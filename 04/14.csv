recent work has proposed generating Counterfactual Latent Uncertainty
Explanations (CLUEs). However, for a single input, such approaches could output
a variety of explanations due to the lack of constraints placed on the
explanation. Here we augment the original CLUE approach, to provide what we
call $\delta$-CLUE. CLUE indicates $\it{one}$ way to change an input, while
remaining on the data manifold, such that the model becomes more confident
about its prediction. We instead return a $\it{set}$ of plausible CLUEs:
multiple, diverse inputs that are within a $\delta$ ball of the original input
in latent space, all yielding confident predictions.

phenomenon of nonlinear changes in language was first observed by Raimund
Piotrowski (hence labelled as Piotrowski's law), even if actual linguistic
evidence usually speaks against using the notion of a ""law"" in this context. In
our study, we apply logistic regression models to 9 changes which occurred
between 15th and 18th century in the Polish language. The attested course of
the majority of these changes closely follow the expected values, which proves
that the language change might indeed resemble a nonlinear phase change
scenario. We also extend the original Piotrowski's approach by proposing
polynomial logistic regression for these cases which can hardly be described by
its standard version. Also, we propose to consider individual language change
cases jointly, in order to inspect their possible collinearity or, more likely,
their different dynamics in the function of time. Last but not least, we
evaluate our results by testing the influence of the subcorpus size on the
model's goodness-of-fit.

Vehicle mobility and safety, and the successful implementation of important
agricultural tasks including seeding, ploughing, fertilising and controlled
traffic depend or can be improved by a correct identification of the terrain
that is traversed. The novelty of this research lies in that terrain estimation
is performed by using not only traditional appearance-based features, that is
colour and geometric properties, but also contact-based features, that is
measuring physics-based dynamic effects that govern the vehicleeterrain
interaction and that greatly affect its mobility. Experimental results obtained
from an all-terrain vehicle operating on different surfaces are presented to
validate the system in the field. It was shown that a terrain classifier
trained with contact features was able to achieve a correct prediction rate of
85.1%, which is comparable or better than that obtained with approaches using
traditional feature sets. To further improve the classification performance,
all feature sets were merged in an augmented feature space, reaching, for these

wide decision trees, as when we plan to visit an exotic country for vacation.
In these cases, exhaustive search for the best sequence of actions is not
tractable due to the large number of possibilities and limited time or
computational resources available to make the decision. Therefore, planning
agents need to balance breadth (exploring many actions at each level of the
tree) and depth (exploring many levels in the tree) to allocate optimally their
finite search capacity. We provide efficient analytical solutions and numerical
analysis to the problem of allocating finite sampling capacity in one shot to
large decision trees. We find that in general the optimal policy is to allocate
few samples per level so that deep levels can be reached, thus favoring depth
over breadth search. In contrast, in poor environments and at low capacity, it
is best to broadly sample branches at the cost of not sampling deeply, although
this policy is marginally better than deep allocations. Our results provide a
theoretical foundation for the optimality of deep imagination for planning and
show that it is a generally valid heuristic that could have evolved from the
finite constraints of cognitive systems.

an added deterministic linear term, also known as mixed p-spin Hamiltonians

strong, then the resulting function has trivial geometry, that is only two
critical points. This contrasts with the situation of no or weak external field
where these functions typically have an exponential number of critical points.
We give an explicit threshold $h_c$ for the magnitude of the external
fieldnecessary for trivialization and conjecture $h_c$ to be sharp. The
Kac-Rice formula is our main tool. Our work extends [Fyo15], which identified
the trivial regime for the special case of pure p-spin Hamiltonians with random

maximizes the surgeon's reachability inside the patient. Scoring functions are
defined for each criterion so that they may be optimized over. Since for
multi-manipulator setups, a large number of free parameters are available to
adjust the base positioning of each arm, a challenge becomes how one can
expediently assess possible setups. We thus also propose methods that perform
fast queries of each measure with the use of a proxy collision-checker. We then
develop an optimization method to determine the optimal position using the

robot arms on canonical trajectories, and show that the solution yielded by the
optimization program can satisfy each criterion. The metrics and optimization
strategy are generalizable to other surgical robotic platforms so that

$\delta$ to the ideal state $\rho$. This predicate $(\hat\rho,\delta)$ can be
computed adaptively using tensor networks based on the Matrix Product States.
Gleipnir features a lightweight logic for reasoning about error bounds in noisy

evolution of quantised modes along a TWPA. We calculate the restriction placed
on pump amplitude as well as amplifier gain as a result of impedance mismatch

modes and demonstrate that they will result in suppressed gain. We show that an
ideal TWPA is indeed quantum-limited - i.e. it introduces a half-quantum of
zero-point fluctuation which is the minimum possible noise contribution for a
phase-preserving linear amplifier. We analyse the thermal noise associated with
a TWPA by considering the effect of distributed sources along an amplifier
transmission line. Our analysis predicts a doubling of thermal noise in the
high gain limit as a result of wave-mixing between signal and idler modes. We
study the operation of a TWPA in the presence of a DC bias current, and have

their own, the most common way to discover extragalactic fast transients,
fading away in a few nights, is via follow-up observations of gamma-ray burst
and gravitational-wave triggers. However, wide-field surveys have the potential
to also identify rapidly fading transients independently of such external
triggers. The volumetric survey speed of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
makes it sensitive to faint and fast-fading objects as kilonovae, the optical
counterparts to binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole mergers, out
to almost 200Mpc. We introduce an open-source software infrastructure, the ZTF
REaltime Search and Triggering, ZTFReST, designed to identify kilonovae and
fast optical transients in ZTF data. Using the ZTF alert stream combined with
forced photometry, we have implemented automated candidate ranking based on
their photometric evolution and fitting to kilonova models. Automated
triggering of follow-up systems, such as Las Cumbres Observatory, has also been
implemented. In 13 months of science validation, we found several extragalactic
fast transients independent of any external trigger (though some counterparts
were identified later), including at least one supernova with post-shock
cooling emission, two known afterglows with an associated gamma-ray burst, two
known afterglows without any known gamma-ray counterpart, and three new
fast-declining sources (ZTF20abtxwfx, ZTF20acozryr, and ZTF21aagwbjr) that are
likely associated with GRB200817A, GRB201103B, and GRB210204A. However, we have
not found any objects which appear to be kilonovae; therefore, we constrain the
rate of GW170817-like kilonovae to $R < 900$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. A framework
such as ZTFReST could become a prime tool for kilonova and fast transient
discovery with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

concerned with solids, not gases. In this study, we demonstrate the application
of the all-electron $\Delta$-SCF method to periodic systems. A consideration of
the experimentally accessible points of reference leads to the definition of a
core electron binding energy in a solid as the difference between the total
energies of two $N-1$ electron systems: one with an explicit, localized core
hole, and one with an electron removed from the highest occupied state. The
calculation of each of these quantities is addressed. In addition, the analogy
between a localized core hole and a charged defect in a solid is highlighted,
and the extrapolation of calculated core electron binding energies to the
infinite supercell limit is discussed. It is found that the extrapolated values
of the core electron binding energies from periodic $\Delta$-SCF calculations
agree well with experimental results for both metallic and insulating systems,
with a mean absolute error of 0.24 eV for the 15 core levels considered in this

Learning (RL) is a viable approach. While current work have applied RL
effectively to portray physics-based skills, social behaviours are challenging
to design reward functions for, due to their lack of physical interaction with
the world. On the other hand, data-driven implementations for these skills have
been limited to supervised learning methods which require extensive training
data and carry constraints on generalisability. In this paper, we propose
RLAnimate, a novel data-driven deep RL approach to address this challenge,
where we combine the strengths of RL together with an ability to learn from a
motion dataset when creating agents. We formalise a mathematical structure for
training agents by refining the conceptual roles of elements such as agents,
environments, states and actions, in a way that leverages attributes of the
character animation domain and model-based RL. An agent trained using our
approach learns versatile animation dynamics to portray multiple behaviours,
using an iterative RL training process, which becomes aware of valid behaviours
via representations learnt from motion capture clips. We demonstrate, by
training agents that portray realistic pointing and waving behaviours, that our
approach requires a significantly lower training time, and substantially fewer
sample episodes to be generated during training relative to state-of-the-art
physics-based RL methods. Also, compared to existing supervised learning-based
animation agents, RLAnimate needs a limited dataset of motion clips to generate
representations of valid behaviours during training.

discontinuities in the vector field at the boundaries of the constraint set. In
particular, the set-valued relation is described by the subdifferential of the
indicator function of a closed convex cone, which results in a
cone-complementarity system. The question of analyzing stability of such
systems is addressed by constructing cone-copositive Lyapunov functions. As a
first analytical result, we show that exponentially stable complementarity
systems always admit a continuously differentiable cone-copositive Lyapunov
function. Putting some more structure on the system vector field, such as
homogeneity, we can show that the aforementioned functions can be approximated
by a rational function of cone-copositive homogeneous polynomials. This later
class of functions is seen to be particularly amenable for numerical
computation as we provide two types of algorithms for precisely that purpose.
These algorithms consist of a hierarchy of either linear or semidefinite

paper, to show the applicability of different protocols in real-world systems,
we detail the implementation of several state-of-the-art multiprocessor
resource synchronization protocols in RTEMS. To study the impact of the
implementation overheads, we deploy these implemented protocols on a real
platform with synthetic task set. The measured results illustrate that the
developed resource synchronization protocols in RTEMS are comparable to the

on the energy spectrum of a given system. In this work we propose a decoherent
mechanism for sensing quantum chaos. The chaotic nature of a many-body quantum
system is sensed by studying the implications that the system produces in the
long-time dynamics of a probe coupled to it under a dephasing interaction. By
introducing the notion of an effective averaged decoherence factor, we show
that the correction to the geometric phase acquired by the probe with respect
to its unitary evolution can be exploited as a robust tool for sensing the
integrable to chaos transition of the many-body quantum system to which it is
coupled. This sensing mechanism is verified for several systems with different
types of symmetries, disorder and even in the presence of long-range
interactions, evidencing its universality.

probabilistic representation of a data set within a low-dimensional space of
latent variables followed by a decoding stage that maps the latent variables
back to the original variable space. Once trained, a statistical ensemble of
simulated data realizations can be obtained by randomly assigning values to the
latent variables that are subsequently processed by the decoding section of the
network. To determine the accuracy of such a procedure when applied to lattice
models, an autoencoder is here trained on a thermal equilibrium distribution of
Ising spin realizations. When the output of the decoder for synthetic data is
interpreted probabilistically, spin realizations can be generated by randomly
assigning spin values according to the computed likelihood. The resulting state
distribution in energy-magnetization space then qualitatively resembles that of
the training samples. However, because correlations between spins are
suppressed, the computed energies are unphysically large for low-dimensional
latent variable spaces. The features of the learned distributions as a function
of temperature, however, provide a qualitative indication of the presence of a
phase transition and the distribution of realizations with characteristic
cluster sizes.

anomalous group velocity dispersion in free space, all the while maintaining
the group velocity fixed at the speed of light in vacuum. Extremely large

speed that diverges when approaching the moment of impact. Although there is
mounting experimental evidence that instabilities form on the liquid interface
during such an event, understanding of the nature of these instabilities is
limited. This study therefore addresses the stability of a liquid-gas interface
with surface tension, subject to a diverging flow in the gas phase, where the
liquid and the gas phase are both represented as potential fluids. We perform a
Kelvin-Helmholtz-type linear modal stability analysis of the surface to obtain
an amplitude equation that is subsequently analysed in detail and applied to
two cases of interest for impact problems, namely, the parallel impact of a
wave onto a vertical wall, and the impact of a horizontal plate onto a liquid
surface. In both cases we find that long wavelengths are stabilised
considerably in comparison to what may be expected based upon classical
knowledge of the stability of interfaces subject to a constant gas flow. In the
former case, this leads to the prediction of a marginally stable wavelength
that is completely absent in the classical analysis. For the latter we find
much resemblance to the classical case, with the connotation that the
instability is suppressed for smaller disk sizes. The study ends with a
discussion of the influence of gas viscosity and gas compressibility on the
respective stability diagrams.

large-scale neural recordings or imaging; often people employ graphical model
selection and estimation techniques for this purpose. But, existing
technologies can only record from a small subset of neurons leading to a
challenging problem of graph selection in the presence of extensive latent
variables. Chandrasekaran et al. (2012) proposed a convex program to address
this problem that poses challenges from both a computational and statistical
perspective. To solve this problem, we propose an incredibly simple solution:
apply a hard thresholding operator to existing graph selection methods.
Conceptually simple and computationally attractive, we demonstrate that
thresholding the graphical Lasso, neighborhood selection, or CLIME estimators
have superior theoretical properties in terms of graph selection consistency as
well as stronger empirical results than existing approaches for the latent
variable graphical model problem. We also demonstrate the applicability of our
approach through a neuroscience case study on calcium-imaging data to estimate
functional neural connections.

procedural modeling, i.e. generating geometry using programs. Such programs
consist of a series of instructions along with their associated parameter
values. To fully realize the benefits of this representation, a shape program
should be compact and only expose degrees of freedom that allow for meaningful
manipulation of output geometry. One way to achieve this goal is to design
higher-level macro operators that, when executed, expand into a series of
commands from the base shape modeling language. However, manually authoring
such macros, much like shape programs themselves, is difficult and largely
restricted to domain experts. In this paper, we present ShapeMOD, an algorithm
for automatically discovering macros that are useful across large datasets of
3D shape programs. ShapeMOD operates on shape programs expressed in an
imperative, statement-based language. It is designed to discover macros that
make programs more compact by minimizing the number of function calls and free
parameters required to represent an input shape collection. We run ShapeMOD on
multiple collections of programs expressed in a domain-specific language for 3D
shape structures. We show that it automatically discovers a concise set of
macros that abstract out common structural and parametric patterns that
generalize over large shape collections. We also demonstrate that the macros
found by ShapeMOD improve performance on downstream tasks including shape
generative modeling and inferring programs from point clouds. Finally, we
conduct a user study that indicates that ShapeMOD's discovered macros make
interactive shape editing more efficient.

pipeline components, where each component heavily relies on the results of its
upstream ones. For example, Intent detection (ID), and slot filling (SF)
require its upstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transform the voice
into text. In this case, the upstream perturbations, e.g. ASR errors,
environmental noise and careless user speaking, will propagate to the ID and SF
models, thus deteriorating the system performance. Therefore, the
well-performing SF and ID models are expected to be noise resistant to some
extent. However, existing models are trained on clean data, which causes a
\textit{gap between clean data training and real-world inference.} To bridge
the gap, we propose a method from the perspective of domain adaptation, by
which both high- and low-quality samples are embedding into similar vector
space. Meanwhile, we design a denoising generation model to reduce the impact
of the low-quality samples. Experiments on the widely-used dataset, i.e. Snips,

that this method not only outperforms the baseline models on real-world (noisy)

combining the kinematics of the stars with those of the globular clusters (GCs)
and planetary nebulae (PNe), we probe the outer regions of our galaxies out to
$\sim$4-6 Re. Six galaxies have PNe and red GCs that show good kinematic
alignment with the stars, whose rotation occurs along the photometric
major-axis of the galaxies, suggesting that both the PNe and red GCs are good
tracers of the underlying stellar population beyond that traced by the stars.
Additionally, the blue GCs also show rotation that is overall consistent with
that of the red GCs in these six galaxies. The remaining three galaxies show
kinematic twists and misalignment of the PNe and GCs with respect to the
underlying stars, suggesting recent galaxy interactions. From the comparison
with simulations, we propose that all six aligned galaxies that show similar
dispersion-dominated kinematics at large radii (>2-3 Re) had similar late
($z<1$) assembly histories characterised by mini mergers (mass-ratio <1:10).
The different Vrot/$\sigma$ profiles are then the result of an early ($z>1$)
minor merger (1:10< mass-ratio <1:4) for the four galaxies with peaked and
decreasing Vrot/$\sigma$ profiles and of a late minor merger for the two
galaxies with flat Vrot/$\sigma$ profiles. The three mis-aligned galaxies
likely formed through multiple late minor mergers that enhanced their velocity
dispersion at all radii, or a late major merger that spun-up both the GC
sub-populations at large radii. Therefore, lenticular galaxies can have complex
merger histories that shape their characteristic kinematic profile shapes.

as a fiducial model the results obtained with current CMB and LSS data,
assuming the $\alpha$-model a priori. We found that current CMB data are able
to place a tight bound on the ratio of the tensor-to-scalar ratio with the
alpha parameter $r/\alpha = 3.87^{+0.78}_{-0.94}\cdot 10^{-3}$ and on the
running of the scalar index $\alpha_S = -6.4^{+1.6}_{-1.3}\cdot 10^{-4}$ with a
value of the scalar index consistent with current constraints. In the
optimistic scenario of detection of primordial gravitational waves in the CMB
B-mode polarization power spectra, we found that CMB-S4 will be able to achieve
a $15\%$ bound on the value of the parameter $\alpha = 1.01^{+0.14}_{-0.18}$.
This bound clearly show the ability of CMB-S4 to constrain not only the energy
scale of inflation but also the shape of its potential. Enlarging the baseline

and are found in the centres of all types of galaxies. They are thought to form
via mergers of star clusters such as ancient globular clusters (GCs) that
spiral to the centre as a result of dynamical friction or through in-situ star
formation directly at the galaxy centre. There is evidence that both paths
occur, but the relative contribution of either channel and their correlation
with galaxy properties are not yet constrained observationally. We aim to
derive the dominant NSC formation channel for a sample of 25 nucleated
galaxies, mostly in the Fornax galaxy cluster, with stellar masses between
$M_\rm{gal} \sim 10^8$ and $10^{10.5} M_\odot$ and NSC masses between
$M_\rm{NSC} \sim 10^5$ and $10^{8.5} M_\odot$. Using Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE) data from the Fornax 3D survey and the ESO archive, we derive
star formation histories, mean ages and metallicities of NSCs, and compare them
to the host galaxies. In many low-mass galaxies, the NSCs are significantly
more metal-poor than the hosts with properties similar to GCs. In contrast, in
the massive galaxies, we find diverse star formation histories and cases of
ongoing or recent in-situ star formation. Massive NSCs ($> 10^7 M_\odot$)
occupy a different region in the mass-metallicity diagram than lower mass NSCs
and GCs, indicating a different enrichment history. We find a clear transition
of the dominant NSC formation channel with both galaxy and NSC mass. We
hypothesise that while GC-accretion forms the NSCs of the dwarf galaxies,
central star formation is responsible for the efficient mass build up in the
most massive NSCs in our sample. At intermediate masses, both channels can
contribute. The transition between these formation channels seems to occur at
galaxy masses $M_\rm{gal} \sim 10^9 M_\odot$ and NSC masses $M_\rm{NSC} \sim
10^7 M_\odot$.

the spectrum softened with increases in the X-ray luminosity, while we observed
the reverse for the September 2020 peak.

soft radiation in limited angular regions of phase space. Their resummation to
next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) order has been a long standing problem and
its solution is relevant in the context of precision all-order calculations in
a wide variety of collider processes and observables. In this article, we
consider observables sensitive only to soft radiation, characterised by the
absence of Sudakov double logarithms, and we derive a set of
integro-differential equations that describes the resummation of NLL soft
corrections in the planar, large-$N_c$ limit. The resulting set of evolution
equations is derived in dimensional regularisation and we additionally provide
a formulation that is manifestly finite in four space-time dimensions. The
latter is suitable for a numerical integration and can be generalised to treat
other infrared-safe observables sensitive solely to soft wide-angle radiation.
We use the developed formalism to carry out a fixed-order calculation to ${\cal
O}(\alpha_s^2)$ in full colour for both the transverse energy and energy
distribution in the interjet region between two cone jets in $e^+e^-$
collisions. We find that the expansion of the resummed cross section correctly
reproduces the logarithmic structure of the full QCD result.

of photometric light curves for evidence of close binaries with a dormant black
hole, and, in some cases, a dormant neutron star. The detection of such a
binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large ellipsoidal
periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its companion. Based on
the observed ellipsoidal amplitude and the primary mass and radius, one can
derive a minimum mass ratio of the binary. A binary with a minimum mass ratio
significantly larger than unity might be a candidate for having a dormant
compact-object companion. Unfortunately, the photometric search is hampered by
the fact that in many cases the primary mass and radius are not well known. In
this paper we present a simple approach that circumvents this problem by
suggesting a robust modified minimum mass ratio, assuming the primary fills its
Roche lobe. The newly defined modified minimum mass ratio is always smaller
than the minimum mass ratio, which is, in its turn, smaller than the actual
mass ratio. Therefore, binaries with a modified minimum mass ratio larger than
unity are candidates for having a compact-object secondary.

We numerically establish a novel photon pumping phenomenon in the

coupling not only significantly enhances the LHC reach via the $gg\to h^*\to

exotic decays and coupling deviations of the Higgs boson, offering new
opportunities to probe the model. In addition, we also study the Drell-Yan

existing [CII] intensity mapping surveys. While the signal we predict is out of
reach for current-generation projects, planned future improvements should be
able to detect reionization-era HD without any additional observations, and
would help to constrain the properties of the star-forming galaxies thought to

complex Gaussian matrices, and more broadly, submatrices of random unitary
matrices. Using a hybrid representation-theoretic and combinatorial approach,
we prove strong lower bounds for all moments of the permanent distribution. We
provide substantial evidence that our bounds are close to being tight and
constitute accurate estimates for the moments. Let $U(d)^{k\times k}$ be the
distribution of $k\times k$ submatrices of $d\times d$ random unitary matrices,
and $G^{k\times k}$ be the distribution of $k\times k$ complex Gaussian
matrices. (1) Using the Schur-Weyl duality (or the Howe duality), we prove an
expansion formula for the $2t$-th moment of $|Perm(M)|$ when $M$ is drawn from
$U(d)^{k\times k}$ or $G^{k\times k}$. (2) We prove a surprising size-moment
duality: the $2t$-th moment of the permanent of random $k\times k$ matrices is
equal to the $2k$-th moment of the permanent of $t\times t$ matrices. (3) We
design an algorithm to exactly compute high moments of the permanent of small
matrices. (4) We prove lower bounds for arbitrary moments of permanents of
matrices drawn from $G^{ k\times k}$ or $U(k)$, and conjecture that our lower
bounds are close to saturation up to a small multiplicative error. (5) Assuming
our conjectures, we use the large deviation theory to compute the tail of the

  $\rm H_2D^+$ observations with ALMA","Accepted for publications in A&A","A&A 650, A202 (2021)","10.1051/0004-6361/202140694",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context. The different theoretical models concerning the formation of
high-mass stars make distinct predictions regarding their progenitors, i.e. the
high-mass prestellar cores. However, so far no conclusive observation of such
objects has been made.
  Aims. We aim to study the very early stages of high-mass star formation in
two infrared-dark, massive clumps, to identify the core population that they
harbour.
  Methods. We obtained ALMA observations of continuum emission at 0.8mm and of
the ortho-$\rm H_2D^+$ transition at 372GHz towards the two clumps. We use the
SCIMES algorithm to identify cores in the position-position-velocity space,
finding 16 cores. We model their observed spectra in the LTE approximation,
deriving the centroid velocity, linewidth, and column density maps. We also
study the correlation between the continuum and molecular data, which in
general do not present the same structure.
  Results. We report for the first time the detection of ortho-$\rm H_2D^+$ in
high-mass star-forming regions performed with an interferometer. The molecular
emission shows narrow and subsonic lines, suggesting that locally the
temperature of the gas is less than 10K. From the continuum emission we
estimate the cores' total masses, and compare them with the respective virial
masses. We also compute the volume density values, which are found to be higher
than $10^{6}\, \rm cm^{-3}$.
  Conclusions. Our data confirm that ortho-$\rm H_2D^+$ is an ideal tracer of
cold and dense gas. Interestingly, almost all the $\rm H_2D^+$-identified cores
are less massive than 13M_sun , with the exception of one core in AG354.
Furthermore, most of them are subvirial and larger than their Jeans masses.
These results are difficult to explain in the context of the turbulent
accretion models, which predict massive and virialised prestellar cores.

turns out that exponential Orlicz hearts are suitable spaces to handle the

the solution of the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a strongly continuous

depends continuously on the initial data. We further determine the symmetric
Lipschitz set which is invariant under the semigroup. This automatically yields
a priori estimates and regularity in Sobolev spaces. In particular, on the
domain restricted to the symmetric Lipschitz set, the generator can be
explicitly determined and linked with the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

approximate exponential decay of correlations, meaning that the exponential

Lipschitz regular and to depend on the base in a way that guarantees diffusive
behaviour on the vertical component. The assumptions do not imply an hyperbolic
picture and one cannot rely on the spectral properties of the transfer
operators involved. The approximate nature of the result is the inevitable
price one pays for having so mild assumptions on the dynamics on the vertical

granulation and the evolution of multispecies granular biofilms within a
continuous reactor. The granule is modelled as a spherical free boundary domain
with radial symmetry. The equation which governs the free boundary is derived
from global mass balance considerations and takes into account the growth of
sessile biomass and the exchange fluxes with the bulk liquid. Starting from a
vanishing initial value, the expansion of the free boundary is initiated by the
attachment process, which depends on the microbial species concentrations
within the bulk liquid and their specific attachment velocity. Nonlinear
hyperbolic PDEs model the growth of the sessile microbial species, while
quasi-linear parabolic PDEs govern the dynamics of substrates and invading
species within the granular biofilm. Nonlinear ODEs govern the evolution of
soluble substrates and planktonic biomass within the bulk liquid. The model is
applied to an anaerobic granular-based system and solved numerically to test
its qualitative behaviour and explore the main aspects of de novo anaerobic
granulation: ecology, biomass distribution, relative abundance, dimensional
evolution of the granules and soluble substrates and planktonic biomass
dynamics within the reactor. The numerical results confirm that the model
accurately describes the ecology and the concentrically-layered structure of
anaerobic granules observed experimentally, and is able to predict the effects
of some significant factors, such as influent wastewater composition,
granulation properties of planktonic biomass, biomass density and hydrodynamic
and shear stress conditions, on the process performance.

consensus that matter flowing through the disk is channelled onto the stellar
surface by the stellar magnetic field. This is thought to be strong enough to
truncate the disk close to the so-called corotation radius where the disk
rotates at the same rate as the star. Spectro-interferometric studies in young
stellar objects show that Hydrogen is mostly emitted in a region of a few
milliarcseconds across, usually located within the dust sublimation radius. Its
origin is still a matter of debate and it can be interpreted as coming from the
stellar magnetosphere, a rotating wind or a disk. In the case of
intermediate-mass Herbig AeBe stars, the fact that the Br gamma emission is
spatially resolved rules out that most of the emission comes from the
magnetosphere. This is due to the weak magnetic fields (some tenths of G)
detected in these sources, resulting in very compact magnetospheres. In the
case of T Tauri sources, their larger magnetospheres should make them easier to
resolve. However, the small angular size of the magnetosphere (a few tenths of
milliarcseconds), along with the presence of winds emitting in Hydrogen make
the observations interpretation challenging. Here, we present direct evidence
of magnetospheric accretion by spatially resolving the inner disk of the 60 pc
T Tauri star TW Hydrae through optical long baseline interferometry. We find
that the hydrogen near-infrared emission comes from a region approximately 3.5
stellar radii (R*) across. This region is within the continuum dusty disk
emitting region (Rcont = 7 R*) and smaller than the corotation radius which is
twice as big. This indicates that the hydrogen emission originates at the
accretion columns, as expected in magnetospheric accretion models, rather than
in a wind emitted at much larger distance (>1au).

using Reference Differential Imaging, comparing and contrasting three reduction
techniques - classical subtraction, Karhunen-Loeve Image Projection and
Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation, selecting the classical method as the most
reliable of the three for our observations. Of the three disks, two are
tentatively detected (2MASS J16142029-1906481 and 2MASS J16123916-1859284),
with the third going undetected. Our two detections are shown to be consistent
when varying the reference star or reduction method used, and both detections
exhibit structure out to projected distances of > 200 au. Structures at these
distances from the host star have never been previously detected at any
wavelength for either disk, illustrating the utility of visible-wavelength
observations in probing the distribution of small dust grains at large angular
separations.

However, such a treatment usually violates the energy conservation law, and is
inconsistent with existing MHD numerical simulation results. A mechanical model
of non-magnetized blastwaves was proposed in previous work to solve the
problem. In this paper, we generalize the mechanical model to the case of a
blastwave driven by an ejecta with an arbitrary magnetization parameter
$\sigma_{\rm ej}$. We test our modified mechanical model by considering a
long-lasting magnetized ejecta and found that it is much better than the
pressure-balance treatment in terms of energy conservation. For a constant
central engine wind luminosity $L_{\rm ej} = 10^{47}{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and
$\sigma_{\rm ej} < 10$, the deviation from energy conservation is negligibly
small at small radii, but only reaches less than $25\%$ even at $10^{19}{\rm

reverse shock crosses the magnetized ejecta earlier for the ejecta with a
higher $\sigma_{\rm ej}$, which is consistent with previous analytical and

few nanomaterial systems, all requiring temperatures below 10K. Here, we
rationally design a single colloidal nanomaterial that hosts multiple (nearly)

different, it is difficult to leverage source language text successfully. In
this work, we focus on sequence-level knowledge distillation (SeqKD) from
external text-based NMT models. To leverage the full potential of the source

paraphrased transcriptions as an auxiliary task with a single decoder. The
paraphrases are generated from the translations in bitext via back-translation.
We further propose bidirectional SeqKD in which SeqKD from both forward and
backward NMT models is combined. Experimental evaluations on both
autoregressive and non-autoregressive models show that SeqKD in each direction
consistently improves the translation performance, and the effectiveness is
complementary regardless of the model capacity.

There exist several similarity measures for comparing SPD matrices with

to cast these parameters in a continuum and learn them from data. We
systematically extend this idea to learn vector-valued parameters, thereby
increasing the expressiveness of the underlying non-linear measure. We conjoin

advantage conferred by harnessing starlight for photosynthesis, and the
apparent low likelihood of maintaining oxygen-rich atmospheres without life.
Hypothetical scenarios have been proposed for non-biological oxygen
accumulation on planets around late M-dwarfs, where the extended pre-main
sequence may favor abiotic O$_2$ accumulation. In contrast, abiotic oxygen
accumulation on planets around F, G, and K-type stars is seemingly less likely,
provided they possess substantial non-condensable gas inventories. The
comparative robustness of oxygen biosignatures around larger stars has
motivated plans for next-generation telescopes capable of oxygen detection on
planets around sun-like stars. However, the general tendency of terrestrial
planets to develop oxygen-rich atmospheres across a broad range of initial
conditions and evolutionary scenarios has not been explored. Here, we use a
coupled thermal-geochemical-climate model of terrestrial planet evolution to
illustrate three scenarios whereby significant abiotic oxygen can accumulate
around sun-like stars, even when significant non-condensable gas inventories
are present. For Earth-mass planets, we find abiotic oxygen can accumulate to
modern levels if (1) the CO$_2$:H$_2$O ratio of the initial volatile inventory
is high, (2) the initial water inventory exceeds ~50 Earth oceans, or (3) the
initial water inventory is very low. Fortunately, these three abiotic oxygen
scenarios could be distinguished from biological oxygen with observations of
other atmospheric constituents or characterizing the planetary surface. This
highlights the need for broadly capable next-generation telescopes that are
equipped to constrain surface water inventories via time-resolved photometry
and search for temporal biosignatures or disequilibrium biosignatures to assess
whether oxygen is biogenic.

key figure of merit in the application of these systems to extremely precise

quantum fluctuations and the conservative nonlinearity of a Josephson junction.
The phenomenon can be understood and visualized through the flow of
quasi-probability in phase space, and accurately describes our experimental
observations. Crucially, the effect is not restricted to superconducting

study the conditions in which evolution selects for direct reciprocity,
signalling, or their combination. We show that signalling alone leads to higher
levels of cooperation than when combined with reciprocity, while offering
additional robustness against errors. Specifically, successful strategies in
the realm of direct reciprocity are often not selected in the presence of
signalling, and memory of past interactions is only exploited opportunistically
in case of earlier coordination failure. Differently, signalling always

  Registration",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last decade, convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have dominated
and achieved state-of-the-art performances in a variety of medical imaging
applications. However, the performances of ConvNets are still limited by
lacking the understanding of long-range spatial relations in an image. The
recently proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification uses a
purely self-attention-based model that learns long-range spatial relations to
focus on the relevant parts of an image. Nevertheless, ViT emphasizes the
low-resolution features because of the consecutive downsamplings, result in a
lack of detailed localization information, making it unsuitable for image
registration. Recently, several ViT-based image segmentation methods have been
combined with ConvNets to improve the recovery of detailed localization
information. Inspired by them, we present ViT-V-Net, which bridges ViT and
ConvNet to provide volumetric medical image registration. The experimental
results presented here demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves
superior performance to several top-performing registration methods.

carrier frequencies. A number of prior works have characterized the loss in
signal strength with the hand using studies with horn antennas and form-factor
user equipments (UEs). However, the impact of the hand on the effective phase
response seen by the antenna elements has not been studied so far. Towards this
goal, we consider a measurement framework that uses a hand phantom holding the
UE in relaxed positions reflective of talk mode, watching videos, and playing
games. We first study the impact of blockage on a directional beam steering
codebook. The tight phase relationship across antenna elements needed to steer
beams leads to a significant performance degradation as the hand surface can
distort the observed amplitudes and phases across the antenna elements, which
cannot be matched by this codebook. To overcome this loss, we propose a
non-directional beamforming codebook made of amplitudes and/or quantized phases
with both these quantities estimated as necessary. Theoretical as well as
numerical studies show that the proposed codebook can de-randomize the phase
distortions induced by the hand and coherently combine the energy across

power failure during a cascade may lead to outages in communication networks,

observable breaker statuses are integrated as constraints in our topology
identification algorithm. The impact of error propagation on the estimation

which increases frictional strength. This effect is analysed in a steadily
propagating rupture model that includes frictional weakening, slip-dependent
fault dilation and fluid flow. Dilatancy is shown to increase the stress
intensity factor required to propagate the rupture tip. With increasing rupture
speed, an undrained (strengthened) region develops near the tip and extends
beyond the frictionally weakened zone. Away from the undrained region, pore
fluid diffusion gradually recharges the fault and strength returns to the
drained, weakened value. For sufficiently large rupture dimensions, the
dilation-induced strength increase near the tip is equivalent to an increase in
toughness that is proportional to the square root of the rupture speed. In
general, dilation has the effect of increasing the stress required for rupture
growth by decreasing the stress drop along the crack. Thermal pressurisation
has the potential to compensate for the dilatant strengthening effect, at the
expense of an increased heating rate, which might lead to premature frictional
melting. Using reasonable laboratory parameters, the dilatancy-toughening
effect leads to rupture dynamics that is quantitatively consistent with the
dynamics of observed slow slip events in subduction zones.

of single-target domain adaptation (STDA) for object detection has recently
received much attention, multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) remains largely
unexplored, despite its practical relevance in several real-world applications,
such as multi-camera video surveillance. Compared to the STDA problem that may
involve large domain shifts between complex source and target distributions,
MTDA faces additional challenges, most notably the computational requirements
and catastrophic forgetting of previously-learned targets, which can depend on
the order of target adaptations. STDA for detection can be applied to MTDA by
adapting one model per target, or one common model with a mixture of data from
target domains. However, these approaches are either costly or inaccurate. The
only state-of-art MTDA method specialized for detection learns targets
incrementally, one target at a time, and mitigates the loss of knowledge by
using a duplicated detection model for knowledge distillation, which is
computationally expensive and does not scale well to many domains. In this
paper, we introduce an efficient approach for incremental learning that
generalizes well to multiple target domains. Our MTDA approach is more suitable
for real-world applications since it allows updating the detection model
incrementally, without storing data from previous-learned target domains, nor
retraining when a new target domain becomes available. Our proposed method,
MTDA-DTM, achieved the highest level of detection accuracy compared against
state-of-the-art approaches on several MTDA detection benchmarks and Wildtrack,

the evolution of the spin axis of an oblate planet. The disk is evolved using
time-dependent equations for linear wave-like warp evolution, including terms
representing the effect of the tidal potential and planetary oblateness. For a
disk with a sufficiently large mass, we find that the planet spin quickly
aligns to the misaligned disk. The tilt of the planetary spin axis then
increases on the same timescale as the disk. This can be an efficient mechanism
for generating primordial obliquity in giant planets. We suggest that directly
imaged exoplanets at large orbital radii, where the disk mass criterion is more
likely to be satisfied, could have significant obliquities due to the tilt

regression analysis, the underlying regression functions are piecewise
continuous in that data follow different continuous regression models for
different regions of the data with possible discontinuities between the
regions. However, many conventional GP regression approaches are not designed
for piecewise regression analysis. We propose a new GP modeling approach for
estimating an unknown piecewise continuous regression function. The new GP
model seeks for a local GP estimate of an unknown regression function at each
test location, using local data neighboring to the test location. To
accommodate the possibilities of the local data from different regions, the
local data is partitioned into two sides by a local linear boundary, and only
the local data belonging to the same side as the test location is used for the
regression estimate. This local split works very well when the input regions
are bounded by smooth boundaries, so the local linear approximation of the
smooth boundaries works well. We estimate the local linear boundary jointly
with the other hyperparameters of the GP model, using the maximum likelihood
approach. Its computation time is as low as the local GP's time. The superior
numerical performance of the proposed approach over the conventional GP
modeling approaches is shown using various simulated piecewise regression
functions.

relatively simple matter to generate solitonic configurations, within a certain

of high-quality semantically segmented images requiring minimal human effort.
Current deep networks are extremely data-hungry, benefiting from training on
large-scale datasets, which are time consuming to annotate. Our method relies
on the power of recent GANs to generate realistic images. We show how the GAN
latent code can be decoded to produce a semantic segmentation of the image.
Training the decoder only needs a few labeled examples to generalize to the
rest of the latent space, resulting in an infinite annotated dataset generator!
These generated datasets can then be used for training any computer vision
architecture just as real datasets are. As only a few images need to be
manually segmented, it becomes possible to annotate images in extreme detail
and generate datasets with rich object and part segmentations. To showcase the
power of our approach, we generated datasets for 7 image segmentation tasks
which include pixel-level labels for 34 human face parts, and 32 car parts. Our
approach outperforms all semi-supervised baselines significantly and is on par
with fully supervised methods, which in some cases require as much as 100x more
annotated data as our method.

We demonstrate that, when the ${\rm Spin}^c$ structure is canonically

path integral reproduces known results for the path integral of the
$\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory with Vafa-Witten twist. On the other hand, we
reproduce results from Donaldson-Witten theory after taking a suitable infinite
mass limit. The topological correlators are functions of the UV coupling
constant $\tau_{\rm uv}$ and we confirm that they obey the expected $S$-duality
transformation laws. The holomorphic part of the partition function is a
generating function for the Euler numbers of the matter (or obstruction) bundle

centers are growing, providing efficient remote healthcare services seems very
important. Currently, most such systems benefit from the distribution and
autonomy features of multiagent systems and the structure of wireless sensor
networks. On the one hand, securing the data of remote healthcare systems is
one of the most significant concerns; particularly recent types of research
about the security of remote healthcare systems keep them secure from
eavesdropping and data modification. On the other hand, existing remote
healthcare systems are still vulnerable against other common attacks of
healthcare networks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and User to Root (U2R)
attacks, because they are managed remotely and based on the Internet.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure framework for remote healthcare
systems that consists of two phases. First, we design a healthcare system base
on multiagent technology to collect data from a sensor network. Then, in the
second phase, a layered architecture of intrusion detection systems that uses
Support Vector Machine to learn the behavior of network traffic is applied.
Based on our framework, we implement a secure remote healthcare system and
evaluate this system against the frequent attacks of healthcare networks such
as Smurf, Buffer overflow, Neptune, and Pod attacks. In the end, evaluation
parameters of the layered architecture of intrusion detection systems prove the
efficiency and correctness of our proposed framework.

rigorously justifying TKV's formal expansion of the Fermi velocity over a
sufficiently large interval of $\alpha$ values. The idea of the proof is to
project the TKV Hamiltonian onto a finite dimensional subspace, and then expand
the Fermi velocity in terms of explicitly computable linear combinations of
modes in the subspace, while controlling the error. The proof relies on two
propositions whose proofs are computer-assisted, i.e., numerical computation
together with worst-case estimates on the accumulation of round-off error which
show that round-off error cannot possibly change the conclusion of the
computation. The propositions give a bound below on the spectral gap of the
projected Hamiltonian, an Hermitian $80 \times 80$ matrix whose spectrum is
symmetric about $0,$ and verify that two real 18th order polynomials, which
approximate the numerator of the Fermi velocity, take values with definite sign

contrast to the \emph{whole} boundary of the $D_h$-metric ball, which is

the thermodynamic properties over a wide range of conditions. For $3D$ systems,
we are able to show that the critical parameters exhibit a linear dependence on
$X$ and that the loci for the thermodynamic state points, for which the system
shows the same compressibility factor or enthalpy as an ideal gas, are two
straight lines spanning the subcritical and supercritical regions of the phase

loss of impact of the Friedel oscillation on the critical properties, as
evidenced by the virtually constant critical density across the range of $X$

approaches to achieve assurance, particularly for game-changing innovations.
The ability for users to easily update algorithms and software, which alters
the performance of a system, implies that traditional machine assurance
performed prior to deployment or sale, will no longer be viable. Moreover, the
high frequency of updates implies that traditional certification that requires
substantial time will no longer be practical. To alleviate these difficulties,
automation of assurance will likely be needed; something like
'ASsurance-as-a-Service' (ASaaS), where APIs constantly ping RAS-AI to ensure
abidance with various rules, frameworks and behavioural expectations. There are
exceptions to this, such as in contested or communications denied environments,
or in underground or undersea mining; and these systems need their own risk
assessments and limitations imposed. Indeed, self-monitors are already
operating within some systems. To ensure safe operations of future robotics
systems, Australia needs to invest in RAS-AI assurance research, stakeholder
engagement and continued development and refinement of robust frameworks,
methods, guidelines and policy in order to educate and prepare its technology

(ReID) suffers from the effects of occlusions and detection errors. Despite
recent advances, occlusions continue to corrupt the features extracted by
state-of-art CNN backbones, and thereby deteriorate the accuracy of ReID
systems. To address this issue, methods in the literature use an additional
costly process such as pose estimation, where pose maps provide supervision to
exclude occluded regions. In contrast, we introduce a novel Holistic Guidance
(HG) method that relies only on person identity labels, and on the distribution
of pairwise matching distances of datasets to alleviate the problem of
occlusion, without requiring additional supervision. Hence, our proposed
student-teacher framework is trained to address the occlusion problem by
matching the distributions of between- and within-class distances (DCDs) of
occluded samples with that of holistic (non-occluded) samples, thereby using
the latter as a soft labeled reference to learn well separated DCDs. This
approach is supported by our empirical study where the distribution of between-
and within-class distances between images have more overlap in occluded than
holistic datasets. In particular, features extracted from both datasets are
jointly learned using the student model to produce an attention map that allows
separating visible regions from occluded ones. In addition to this, a joint
generative-discriminative backbone is trained with a denoising autoencoder,
allowing the system to self-recover from occlusions. Extensive experiments on
several challenging public datasets indicate that the proposed approach can
outperform state-of-the-art methods on both occluded and holistic datasets

uniform, anti-ferromagnetic (AF) intra-clusters interactions $J_{0}/J$. The
clusters are represented by nodes on a finite connectivity random graph, and
the inter-cluster interactions are random Gaussian distributed. The graph
realizations are treated in replica theory using the formalism of order
parameter functions, which allows to calculate the distribution of local fields
and, as a consequence, the relevant observable. In the case of triangular
cluster geometry, there is the onset of a classical Spin Liquid state at a
temperature $T^{*}/J$ and then, a Cluster Spin Glass (CSG) phase at a
temperature $T_{f}/J$. The CSG ground state is robust even for very weak
disorder or large negative $J_{0}/J$. These results does not depend on the
network connectivity. Nevertheless, variations in the connectivity strongly
affect the level of frustration $f_{p}=-\Theta_{CW}/T_{f}$ for large $J_{0}/J$.
In contrast, for the non-frustrated tetrahedral cluster geometry, the CSG
ground state is suppressed for weak disorder or large negative $J_{0}/J$. The
CSG boundary phase presents a re-entrance which is dependent on the network

variations on short (sub-eight-hour) timescales is believed to be convective
granulation. In this work, we improve existing models of this granular flicker
amplitude, or $F_8$, by including the effect of the Kepler bandpass on measured
flicker, by incorporating metallicity in determining convective Mach numbers,
and by using scaling relations from a wider set of numerical simulations. To
motivate and validate these changes, we use a recent database of convective
flicker measurements in Kepler stars, which allows us to more fully detail the
remaining model--prediction error. Our model improvements reduce the typical
misprediction of flicker amplitude from a factor of 2.5 to 2. We rule out
rotation period and strong magnetic activity as possible explanations for the
remaining model error, and we show that binary companions may affect convective
flicker. We also introduce an ""envelope"" model which predicts a range of
flicker amplitudes for any one star to account for some of the spread in
numerical simulations, and we find that this range covers 78% of observed
stars. We note that the solar granular flicker amplitude is lower than most

for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In particular, the introduction of the
BERT language model brought with it breakthroughs in tasks such as question
answering and natural language inference, advancing applications that allow
humans to interact naturally with embedded devices. FPGA-based overlay
processors have been shown as effective solutions for edge image and video
processing applications, which mostly rely on low precision linear matrix
operations. In contrast, transformer-based NLP techniques employ a variety of
higher precision nonlinear operations with significantly higher frequency. We
present NPE, an FPGA-based overlay processor that can efficiently execute a
variety of NLP models. NPE offers software-like programmability to the end user
and, unlike FPGA designs that implement specialized accelerators for each
nonlinear function, can be upgraded for future NLP models without requiring
reconfiguration. We demonstrate that NPE can meet real-time conversational AI
latency targets for the BERT language model with $4\times$ lower power than
CPUs and $6\times$ lower power than GPUs. We also show NPE uses $3\times$ fewer
FPGA resources relative to comparable BERT network-specific accelerators in the
literature. NPE provides a cost-effective and power-efficient FPGA-based
solution for Natural Language Processing at the edge.

small form-factor strategies for rapid stroke detection; however, widespread
clinical adoption remains unrealized. Here, we investigated the use of
microwave scattering perturbations from ultra-wide-band antenna arrays to learn
dielectric signatures of disease. Two deep neural networks (DNNs) were used
for: 1) stroke detection (""classification network""), and 2) characterization of
the hemorrhage location and size (""discrimination network""). Dielectric

caustic-crossing features, considering the possibility that such signals may be
missed due to their weak and featureless nature. For this purpose, we reexamine
the lensing events found by the KMTNet survey before the 2019 season. From this
investigation, we find two new planetary lensing events, KMT-2018-BLG-1976 and
KMT-2018-BLG-1996. We also present the analysis of the planetary event
OGLE-2019-BLG-0954, for which the planetary signal was known, but no detailed
analysis has been presented before. We identify the genuineness of the
planetary signals by checking various interpretations that can generate
short-term anomalies in lensing light curves. From Bayesian analyses conducted
with the constraint from available observables, we find that the host and
planet masses are $(M_1, M_2)\sim (0.65~M_\odot, 2~M_{\rm J})$ for
KMT-2018-BLG-1976L, $\sim (0.69~M_\odot, 1~M_{\rm J})$ for KMT-2018-BLG-1996L,
and $\sim (0.80~M_\odot, 14~M_{\rm J})$ for OGLE-2019-BLG-0954L. The estimated
distance to OGLE-2019-BLG-0954L, $3.63^{+1.22}_{-1.64}$~kpc, indicates that it
is located in the disk, and the brightness expected from the mass and distance
matches well the brightness of the blend, indicating that the lens accounts for
most of the blended flux. The lens of OGLE-2019-BLG-0954 could be resolved from
the source by conducting high-resolution follow-up observations in and after

applications due to their highly populated plasmon generations. Despite their
remarkable plasmonic performance, their widespread use in plasmonic
applications is commonly hindered due to limitations on the available laser
sources and relatively low operating temperatures needed to retain mechanical
strength in these materials. Motivated by recent experimental works, in which
exotic hexagonal-closed-packed (HCP) phases have been identified in gold (Au),
silver (Ag) and copper (Cu), we present the plasmonic performance of two HCP
polytypes in these materials using high-accuracy first-principles simulations.
The isolated HCP phases commonly reach thermal and mechanical stability at high
temperatures due to monotonically decreasing Gibbs free energy differences
compared to the face-centered cubic (FCC) phases. We find that several of these
polytypes are harder and produce bulk plasmons at lower energies with
comparable lifetimes than their conventional FCC counterparts. It also leads to
the localized surface-plasmon resonance (LSPR) in perfectly spherical
HCP-phased nanoparticles, embedded onto dielectric matrices, at substantially
lower energies with comparable lifetimes to their FCC counterparts. LSPR peak
locations and lifetimes can be tuned by controlling the operational
temperature, the dielectric permittivity of hosting matrix and the grain size.
Our work suggests that noble-metal nanoparticles can be tailored to develop
exotic HCP phases to obtain novel plasmonic properties.

the way how we can connect to the Internet. Our mobile devices are demanding
for more network resources, in terms of traffic volume and QoS requirements.
Unfortunately, it is very hard to a multihomed device to be simultaneously
connected to the network through multiple links. The current work enhances the
network access of multihomed devices agnostically to the deployed access
technologies. This enhancement is achieved by using simultaneously all of the
mobile devices interfaces, and by routing each individual data flow through the
most convenient access technology. The proposed solution is only deployed at
the network side and it extends Proxy Mobile IPv6 with flow mobility in a
completely transparent way to mobile nodes. In fact, it gives particular
attention to the handover mechanisms, by improving the detection and attachment
of nodes in the network, with the inclusion of the IEEE 802.21 standard in the
solution. This provides the necessary implementation and integration details to
extend a network topology with femtocell devices. Each femtocell is equipped
with various network interfaces supporting a diverse set of access
technologies. There is also a decision entity that manages individually each
data flow according to its QoS / QoE requisites. The proposed solution has been
developed and extensively tested with a real prototype. Evaluation results
evidence that the overhead for using the solution is negligible as compared to
the offered advantages such as: the support of flow mobility, the fulfil of
VoIP functional requisites, the session continuity in spite of flows mobility,
its low overhead, its high scalability, and the complete transparency of the
proposed solution to the user terminals.

context to the users specific and immediate feedback to make sequential
recommendations. We envision our system would be highly useful in situations
with intrinsic constraints, such as finding the right restaurant within walking
distance or the right retail item within a limited inventory. Our research
prototype instantiates the former use case, leveraging real data from Google
Places, Yelp, and Zomato. We evaluated our system against a similar system that
did not incorporate user feedback in a 16 person remote study, generating 64

design. We show that realistic dark matter axion velocities of $10^{-3} c$ and
inhomogeneities of the external magnetic field at the scale of $10\,\%$ have
negligible impact on the sensitivity of MADMAX. We investigate design
requirements for which the emitted power changes by less than $20\,\%$ for a
benchmark boost factor with a bandwidth of $50\,{\rm MHz}$ at $22\,{\rm GHz}$,
corresponding to an axion mass of $90\,\mu{\rm eV}$. We find that the maximum

required disk planarity is $20\,\mu{\rm m}$ (min-to-max) or better, and the
maximum allowed surface roughness is $100\,\mu{\rm m}$ (min-to-max). We show
how using tiled dielectric disks glued together from multiple smaller patches

across the disk. Depending on wavelength, the south polar region is $5-40$ K
brighter than the mid-latitudes and northern equatorial region. We use
radiative transfer modeling coupled to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to
retrieve H$_2$S, NH$_3$, and CH$_4$ abundance profiles across the disk, though
only strong constraints can be made for H$_2$S. Below all cloud formation, the

favored over models following strict thermochemical equilibrium. H$_2$S is more
abundant at the equatorial region than at the poles, indicative of strong,
persistent global circulation. Our results imply that Neptune's
sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio exceeds unity as H$_2$S is more abundant than NH$_3$

by partial dissolution of NH$_3$ in an ionic ocean at GPa pressures or by a

sulfur rather than nitrogen onto planetesimals, or a combination of these

risk factors from a wide range of crash variables characterizing environmental,
driver, crash and road-related variables. The impact of these risk factors on
crash severity was investigated using frequency analyses, logistic regression

anticipated that the findings of this study will help traffic engineers and
departments of transportation in developing work zone countermeasures to
improve safety and reduce the crash risk. It was found that some of these
factors could be overlooked when designing and devising work zone traffic
control plans. Results indicate, for example, the need for appropriate traffic

work zones, the need to provide illumination at specific locations of the work
zone, and the need to establish frequent public education programs, flyers, and

crystal Mn3Si2Te6 (MST) through critical phenomena and magnetic entropy
analysis in the easy axis (H || ab) as a function of proton irradiance.
Employing a modified asymptotic analysis method, we find that upon proton
irradiation the critical exponents do not fall into any particular universality
class but lie close to mean field critical exponents ({\gamma} = 1, \b{eta} =
0.5). The presence of long-range interactions can be safely assumed for the
pristine and irradiated cases of MST examined in this work. Further analysis on
the effective spatial dimensionality reveal that MST remains at d = 3 under
proton irradiation transitioning from an n = 1 spin dimensionality to n = 2 and
n=3 for 1 x 10^15 and 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2, indicating an XY interaction and a
Heisenberg interaction, respectively. The pair (spin-spin) correlation function
reveals an increase in magnetic correlations at the proton irradiance of 5 x
10^15 H+/cm^2. In conjunction, the maximum change in magnetic entropy obtained
from isothermal magnetization at 3 T is the largest for 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2 with
a value of 2.45 J/kgK at T = 73.66 K, in comparison to 1.60 J/kgK for pristine
MST at T = 73 K. Magnetic entropy derived from zero-field heat capacity does
not show large deviations across the proton irradiated samples. This suggests
that the antiferromagnetic coupling between the Mn sites is stable even after
proton irradiation. Such result implies that magnetization is enhanced through
a strengthening of the super-exchange interaction between Mn atoms mediated
through Te rather than a weakening of the AFM component. Overall, our study
finds that the magnetic interactions are manipulated the greatest when MST is
irradiated at 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2.

error probability as $n$ increases. We propose a novel block-structured

each block, and show that the resulting error exponent is the binary relative
entropy $D\big(\frac{1}{2}\|\max(p,q)\big)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the noise

studies show that LDP is generally vulnerable to malicious data providers in
nature. Because a data collector has to estimate background data distribution
only from already randomized data, malicious data providers can manipulate
their output before sending, i.e., randomization would provide them plausible
deniability. Attackers can skew the estimations effectively since they are
calculated by normalizing with randomization probability defined in the LDP
protocol, and can even control the estimations. In this paper, we show how we
prevent malicious attackers from compromising LDP protocol. Our approach is to
utilize a verifiable randomization mechanism. The data collector can verify the
completeness of executing an agreed randomization mechanism for every data
provider. Our proposed method completely protects the LDP protocol from
output-manipulations, and significantly mitigates the expected damage from
attacks. We do not assume any specific attacks, and it works effectively
against general output-manipulation, and thus is more powerful than previously
proposed countermeasures. We describe the secure version of three

is known to be a challenge. Based on the fact that directly providing the label
to the data (Positive Learning; PL) has a risk of allowing CNNs to memorize the
contaminated labels for the case of noisy data, the indirect learning approach
that uses complementary labels (Negative Learning for Noisy Labels; NLNL) has
proven to be highly effective in preventing overfitting to noisy data as it
reduces the risk of providing faulty target. NLNL further employs a three-stage
pipeline to improve convergence. As a result, filtering noisy data through the
NLNL pipeline is cumbersome, increasing the training cost. In this study, we
propose a novel improvement of NLNL, named Joint Negative and Positive Learning
(JNPL), that unifies the filtering pipeline into a single stage. JNPL trains
CNN via two losses, NL+ and PL+, which are improved upon NL and PL loss
functions, respectively. We analyze the fundamental issue of NL loss function
and develop new NL+ loss function producing gradient that enhances the
convergence of noisy data. Furthermore, PL+ loss function is designed to enable
faster convergence to expected-to-be-clean data. We show that the NL+ and PL+
train CNN simultaneously, significantly simplifying the pipeline, allowing
greater ease of practical use compared to NLNL. With a simple semi-supervised
training technique, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for noisy
data classification based on the superior filtering ability.

for grain boundary (GB) structure-property models and surrogates. The VFZO
framework offers an advantage over other five degree-of-freedom based property
interpolation methods because it is constructed as a point set in a manifold.
This means that directly computed Euclidean distances approximate the original
octonion distance with significantly reduced computation runtime (~7 CPU
minutes vs. 153 CPU days for a 50000x50000 pairwise-distance matrix). This
increased efficiency facilitates lower interpolation error through the use of
significantly more input data. We demonstrate grain boundary energy
interpolation results for a non-smooth validation function and simulated
bi-crystal datasets for Fe and Ni using four interpolation methods: barycentric
interpolation, Gaussian process regression (GPR), inverse-distance weighting,
and nearest-neighbor interpolation. These are evaluated for 50000 random input
GBs and 10 000 random prediction GBs. The best performance was achieved with
GPR, which resulted in a reduction of the root mean square error (RMSE) by
83.0% relative to RMSE of a constant, average model. Likewise, interpolation on
a large, noisy, molecular statics Fe simulation dataset improves performance by
34.4% compared to 21.2% in prior work. Interpolation on a small, low-noise MS
Ni simulation dataset is similar to interpolation results for the original
octonion metric (57.6% vs. 56.4%). A vectorized, parallelized, MATLAB
interpolation function (interp5DOF.m) and related routines are available in our
VFZO repository (github.com/sgbaird-5dof/interp) which can be applied to other

computing distances between GBs, estimating property values for arbitrary GBs,

simulations.

Shortest Vector Problem and the Closest Vector Problem over lattices in
different $\ell_p$ norms ($\SVP_p$ and $\CVP_p$ respectively). Specifically, we
present the following $2^{\eps m}$-time reductions for $1 \leq p \leq q \leq
\infty$, which all increase the rank $n$ and dimension $m$ of the input lattice
by at most one:
  $\bullet$ a reduction from $\widetilde{O}(1/\eps^{1/p})\gamma$-approximate
$\SVP_q$ to $\gamma$-approximate $\SVP_p$;
  $\bullet$ a reduction from $\widetilde{O}(1/\eps^{1/p}) \gamma$-approximate

  $\bullet$ a reduction from $\widetilde{O}(1/\eps^{1+1/p})$-$\CVP_q$ to
$(1+\eps)$-unique $\SVP_p$ (which in turn trivially reduces to
$(1+\eps)$-approximate $\SVP_p$).
  The last reduction is interesting even in the case $p = q$. In particular,
this special case subsumes much prior work adapting $2^{O(m)}$-time $\SVP_p$
algorithms to solve $O(1)$-approximate $\CVP_p$. In the (important) special
case when $p = q$, $1 \leq p \leq 2$, and the $\SVP_p$ oracle is exact, we show
a stronger reduction, from $O(1/\eps^{1/p})\text{-}\CVP_p$ to (exact) $\SVP_p$
in $2^{\eps m}$ time. For example, taking $\eps = \log m/m$ and $p = 2$ gives a
slight improvement over Kannan's celebrated polynomial-time reduction from
$\sqrt{m}\text{-}\CVP_2$ to $\SVP_2$. We also note that the last two reductions
can be combined to give a reduction from approximate-$\CVP_p$ to $\SVP_q$ for
any $p$ and $q$, regardless of whether $p \leq q$ or $p > q$.
  Our techniques combine those from the recent breakthrough work of Eisenbrand

examined temperature range but revealed well-defined Lorentzian bulges, and
increased strongly near the Neel temperature of 118 K (f is the frequency).
Intriguingly, the noise spectral density attained its minimum at temperature
T~200 K, which was attributed to an interplay of two opposite trends in noise
scaling - one for semiconductors and another for materials with the phase
transitions. The Lorentzian corner frequencies revealed unusual dependence on
temperature and bias voltage, suggesting that their origin is different from
the generation - recombination noise in conventional semiconductors. The
obtained results are important for proposed applications of antiferromagnetic

aperture technique and phase retrieval method, is a recently developed
computational microscopic super-resolution technique. By turning on the
light-emitting diode (LED) elements sequentially and acquiring the
corresponding images that contain different spatial frequencies, FPM can
achieve a wide field-of-view (FOV), high-spatial-resolution imaging, and phase
recovery simultaneously. Conventional FPM assumes that the sample is
sufficiently thin and strictly in focus. Nevertheless, even for a relatively
thin sample, the non-planar distribution characteristics and the non-ideal
position/posture of the sample will cause all or part of FOV to be defocused.
In this paper, we proposed a fast digital refocusing and depth-of-field (DOF)
extended FPM strategy by taking the advantages of image lateral shift caused by
sample defocusing and varied-angle illuminations. The lateral shift amount is
proportional to the defocus distance and the tangent of the illumination angle.
Instead of searching the optimal defocus distance in optimization strategy,
which is time-consuming, the defocus distance of each subregion of the sample
can be precisely and quickly obtained by calculating the relative lateral shift
amounts corresponding to different oblique illuminations. And then, the digital
refocusing strategy rooting in the Fresnel propagator is integrated into the
FPM framework to achieve the high-resolution and phase information
reconstruction for each part of the sample, which means the DOF the FPM is
effectively extended. The feasibility of the proposed method in fast digital

adjustments in observational studies emulate key features of randomized
experiments, such as covariate balance, self-weighted sampling, and study
representativeness? In this paper, we provide answers to this and related
questions by analyzing the implied (individual-level data) weights of linear
regression methods. We derive new closed-form expressions of the weights and
examine their properties in both finite and asymptotic regimes. We show that
the implied weights of general regression problems can be equivalently obtained
by solving a convex optimization problem. Among others, we study doubly and
multiply robust properties of regression estimators from the perspective of
their implied weights. This equivalence allows us to bridge ideas from the
regression modeling and causal inference literatures. As a result, we propose
novel regression diagnostics for causal inference that are part of the design

dynamic events while a routing solution is already partially executed. We then
propose a novel framework which can benefit from existing static CARP

The framework is very flexible. In response to a dynamic event, it can use
either a simple restart strategy or a sequence transfer strategy that benefits
from past optimisation experience. Empirical studies have been conducted on a
wide range of DCARP instances to evaluate our proposed framework. The results
show that the proposed framework significantly improves over state-of-the-art

kinds of apicomplexan parasites and non-infected host cells microscopic images,
which uses a small number of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data
for training. There are two challenges in microscopic image recognition. The
first is that salient structures of the microscopic images are more fuzzy and
intricate than natural images' on a real-world scale. The second is that
insignificant textures, like background staining, lightness, and contrast
level, vary a lot in samples from different clinical scenarios. To address
these challenges, we aim to learn a distinguishable and appearance-invariant
representation by contrastive learning strategy. On one hand, macroscopic
images, which share similar shape characteristics in morphology, are introduced
to contrast for structure enhancement. On the other hand, different appearance
transformations, including color distortion and flittering, are utilized to
contrast for texture elimination. In the case where only 1% of microscopic
images are labeled, the proposed method reaches an accuracy of 94.90% in a

The network-obtained regularization parameters can be computed more efficiently

of using DNNs for learning regularization parameters, compared to previous
works on learning via optimal experimental design or empirical Bayes risk

set of parameters that is optimal with respect to one particular design
objective, DNN-computed regularization parameters are tailored to the specific

generalization can be obtained when it is trained with face images from
different input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality,
training data (both real face images and spoof images) are not directly shared
between data owners due to legal and privacy issues. In this paper, with the
motivation of circumventing this challenge, we propose a Federated Face
Presentation Attack Detection (FedPAD) framework that simultaneously takes
advantage of rich fPAD information available at different data owners while
preserving data privacy. In the proposed framework, each data center locally
trains its own fPAD model. A server learns a global fPAD model by iteratively
aggregating model updates from all data centers without accessing private data
in each of them. To equip the aggregated fPAD model in the server with better
generalization ability to unseen attacks from users, following the basic idea
of FedPAD, we further propose a Federated Generalized Face Presentation Attack
Detection (FedGPAD) framework. A federated domain disentanglement strategy is
introduced in FedGPAD, which treats each data center as one domain and
decomposes the fPAD model into domain-invariant and domain-specific parts in
each data center. Two parts disentangle the domain-invariant and
domain-specific features from images in each local data center, respectively. A
server learns a global fPAD model by only aggregating domain-invariant parts of
the fPAD models from data centers and thus a more generalized fPAD model can be
aggregated in server. We introduce the experimental setting to evaluate the
proposed FedPAD and FedGPAD frameworks and carry out extensive experiments to
provide various insights about federated learning for fPAD.

find that the breakdown of the quantum-classical correspondence of particle
motion, via dramatically changing the spatial structure of many-body
wavefunction, leads to profound changes of the entanglement structure.
Furthermore, for a class of initial states, such change leads to the approach
to thermal equilibrium everywhere in the cavity, with the well-known Ehrenfest
time in quantum chaos as the thermalization time. Specifically, the quantum
expectation values of various correlation functions at different spatial scales
are all determined by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. In addition, by using the
reduced density matrix (RDM) and the entanglement entropy (EE) as local probes,

achieve satisfactory performance on fake face detection, we observe that the
detectors tend to seek forgeries on a limited region of face, which reveals
that the detectors is short of understanding of forgery. Therefore, we propose
an attention-based data augmentation framework to guide detector refine and
enlarge its attention. Specifically, our method tracks and occludes the Top-N
sensitive facial regions, encouraging the detector to mine deeper into the
regions ignored before for more representative forgery. Especially, our method
is simple-to-use and can be easily integrated with various CNN models.
Extensive experiments show that the detector trained with our method is capable
to separately point out the representative forgery of fake faces generated by
different manipulation techniques, and our method enables a vanilla CNN-based
detector to achieve state-of-the-art performance without structure

first provide the formal definitions for different types of dataset shifts in

effectively for regression problems. Our approach is based on the inductive
conformal anomaly detection and utilizes a variational autoencoder for

improve the robustness of detection, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is

different types of dataset shifts with a small number of false alarms while the

we proposed a semi-supervised technique and architecture for detecting UAVs in
an environment by exploiting the RF signals (i.e., fingerprints) between a UAV

the quality of sensors and the current algorithms used to interpret the data.
This paper presents light-weight, low-cost and open-source force-sensing shoes

method for calibrating the shoes. The shoes measure center of pressure (CoP)
and normal ground reaction force (GRF). The calibration method enables each
individual shoe to reach high measurement precision by applying known forces at
different locations of the shoe and using a regularized least squares
optimization to interpret sensor outputs. A NAO robot is used as our
experimental platform. Experiments are conducted to compare the measurement
performance between the shoes and the robot's factory-installed force-sensing
resistors (FSRs), and to evaluate the calibration method over these two sensing
modules. Experimental results show that the shoes significantly improve CoP and
GRF measurement precision compared to the robot's built-in FSRs. Moreover, the
developed calibration method improves the measurement performance for both our

has been broadly used to solve thermodynamically consistent PDE problems. By
utilizing scalar auxiliary variables, the original PDE problems are
reformulated into equivalent PDE problems. The advantages of the SAV approach,
such as linearity, unconditionally energy stability, and easy-to-implement, are
prevalent. However, there is still an open issue unresolved, i.e., the
numerical schemes resulted from the SAV method preserve a ""modified"" energy law
according to the auxiliary variables instead of the original variables.
Truncation errors are introduced during numerical calculations so that the
numerical solutions of the auxiliary variables are no longer equivalent to
their original continuous definitions. In other words, even though the SAV
scheme satisfies a modified energy law, it does not necessarily satisfy the
energy law of the original PDE models. This paper presents one essential
relaxation technique to overcome this issue, which we named the relaxed-SAV
(RSAV) method. Our RSAV method penalizes the numerical errors of the auxiliary
variables by a relaxation technique. In general, the RSAV method keeps all the
advantages of the baseline SAV method and improves its accuracy and consistency
noticeably. Several examples have been presented to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the RSAV approach.

the method of Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) that has been developed in the
last years to analyze time series avoiding the tedium and the high
computational cost that other methods offer. Here we build a complex network
based on directed HVG technique applied to magnetic field fluctuations time
series obtained from Particle In Cell (PIC) simulations of a magnetized
collisionless plasma to distinguish the degree distributions and calculate the
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) as a measure of relative entropy of data sets
produced by processes that are not in equilibrium. First, we analyze the
connectivity probability distribution for the undirected version of HVG finding
how the Kappa distribution for low values of $\kappa$ tends to be an
uncorrelated time series, while the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution shows a
correlated stochastic processes behavior. Then, we investigate the degree of
temporary irreversibility of magnetic fluctuations self-generated by the
plasma, comparing the case of a thermal plasma (described by a Maxwell-Botzmann
velocity distribution function) with non-thermal Kappa distributions. We have
shown that the KLD associated to the HVG is able to distinguish the level of
reversibility associated to the thermal equilibrium in the plasma because the
dissipative degree of the system increases as the value of $\kappa$ parameter
decreases and the distribution function departs from the Maxwell-Boltzmann
equilibrium.

low-speed ($\lesssim 450$ km s$^{-1}$) solar wind is widely believed to
originate from coronal streamers, unlike high-speed wind, which comes from
coronal holes. An alternative scenario is that the bulk of the slow wind
(excluding that in the immediate vicinity of the heliospheric current sheet)
originates from rapidly diverging flux tubes rooted inside small coronal holes
or just within the boundaries of large holes. This viewpoint is based largely
on photospheric field extrapolations, which are subject to considerable
uncertainties and do not include dynamical effects, making it difficult to be
certain whether a source is located just inside or outside a hole boundary, or
whether a high-latitude hole will be connected to Earth. To minimize the
dependence on field-line extrapolations, we have searched for cases where
equatorial coronal holes at central meridian are followed by low-speed streams
at Earth. We describe 14 examples from the period 2014--2017, involving Fe XIV
21.1 nm coronal holes located near active regions and having equatorial widths
of $\sim$3$^\circ$--10$^\circ$. The associated in situ wind was characterized
by speeds $v\sim 300$--450 km s$^{-1}$ and by O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$ ratios of
$\sim$0.05--0.15, with $v$ showing the usual correlation with proton
temperature. In addition, consistent with other recent studies, this slow wind
had remarkably high Alfv\'enicity, similar to that in high-speed streams. We
conclude that small coronal holes are a major contributor to the slow solar
wind during the maximum and early post-maximum phases of the solar cycle.

  Faithful Attribution",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Back propagation based visualizations have been proposed to interpret deep
neural networks (DNNs), some of which produce interpretations with good visual
quality. However, there exist doubts about whether these intuitive
visualizations are related to the network decisions. Recent studies have
confirmed this suspicion by verifying that almost all these modified
back-propagation visualizations are not faithful to the model's decision-making
process. Besides, these visualizations produce vague ""relative importance
scores"", among which low values can't guarantee to be independent of the final
prediction. Hence, it's highly desirable to develop a novel back-propagation
framework that guarantees theoretical faithfulness and produces a quantitative
attribution score with a clear understanding. To achieve the goal, we resort to
mutual information theory to generate the interpretations, studying how much
information of output is encoded in each input neuron. The basic idea is to
learn a source signal by back-propagation such that the mutual information
between input and output should be as much as possible preserved in the mutual
information between input and the source signal. In addition, we propose a
Mutual Information Preserving Inverse Network, termed MIP-IN, in which the
parameters of each layer are recursively trained to learn how to invert. During
the inversion, forward Relu operation is adopted to adapt the general
interpretations to the specific input. We then empirically demonstrate that the
inverted source signal satisfies completeness and minimality property, which
are crucial for a faithful interpretation. Furthermore, the empirical study
validates the effectiveness of interpretations generated by MIP-IN.

with finite velocity in nature. Any variation of the hole does not affect the
boundary condition at null infinity in a finite time. The quasinormal modes
originated around the horizon would not immediately come down to, but slowly
goes to the final state following the mass accretion process of the hole. The
precision of the matrix method is quite compelling, which reveals more details

contrary to the common belief that the higher the energy, the lower the plastic

that the spongy-textured Fe IX 17.1 nm moss is not confined to plages, but may
extend into regions where the photospheric field is relatively weak or even has
mixed polarity. We again find a tendency for bright coronal loops seen in the

dissipating energy at the level of their microscopic components. This energy
flux stems from the conversion of a fuel, present in the environment, into
sustained individual motion. It can lead to collective effects without any
equilibrium equivalent, such as a phase separation for purely repulsive
particles, or a collective motion (flocking) for aligning particles. Some of
these effects can be rationalized by using equilibrium tools to recapitulate
nonequilibrium transitions. An important challenge is then to delineate
systematically to which extent the character of these active transitions is
genuinely distinct from equilibrium analogs. We review recent works that use
stochastic thermodynamics tools to identify, for active systems, a measure of
irreversibility comprising a coarse-grained or informatic entropy production.
We describe how this relates to the underlying energy dissipation or
thermodynamic entropy production, and how it is influenced by collective
behavior. Then, we review the possibility to construct thermodynamic ensembles
out-of-equilibrium, where trajectories are biased towards atypical values of
nonequilibrium observables. We show that this is a generic route to discovering
unexpected phase transitions in active matter systems, which can also inform
their design.

of 13.56 MHz. For each case, the dissipated power is measured based on a
careful calibration procedure of voltage and current measurements. The results
are compared to PIC/MCC simulation results and very good agreement is found.
The computational results show that the choice of the surface coefficients in
the simulation is important to reproduce the experimental data correctly. Due
to the enhanced control of the spatio-temporal electron power absorption
dynamics and, thus, of the electron energy distribution function by VWT, this
approach does not only provide better control of the generation of excited and

metastables the energy efficiency is also shown to be significantly higher in

appearance but is still a challenging task even with prosperous deep learning
approaches. Recent works introduce the promising Transformer architecture into
deep video inpainting and achieve better performance. However, it still suffers
from synthesizing blurry texture as well as huge computational cost. Towards
this end, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) for
improving video inpainting with exceptional efficiency. Our proposed DSTT
disentangles the task of learning spatial-temporal attention into 2 sub-tasks:
one is for attending temporal object movements on different frames at same
spatial locations, which is achieved by temporally-decoupled Transformer block,
and the other is for attending similar background textures on same frame of all
spatial positions, which is achieved by spatially-decoupled Transformer block.
The interweaving stack of such two blocks makes our proposed model attend
background textures and moving objects more precisely, and thus the attended
plausible and temporally-coherent appearance can be propagated to fill the
holes. In addition, a hierarchical encoder is adopted before the stack of
Transformer blocks, for learning robust and hierarchical features that maintain
multi-level local spatial structure, resulting in the more representative token
vectors. Seamless combination of these two novel designs forms a better
spatial-temporal attention scheme and our proposed model achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art video inpainting approaches with significant

X9.3) approximately 3 hours apart in September 2017. The X9.3 was the recorded
largest solar flare in Solar Cycle 24. In this study we perform a
data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation taking into account the
observed photospheric magnetic field to reveal the initiation and dynamics of
the X2.2 and X9.3 flares. According to our simulation, the X2.2 flare is first
triggered by magnetic reconnection at a local site where at the photosphere the
negative polarity intrudes into the opposite-polarity region. This magnetic
reconnection expels the innermost field lines upward beneath which the magnetic
flux rope is formed through continuous reconnection with external twisted field
lines. Continuous magnetic reconnection after the X2.2 flare enhances the
magnetic flux rope, which is lifted up and eventually erupts via the torus
instability. This gives rise to the X9.3 flare.

metrics, FDG exploits the ongoing FL results to emphasise the parts of the
program for which more information is needed. Our evaluation of FDG with
Defects4J shows that it can successfully help the augmentation of test suites
for better FL. When given only a few failing test cases (2.3 test cases on

test cases generated automatically by EvoSuite: the augmentation can improve
the acc@1 and acc@10 of the FL results by 11.6x and 2.2x on average, after

temperature-sensitive spatial redistribution of defects in PdSe2 thin flakes
through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We observe that the spatial
distribution of Se vacancies in PdSe2 flakes exhibits a strong anisotropic
characteristic at 80 K, and that this orientation-dependent feature is weakened
when temperature is raised. Moreover, we carry out transport measurements on
PdSe2 thin flakes and show that the anisotropic features of carrier mobility
and phase coherent length are also sensitive to temperature. Combining with
theoretical analysis, we conclude that temperature-driven defect spatial

after fine-tuning on many downstream tasks -- including on tasks specifically

perform surprisingly well according to some parametric syntactic probes,

influenza victims during epidemics is an important task for clinical, hospital,

primarily in the form of social media posts or search query logs, are generally
used for prediction for reaction to sudden and unusual outbreaks. However, most
studies rely only on the UGC as their resource and do not use various UGCs. Our
study aims to solve these questions about Influenza prediction: Which model is
the best? What combination of multiple UGCs works well? What is the nature of
each UGC? We adapt some models, LASSO Regression, Huber Regression, Support
Vector Machine regression with Linear kernel (SVR) and Random Forest, to test
the influenza volume prediction in Japan during 2015 - 2018. For that, we use
on-line five data resources: (1) past flu patients, (2) SNS (Twitter), (3)
search engines (Yahoo! Japan), (4) shopping services (Yahoo! Shopping), and (5)
Q&A services (Yahoo! Chiebukuro) as resources of each model. We then validate
respective resources contributions using the best model, Huber Regression, with
all resources except one resource. Finally, we use Bayesian change point method
for ascertaining whether the trend of time series on any resources is reflected
in the trend of flu patient count or not. Our experiments show Huber Regression
model based on various data resources produces the most accurate results. Then,
from the change point analysis, we get the result that search query logs and
social media posts for three years represents these resources as a good
predictor. Conclusions: We show that Huber Regression based on various data
resources is strong for outliers and is suitable for the flu prediction.
Additionally, we indicate the characteristics of each resource for the flu
prediction.

In the first level, the manufacturing company decides about the predictive

approach in which the objective function depends on their consumption, the
consumption levels of other customers who are connected through the graph, and

collected from mobile phone users, cannot cover all populations. Therefore,
this study proposes a Small World Model, to map the results from the ""small
world"" (simulation with partially sampled data) to the real world. Based on the
basic principles of disease transmission, this study derives two parameters: a
time scaling factor to map the simulated period to the real period, and an
amount scaling factor to map the simulated infected number to the real infected
number. It is believed that this model could convert the simulation of the
""small world"" into the state of the real world, and analyze the effectiveness
of different mobility restriction policies.

matrix based on the dynamically weighted Halley (DWH) iteration. This method is
well established for computing the standard polar decomposition. A stable
implementation is available, where matrix inversion is avoided and QR
decompositions are used instead. We establish a natural generalization of this
approach for computing generalized polar decompositions with respect to
signature matrices. Again the inverse can be avoided by using a generalized QR
decomposition called hyperbolic QR decomposition. However, this decomposition
does not show the same favorable stability properties as its orthogonal
counterpart. We overcome the numerical difficulties by generalizing the
CholeskyQR2 method. This method computes the standard QR decomposition in a
stable way via two successive Cholesky factorizations. An even better numerical
stability is achieved by employing permuted graph bases, yielding residuals of
order $10^{-14}$ even for badly conditioned matrices, where other methods fail.

reflects the symmetry of the underlying distribution. The phase boundary has a
multicritical point which separates a locus of continuous transitions (for

The free energy is a function of a single variable in case (a) and a function

  Journal of the IMA",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-supervised (SS) inference has received much attention in recent years.
Apart from a moderate-sized labeled data, L, the SS setting is characterized by
an additional, much larger sized, unlabeled data, U. The setting of |U| >> |L|,
makes SS inference unique and different from the standard missing data
problems, owing to natural violation of the so-called ""positivity"" or ""overlap""
assumption. However, most of the SS literature implicitly assumes L and U to be
equally distributed, i.e., no selection bias in the labeling. Inferential
challenges in missing at random (MAR) type labeling allowing for selection
bias, are inevitably exacerbated by the decaying nature of the propensity score
(PS). We address this gap for a prototype problem, the estimation of the
response's mean. We propose a double robust SS (DRSS) mean estimator and give a
complete characterization of its asymptotic properties. The proposed estimator
is consistent as long as either the outcome or the PS model is correctly
specified. When both models are correctly specified, we provide inference
results with a non-standard consistency rate that depends on the smaller size
|L|. The results are also extended to causal inference with imbalanced
treatment groups. Further, we provide several novel choices of models and
estimators of the decaying PS, including a novel offset logistic model and a
stratified labeling model. We present their properties under both high and low
dimensional settings. These may be of independent interest. Lastly, we present
extensive simulations and also a real data application.

Reordering a narrative can impact the temporal, causal, event-based, and other

its interpretation and interestingness. In this paper, we propose and
investigate the task of Narrative Reordering (NAREOR) which involves rewriting

that although our models can perform decently, NAREOR is a challenging task

prospective ones, such as for pedagogical setups related to language skills

angular momenta on such confining properties. To have a global picture of
confinement, both bound and resonance states are considered. The resonances
will be examined by means of the Wigner time delay of the scattering states, as
well as through the complex eigenvalues of outgoing states in order to show
that they are physically meaningful. By tuning the potential intensity of the
well, electron captures and atomic collapses are observed for critical values.
In these processes, the bound states of the discrete spectrum become resonances
of the continuous spectrum or vice versa. For massive charges, the atomic
collapse phenomenon keeps the number of bound levels in the quantum dot below a
maximum value. In the massless case, the bound states have zero energy and
occur only for some discrete values of the potential depth, as is known. We
also show that although the intensity of the resonances for massive particles
is not significantly influenced by angular momenta, on the contrary, for
massless particles they are quite sensitive to angular momenta, as it is the
case of graphene.

usually reside in distributed parties such as different institutions and may

As a result, some parties may suffer from insufficient data available for

multiple parties always emerge in dual forms, we show that dual learning is
naturally suitable to handle the challenge of missing data, and explicitly
exploits the probabilistic correlation and structural relationship between dual
tasks to regularize the training process. We introduce a feature-oriented
differential privacy with mathematical proof, in order to avoid possible
privacy leakage of raw features in the dual inference process. The approach
requires minimal modifications to the existing multi-party learning structure,
and each party can build flexible and powerful models separately, whose
accuracy is no less than non-distributed self-learning approaches. The MPDL

considered including the inclusive-service BS (IS-BS) scheme, which makes BSs
serve both ground users (GUs) and aerial users (AUs) (i.e., UAVs)
simultaneously, and the exclusive-service BS (ES-BS) scheme, which has BSs for
GUs and BSs for AUs. By considering the antenna tilt angle-based channel gain,
we derive the network outage probability for both IS-BS and ES-BS schemes, and
show the existence of the optimal tilt angle that minimizes the network outage
probability after analyzing the conflict impact of the antenna tilt angle. We
also analyze the impact of various network parameters, including the ratio of
GUs to total users and densities of total and interfering BSs, on the network
outage probability. Finally, we analytically and numerically show in which
environments each service provisioning scheme can be superior to the other one.

the range of the distortion generally depends on the dimensionality. We find
that in both model systems the deformation of the body-centered cubic (BCC)

The Loomis-Whitney inequality in the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^1$ is a
direct consequence of known $L^p$ improving properties of the standard Radon
transform in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In this note, we show how the Loomis-Whitney
inequalities in higher dimensional Heisenberg groups can be deduced by an
elementary inductive argument from the inequality in $\mathbb{H}^1$. The same

geometric Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{H}^n$: $$\|u\|_{\frac{2n+2}{2n+1}}

gradients is a key bottleneck in a large-scale federated learning system.
Various recent works have proposed to compress the local stochastic gradients
to mitigate the communication overhead. However, robustness to malicious
attacks is rarely considered in such a setting. In this work, we investigate
the problem of Byzantine-robust compressed federated learning, where the
attacks from Byzantine workers can be arbitrarily malicious. We theoretically
point out that different to the attacks-free compressed stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), its vanilla combination with geometric median-based robust
aggregation seriously suffers from the compression noise in the presence of
Byzantine attacks. In light of this observation, we propose to reduce the
compression noise with gradient difference compression so as to improve the
Byzantine-robustness. We also observe the impact of the intrinsic stochastic
noise caused by selecting random samples, and adopt the stochastic average
gradient algorithm (SAGA) to gradually eliminate the inner variations of
regular workers. We theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm reaches a
neighborhood of the optimal solution at a linear convergence rate, and the
asymptotic learning error is in the same order as that of the state-of-the-art
uncompressed method. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the

yet challenging task. Existing methods mainly focus on feature extraction in
spatial domain, and little attention has been paid to frequency domain.
Furthermore, in patch-wise feature analysis, some noisy features in the
marginal region may be introduced. To tackle the above two challenges, we
propose a Dual-Domain Network. Specifically, we take features from the discrete
cosine transform domain into consideration and the reshaped DCT coefficients
are integrated into the proposed model as the frequency domain branch. Feature
representations from both frequency and spatial domain are exploited to
alleviate the speckle noise. In addition, we further propose a multi-region
convolution module, which emphasizes the central region of each patch. The
contextual information and central region features are modeled adaptively. The
experimental results on three SAR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model. Our codes are available at

numbers for joint eigenvalues from the bare data of the joint spectrum. In the
spectral region corresponding to regular values of the momentum map, the
algorithms developed by Dauge, Hall and the second author [27] produce such

that semitoric systems are completely spectrally determined in an algorithmic

drastically affect the performance. Due to the often complicated interplay of
the parameters, setting these values right for a particular problem (parameter
tuning) is a challenging task. This task becomes even more complicated when the
optimal parameter values change significantly during the run of the algorithm
since then a dynamic parameter choice (parameter control) is necessary.
  In this work, we propose a lazy but effective solution, namely choosing all
parameter values (where this makes sense) in each iteration randomly from a
suitably scaled power-law distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach, we perform runtime analyses of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$
genetic algorithm with all three parameters chosen in this manner. We show that
this algorithm on the one hand can imitate simple hill-climbers like the
$(1+1)$ EA, giving the same asymptotic runtime on problems like OneMax,
LeadingOnes, or Minimum Spanning Tree. On the other hand, this algorithm is
also very efficient on jump functions, where the best static parameters are
very different from those necessary to optimize simple problems. We prove a
performance guarantee that is comparable to the best performance known for
static parameters. For the most interesting case that the jump size $k$ is
constant, we prove that our performance is asymptotically better than what can
be obtained with any static parameter choice. We complement our theoretical
results with a rigorous empirical study confirming what the asymptotic runtime
results suggest.

bounding algorithms based on Lagrangian Decomposition. Previous works have used
off-the-shelf solvers to solve relaxations at each node of the BaB tree, or
constructed weaker relaxations that can be solved efficiently, but lead to
unnecessarily weak bounds. Our formulation restricts the optimization to a
subspace of the dual domain that is guaranteed to contain the optimum,
resulting in accelerated convergence. Furthermore, it allows for a massively
parallel implementation, which is amenable to GPU acceleration via modern deep
learning frameworks. Second, we present a novel activation-based branching
strategy. By coupling an inexpensive heuristic with fast dual bounding, our
branching scheme greatly reduces the size of the BaB tree compared to previous
heuristic methods. Moreover, it performs competitively with a recent strategy
based on learning algorithms, without its large offline training cost. Finally,
we design a BaB framework, named Branch and Dual Network Bound (BaDNB), based
on our novel bounding and branching algorithms. We show that BaDNB outperforms
previous complete verification systems by a large margin, cutting average
verification times by factors up to 50 on adversarial robustness properties.

promising compound for low energy spintronics applications.

becomes more compact, their boundary treatment is simpler, and the numerical
errors are smaller at the same grid. Thus, it is also a compact scheme when we

ABMA to test the robustness of formal reason-balancing models of argumentation
[Maes & Flache 2013, Singer et al. 2019]: First of all, as long as ADAs remain
passive, confirmation bias and homophily updating trigger polarization, which
is consistent with results from formal models. However, once ADAs start to
actively generate new contributions, the evolution of a conservation is
dominated by properties of the agents *as authors*. This suggests that the
creation of new arguments, reasons, and claims critically affects a
conversation and is of pivotal importance for understanding the dynamics of

reactions in hydrogen generation. However, the structure-dependent stability
and reaction pathways of such materials remain unclear. Herein, we report
catalytically active Cu modified SrTiO3 (nominally SrTi1-xCuxO3) prepared by a
modified polymeric precursor method. Microstructural analysis revealed a
partially segregated CuO phase in the as-prepared materials. Operando X-ray
diffraction and absorption spectroscopy showed the reduction of CuO into a
stable metallic phase under conditions of WGS reactions for all compositions.
Among the characterized materials, the x = 0.20 composition showed the highest
turnover frequency, lowest activation energy, and the highest WGS rate at 300C.
According to density functional calculations, the formation of CuO is
energetically less favorable compared with SrTiO3, explaining why the
segregated CuO phase on the SrTiO3 surface is reduced to Cu during the
catalytic reaction, while SrTiO3 remains. For x = 0.20, the size of the
segregated CuO phase is optimum for facilitating the catalytic reaction. In
contrast, a higher Cu content (x = 0.3) results in an aggregation of smaller
CuO particles, resulting in fewer surface active sites and a net decrease in
catalytic performance.

opacities, which depend on the size of the dust grains and their chemical
composition. In the inner regions, the grain sizes are regulated by the level
of turbulence (e.g. $\alpha$ viscosity) and by the dust fragmentation velocity
that represents the maximal velocity that grains can have at a collision before
they fragment. Here, we perform self-consistently calculated 2D hydrodynamical
simulations that consider a full grain size distribution of dust grains with a
transition in the dust fragmentation velocity at the water-ice line. This
approach accounts for the results of previous particle collision laboratory
experiments, in which silicate particles typically have a lower dust
fragmentation velocity than water-ice particles. Furthermore, we probe the
effects of variations in the water abundance, the dust-to-gas ratio, and the
turbulence parameter on the disc structure. For the discs with a transition in
the dust fragmentation velocity at the water-ice line, we find a narrow but
striking zone of planetary outward migration, including for low viscosities. In
addition, we find a bump in the radial pressure gradient profile that tends to
be located slightly inside the ice line. Both of these features are present for
all tested disc parameters. Thus, we conclude that the ice line can function
both as a migration trap, which can extend the growth times of planets before
they migrate to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, and as a pressure
trap, where planetesimal formation can be initiated or enhanced.

  This survey provides complete proofs of the major results obtained thus far.
We focus equally on upper bounds for the determinant (achieved largely via the

via quadratic residues in finite fields and concepts from design theory). To

for supporting and complementing terrestrial communications. However, the
benefits of such a system cannot be fully exploited, especially when the
line-of-sight (LoS) transmissions are prone to severe deterioration due to
complex propagation environments in urban areas. The emerging technology of
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has recently become a potential
solution to mitigate propagation-induced impairments and improve wireless
network coverage. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we address
the coverage and link performance problems of the aerial-terrestrial
communication system by proposing an RIS-assisted transmission strategy. In
particular, we design an adaptive RIS-assisted transmission protocol, in which
the channel estimation, transmission strategy, and data transmission are
independently implemented in a frame. On this basis, we formulate an
RIS-assisted transmission strategy optimization problem as a mixed-integer
non-linear program (MINLP) to maximize the overall system throughput. We then
employ multi-task learning to speed up the solution to the problem. Benefiting
from multi-task learning, the computation time is reduced by about four orders
of magnitude. Numerical results show that the proposed RIS-assisted
transmission protocol significantly improves the system throughput and reduces
the transmit power.

sparsely distributed carbon clusters and inefficient active sites. To overcome
these limitations, we designed and fabricated a layered graphene SiOC
heterostructure by solvent assisted infiltration of a polymeric precursor into
a modified three dimensional graphene aerogel skeleton. The use of a high
melting point solvent facilitated the precursors freeze drying, which following
pyrolysis yielded SiOC as a layer supported on the surface of nitrogen doped
reduced graphene oxide aerogels. The fabrication method employed here modifies
the composition and microstructure of the SiOC phase. Among the studied
materials, the highest levels of performance were obtained for a sample of
moderate SiOC content, in which the graphene network constituted 19.8 wt % of
the system. In these materials, a stable reversible charge capacity of 751
mAh/g was achieved at low charge rates. At high charge rates of 1480 mA/g, the
capacity retention was ca. 95% (352 mAh/g) after 1000 consecutive cycles. At
all rates, Coulombic efficiencies greater than 99% were maintained following

graphene aerogel SiOC nanocomposites, compared with unsupported SiOC. The
performance was attributed to mechanisms across multiple length scales. The
presence of oxygen rich SiO4-xCx tetrahedral units and a continuous free carbon

in heterogeneous face recognition, which aims to match a pair of face images
captured from two different modalities. Existing deep learning based methods
have made remarkable progress in NIR-VIS face recognition, while it encounters
certain newly-emerged difficulties during the pandemic of COVID-19, since
people are supposed to wear facial masks to cut off the spread of the virus. We
define this task as NIR-VIS masked face recognition, and find it problematic
with the masked face in the NIR probe image. First, the lack of masked face
data is a challenging issue for the network training. Second, most of the
facial parts (cheeks, mouth, nose etc.) are fully occluded by the mask, which
leads to a large amount of loss of information. Third, the domain gap still
exists in the remaining facial parts. In such scenario, the existing methods
suffer from significant performance degradation caused by the above issues. In
this paper, we aim to address the challenge of NIR-VIS masked face recognition
from the perspectives of training data and training method. Specifically, we
propose a novel heterogeneous training method to maximize the mutual
information shared by the face representation of two domains with the help of
semi-siamese networks. In addition, a 3D face reconstruction based approach is
employed to synthesize masked face from the existing NIR image. Resorting to
these practices, our solution provides the domain-invariant face representation
which is also robust to the mask occlusion. Extensive experiments on three
NIR-VIS face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
cross-dataset-generalization capacity of our method.

include, in particular, a kinematic coupling between activator density and

of a perturbative field-theoretical renormalization group analysis. Due to the
aforementioned kinematic coupling the natural dynamical scaling is acoustic,
that is the dynamical critical exponent is 1. However, as soon as the the
normal velocity of the membrane is tuned to zero, the system crosses over to
diffusive dynamic scaling in mean field. Distinct critical points can be
reached depending on how the limit of vanishing velocity is realised: in each
of them corrections to scaling due to nonlinear coupling terms must be taken
into accounts. The detailed analysis of these critical points reveals novel
scaling regimes wich can be accessed with perturbative methods, together with
signs of strong coupling behaviour, which establishes a promising ground for
further non-perturbative calculations. Our results unify several previous
studies on the dynamics of active membrane, while also identifying nontrivial
scaling regimes which cannot be captured by passive theories of fluctuating

nonconvex function, standard gradient-based methods can find
$\epsilon$-stationary points (with gradient norm less than $\epsilon$) in
$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations. However, many important nonconvex
optimization problems, such as those associated with training modern neural
networks, are inherently not smooth, making these results inapplicable. In this
paper, we study nonsmooth nonconvex optimization from an oracle complexity
viewpoint, where the algorithm is assumed to be given access only to local
information about the function at various points. We provide two main results:
First, we consider the problem of getting near $\epsilon$-stationary points.
This is perhaps the most natural relaxation of finding $\epsilon$-stationary
points, which is impossible in the nonsmooth nonconvex case. We prove that this
relaxed goal cannot be achieved efficiently, for any distance and $\epsilon$
smaller than some constants. Our second result deals with the possibility of
tackling nonsmooth nonconvex optimization by reduction to smooth optimization:
Namely, applying smooth optimization methods on a smooth approximation of the
objective function. For this approach, we prove under a mild assumption an
inherent trade-off between oracle complexity and smoothness: On the one hand,
smoothing a nonsmooth nonconvex function can be done very efficiently (e.g., by
randomized smoothing), but with dimension-dependent factors in the smoothness
parameter, which can strongly affect iteration complexity when plugging into
standard smooth optimization methods. On the other hand, these dimension
factors can be eliminated with suitable smoothing methods, but only by making
the oracle complexity of the smoothing process exponentially large.

larger than the coherence length, we derive the effective nearest-neighbour
tight-binding equations for ACs with a helical magnetic configuration. The

energy-symmetric bands. By increasing the strength of the magnetic impurities
in ferromagnetic ACs, these bands cross without interacting. However, in any
other helical configuration, there is a value of the magnetic strength at which
the bands touch each other, forming a Dirac point. Further increase of the

respect to manufacturing processes such as fermentation processes arising e.g.\
in food and chemical manufacturing processes. According to Zhang et al. (2002),
the open-loop dynamics of yeast are highly dependent on the initial cell mass
distribution. This can be modeled via population balance models describing the
single-cell behavior of the yeast cell. There have already been several
population balance models for wine fermentation in the literature. However, the
new model introduced in this paper is much more detailed than the ones studied
previously. This new model for the white wine fermentation process is based on
a combination of components previously introduced in literature. It turns it
into a system of highly nonlinear weakly hyperbolic partial/ordinary
integro-differential equations. This model becomes very challenging from a
theoretical and numerical point of view. Existence and uniqueness of solutions
to a simplified version of the introduced problem is studied based on semigroup
theory. For its numerical solution a numerical methodology based on a finite
volume scheme combined with a time implicit scheme is derived. The impact of
the initial cell mass distribution on the solution is studied and underlined
with numerical results. The detailed model is compared to a simpler model based
on ordinary differential equations. The observed differences for different
initial distributions and the different models turn out to be smaller than
expected. The outcomes of this paper are very interesting and useful for
applied mathematicians, winemakers and process engineers.

vehicles on multilane motorways is derived from the opportune formulation of an

connected vehicles are able to exchange with each other (V2V) or the

For the numerical solution of the optimal control problem, an efficient
feasible direction algorithm is used. To ensure high-quality local minima, a
simplified Dynamic Programming algorithm is also conceived to deliver the
initial guess trajectory for the feasible direction algorithm. Thanks to low
computation times, the approach is readily executable within a model predictive

Aimsun microsimulation platform, which enables the evaluation of a plethora of
realistic vehicle driving and advancement scenarios. Results obtained on a

ordinary Aimsun vehicles. Increased penetration rates of automated vehicles are
found to increase the efficiency of the overall traffic flow, benefiting manual

task consists in understanding the high-level semantic information of the game
in play. For instance, recognizing and localizing the main actions of the game
would allow producers to adapt and automatize the broadcast production,
focusing on the important details of the game and maximizing the spectator
engagement. In this paper, we focus our analysis on action spotting in soccer
broadcast, which consists in temporally localizing the main actions in a soccer
game. To that end, we propose a novel feature pooling method based on NetVLAD,
dubbed NetVLAD++, that embeds temporally-aware knowledge. Different from
previous pooling methods that consider the temporal context as a single set to
pool from, we split the context before and after an action occurs. We argue
that considering the contextual information around the action spot as a single
entity leads to a sub-optimal learning for the pooling module. With NetVLAD++,
we disentangle the context from the past and future frames and learn specific
vocabularies of semantics for each subsets, avoiding to blend and blur such
vocabulary in time. Injecting such prior knowledge creates more informative
pooling modules and more discriminative pooled features, leading into a better
understanding of the actions. We train and evaluate our methodology on the
recent large-scale dataset SoccerNet-v2, reaching 53.4% Average-mAP for action
spotting, a +12.7% improvement w.r.t the current state-of-the-art.

with those for different gas phases, and analyse the relative effects of using
different tracers when estimating dynamical masses. The stellar velocity and
velocity dispersion maps are extracted in both near-IR bands by fitting the
continuum emission using pPXF while we use the gas kinematics from previous

the stellar component is rotating with slightly lower velocities
(V$_*$~0.8V$_g$) but in significantly warmer orbits ($\sigma_*$~2$\sigma_g$)
than the gas phases. These values indicate that stars are rotating in thick
discs while the gas phases are confined in dynamically cooler rotating discs.
However, these differences do not lead to significant discrepancies between the
dynamical mass estimations based on the stellar and gas kinematics. This result
suggests that the gas kinematics can be used to estimate M$_{dyn}$ also in z~2

today. Teleoperation follows the idea to get humans back into the loop for
certain rare situations the automated vehicle cannot resolve. Teleoperation
therefore has the potential to expand the operational design domain and
increase the availability of automated vehicles. This is especially relevant
for concepts with no backup driver inside the vehicle. While teleoperation
resolves certain issues an automated vehicle will face, it introduces new
challenges in terms of safety requirements. While safety and regulatory
approval is a major research topic in the area of automated vehicles, it is
rarely discussed in the context of teleoperated road vehicles. The focus of
this paper is to systematically analyze the potential hazards of teleoperation
systems. An appropriate hazard analysis method (STPA) is chosen from literature
and applied to the system at hand. The hazard analysis is an essential part in
developing a safety concept (e.g., according to ISO26262) and thus far has not
been discussed for teleoperated road vehicles.

large disparity and the non-Lambertian effect. Typical approaches either
address the large disparity challenge using depth estimation followed by view
synthesis or eschew explicit depth information to enable non-Lambertian
rendering, but rarely solve both challenges in a unified framework. In this
paper, we revisit the classic LF rendering framework to address both challenges
by incorporating it with advanced deep learning techniques. First, we
analytically show that the essential issue behind the large disparity and
non-Lambertian challenges is the aliasing problem. Classic LF rendering
approaches typically mitigate the aliasing with a reconstruction filter in the
Fourier domain, which is, however, intractable to implement within a deep
learning pipeline. Instead, we introduce an alternative framework to perform
anti-aliasing reconstruction in the image domain and analytically show
comparable efficacy on the aliasing issue. To explore the full potential, we
then embed the anti-aliasing framework into a deep neural network through the
design of an integrated architecture and trainable parameters. The network is
trained through end-to-end optimization using a peculiar training set,
including regular LFs and unstructured LFs. The proposed deep learning pipeline
shows a substantial superiority in solving both the large disparity and the
non-Lambertian challenges compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. In
addition to the view interpolation for an LF, we also show that the proposed
pipeline also benefits light field view extrapolation.

  Modeling","14 pages, 7 figures, submit to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of two-dimensional (2-D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation
for the L-shaped nested array is considered. Typically, the multi-dimensional
structure of the received signal in co-array domain is ignored in the problem
considered. Moreover, the cross term generated by the correlated signal and
noise components degrades the 2-D DOA estimation performance seriously. To
tackle these issues, an iterative 2-D DOA estimation approach based on tensor
modeling is proposed. To develop such approach, a higher-order tensor is
constructed, whose factor matrices contain the sources azimuth and elevation
information. By exploiting the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a
computationally efficient tensor decomposition method is then developed to
estimate the sources DOA information in each dimension independently. The
pair-matching of the azimuth and elevation angles is conducted via the
cross-correlation matrix (CCM) of the received signals. An iterative method is
further designed to improve the DOA estimation performance. Specifically, the
cross term is estimated and removed in the next step of such iterative
procedure on the basis of the DOA estimates originated from the tensor
decomposition in the previous step. As a consequence, the DOA estimation with
better accuracy and higher resolution is obtained. The proposed iterative 2-D
DOA estimation method for the L-shaped nested array can resolve more sources
than the number of real elements, which is superior to conventional approaches.
Simulation results validate the performance improvement of the proposed 2-D DOA
estimation method as compared to existing state-of-the-art DOA estimation
techniques for the L-shaped nested array.

is to investigate the spectral formation in the neutron star atmosphere at low
$\dot{M}$ and to conduct a parameter study of physical properties of the
emitting region. We obtain the structure of the static atmosphere, assuming
that Coulomb collisions are the dominant deceleration process. The upper part
of the atmosphere is strongly heated by the braking plasma, reaching
temperatures of 30-40 keV, while its denser isothermal interior is much cooler
(~2 keV). We numerically solve the polarized radiative transfer in the
atmosphere with magnetic Compton scattering, free-free processes, and
non-thermal cyclotron emission due to possible collisional excitations of
electrons. The strongly polarized emitted spectrum has a double-hump shape that
is observed in low-luminosity X-ray pulsars. A low-energy ""thermal"" component
is dominated by extraordinary photons that can leave the atmosphere from deeper
layers due to their long mean free path at soft energies. We find that a
high-energy component is formed due to resonant Comptonization in the heated
non-isothermal part of the atmosphere even in the absence of collisional
excitations. The latter, however, affect the ratio of the two components. A
strong cyclotron line originates from the optically thin, uppermost zone. A fit
of the model to NuSTAR and Swift/XRT observations of GX 304-1 provides an
accurate description of the data with reasonable parameters. The model can thus
reproduce the characteristic double-hump spectrum observed in low-luminosity
X-ray pulsars and provides insights into spectral formation.

form fractal dust aggregates. The geometric cross-section of these aggregates
is a crucial parameter characterizing aerodynamical friction, collision rates,
and opacities. However, numerical measurements of the cross-section are often
time-consuming as aggregates exhibit complex shapes. In this study, we derive a
novel analytic expression for geometric cross-sections of fractal aggregates.
If an aggregate consists of $N$ monomers of radius $R_0$, its geometric
cross-section $G$ is expressed as \begin{equation} \frac{G}{N\pi
R_0^2}=\frac{A}{1+(N-1)\tilde{\sigma}}, \nonumber
  \end{equation} where $\tilde{\sigma}$ is an overlapping efficiency, and $A$
is a numerical factor connecting the analytic expression to the small
non-fractal cluster limit. The overlapping efficiency depends on the fractal
dimension, fractal prefactor, and $N$ of the aggregate, and its analytic
expression is derived as well. The analytic expressions successfully reproduce
numerically measured cross-sections of aggregates. We also find that our
expressions are compatible with the mean-field light scattering theory of
aggregates in the geometrical optics limit. The analytic expressions greatly
simplify an otherwise tedious calculation and will be useful in model
calculations of fractal grain growth in protoplanetary discs and planetary

and extended for the multi-link bus travel time problem. The uncertainty is
modeled directly as part of recurrent artificial neural networks, but using two
fundamentally different approaches: one based on Deep Quantile Regression (DQR)
and the other on Bayesian Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNN). Both models predict
multiple time steps into the future, but handle the time-dependent uncertainty
estimation differently. We present a sampling technique in order to aggregate
quantile estimates for link level travel time to yield the multi-link travel
time distribution needed for a vehicle to travel from its current position to a
specific downstream stop point or transfer site.
  To motivate the relevance of uncertainty-aware models in the domain, we focus
on the connection assurance application as a case study: An expert system to
determine whether a bus driver should hold and wait for a connecting service,
or break the connection and reduce its own delay. Our results show that the
DQR-model performs overall best for the 80%, 90% and 95% prediction intervals,
both for a 15 minute time horizon into the future (t + 1), but also for the 30
and 45 minutes time horizon (t + 2 and t + 3), with a constant, but very small
underestimation of the uncertainty interval (1-4 pp.). However, we also show,
that the BRNN model still can outperform the DQR for specific cases. Lastly, we
demonstrate how a simple decision support system can take advantage of our
uncertainty-aware travel time models to prioritize the difference in travel
time uncertainty for bus holding at strategic points, thus reducing the
introduced delay for the connection assurance application.

the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs boson is closely linked to
the mechanism that gives mass to the W and Z gauge bosons that mediate the weak

boson, present measurements at the Large Hadron Collider are focused on testing
the Higgs boson's couplings to other elementary particles, precision
measurements of the Higgs boson's properties and initial investigation of the
Higgs boson's self-interaction and shape of the Higgs potential. With the Higgs
boson mass of 125 GeV the vacuum sits very close to the border of stable and
metastable, which may be a hint to deeper physics beyond the Standard Model.
The Higgs potential also plays an important role in ideas about the
cosmological constant or dark energy that drives the accelerating expansion of
the Universe, the mysterious dark matter that comprises about 80% of the matter

this need to transfer local data by sharing model updates only. However, data
leakage still remains an issue. In this paper, we propose xMK-CKKS, a multi-key

collaboration between all participating devices is required. This scheme
prevents privacy leakage from publicly shared information in federated

the server. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the scheme preserves
model accuracy against traditional federated learning as well as secure
federated learning with homomorphic encryption (MK-CKKS, Paillier) and reduces
computational cost compared to Paillier based federated learning. The average

ImageNet or PASCAL VOC, neural networks have proven to be exceptionally
accurate in recognition tasks. However, state-of-the-art accuracy often comes
at a high computational price, requiring hardware acceleration to achieve
real-time performance, while use cases, such as smart cities, require images
from fixed cameras to be analyzed in real-time. Due to the amount of network
bandwidth these streams would generate, we cannot rely on offloading compute to
a centralized cloud. Thus, a distributed edge cloud is expected to process
images locally. However, the edge is, by nature, resource-constrained, which
puts a limit on the computational complexity that can execute. Yet, there is a
need for a meeting point between the edge and accurate real-time video
analytics. Specializing lightweight models on a per-camera basis may help but
it quickly becomes unfeasible as the number of cameras grows unless the process
is automated. In this paper, we present and evaluate COVA (Contextually
Optimized Video Analytics), a framework to assist in the automatic
specialization of models for video analytics in edge cameras. COVA
automatically improves the accuracy of lightweight models through their
specialization. Moreover, we discuss and review each step involved in the
process to understand the different trade-offs that each one entails.
Additionally, we show how the sole assumption of static cameras allows us to
make a series of considerations that greatly simplify the scope of the problem.
Finally, experiments show that state-of-the-art models, i.e., able to
generalize to unseen environments, can be effectively used as teachers to
tailor smaller networks to a specific context, boosting accuracy at a constant
computational cost. Results show that our COVA can automatically improve
accuracy of pre-trained models by an average of 21%.

dependency structure and pre-trained BERT embedding. The BERT embedding of each
word is reprocessed considering its specific dependencies and related words in
the sentence, to generate more effective semantic representation for TTS. To
better utilize the dependency structure, relational gated graph network (RGGN)
is introduced to make semantic information flow and aggregate through the
dependency structure. The experimental results show that the proposed method
can further improve the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speeches
on both Mandarin and English datasets.

formation. However, a direct link between exoplanets and disks remains hard to
identify. We present a large sample study of ALMA disk surveys of nearby
star-forming regions to disentangle this connection. All disks are classified
as either structured (transition, ring, extended) or non-structured (compact)
disks. Although low-resolution observations may not identify large scale
substructure, we assume that an extended disk must contain substructure from a
dust evolution argument. A comparison across ages reveals that structured disks
retain high dust masses up to at least 10 Myr, whereas the dust mass of
compact, non-structured disks decreases over time. This can be understood if
the dust mass evolves primarily by radial drift, unless drift is prevented by
pressure bumps. We identify a stellar mass dependence of the fraction of
structured disks. We propose a scenario linking this dependence with that of
giant exoplanet occurrence rates. We show that there are enough exoplanets to
account for the observed disk structures if transitional disks are created by
exoplanets more massive than Jupiter, and ring disks by exoplanets more massive
than Neptune, under the assumption that most of those planets eventually
migrate inwards. On the other hand, the known anti-correlation between
transiting super-Earths and stellar mass implies those planets must form in the
disks without observed structure, consistent with formation through pebble
accretion in drift-dominated disks. These findings support an evolutionary
scenario where the early formation of giant planets determines the disk's dust
evolution and its observational appearance.

we gather evidence that shows this is a consequence of the moving nature of the
OA status. Therefore these figures should be seen as a snapshot rather than

according to the publication type, the publisher and the discipline (more than
60% in Mathematics while it is about 30% in Medical research which represents
the largest share in the number of publications). We describe the main
challenges of our method (detection of the publications with a French

evaluate the errors of each step. Most of the method is not country-specific

Borisov - have been discovered. Large quantities of planetesimals form as a
by-product of planet formation. Therefore, it seems likely that ISOs are former
planetesimals that became unbound from their parent star. The discoveries raise
the question of the dominant ISO formation process. Here, we concentrate on
planetesimals released during another star's close flybys. We quantify the
amount of planetesimals released during close stellar flybys, their ejection
velocity and likely composition. We study the dependence of the effect of
parabolic flybys on the mass ratio between the perturber and parent star, the
periastron distance, inclination, and angle of periastron. Whenever ISOs are
produced, they leave their parent system typically with velocities of 0.5-2
km/s. This ejection velocity is distinctly different to that of ISOs produced
by planet scattering (4-8 km/s) and those shed during the stellar
post-main-sequence phase 0.1-0.2 km/s). Using the typical disc truncation
radius in various cluster environments, we find that clusters like the Orion
nebula cluster are likely to produce the equivalent of 0.85 Earth-masses of
ISOs per star. In contrast, clusters like NGC 3603 could produce up to 50
Earth-masses of ISOs per star. Our solar system probably produced the
equivalent of 2-3 Earth masses of ISOs, which left our solar system at a mean
ejection velocity of 0.7 km/s. Most ISOs produced by flybys should be
comet-like, similar to Borisov. ISOs originating from compact long-lived
clusters would often show a deficiency in CO. As soon as a statistically
significant sample of ISOs is discovered, the combined information of their
observed velocities and composition might help in constraining the dominant
production process (abridged).

properties of distinct chemical reservoirs in the lunar mantle that formed
during the early evolution of the Moon. We use a combination of phase
equilibria models consistent with experimental results on lunar magma ocean
crystallization to study the effect of bulk silicate Moon composition on the
properties of lunar mantle reservoirs. We find that the densities and relative
proportions of these mantle reservoirs, in particular of the late forming
ilmenite bearing cumulates (IBC), strongly depend on the FeO content of the
bulk silicate Moon. This relation has implications for post-magma ocean mantle
dynamics and the mass distribution in the lunar interior, because the dense IBC
form at shallow depths but tend to sink towards the core mantle boundary. We
quantify the relations between bulk silicate Moon FeO content, IBC thickness
and bulk Moon density as well as mantle stratigraphy and bulk silicate Moon
moment of inertia to constrain the bulk silicate Moon FeO content and the
efficiency of IBC sinking. In combination with seismic and selenodetic
constraints on mantle stratigraphy, core radius, extent of the low velocity
zone at the core mantle boundary, considerations about the present day
selenotherm and the effects of reservoir mixing by convection our model
indicates that the bulk silicate Moon is only moderately enriched in FeO
compared to the Earths mantle and contains about 9.4 - 10.9 weight percent FeO
(with a lowermost limit of 8.3 weight percent and an uppermost limit of 11.9
weight percent). We also conclude that the observed bulk silicate Moon moment
of inertia requires incomplete sinking of the IBC layer by mantle convection:
only 20 - 60 percent of the IBC material might have reached the core mantle
boundary, while the rest either remained at the depth of origin or was mixed

query point to a canonical space via learned linear blend skinning (LBS)

manifolds, making them interesting playgrounds for the study of quantum phases
not realized by symmetry breaking. In particular they are known to support
anyons of an even richer variety than the two-dimensional space. We explore
this possibility by building a class of frustration-free and gapped
Hamiltonians based on discrete abelian gauge groups. The resulting models have
a ground state degeneracy that can be either a topological invariant, an
extensive quantity or a mixture of the two. For two basis of the degenerate
ground states which are complementary in quantum theory, the entanglement
entropy is exactly computed. The result for one basis has a constant global
term, known as the topological entanglement entropy, implying long-range
entanglement. On the other hand, the topological entanglement entropy vanishes
in the result for the other basis. Comparisons are made with similar
occurrences in the toric code. We analyze excitations and identify anyon-like
excitations that account for the topological entanglement entropy. An analogy
between the ground states of this system and the $\theta$-vacuum for a $U(1)$
gauge theory on a circle is also drawn.

Brookhaven and Fermilab show a difference with the SM prediction $\delta a_\mu
= (251 \pm 59) \times 10^{-11}$ at a significance of $4.2\sigma$, strongly
indicating the presence of new physics. Motivated by this new result we
reexamine the contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment from both:
(i)~the ubiquitous $U(1)$ gauge bosons of D-brane string theory constructions
and (ii)~the Regge excitations of the string. We show that, for a string scale
${\cal O} ({\rm PeV})$, the contribution from anomalous $U(1)$ gauge bosons
which couple to hadrons could help to reduce (though not fully eliminate) the
discrepancy reported by the Muon $g-2$ Collaboration. Consistency with null
results from LHC searches of new heavy vector bosons imparts the dominant
constraint. We demonstrate that the contribution from Regge excitations is
strongly suppressed as it was previously conjectured. We also comment on
contributions from Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes, which could help resolve the
$\delta a_\mu$ discrepancy. In particular, we argue that for 4-stack
intersecting D-brane models, the KK excitations of the $U(1)$ boson living on
the lepton brane would not couple to hadrons and therefore can evade the LHC
bounds while fully bridging the $\delta a_\mu$ gap observed at Brookhaven and
Fermilab.

However, prevention of a new infectious disease by vaccination or
pharmaceuticals is made difficult by the slow process of vaccine and drug
development. We propose an additional intervention that allows rapid control of
emerging infectious diseases, and can also be used to eradicate diseases that
rely almost exclusively on human-to-human transmission. The intervention is
based on (1) testing every individual for the disease, (2) repeatedly, and (3)
isolation of infected individuals. We show here that at a sufficient rate of
testing, the reproduction number is reduced below 1.0 and the epidemic will
rapidly collapse. The approach does not rely on strong or unrealistic
assumptions about test accuracy, isolation compliance, population structure or
epidemiological parameters, and its success can be monitored in real time by
following the test positivity rate. In addition to the compliance rate and
false negatives, the required rate of testing depends on the design of the
testing regime, with concurrent testing outperforming random sampling. Provided
that results are obtained rapidly, the test frequency required to suppress an
epidemic is monotonic and near-linear with respect to R0, the infectious
period, and the fraction of susceptible individuals. The testing regime is
effective against both early phase and established epidemics, and additive to
other interventions (e.g. contact tracing and social distancing). It is also
robust to failure: any rate of testing reduces the number of infections,
improving both public health and economic conditions. These conclusions are
based on rigorous analysis and simulations of appropriate epidemiological
models. A mass-produced, disposable test that could be used at home would be
ideal, due to the optimal performance of concurrent tests that return immediate
results.

particular, a well-known model which describes the fluctuations of a continuum
elastic medium embedded in a higher-dimensional space. In this theory, the
renormalization group flow connects a non-interacting ultraviolet fixed point,
where the theory is controlled by linear elasticity, to an interacting infrared
fixed point. By studying the structure of correlation functions and of the
energy-momentum tensor, we show that, in the infrared, the theory is only
scale-invariant: the dilatation symmetry is not enhanced to full conformal
invariance. The model is shown to present a non-vanishing virial current which,
despite being non-conserved, maintains a scaling dimension exactly equal to $D
- 1$, even in presence of interactions. We attribute the absence of anomalous
dimensions to the symmetries of the model under translations and rotations in
the embedding space, which are realized as shifts of phonon fields, and which
protect the renormalization of several non-invariant operators. We also note
that closure of a symmetry algebra with both shift symmetries and conformal
invariance would require, in the hypothesis that phonons transform as primary
fields, the presence of new shift symmetries which are not expected to hold on
physical grounds. We then consider an alternative model, involving only scalar
fields, which describes effective phonon-mediated interactions between local
Gaussian curvatures. The model is described in the ultraviolet by two copies of
the biharmonic theory, which is conformal, but flows in the infrared to a fixed
point which we argue to be only dilatation-invariant.

model of trapping sets (TSs) which incorporates the layered nature of
scheduling. We demonstrate that the contribution of each TS to the error floor
is not only a function of the topology of the TS, but also depends on the row
layers in which different check nodes of the TS are located. This information,
referred to as TS layer profile (TSLP), plays an important role in the
harmfulness of a TS. As a result, the harmfulness of a TS in particular, and
the error floor of the code in general, can significantly change by changing
the order in which the information of different layers, corresponding to
different row blocks of the parity-check matrix, is updated. We also study the
problem of finding a layer ordering that minimizes the error floor, and obtain
row layered decoders with error floor significantly lower than that of their
flooding counterparts. As part of our analysis, we make connections between the

suppose that T is stochastically dependent on the censoring time C. We are
interested in the marginal distribution of T. This situation is often
encountered in practice. Consider for instance the case where T is the time to
death of a patient suffering from a certain disease. Then, the censoring time C
is for instance the time until the person leaves the study or the time until
he/she dies from another disease. If the reason for leaving the study is
related to the health condition of the patient or if he/she dies from a disease

relationship between T and C, and on parametric marginal distributions for T

parameter defining the copula function is known. We give sufficient conditions
on these parametric copula and marginals under which the bivariate distribution
of (T;C) is identifed. These sufficient conditions are then checked for a wide
range of common copulas and marginal distributions. We also study the
estimation of the model, and carry out extensive simulations and the analysis

With supplementary files",,,,"cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Modern media data such as 360 videos and light field (LF) images are
typically captured in much higher dimensions than the observers' visual
displays. To efficiently browse high-dimensional media over
bandwidth-constrained networks, a navigational streaming model is considered: a
client navigates the large media space by dictating a navigation path to a
server, who in response transmits the corresponding pre-encoded media data
units (MDU) to the client one-by-one in sequence. Intra-coding an MDU (I-MDU)
would result in a large bitrate but I-MDU can be randomly accessed, while
inter-coding an MDU (P-MDU) using another MDU as a predictor incurs a small
coding cost but imposes an order where the predictor must be first transmitted
and decoded. From a compression perspective, the technical challenge is: how to
achieve coding gain via inter-coding of MDUs, while enabling adequate random
access for satisfactory user navigation. To address this problem, we propose
landmarks, a selection of key MDUs from the high-dimensional media. Using
landmarks as predictors, nearby MDUs in local neighborhoods are intercoded,
resulting in a predictive MDU structure with controlled coding cost. It means
that any requested MDU can be decoded by at most transmitting a landmark and an
inter-coded MDU, enabling navigational random access. To build a landmarked MDU
structure, we employ tree-structured vector quantizer (TSVQ) to first optimize
landmark locations, then iteratively add/remove inter-coded MDUs as refinements
using a fast branch-and-bound technique. Taking interactive LF images and
viewport adaptive 360 images as illustrative applications, and I-, P- and
previously proposed merge frames to intra- and inter-code MDUs, we show
experimentally that landmarked MDU structures can noticeably reduce the
expected transmission cost compared with MDU structures without landmarks.

by X-rays has been proposed to influence the water abundances in these regions,
but the detailed chemistry, including the nature of alternative oxygen
carriers, is not yet understood. In this study, we aim to understand the impact
of X-rays on the composition of low-mass protostellar envelopes, focusing
specifically on water and related oxygen bearing species. We compute the
chemical composition of two low-mass protostellar envelopes using a 1D
gas-grain chemical reaction network, under various X-ray field strengths.
According to our calculations, outside the water snowline, the water gas
abundance increases with $L_{\mathrm{X}}$. Inside the water snowline, water
maintains a high abundance of $\sim 10^{-4}$ for small $L_{\mathrm{X}}$, with
water and CO being the dominant oxygen carriers. For large $L_{\mathrm{X}}$,
the water gas abundances significantly decrease just inside the water snowline
(down to $\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}$) and in the innermost regions ($\sim10^{-6}$).
For these cases, the O$_{2}$ and O gas abundances reach $\sim 10^{-4}$ within
the water snowline, and they become the dominant oxygen carriers. The HCO$^{+}$
and CH$_{3}$OH abundances, which have been used as tracers of the water
snowline, significantly increase/decrease within the water snowline,
respectively, as the X-ray fluxes become larger. The abundances of some other
dominant molecules, such as CO$_{2}$, OH, CH$_{4}$, HCN, and NH$_{3}$, are also
affected by strong X-ray fields, especially within their own snowlines. These
X-ray effects are larger in lower density envelope models. Future observations
of water and related molecules (using e.g., ALMA and ngVLA) will access the
regions around protostars where such X-ray induced chemistry is effective.

corresponding single-mass dynamical models, this technique ultimately provides
self-consistent total mass and $M/L_V$ estimates for each cluster. Mean

acceptable levels by limiting the neutron and gamma fluxes. The shield
materials compared are W2B, WB, W2B5 and WB4 along with a reactively sintered
boride B0.329C0.074Cr0.024Fe0.274W0.299, monolithic W and WC. Of all these W2B5
gave the most favourable results with a factor of ~10 or greater reduction in
neutron flux and gamma energy deposition as compared to monolithic W. These
results are compared with layered water-cooled shields, giving the result that
the monolithic shields, with moderating boron, gave comparable neutron flux and
power deposition, and (in the case of W2B5) even better performance. Good
performance without water-coolant has advantages from a reactor safety
perspective due to the risks associated with radio-activation of oxygen. 10B
isotope concentrations between 0 and 100% are considered for the boride
shields. The naturally occurring 20% fraction gave much lower energy
depositions than the 0% fraction, but the improvement largely saturated beyond
40%. Thermophysical properties of the candidate materials are discussed, in
particular the thermal strain. To our knowledge, the performance of W2B5 is
unrivalled by other monolithic shielding materials. This is partly as its
trigonal crystal structure gives it higher atomic density compared with other

mainly focusing on the progress in understanding their magnetic, electronic,
and polar properties during the last two decades. Many spinel compounds are
magnetic insulators or semiconductors; however, a number of spinel-type metals
exists including superconductors and some rare examples of d-derived
heavy-fermion compounds. In the early days, they gained importance as
ferrimagnetic or even ferromagnetic insulators with relatively high saturation
magnetization and high ordering temperatures, with magnetite being the first
magnetic mineral known to mankind. However, spinels played an outstanding role
in the development of concepts of magnetism, in testing and verifying the
fundamentals of magnetic exchange, in understanding orbital-ordering and
charge-ordering phenomena. In addition, the A- site as well as the B-site
cations in the spinel structure form lattices prone to strong frustration
effects resulting in exotic ground-state properties. In case the A-site cation
is Jahn-Teller active, additional entanglements of spin and orbital degrees of
freedom appear, which can give rise to a spin-orbital liquid or an orbital
glass state. The B-site cations form a pyrochlore lattice, one of the strongest
contenders of frustration in three dimensions. In addition, in spinels with
both cation lattices carrying magnetic moments, competing magnetic exchange
interactions become important, yielding ground states like the time-honoured
triangular Yafet-Kittel structure. Finally, yet importantly, there exists a
long-standing dispute about the possibility of a polar ground state in spinels,
despite their reported overall cubic symmetry. Indeed, over the years number of
multiferroic spinels were identified.

symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). The method is applicable to
noncovalent interactions between monomers which require a multiconfigurational
description, in particular when the interacting system is strongly correlated
or in an electronically excited state. SAPT(MC) is based on one- and
two-particle reduced density matrices of the monomers and assumes the
single-exchange approximation for the exchange energy contributions.
Second-order terms are expressed through response properties from extended
random phase approximation (ERPA) equations. SAPT(MC) is applied either with
generalized valence bond perfect pairing (GVB) or with complete active space
self consistent field (CASSCF) treatment of the monomers. We discuss two model
multireference systems: the H2-H2 dimer in out-of-equilibrium geometries and
interaction between the argon atom and excited state of ethylene. In both cases
SAPT(MC) closely reproduces benchmark results. Using the C2H4-Ar complex as an
example, we examine second-order terms arising from negative transitions in the
linear response function of an excited monomer. We demonstrate that the
negative-transition terms must be accounted for to ensure qualitative
prediction of induction and dispersion energies and develop a procedure
allowing for their computation. Factors limiting the accuracy of SAPT(MC) are
discussed in comparison with other second-order SAPT schemes on a data set of
small single-reference dimers.

optimization problem to reduce cycle skipping in full-waveform inversion (FWI).
WRI often requires expensive matrix inversions to reconstruct frequency-domain
wavefields. Physics-informed neural network (PINN) uses the underlying physical
laws as loss functions to train the neural network (NN), and it has shown its
effectiveness in solving the Helmholtz equation and generating Green's
functions, specifically for the scattered wavefield. By including a
data-constrained term in the loss function, the trained NN can reconstruct a
wavefield that simultaneously fits the recorded data and satisfies the
Helmholtz equation for a given initial velocity model. Using the predicted
wavefields, we rely on a small-size NN to predict the velocity using the
reconstructed wavefield. In this velocity prediction NN, spatial coordinates
are used as input data to the network and the scattered Helmholtz equation is
used to define the loss function. After we train this network, we are able to
predict the velocity in the domain of interest. We develop this PINN-based WRI
method and demonstrate its potential using a part of the Sigsbee2A model and a
modified Marmousi model. The results show that the PINN-based WRI is able to
invert for a reasonable velocity with very limited iterations and frequencies,
which can be used in a subsequent FWI application.

Dual forms turn out to be much simpler than their Feynman counterparts: they

they provide a systematic approach to generalized unitarity, the reconstruction

sequence-to-sequence (S2S) model-based voice conversion (VC) methods. S2S
model-based VC methods have attracted particular attention in recent years for
their flexibility in converting not only the voice identity but also the pitch
contour and local duration of input speech, thanks to the ability of the
encoder-decoder architecture with the attention mechanism. However, one of the
obstacles to making these methods work in real-time is the autoregressive (AR)
structure. To overcome this obstacle, we develop a method to obtain a model
that is free from an AR structure and behaves similarly to the original S2S
models, based on a teacher-student learning framework. In our method, called
""FastS2S-VC"", the student model consists of encoder, decoder, and attention
predictor. The attention predictor learns to predict attention distributions
solely from source speech along with a target class index with the guidance of
those predicted by the teacher model from both source and target speech. Thanks
to this structure, the model is freed from an AR structure and allows for
parallelization. Furthermore, we show that FastS2S-VC is suitable for real-time
implementation based on a sliding-window approach, and describe how to make it
run in real-time. Through speaker-identity and emotional-expression conversion
experiments, we confirmed that FastS2S-VC was able to speed up the conversion
process by 70 to 100 times compared to the original AR-type S2S-VC methods,
without significantly degrading the audio quality and similarity to target
speech. We also confirmed that the real-time version of FastS2S-VC can be run
with a latency of 32 ms when run on a GPU.

achieve this by extracting semantically related words from pre-trained word

The surprise announcement came in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which
caused a transient drop in China's emissions in the first half of 2020. Here,
we show an unprecedented de-carbonization of China's power system in late 2020:
although China's power related carbon emissions were 0.5% higher in 2020 than
2019, the majority (92.9%) of the increased power demand was met by increases
in low-carbon (renewables and nuclear) generation (increased by 9.3%), as
compared to only 0.4% increase for fossil fuels. China's low-carbon generation
in the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of
36.7% (increased by 1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when
the fossil production dropped to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the
carbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of
519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020. If the fast decarbonization and slowed down power
demand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030, over half (50.8%) of

the known fundamental particles, arises from the symmetric theory of fermions
proposed by Ettore Majorana in 1937. Given the profound consequences of such
Majorana neutrinos, among which is a potential explanation for the
matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis, the Majorana
nature of neutrinos commands intense experimental scrutiny globally; one of the
primary experimental probes is neutrinoless double beta ($0 \nu \beta \beta$)
decay. Here we show results from the search for $0 \nu \beta \beta$ decay of
$^{130}$Te, using the latest advanced cryogenic calorimeters with the CUORE
experiment. CUORE, operating just 10 millikelvin above absolute zero, has
pushed the state of the art on three frontiers: the sheer mass held at such
ultra-low temperatures, operational longevity, and the low levels of ionising
radiation emanating from the cryogenic infrastructure. We find no evidence for
$0 \nu \beta \beta$ decay and set a lower bound of $T_{1/2}^{0 \nu} > 2.2
\times 10^{25}$ years at a 90% credibility interval. We discuss potential
applications of the advances made with CUORE to other fields such as direct
dark matter, neutrino and nuclear physics searches and large-scale quantum
computing, which can benefit from sustained operation of large payloads in a
low-radioactivity, ultra-low temperature cryogenic environment.

to the relationship between the Boltzmann hierarchy and Boltzmann equation,
this spectral hierarchy admits a special class of factorized solutions, where
each factor is a solution to the wave kinetic equation (WKE). A question left
open by these works and highly relevant for the mathematical derivation of the
WKE is whether solutions of the spectral hierarchy are unique, in particular
whether factorized initial data necessarily lead to factorized solutions. In
this article, we affirmatively answer this question in the case of 4-wave

well-posed in an appropriate function space. Our proof draws on work of Chen

that the existing confidence intervals may undercover when the valid and

this, we construct uniformly valid confidence intervals that are robust to the
mistakes in separating valid and invalid instruments. We propose to search for
a range of treatment effect values that lead to sufficiently many valid

searching, leads to a more precise confidence interval. Our proposed searching

parametric length under the finite-sample majority and plurality rules. We
apply our proposal to examine the effect of education on earnings. The proposed

pleasant urban environment with slower motorized movement, smoother traffic,
and less congestion. In the foreseeable future, shared spaces will be populated
with a mixture of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs)
like pedestrians and cyclists. However, a driver-less AV lacks a way to
communicate with the VRUs when they have to reach an agreement of a
negotiation, which brings new challenges to the safety and smoothness of the
traffic. To find a feasible solution to integrating AVs seamlessly into
shared-space traffic, we first identified the possible issues that the
shared-space designs have not considered for the role of AVs. Then an online
questionnaire was used to ask participants about how they would like a driver
of the manually driving vehicle to communicate with VRUs in a shared space. We
found that when the driver wanted to give some suggestions to the VRUs in a
negotiation, participants thought that the communications via the driver's body
behaviors were necessary. Besides, when the driver conveyed information about
her/his intentions and cautions to the VRUs, participants selected different
communication methods with respect to their transport modes (as a driver,
pedestrian, or cyclist). These results suggest that novel eHMIs might be useful
for AV-VRU communication when the original drivers are not present. Hence, a
potential eHMI design concept was proposed for different VRUs to meet their
various expectations. In the end, we further discussed the effects of the eHMIs
on improving the sociality in shared spaces and the autonomous driving systems.

X-rays passing through an object. The goal is to reconstruct the linear
attenuation coefficient of the object's interior. For each position of the

system, one measures a set of data referred to as a view. A common assumption
is that these view angles are known, but in some applications they are known
with imprecision. We propose a framework to solve a Bayesian inverse problem
that jointly estimates the view angles and an image of the object's attenuation

associated conditional densities are simulated using different sampling schemes
- hence the term hybrid. In particular, the conditional distribution associated
with the reconstruction is nonlinear in the image pixels, non-Gaussian and
high-dimensional. We approach this distribution by constructing a Laplace

In contrast to the traditional RL objective, safe exploration considers the

cost returns. We introduce a model-based safe exploration algorithm for
constrained high-dimensional control to address the often prohibitively high
sample complexity of model-free safe exploration algorithms. Further, we
provide theoretical and empirical analyses regarding the implications of
model-usage on constrained policy optimization problems and introduce a
practical algorithm that accelerates policy search with model-generated data.
The need for accurate estimates of a policy's constraint satisfaction is in
conflict with accumulating model-errors. We address this issue by quantifying
model-uncertainty as the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between
predictions of an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models and constrain this
error-measure, resulting in an adaptive resampling scheme and dynamically
limited rollout horizons. We evaluate this approach on several simulated

previous studies typically generate pseudo-ground truth for evaluation.
However, our investigation reveals that the evaluation protocol proposed by

tool used for entity matching is very noisy, while the ignorance of event
argument for event evaluation leads to boosted performance. In this work, we
propose a light yet practical entity and event salience estimation evaluation
protocol, which incorporates the more reliable syntactic dependency parser.
Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis among popular entity and event

capture the interactions of entities and events. The empirical results show

constraints on cosmology from cluster abundances are currently limited by
systematics in their inferred masses. One unmitigated systematic effect in
weak-lensing mass inference is ignoring the presence of baryons and treating
the entire cluster as a dark matter halo. In this work we present a new
flexible model for cluster densities that captures both the baryonic and dark
matter profiles, a new general technique for calculating the lensing signal of
an arbitrary density profile, and a methodology for stacking those lensing
signal to appropriately model stacked weak-lensing measurements of galaxy
cluster catalogues. We test this model on 1400 simulated clusters. Similarly to
previous studies, we find that a dark matter-only model overestimates the
average mass by $7.5\%$, but including our baryonic term reduces that to
$0.7\%$. Additionally, to mitigate the computational complexity of our model,
we construct an emulator (surrogate model) which accurately interpolates our
model for parameter inference, while being much faster to use than the raw
model. We also provide an open-source software framework for our model and
emulator, called maszcal, which will serve as a platform for continued efforts
to improve these mass-calibration techniques. In this work, we detail our

validate that our model does mitigate bias. Lastly, we describe tests of the

complicate guaranteeing the demanded response time. To guarantee an optimal

edge) to a one-dimensional continuum with a van Hove singularity in the density
of states, we demonstrate general conditions such that a characteristic triple
level convergence occurs directly on the threshold as the coupling $g$ is shut
off. For small $g$ values the eigenvalue and norm of each of these states can
be expanded in a Puiseux expansion in terms of powers of $g^{2/3}$, which
suggests the influence of a third-order exceptional point. However, in the
actual $g \rightarrow 0$ limit, only two discrete states in fact coalesce as
the system can be reduced to a $2 \times 2$ Jordan block; the third state
instead merges with the continuum. Moreover, the decay width of the resonance
state involved in this convergence is significantly enhanced compared to the
usual Fermi golden rule, which is consistent with the Purcell effect. However,
non-Markovian dynamics due to the branch-point effect are also enhanced near
the threshold. Applying a perturbative analysis in terms of the Puiseux
expansion that takes into account the threshold influence, we show that the
combination of these effects results in quantum emitter decay of the unusual
form $1 - C t^{3/2}$ on the key timescale during which most of the decay
occurs. We then present two conditions that must be satisfied at the threshold
for the anomalous exceptional point to occur: the density of states must
contain an inverse square-root divergence and the potential must be
non-singular. We further show that when the energy of the quantum emitter is
detuned from threshold, the anomalous exceptional point splits into three
ordinary exceptional points, two of which appear in the complex-extended
parameter space. These results provide deeper insight into a well-known problem
in spontaneous decay at a photonic band edge.

Networks (CNN) to time series problems including classification, however not
yet to outcome prediction. The purpose of this paper is to close this gap and
compare CNNs to LSTMs. Attention is another technique that, in combination with
LSTMs, has found application in time series classification and was included in
our research. Our findings show that all these neural networks achieve
satisfactory to high predictive power provided sufficiently large datasets.
CNNs perfom on par with LSTMs; the Attention mechanism adds no value to the
latter. Since CNNs run one order of magnitude faster than both types of LSTM,
their use is preferable. All models are robust with respect to their
hyperparameters and achieve their maximal predictive power early on in the
cases, usually after only a few events, making them highly suitable for runtime
predictions. We argue that CNNs' speed, early predictive power and robustness
should pave the way for their application in process outcome prediction.

single scene with a neural network and require dense multi-view inputs. Testing
on a new scene requires re-training from scratch, which takes 2-3 days. In this
work, we introduce Stereo Radiance Fields (SRF), a neural view synthesis
approach that is trained end-to-end, generalizes to new scenes, and requires
only sparse views at test time. The core idea is a neural architecture inspired
by classical multi-view stereo methods, which estimates surface points by
finding similar image regions in stereo images. In SRF, we predict color and
density for each 3D point given an encoding of its stereo correspondence in the
input images. The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wise
similarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learns
structure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of the
DTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10
sparse and spread-out views as input. We show that 10-15 minutes of fine-tuning
further improve the results, achieving significantly sharper, more detailed

differ considerably from those at macro-scales, mainly due to nonequilibrium

enhance with a decrease in the characteristic length-scale of the fluid flow or
the gas density, leading to the failure of the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier
(NSF) equations in predicting thermal and fluid flow fields. The direct
simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) method is employed in the present work to
investigate pressure-driven nitrogen flow in divergent microchannels with
various divergence angles and isothermal walls. The thermal fields obtained
from numerical simulations are analysed for different inlet-to-outlet pressure
ratios (1.5 $\leq \Pi \leq$ 2.5), tangential momentum accommodation
coefficients and Knudsen numbers (0.05 $\leq \mathrm{Kn} \leq$ 12.5), covering
slip to free-molecular rarefaction regimes. The thermal field in the
microchannel is predicted, heat-lines are visualised, and the physics of heat
transfer in the microchannel is discussed. Due to the rarefaction effects, the
direction of heat flow is largely opposite to that of the mass flow. However,
the interplay between thermal and pressure gradients, which are affected by
geometrical configurations of the microchannel and applied boundary conditions,
determines the net heat flow direction. Additionally, the occurrence of thermal
separation and cold-to-hot heat transfer (also known as anti-Fourier heat
transfer) in divergent microchannels is explained.

  for Bayesian inference","Additional results included in the appendix",,,,"cs.CL stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a bag-of-words model, the senses of a word with multiple meanings, e.g.
""bank"" (used either in a river-bank or an institution sense), are represented
as probability distributions over context words, and sense prevalence is
represented as a probability distribution over senses. Both of these may change
with time. Modelling and measuring this kind of sense change is challenging due
to the typically high-dimensional parameter space and sparse datasets. A
recently published corpus of ancient Greek texts contains expert-annotated
sense labels for selected target words. Automatic sense-annotation for the word
""kosmos"" (meaning decoration, order or world) has been used as a test case in
recent work with related generative models and Monte Carlo methods. We adapt an
existing generative sense change model to develop a simpler model for the main
effects of sense and time, and give MCMC methods for Bayesian inference on all
these models that are more efficient than existing methods. We carry out
automatic sense-annotation of snippets containing ""kosmos"" using our model, and
measure the time-evolution of its three senses and their prevalence. As far as
we are aware, ours is the first analysis of this data, within the class of
generative models we consider, that quantifies uncertainty and returns credible
sets for evolving sense prevalence in good agreement with those given by expert
annotation.

  SoCs: An Information-Theoretic Approach","To be published in proceedings DAC",,,,"cs.AR cs.DC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) are growing in their complexity and
heterogeneity (e.g., Arm's Big-Little architecture) to meet the needs of
emerging applications, including games and artificial intelligence. This makes
it very challenging to optimally manage the resources (e.g., controlling the
number and frequency of different types of cores) at runtime to meet the
desired trade-offs among multiple objectives such as performance and energy.
This paper proposes a novel information-theoretic framework referred to as
PaRMIS to create Pareto-optimal resource management policies for given target
applications and design objectives. PaRMIS specifies parametric policies to
manage resources and learns statistical models from candidate policy evaluation
data in the form of target design objective values. The key idea is to select a
candidate policy for evaluation in each iteration guided by statistical models
that maximize the information gain about the true Pareto front. Experiments on
a commercial heterogeneous SoC show that PaRMIS achieves better Pareto fronts
and is easily usable to optimize complex objectives (e.g., performance per
Watt) when compared to prior methods.

rank-one signal in unknown Gaussian noise, which was previously addressed for
the case of sufficient training data. We relax the above assumption to the case
of limited training data. We re-derive the corresponding generalized likelihood
ratio test (GLRT) and two-step GLRT (2S--GLRT) based on certain unitary
transformation on the test data. It is shown that the re-derived detectors can
work with low sample support. Moreover, in sample-abundant environments the
re-derived GLRT is the same as the previously proposed GLRT and the re-derived
2S--GLRT has better detection performance than the previously proposed
2S--GLRT. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the re-derived detectors.
