in the natural sciences and are used to model systems that combine reactions
with diffusive motion. However, rather than normal diffusion, anomalous
subdiffusion is observed in many systems and is especially prevalent in cell
biology. What are the reaction-subdiffusion equations describing a system that
involves first-order reactions and subdiffusive motion? In this paper, we
answer this question. We derive fractional reaction-subdiffusion equations
describing an arbitrary number of molecular species which react at first-order
rates and move subdiffusively with general space-dependent diffusivities and
drifts. Importantly, different species may have different diffusivities and
drifts, which contrasts previous approaches to this question which assume that
each species has the same movement dynamics. We derive the equations by
combining results on time-dependent fractional Fokker-Planck equations with
methods of analyzing stochastically switching evolution equations. Furthermore,
we construct the stochastic description of individual molecules whose
deterministic concentrations follow these reaction-subdiffusion equations. This
stochastic description involves subordinating a diffusion process whose
dynamics are controlled by a subordinated Markov jump process. We illustrate
our results in several examples and show that solutions of the
reaction-subdiffusion equations agree with stochastic simulations of individual
molecules.

homodyne detection obtains poor tolerance to excess noise and insufficient
transmission distance, hence seriously restricting the large-scale deployment
of quantum secure communication networks. In this paper, we propose a homodyne
detection protocol using the quadrature phase shift keying technique. By
limiting information leakage, our proposed protocol enhances excess noise
tolerance to a high level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that homodyne detection
performs better than heterodyne detection in quaternary-modulated
continuous-variable quantum key distribution under the untrusted detector noise
scenario. The security is analyzed using the tight numerical method against
collective attacks in the asymptotic regime. Our results imply that the current
protocol is able to distribute keys in nearly intercity area and thus paves the
way for constructing low-cost quantum secure communication networks.

behavior and be confident about that inference. Hence, trust is a necessary
condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). Despite its crucial role, it is
largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human interactions
with nonhuman artefacts. Here, we review the literature on trust, human-robot
interaction, human-robot collaboration, and human interaction at large. Early
models of trust suggest that trust entails a trade-off between benevolence and
competence, while studies of human-to-human interaction emphasize the role of
shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We then
introduce a model of trust as an agent's best explanation for reliable sensory
exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the
cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of
HRC, trust can be cast in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. In
this setting, interactive feedback becomes a necessary component of the
trustor's perception-action cycle. The resulting model has important
implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration, as it
allows the traditional determinants of human trust to be defined in terms of
active inference, information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model
suggests that boredom and surprise may be used as markers for under and
over-reliance on the system. Finally, we examine the role of shared behavior in
the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration,
suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of
human-robot collaborative systems.

the context of generalized quadratic theories of gravity to compare their

involves mainly the investigation of spatial distribution of grains and the
occurrence and characteristics of inclusions or precipitates. This work
presents an holistic artificial intelligence model for Anomaly Detection that
automatically quantifies the degree of anomaly of impurities in alloys. We
suggest the following examination process: (1) Deep semantic segmentation is
performed on the inclusions (based on a suitable metallographic database of
alloys and corresponding tags of inclusions), producing inclusions masks that
are saved into a separated database. (2) Deep image inpainting is performed to
fill the removed inclusions parts, resulting in 'clean' metallographic images,
which contain the background of grains. (3) Grains' boundaries are marked using
deep semantic segmentation (based on another metallographic database of
alloys), producing boundaries that are ready for further inspection on the
distribution of grains' size. (4) Deep anomaly detection and pattern
recognition is performed on the inclusions masks to determine spatial, shape
and area anomaly detection of the inclusions. Finally, the system recommends to
an expert on areas of interests for further examination. The performance of the
model is presented and analyzed based on few representative cases. Although the
models presented here were developed for metallography analysis, most of them

facilitation (anti-blockade) conditions which implements a so-called
kinetically constrained spin system. Here an atom can only be excited to a
Rydberg state when one of its neighbors is already excited. Once two or more
atoms are simultaneously excited mechanical forces emerge, which couple the
internal electronic dynamics of this many-body system to external vibrational
degrees of freedom in the lattice. This electron-phonon coupling results in a
so-called phonon dressing of many-body states which in turn impacts on the
facilitation dynamics. In our theoretical study we focus on a scenario in which
all energy scales are sufficiently separated such that a perturbative treatment
of the coupling between electronic and vibrational states is possible. This
allows to analytically derive an effective Hamiltonian for the evolution of
consecutive clusters of Rydberg excitations in the presence of phonon dressing.
We analyze the spectrum of this Hamiltonian and show -- by employing Fano
resonance theory -- that the interaction between Rydberg excitations and
lattice vibrations leads to the emergence of slowly decaying bound states that
inhibit fast relaxation of certain initial states.

Model, but can be sizable in some extended models. The current experimental
bounds on decay modes $\ell'^{\pm} \to a \ell^{\pm}$ are much weaker than the
other processes because of the huge irreducible backgrounds $\ell'^{\pm} \to
\ell^{\pm} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} \nu_{\ell'}$. In this paper, we study polarization
effects of both the signals and backgrounds. We find that signals and
backgrounds have distinctive polarization effects, and for the irreducible
backgrounds both longitudinal and transverse polarization effects survive when
the relative momentum of the two neutrinos are integrated out. At low energy
$e^+e^-$ collider, for instance the Belle II experiment, leptons are generated
in pair but with no net polarization. However, we show that polarization
correlation of the lepton pair is a useful observable for probing the signal.
More interestingly, the polarization correlation depends on product of scalar
and pseudo-scalar couplings, and hence are sensitive to their relative sign.
Because kinematical reconstruction or tagging is not necessary, number of the
available signal events increases significantly.

been recently discovered in several ULXs. However, it is yet unclear whether
the thickening of the disc or the wind variability causes the switch between
the classical soft and supersoft states observed in some ULXs. In order to
understand such phenomenology and the overall super-Eddington mechanism, we
undertook a large (800 ks) observing campaign with XMM-Newton to study NGC 247
ULX-1, which shifts between a supersoft and classical soft ULX state. The new
observations show unambiguous evidence of a wind in the form of emission and
absorption lines from highly-ionised ionic species, with the latter indicating
a mildly-relativistic outflow (-0.17c) in line with the detections in other
ULXs. Strong dipping activity is observed in the lightcurve and primarily
during the brightest observations, which is typical among soft ULXs, and
indicates a close relationship between the accretion rate and the appearance of
the dips. The latter is likely due to a thickening of the disc scale-height and
the wind as shown by a progressively increasing blueshift in the spectral
lines.

These layers are designed to solve the action recognition problem. The
first-layer growing grid receives the input data of human actions and the
neural map generates an action pattern vector representing each action sequence
by connecting the elicited activation of the trained map. The pattern vectors
are then sent to the ordered vector representation layer to build the
time-invariant input vectors of key activations for the second-layer growing
grid. The second-layer growing grid categorizes the input vectors to the
corresponding action clusters/sub-clusters and finally the one-layer supervised

to categorize the actions quickly and efficiently. The performance of the

Lett. 126,082301 (2021)}] used the
$(e,e'p)$ reaction on $^{12}$C to search for the effects of color transparency
(the absence of final state interactions). Color transparency was said to be
ruled out. The ability to observe the effects of color transparency depends on
the ability of a putative point-like-configuration (PLC), formed in a
high-momentum transfer coherent reaction, to escape the nucleus without
expanding its size. We study the expansion aspect of color transparency using
superconformal baryon-meson symmetry and light-front holographic QCD. A new
formalism is obtained and used to analyze the recent experiment. The resulting
conclusion is that effects of expansion would not be sufficiently significant
in causing final state interactions to occur. Therefore we conclude that a PLC
was not formed. This means that the Feynman mechanism involving virtual photon
absorption on a single high momentum quark is responsible for high momentum
electromagnetic form factor of the proton.

kinds of opinions: inherent and declared. Each agent's inherent opinion is
fixed and unobservable by the other agents. At each time step, agents broadcast
their declared opinions on a social network, which are governed by the agents'
inherent opinions and social pressure. In particular, we assume that agents may
declare opinions that are not aligned with their inherent opinions to conform
with their neighbors. This raises the natural question: Can we estimate the
agents' inherent opinions from observations of declared opinions? For example,
agents' inherent opinions may represent their true political alliances
(Democrat or Republican), while their declared opinions may model the political
inclinations of tweets on social media. In this context, we may seek to predict
the election results by observing voters' tweets, which do not necessarily
reflect their political support due to social pressure. We analyze this
question in the special case where the underlying social network is a complete

$N$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ denote by $K_N(f,\alpha)$ the arboreal field
$K(f^{-N}(\alpha))$ and by $D_N(f,\alpha)$ its degree over $K$.
  It is conjectured that $D_N(f,\alpha)$ should grow as a double exponential
function of $N$, unless $f$ is post-critically finite (PCF), in which case
there are examples like $D_N(x^2,\alpha) \leq 4^{N}$. There is evidence
conditionally on Vojta's conjecture. However, before the present work, no
unconditional non-trivial lower bound was known for post-critically infinite
$f$. In the case $f$ is PCF, no non-trivial lower bound was known, not even
under Vojta's conjecture.
  In this paper we give two simple methods that turn the finiteness of the
critical orbit into an exploitable feature, also in the post-critically
infinite case. First, assuming GRH for number fields, we establish for all PCF
polynomials $f$ of degree at least $2$ and all $\alpha$ outside of the critical
orbits of $f$, the existence of a positive constant $c(f,\alpha)$ such that
$$D_N(f,\alpha) \geq \text{exp}(c(f,\alpha)N), $$ for all $N$, which is sharp
up to, possibly, improve the constant $c(f,\alpha)$.
  Second, we show unconditionally that if $f$ is post-critically infinite over
any number field $K$ and unicritical, then, for each $\alpha$ in $K$, there
exists a positive constant $c(f,\alpha)$ such that $$D_N(f,\alpha) \geq
\text{exp}(c(f,\alpha)N), $$ for all $N$. The main input here is to work modulo
a suitably chosen prime and use a construction available for PCF unicritical
polynomials with periodic critical orbit.

activity. Gault is an asteroid belonging to the Phocaea dynamical family and
was not previously known to be active, nor was any other member of the Phocaea
family. In this work we present the results of photometric and spectroscopic
observations that commenced soon after the discovery of activity. We obtained
observations over two apparitions to monitor its activity, rotation period,
composition, and possible non-gravitational orbital evolution. We find that
Gault has a rotation period of $P = 2.4929 \pm 0.0003$ hours with a lightcurve
amplitude of $0.06$ magnitude. This short rotation period close to the spin
barrier limit is consistent with Gault having a density no smaller than $\rho =
1.85$~g/cm$^3$ and its activity being triggered by the YORP spin-up mechanism.
Analysis of the Gault phase curve over phase angles ranging from $0.4^{\circ}$
to $23.6^{\circ}$ provides an absolute magnitude of $H = 14.81 \pm 0.04$,
$G1=0.25 \pm 0.07$, and $G2= 0.38 \pm 0.04$. Model fits to the phase curve find
the surface regolith grain size constrained between 100-500 $\rm{\mu}$m. Using
relations between the phase curve and albedo we determine that the geometrical
albedo of Gault is $p_{\rm v} = 0.26 \pm 0.05$ corresponding to an equivalent
diameter of $D = 2.8^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ km. Our spectroscopic observations are all
consistent with an ordinary chondrite-like composition (S, or Q-type in the
Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classification). A search through archival photographic
plate surveys found previously unidentified detections of Gault dating back to
1957 and 1958. Only the latter had been digitized, which we measured to nearly
double the observation arc of Gault. Finally, we did not find any signal of
activity during the 2020 apparition or non-gravitational effects on its orbit.

conditions, even in its simplest version, which is the pole-dipole
approximation corresponding to a spinning test body. In particular, imposing a
spin supplementary condition (SSC) fixes the center of the mass of the spinning
body, i.e. the centroid of the body. In the present study, we examine whether
characteristic features of the centroid of a spinning test body, moving in a
circular equatorial orbit around a massive black hole, are preserved under the
transition to another centroid of the same physical body, governed by a
different SSC. For this purpose, we establish an analytical algorithm for
deriving the orbital frequency of a spinning body, moving in the background of
an arbitrary, stationary, axisymmetric spacetime with reflection symmetry, for
the Tulzcyjew-Dixon, the Mathisson-Pirani and the Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\'{a}k

series expansion method is developed, in order to investigate the discrepancies
in the orbital frequencies expanded in power series of the spin among the
different SSCs. Lastly, by employing the fact that the position of the centroid
and the measure of the spin alters under the centroid's transition, we impose
proper corrections to the power expansion of the orbital frequencies, which
allows to improve the convergence between the SSCs. Our concluding argument is
that when we shift from one circular equatorial orbit to another in the
Schwarzschild background, under the change of a SSC, the convergence between
the SSCs holds only up to certain powers in the spin expansion, and it cannot

than the layer size. In order to do this, the concept of fictitious tip stress
is first introduced for determining the fracture front location. In this
technique, an additional stress is applied to the tip element with the purpose
to suppress opening and to mimic width corresponding to the actual fracture
front location. A theoretical basis for this concept has been established and
it is further calibrated for piece-wise constant elements. Once the ability to
track the crack front location is developed, the effect of layers is included
by vary properties as a function of front location. Several numerical examples
benchmarking the numerical solution, as well as highlighting capabilities of
the algorithm to tackle multiple thin layers accurately are presented.

carefully skews the empirical transitions and perturbs the empirical costs with
an exploration bonus to induce an optimistic SSP problem whose associated value
iteration scheme is guaranteed to converge. We prove that EB-SSP achieves the
minimax regret rate $\tilde{O}(B_{\star} \sqrt{S A K})$, where $K$ is the
number of episodes, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions,
and $B_{\star}$ bounds the expected cumulative cost of the optimal policy from
any state, thus closing the gap with the lower bound. Interestingly, EB-SSP
obtains this result while being parameter-free, i.e., it does not require any
prior knowledge of $B_{\star}$, nor of $T_{\star}$, which bounds the expected
time-to-goal of the optimal policy from any state. Furthermore, we illustrate
various cases (e.g., positive costs, or general costs when an order-accurate
estimate of $T_{\star}$ is available) where the regret only contains a
logarithmic dependence on $T_{\star}$, thus yielding the first (nearly)
horizon-free regret bound beyond the finite-horizon MDP setting.

nature of the magnetic ground state in undoped infinite-layer nickelates was
still elusive. Here, we perform a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment
through 139La nuclei to study the intrinsic spin susceptibility of
infinite-layer LaNiO2. First, the signature for magnetic ordering or freezing
is absent in the 139La NMR spectrum down to 0.24 K, which unambiguously
confirms a paramagnetic ground state in LaNiO2. Second, a pseudogap-like
behavior instead of Curie-Weiss-like behavior is observed in both the
temperature-dependent Knight shift and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
(1/T1), which is widely observed in both underdoped cuprates and iron-based

considerable exchange interaction in infinite-layer nickelates, which sets a

increasing research interest in the last few years. Most of current researches
mainly deploy efforts to categorize an aerial image into one scene-level label,
while in real-world scenarios, there often exist multiple scenes in a single
image. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to take a step forward to a more
practical and challenging task, namely multi-scene recognition in single
images. Moreover, we note that manually yielding annotations for such a task is
extraordinarily time- and labor-consuming. To address this, we propose a
prototype-based memory network to recognize multiple scenes in a single image
by leveraging massive well-annotated single-scene images. The proposed network
consists of three key components: 1) a prototype learning module, 2) a
prototype-inhabiting external memory, and 3) a multi-head attention-based
memory retrieval module. To be more specific, we first learn the prototype
representation of each aerial scene from single-scene aerial image datasets and
store it in an external memory. Afterwards, a multi-head attention-based memory
retrieval module is devised to retrieve scene prototypes relevant to query
multi-scene images for final predictions. Notably, only a limited number of
annotated multi-scene images are needed in the training phase. To facilitate
the progress of aerial scene recognition, we produce a new multi-scene aerial
image (MAI) dataset. Experimental results on variant dataset configurations
demonstrate the effectiveness of our network. Our dataset and codes are
publicly available.

  Dexterous Manipulation Behaviors without Human Intervention","Published at ICRA 2021. First four authors contributed equally",,,,"cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can in principle acquire complex
robotic skills by learning from large amounts of data in the real world,
collected via trial and error. However, most RL algorithms use a carefully
engineered setup in order to collect data, requiring human supervision and
intervention to provide episodic resets. This is particularly evident in
challenging robotics problems, such as dexterous manipulation. To make data
collection scalable, such applications require reset-free algorithms that are
able to learn autonomously, without explicit instrumentation or human
intervention. Most prior work in this area handles single-task learning.
However, we might also want robots that can perform large repertoires of
skills. At first, this would appear to only make the problem harder. However,
the key observation we make in this work is that an appropriately chosen
multi-task RL setting actually alleviates the reset-free learning challenge,
with minimal additional machinery required. In effect, solving a multi-task
problem can directly solve the reset-free problem since different combinations
of tasks can serve to perform resets for other tasks. By learning multiple
tasks together and appropriately sequencing them, we can effectively learn all
of the tasks together reset-free. This type of multi-task learning can
effectively scale reset-free learning schemes to much more complex problems, as
we demonstrate in our experiments. We propose a simple scheme for multi-task
learning that tackles the reset-free learning problem, and show its
effectiveness at learning to solve complex dexterous manipulation tasks in both
hardware and simulation without any explicit resets. This work shows the
ability to learn dexterous manipulation behaviors in the real world with RL

Math",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We provide the rigorous derivation of the wave kinetic equation from the
cubic nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation at the kinetic timescale, under a
particular scaling law that describes the limiting process. This solves a main
conjecture in the theory of wave turbulence, i.e. the kinetic theory of
nonlinear wave systems. Our result is the wave analog of Lanford's theorem on
the derivation of the Boltzmann kinetic equation from particle systems, where
in both cases one takes the thermodynamic limit as the size of the system
diverges to infinity, and as the interaction strength of waves or radius of
particles vanishes to $0$, according to a particular scaling law
(Boltzmann-Grad in the particle case).
  More precisely, in dimensions $d\geq 3$, we consider the (NLS) equation in a
large box of size $L$ with a weak nonlinearity of strength $\alpha$. In the
limit $L\to\infty$ and $\alpha\to 0$, under the scaling law $\alpha\sim
L^{-1}$, we show that the long-time behavior of (NLS) is statistically
described by the wave kinetic equation, with well justified approximation, up
to times that are $O(1)$ (i.e independent of $L$ and $\alpha$) multiples of the
kinetic timescale $T_{\text{kin}}\sim \alpha^{-2}$. This is the first result of
its kind for any nonlinear dispersive system.

matting, there has been so far no representative work on deep learning for
video matting due to the inherent technical challenges in reasoning temporal

propose a deep learning-based video matting framework which employs a novel and
effective spatio-temporal feature aggregation module (ST-FAM). As optical flow
estimation can be very unreliable within matting regions, ST-FAM is designed to
effectively align and aggregate information across different spatial scales and
temporal frames within the network decoder. To eliminate frame-by-frame trimap
annotations, a lightweight interactive trimap propagation network is also
introduced. The other contribution consists of a large-scale video matting
dataset with groundtruth alpha mattes for quantitative evaluation and
real-world high-resolution videos with trimaps for qualitative evaluation.
Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms conventional video matting and deep image matting
methods applied to video in presence of multi-frame temporal information.

aperture masking technology implemented at the Keck OSIRIS Imager: the
holographic aperture mask. Holographic aperture masking (HAM) aims at (i)
increasing the throughput of sparse aperture masking (SAM) by selectively
combining all subapertures across a telescope pupil in multiple interferograms
using a phase mask, and (ii) adding low-resolution spectroscopic capabilities.
Using liquid-crystal geometric phase patterns, we manufacture a HAM mask that
uses an 11-hole SAM design as the central component and a holographic component
comprising 19 different subapertures. Thanks to a multilayer liquid-crystal
implementation, the mask has a diffraction efficiency higher than 96% from 1.1
to 2.5 micron. We create a pipeline that extracts monochromatic closure phases
from the central component as well as multiwavelength closure phases from the
holographic component. We test the performance of the HAM mask in the
laboratory and on-sky. The holographic component yields 26 closure phases with
spectral resolutions between R$\sim$6.5 and R$\sim$15. On April 19, 2019, we
observed the binary star HDS 1507 in the Hbb filter ($\lambda_0 = 1638$ nm and
$\Delta \lambda = 330$ nm) and retrieved a constant separation of 120.9 $\pm
0.5$ mas for the independent wavelength bins, which is in excellent agreement
with literature values. For both the laboratory measurements and the
observations of unresolved reference stars, we recorded nonzero closure phases
-- a potential source of systematic error that we traced to polarization
leakage of the HAM optic. We propose a future upgrade that improves the
performance, reducing this effect to an acceptable level. Holographic aperture
masking is a simple upgrade of SAM with increased throughput and a new
capability of simultaneous low-resolution spectroscopy that provides new
differential observables.

Previous research has addressed the extension of this problem where one has

we consider the following version of the problem where on the input we are

between real and generated images. The often-used Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) metric, for example, extracts ""high-level"" features using a deep network
from the two sets. However, we find that the differences in ""low-level""
preprocessing, specifically image resizing and compression, can induce large
variations and have unforeseen consequences. For instance, when resizing an
image, e.g., with a bilinear or bicubic kernel, signal processing principles
mandate adjusting prefilter width depending on the downsampling factor, to
antialias to the appropriate bandwidth. However, commonly-used implementations
use a fixed-width prefilter, resulting in aliasing artifacts. Such aliasing
leads to corruptions in the feature extraction downstream. Next, lossy
compression, such as JPEG, is commonly used to reduce the file size of an
image. Although designed to minimally degrade the perceptual quality of an
image, the operation also produces variations downstream. Furthermore, we show
that if compression is used on real training images, FID can actually improve
if the generated images are also subsequently compressed. This paper shows that
choices in low-level image processing have been an underappreciated aspect of
generative modeling. We identify and characterize variations in generative
modeling development pipelines, provide recommendations based on signal
processing principles, and release a reference implementation to facilitate
future comparisons.

through automatically discovered 3D keypoints. We cast this as the problem of
aligning a source 3D object to a target 3D object from the same object
category. Our method analyzes the difference between the shapes of the two
objects by comparing their latent representations. This latent representation
is in the form of 3D keypoints that are learned in an unsupervised way. The
difference between the 3D keypoints of the source and the target objects then
informs the shape deformation algorithm that deforms the source object into the
target object. The whole model is learned end-to-end and simultaneously
discovers 3D keypoints while learning to use them for deforming object shapes.
Our approach produces intuitive and semantically consistent control of shape
deformations. Moreover, our discovered 3D keypoints are consistent across
object category instances despite large shape variations. As our method is
unsupervised, it can be readily deployed to new object categories without
requiring annotations for 3D keypoints and deformations.

dark matter component predicted to exist in regions of the Universe with large
relative velocities between baryons and dark matter at the time of
recombination. They have been suggested to be the progenitors of present-day
globular clusters. Using simulations, SIGOs have been studied on small scales
(around 2 Mpc), where these relative velocities are coherent. However, it is
challenging to study SIGOs using simulations on large scales due to the varying
relative velocities at scales larger than a few Mpc. Here, we study SIGO
abundances semi-analytically: using perturbation theory, we predict the number
density of SIGOs analytically, and compare these results to small-box numerical
simulations. We use the agreement between the numerical and analytic
calculations to extrapolate the large-scale variation of SIGO abundances over
different stream velocities. As a result, we predict similar large-scale
variations of objects with high gas densities before reionization that could
possibly be observed by JWST. If indeed SIGOs are progenitors of globular
clusters, then we expect a similar variation of globular cluster abundances
over large scales. Significantly, we find that the expected number density of
SIGOs is consistent with observed globular cluster number densities. As a
proof-of-concept, and because globular clusters were proposed to be natural
formation sites for gravitational wave sources from binary black hole (BBH)
mergers, we show that SIGOs should imprint an anisotropy on the gravitational
wave signal on the sky, consistent with SIGOs' distribution.

reducing the spatial resolution. This creates a multiscale pyramid of features

out-of-domain faces, such as non-photorealistic paintings, cartoon portraits,

from 3DMM parameters to the latent space embedding of a pre-trained StyleGAN2
that guarantees disentangled and precise controls for each semantic attribute;
and 2) cross-domain adaptation that bridges domain discrepancies and makes
human 3DMM applicable to out-of-domain faces by enforcing a consistent latent

of the outer halo (R$_{\rm GC}$=18 kpc) GC NGC 1261, which has been suggested
to be an accreted object. We measured 31 species of 29 elements in two stars
from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra and find that the cluster is
moderately metal poor, at [Fe/H]=-1.26. NGC 1261 is moderately
$\alpha$-enhanced to the 0.3-dex level. While from the small sample alone it is
difficult to assert any abundance correlations, the light elements Na,O,Mg, and
Al differ significantly between the two stars in contrast to the majority of
other elements with smaller scatter; this argues in favour of multiple
generations of stars coexisting in this GC. Intriguingly for its metallicity,
NGC 1261 shows heavy element abundances that are consistent with $r$-process
nucleosynthesis and we discuss their origin in various sites. In particular the
Eu overabundance quantitatively suggests that one single $r$-process event,
such as a neutron-star neutron-star merger or a rare kind of supernova, can be
responsible for the stellar enhancement or even the enrichment of the cluster
with the excess $r$-material. Its heavy element pattern makes NGC 1261 resemble
the moderately enhanced r-I stars that are commonly found in the halo and have
been detected in Gaia-Enceladus as well. Therefore, combining all kinematical,
age, and chemical evidence we conclude that NGC 1261 is a chemically intriguing
GC that was born in Gaia-Enceladus and has been subsequently accreted into the
MW halo. [abridged]

reduction of the coefficients maintains rotational invariance when generalized
to test data and visualize residual symmetry breaking terms. Rotation
equivariance is leveraged to estimate the rotation angle of digits and
reconstruct the full rotation dependence of each coefficient from a single

conjunction with constraining crystal field symmetries, leads to a vast array
of possible interactions and resulting non-Fermi liquid ground states. Previous
works on Kondo physics have typically focussed on impurities that have two
degenerate internal states. In this work, inspired by recent experiments on the
tetragonal material YbRu$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$, which has been shown to exhibit a local
moment with a quasi-fourfold degenerate ground state, we consider the Kondo
effect for such a quasi-quartet multipolar impurity. In the tetragonal crystal
field environment, the local moment supports dipolar, quadrupolar, and
octupolar moments, which interact with conduction electrons in entangled spin
and orbital states. Using renormalization group analysis, we uncover a number
of emergent quantum ground states characterized by non-trivial fixed points. It
is shown that these previously unidentified fixed points are described by
truncated SU(4) Kondo models, where only some of the SU(4) generators
(representing the impurity degrees of freedom) are coupled to conduction
electrons. Such novel non-trivial fixed points are unique to the quasi-quartet
multipolar impurity, reinforcing the idea that an unexplored rich diversity of
phenomena may be produced by multipolar quantum impurity systems.

planet formation models, particularly when contrasted with the relatively high
derived occurrence rates of short-period planets around Sun-like stars. Recent
work proposed that the majority of systems hosting hot super-Earths attain
their orbital architectures through an epoch of dynamical instability after
forming in quasi-stable, tightly packed configurations. Isotopic evidence seems
to suggest that the formation of objects in the super-Earth mass regime is
unlikely to have occurred in the solar system as the terrestrial-forming disk
is thought to have been significantly mass-deprived starting around 2 Myr after
CAI; a consequence of either Jupiter's growth or an intrinsic disk feature.
Nevertheless, terrestrial planet formation models and high-resolution
investigations of planetesimal dynamics in the gas disk phase occasionally find
that quasi-stable proto-planets with masses comparable to that of Mars emerge
in the vicinity of Mercury's modern orbit. In this paper, we investigate
whether it is possible for a primordial configuration of such objects to be
cataclysmically destroyed in a manner that leaves Mercury behind as the sole
survivor without disturbing the other terrestrial worlds. We use numerical
simulations to show that this scenario is plausible. In many cases, the
surviving Mercury analog experiences a series of erosive impacts; thereby
boosting its Fe/Si ratio. A caveat of our proposed genesis scenario for Mercury
is that Venus typically experiences at least one late giant impact.

find that irradiation drives enhanced mass transfer from the donor at a rate
$\dot{m}\propto T_{\rm irr}^{5/3}$, which reaches $\dot{m}\sim 10^{-6}\textrm{

faster than during quiescence. As the nova subsides and the white dwarf cools

self-sustaining rate of $\dot{m}\sim 10^{-7}\textrm{ M}_\odot\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$
for up to $\sim 10^3$ yr after the eruption. At this rate, irradiation by the
white dwarf's accretion luminosity is sufficient to drive the mass transfer on
its own. The self-sustaining rate is close to the white dwarf's stable burning

direct detection of young giant exoplanets. We use an end-to-end model of the

conditions. We analyze these data with the so-called ""molecule mapping""
technique combined to a matched-filter approach, in order to disentangle the
companions from the host star and tellurics, and increase the S/N of the
planetary signal. We detect planets above 5-sigma at contrasts up to 16 mag and
separations down to 75 mas in several spectral configurations of the
instrument. We show that molecule mapping allows the detection of companions up
to 2.5 mag fainter compared to state-of-the-art high-contrast imaging
techniques based on angular differential imaging. We also demonstrate that the
performance is not strongly affected by the spectral type of the host star, and
that we reach close sensitivities for the best three quartiles of observing
conditions at Armazones, which means that HARMONI could be used in
near-critical observations during 60 to 70% of telescope time at the ELT.
Finally, we simulate planets from population synthesis models to further

consistently generating planets with masses and orbits analogous to those of

inferred demographics of multi-planet systems of rocky exoplanets, the mass
(>10) and orbital period (>2) ratios between Venus and Earth and the
neighboring Mercury and Mars are not common outcomes in numerically generated
systems. While viable solutions to the small-Mars problem are abundant in the
literature, Mercury's peculiar origin remains rather mysterious. In this paper,
we investigate the possibility that Mercury formed in a mass-depleted, inner
region of the terrestrial disk (a < 0.5 au). This regime is often neglected in
terrestrial planet formation models because of the high computational cost of
resolving hundreds of short-period objects over ~100 Myr timescales. By testing
multiple disk profiles and mass distributions, we identify several promising
sets of initial conditions that lead to remarkably successful analog systems.
In particular, our most successful simulations consider moderate total masses
of Mercury-forming material (0.1-0.25 Earth masses). While larger initial
masses tend to yield disproportionate Mercury analogs, smaller values often
inhibit the planets' formation as the entire region of material is easily
accreted by Venus. Additionally, we find that shallow surface density profiles
and larger inventories of small planetesimals moderately improve the likelihood
of adequately reproducing Mercury.

focused on two distinct mechanisms for boundary robustness - topological

the first experimental realizations of hybrid higher-order skin-topological
effect, in which the skin effect selectively acts only on the topological
boundary modes, not the bulk modes. Our experiments, which are performed on
specially designed non-reciprocal 2D and 3D topolectrical circuit lattices,
showcases how non-reciprocal pumping and topological localization dynamically
interplays to form various novel states like 2D skin-topological, 3D
skin-topological-topological hybrid states, as well as 2D and 3D higher-order
non-Hermitian skin states. Realized through our highly versatile and scalable
circuit platform, theses states have no Hermitian nor lower-dimensional analog,
and pave the way for new applications in topological switching and sensing
through the simultaneous non-trivial interplay of skin and topological boundary

Sensor (WFS) may evolve during the operations due to the flexures of the
opto-mechanical components present in the optical path. The latter will result
in degraded AO performance that will impact the scientific operation. To
overcome this challenge, it will be necessary to regularly monitor and
compensate for these DM/WFS mis-registrations either by physically re-aligning
some optical components or by updating the control matrix of the system. In
this paper, we present a new strategy to track mis-registrations using a
pseudo-synthetic model of the AO system. The method is based on an invasive
approach where signals are acquired on-sky, before or during the scientific
operations, and fed to the model to extract the mis-registration parameters. We
introduce a method to compute the most sensitive modes to these
mis-registrations that allows to reduce the number of degrees of freedom
required by the algorithm and minimize the impact on the scientific
performance. We demonstrate that, using only a few of these well selected
signals, the method provides a very good accuracy on the parameters estimation,
well under the targeted accuracy, and has a negligible impact on the scientific
path. In addition, the method appears to be very robust to varying operating
conditions of noise and atmospheric turbulence and performs equally for both

exploring the properties of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei

parameters through spectral fitting techniques. However, questions, including
how the torus mid-infrared (mid-IR) and X-ray emission are related remain
unanswered. In this work, we study whether the dust continuum at mid-IR and gas
reflection at X-rays have the same distribution in a sample of AGN. We
carefully selected a sample of 36 nearby AGN with NuSTAR and Spitzer spectra
available in both archives. We derived the properties of the nuclear dust and
gas through a spectral fitting, using models developed for mid-IR and X-ray
wavelengths assuming smooth and clumpy distributions for this structure. We
found that a combination of smooth and clumpy distributions of gas and dust,
respectively, is preferred for ~80% of sources with good spectral fits
according to the Akaike criterion. However, considering extra information about
each individual source, such as the absorption variability, we found that ~50%
of our sources are best described by a clumpy distribution of both dust and
gas. The remaining ~50% of our sources can still be explained with a smooth
distribution of gas and a clumpy distribution of dust. The results presented in
this paper suggest that the distribution of the gas and dust in AGN is complex.
We find at least six scenarios to explain the observed properties of our
sample. In these scenarios, three gas-dust distribution combinations are
possible: clumpy-clumpy, smooth-smooth, and smooth-clumpy. Most of them are in
agreement with the notion that gas could also be located in the dust-free
region, which is consistent with the dust-to-gas ratio found.

anti-parallel motion, i.e., when detectors $A$ and $B$ are in the right and
left Rindler wedges, respectively. While for $T^{(f)}=0$ entanglement
harvesting is possible for all values of $A$'s acceleration $a_A$, in the

entanglement harvesting increases. Moreover, above a critical value $a_A=a_c$
harvesting increases as we increase $T^{(f)}$, which is just opposite to the
accelerations below it. There are several critical values in $(1+3)$ dimensions

success in predicting expressions from faces having extreme poses,
illumination, and occlusion conditions. To mitigate this issue, CNNs are often

often provide high accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity.
In this work, we propose a Part-based Ensemble Transfer Learning network that
models how humans recognize facial expressions by correlating the spatial
orientation pattern of the facial features with a specific expression. It
consists of 5 sub-networks, and each sub-network performs transfer learning
from one of the five subsets of facial landmarks: eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth,
or jaw to expression classification. We show that our proposed ensemble network
uses visual patterns emanating from facial muscles' motor movements to predict
expressions and demonstrate the usefulness of transfer learning from Facial
Landmark Localization to Facial Expression Recognition. We test the proposed
network on the CK+, JAFFE, and SFEW datasets, and it outperforms the benchmark
for CK+ and JAFFE datasets by 0.51% and 5.34%, respectively. Additionally, the
proposed ensemble network consists of only 1.65M model parameters, ensuring
computational efficiency during training and real-time deployment. Grad-CAM

its sub-networks, a key design parameter of an effective ensemble network.
Lastly, cross-dataset evaluation results reveal that our proposed ensemble has
a high generalization capacity, making it suitable for real-world usage.

different sectors (plus corresponds to the positive and minus to the negative
directions) of the heliospheric magnetic field. We compare the analysis of GCRs
anisotropy using different evaluations of the mean GCRs rigidity related to
Neutron Monitor observations. Then the radial and tangential components are
used for characterizing the GCRs modulation in the heliosphere. We show that in
the solar minimum 23_24 in 2007-2009 when negative, the drift effect is not
visibly evident in the changes of the radial component, i.e. the drift effect
is found to produce 4 % change in the radial component of the GCRs anisotropy
for 2007-2009. Hence the diffusion dominated model of GCRs transport is more
acceptable in 2007-2009. In turn, near the solar minimum 24_25 in 2017-2018
when positive, the drift effect is evidently visible and produce 40% change in
the radial component of the GCRs anisotropy for 2017-2018. So in the period of
2017-2018 diffusion model with noticeably manifested drift is acceptable. The
results of this work are in good agreement with the drift theory of GCRs
modulation, according to which during negative (positive) polarity cycles, a
drift stream of GCRs is directed toward (away from) the Sun, thus giving rise
to a 22-year cycle variation of the radial GCRs anisotropy.

chains, the Gaussian chain approximation, misses key physics. By considering
the nonlinearities of the problem, we show a strong coupling between the
deformation of a polymer chain and its dielectric response; that is, its net
dipole. When chains with this coupling are cross-linked in an elastomer network
and an electric field is applied, the field breaks the symmetry of the
elastomer's elastic properties, and, combined with electrostatic torque and
incompressibility, leads to intrinsic electrostriction. Conversely, deformation
can break the symmetry of the dielectric response leading to volumetric torque
(i.e., a couple stress or torque per unit volume) and asymmetric actuation.
Both phenomena have important implications for designing high-efficiency soft
actuators and soft electroactive materials; and the presence of mechanisms for
volumetric torque, in particular, can be used to develop higher degree of
freedom actuators and to achieve bioinspired locomotion.

Therefore, it is necessary to use automated table extraction to obtain thorough

extraction struggle to adequately extract tables with machine-readable text and
structural data. To make matters worse, many tables do not have
machine-readable data, such as tables saved as images, making most extraction
methods completely ineffective. In order to address these issues, a novel,
general format table extractor tool, Tablext, is proposed. This tool uses a
combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning methods to
efficiently and effectively identify and extract data from tables. Tablext
begins by using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and
separate all potential tables. The identification process is optimized by
combining the custom CNN with the YOLO object detection network. Then, the
high-level structure of each table is identified with computer vision methods.
This high-level, structural meta-data is used by another CNN to identify exact
cell locations. As a final step, Optical Characters Recognition (OCR) is
performed on every individual cell to extract their content without needing
machine-readable text. This multi-stage algorithm allows for the neural
networks to focus on completing complex tasks, while letting image processing
methods efficiently complete the simpler ones. This leads to the proposed
approach to be general-purpose enough to handle a large batch of tables
regardless of their internal encodings or their layout complexity.
Additionally, it becomes accurate enough to outperform competing
state-of-the-art table extractors on the ICDAR 2013 table dataset.

methods is challenging. As an alternative, self-supervised methods are becoming
more popular to mitigate this challenge. In this paper, we introduce the H-Net,
a deep-learning framework for unsupervised stereo depth estimation that
leverages epipolar geometry to refine stereo matching. For the first time, a
Siamese autoencoder architecture is used for depth estimation which allows
mutual information between the rectified stereo images to be extracted. To
enforce the epipolar constraint, the mutual epipolar attention mechanism has
been designed which gives more emphasis to correspondences of features which
lie on the same epipolar line while learning mutual information between the
input stereo pair. Stereo correspondences are further enhanced by incorporating
semantic information to the proposed attention mechanism. More specifically,
the optimal transport algorithm is used to suppress attention and eliminate
outliers in areas not visible in both cameras. Extensive experiments on

church, we measured the azimuth and the angular height of the horizon taken in
the direction towards which the altar of each temple points. The data obtained
were corroborated with digital terrain models frequently used in
archaeoastronomical studies. Finally, for the study of the sample, various
analyzes were carried out: statistical, calendarical and orographic, trying to
find clues that would allow us to understand the pattern of orientations found.
From this analysis, we can infer that in some places the canonical tradition of
orienting Christian temples in the solar range was respected. Also, it is
possible that a few constructions were oriented with imitation patterns of the
aborigine cult, especially in solstitial directions. However, we find that the
orientation of the majority of the churches is towards the northeast and, in
the absence of a better justification, we think that reason should be sought
more in the terrestrial landscape than in the celestial one. Judging by the way
in which several small groups of temples are distributed, we estimate this
unusual pattern of global orientations is motivated by the particular orography
of the island. A significant proportion of churches seems to adapt to the
characteristics of their sites, orienting themselves according to the numerous
geographical features where they are located. These results allow us to
conjecture that the known ""abrupt nature"" of La Gomera is perhaps the main

to improve the accuracy of models with noisy parameters, we consider the
problem of reducing error in a linear system with the operator corrupted by
noise. Our contribution in this paper is to extend the elliptic operator
shifting framework from Etter, Ying '20 to the general nonsymmetric matrix
case. Roughly, the operator shifting technique is a matrix analogue of the
James-Stein estimator. The key insight is that a shift of the matrix inverse
estimate in an appropriately chosen direction will reduce average error. In our
extension, we interrogate a number of questions -- namely, whether or not
shifting towards the origin for general matrix inverses always reduces error as
it does in the elliptic case. We show that this is usually the case, but that
there are three key features of the general nonsingular matrices that allow for

these adversarial possibilities are eliminated by the assumption of noise
symmetry and the use of the residual norm as the error metric, the optimal
shift is always towards the origin, mirroring results from Etter, Ying '20. We
also investigate behavior in the small noise regime and other scenarios. We
conclude by presenting numerical experiments (with accompanying source code)

yield substantial reductions in error.

these embeddings. In particular, we propose a novel post-processing approach,
applying a combination of Isomap and PCA. We find that the geodesic distance
estimations, estimates of the shortest path on a Riemannian manifold, from
Isomap's k-Nearest Neighbors graph bolstered the performance of the compressed

find that despite a 12-fold dimensionality reduction, the compressed embeddings
performed within 0.1% of the original BERT embeddings on a downstream
classification task. In addition, we find that this approach works particularly
well on tasks reliant on syntactic data, when compared with linear

approach to achieve lower dimensional text embeddings from existing

that improving the accuracy of numeric estimates does not necessarily improve
the accuracy of decisions. For binary choice judgments, also known as
classification tasks--e.g. yes/no or build/buy decisions--social influence is
most likely to grow the majority vote share, regardless of the accuracy of that
opinion. As a result, initially inaccurate groups become increasingly
inaccurate after information exchange even as they signal stronger support. We
term this dynamic the ""crowd classification problem."" Using both a novel
dataset as well as a reanalysis of three previous datasets, we study this
process in two types of information exchange: (1) when people share votes only,
and (2) when people form and exchange numeric estimates prior to voting.
Surprisingly, when people exchange numeric estimates prior to voting, the
binary choice vote can become less accurate even as the average numeric
estimate becomes more accurate. Our findings recommend against voting as a form
of decision-making when groups are optimizing for accuracy. For those cases
where voting is required, we discuss strategies for managing communication to
avoid the crowd classification problem. We close with a discussion of how our

sensitive to both the line of sight direction and twist of the magnetic field.
In these models, a stable sign of the circular polarization over time, as
observed for several sources, can be attributed to a stability of these
properties. We illustrate how different aspects of a generic helical magnetic
field geometry become imprinted on a circular polarization image. We also
identify novel effects of light bending that affect the circular polarization

turbulence as they navigate the ocean. To survive they must avoid predation and
find efficient energy sources. A major difficulty in analysing possible
survival strategies is that the time series of environmental cues in non-linear
flow is complex, and that it depends on the decisions taken by the organism.
One way of determining and evaluating optimal strategies is reinforcement
learning. In a proof-of-principle study, Colabrese et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
(2017)] used this method to find out how a micro-swimmer in a vortex flow can
navigate towards the surface as quickly as possible, given a fixed swimming
speed. The swimmer measured its instantaneous swimming direction and the local
flow vorticity in the laboratory frame, and reacted to these cues by swimming
either left, right, up, or down. However, usually a motile microorganism
measures the local flow rather than global information, and it can only react
in relation to the local flow, because in general it cannot access global
information (such as up or down in the laboratory frame). Here we analyse
optimal strategies with local signals and actions that do not refer to the
laboratory frame. We demonstrate that symmetry-breaking is required in order to
learn vertical migration in a meaningful way. Using reinforcement learning we
analyse the emerging strategies for different sets of environmental cues that
microorganisms are known to measure.

  Positioning System using WiFi RTT and RSS","Experiments have been reconducted",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The accuracy of smartphone-based positioning methods using WiFi usually
suffers from ranging errors caused by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions.
Previous research usually exploits several statistical features from a long
time series (hundreds of samples) of WiFi received signal strength (RSS) or
WiFi round-trip time (RTT) to achieve a high identification accuracy. However,
the long time series or large sample size attributes to high power and time
consumption in data collection for both training and testing. This will also
undoubtedly be detrimental to user experience as the waiting time of getting
enough samples is quite long. Therefore, this paper proposes a new real-time
NLOS/LOS identification method for smartphone-based indoor positioning system
using WiFi RTT and RSS. Based on our extensive analysis of RSS and RTT
features, a machine learning-based method using random forest was chosen and
developed to separate the samples for NLOS/LOS conditions. Experiments in
different environments show that our method achieves a discrimination accuracy
of about 94% with a sample size of 10. Considering the theoretically shortest
WiFi ranging interval of 100ms of the RTT-enabled smartphones, our algorithm is
able to provide the shortest latency of 1s to get the testing result among all
of the state-of-art methods.

adopted cloud technology to store their video streams. Generally, having all
video streams stored in one type of cloud storage, the cost rises gradually.
More importantly, the variation of the access pattern to frequently accessed
video streams impacts negatively the storage cost and increases it
significantly. To optimize storage usage and lower its cost, we propose a
method that manages the cloud hierarchy storage. Particularly, we develop an

travels through the scene material, which is then used to calculate attenuation
assuming a single attenuation coefficient for solids within the geometry.
Parameter estimation using maximum likelihood is performed to simultaneously
find the attenuation coefficient, source activity, and source position that
best match the data. Using a simulation, we validate the ability of this method

classical transport time in the momentum space is still large enough, although
the diffusion is not normal. In quantum systems with discrete energy spectrum
the Heisenberg time $t_H =2\pi \hbar/\Delta E$, where $\Delta E$ is the mean
level spacing, is an important time scale.The classical transport time scale
$t_T$ in relation to the Heisenberg time scale $t_H$ (their ratio is the
parameter $\alpha=t_H/t_T$) determines the degree of localization of the
chaotic eigenstates, whose measure $A$ is based on the information entropy. We
show that $A$ is linearly related to normalized inverse participation ratio.
The localization of chaotic eigenstates is reflected also in the fractional
power-law repulsion between the nearest energy levels in the sense that the
probability density to find successive levels on a distance $S$ goes like
$\propto S^\beta$ for small $S$, where $0\leq\beta\leq1$, and $\beta=1$
corresponds to completely extended states. We show that the level repulsion
exponent $\beta$ is empirically a rational function of $\alpha$, and the mean
$\langle A \rangle$ as a function of $\alpha$ is also well approximated by a
rational function. In both cases there is some scattering of the empirical data
around the mean curve, which is due to the fact that $A$ actually has a
distribution, typically with quite complex structure, but in the limit
$\alpha\rightarrow \infty$ well described by the beta distribution. Like in
other systems, $\beta$ goes from $0$ to $1$ when $\alpha$ goes from $0$ to
$\infty$. $\beta$ is a function of $\langle A \rangle$, similar to the quantum
kicked rotator and the stadium billiard.

implement an automated feature selection strategy that iteratively determines
appropriate combinations of filters and colours to minimise photometric
redshift prediction error. We intend for Z-Sequence to be a standalone
technique but it can be combined with cluster finders that do not intrinsically
predict redshift, such as our own DEEP-CEE. In this proof-of-concept study we
train, fine-tune and test Z-Sequence on publicly available cluster catalogues
derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We determine the photometric
redshift prediction error of Z-Sequence via the median value of $|\Delta
z|/(1+z)$ (across a photometric redshift range of $0.05 \le \textit{z} \le
0.6$) to be $\sim0.01$ when applying a small search radius. The photometric
redshift prediction error for test samples increases by 30-50 per cent when the
search radius is enlarged, likely due to line-of-sight interloping galaxies.
Eventually, we aim to apply Z-Sequence to upcoming imaging surveys such as the

the probable rotational states today using our computer-efficient chaotic
process simulation method. Starting with random initial conditions, we find
that this asteroid is inevitably captured into stable spin-orbit resonances
typically within tens to a hundred Myr. The resonances are confirmed by direct
integration of the equation of motion in the vicinity of end-points. Most
resonances are located at high spin values above 960 times the mean motion
(such as 964:1 or 4169:4), corresponding to rotation periods of a few days. We
discover three types of resonance in the high-eccentricity regime: 1) regular
circulation with weakly librating aphelion velocities and integer-number
spin-orbit commensurabilities; 2) switching resonances of higher order with
orientation alternating between aligned (0 or $\pi$) and sidewise ($\pi/2$)
angles at aphelia and perihelia; 3) jumping resonances with aphelion spin
alternating between two quantum states in the absence of spin-orbit
commensurability. The islands of equilibrium are numerous at high spin rates
but small in parameter space area, so that it takes millions of orbits of
chaotic wandering to accidentally entrap in one of them. We discuss the
implications of this discovery for the origins and destiny of high-eccentricity
objects and the prospects of extending this analysis to the full 3D treatment.

target state is both thermodynamically stable and kinetically accessible. These
two objectives are known to be typically in competition, but it is not known
how to simultaneously optimize them. We consider this problem through the lens
of multi-objective optimization theory: we develop a genetic algorithm to
compute the Pareto fronts characterizing the tradeoff between equilibrium
probability and folding rate, for a model system of small polymers of colloids
with tunable short-ranged interaction energies. We use a coarse-grained model
for the particles' dynamics that allows us to efficiently search over
parameters, for systems small enough to be enumerated. For most target states
there is a tradeoff when the number of types of particles is small, with
medium-weak bonds favouring fast folding, and strong bonds favouring high
equilibrium probability. The tradeoff disappears when the number of particle
types reaches a value $m_*$, that is usually much less than the total number of
particles. This general approach of computing Pareto fronts allows one to
identify the minimum number of design parameters to avoid a
thermodynamic-kinetic tradeoff. However, we argue, by contrasting our
coarse-grained model's predictions with those of Brownian dynamics simulations,
that particles with short-ranged isotropic interactions should generically have
a tradeoff, and avoiding it in larger systems will require
orientation-dependent interactions.

to back-calculate BCs using trial-and-error FE analysis. However, since the
inverse heat transfer problem is ill-posed, many solutions are obtained for
given TC data. In this study, a novel machine learning (ML) framework is
presented capable of optimizing air temperature cycle in real-time based on TC
data from multiple parts, for active control of manufacturing. The framework
consists of two recurrent Neural Networks (NN) for inverse modeling of the
ill-posed curing problem at the speed of 300 simulations/second, and a
classification NN for multi-objective optimization of the air temperature at
the speed of 35,000 simulations/second. A virtual demonstration of the
framework for process optimization of three composite parts with data from
three TCs is presented.

has been known that during a binary merger, a new outer horizon forms around
the initial apparent horizons of the individual holes once they are
sufficiently close together. However the ultimate fate of those initial
horizons has remained a subject of speculation. Recent axisymmetric studies
have shed new light on this process and this pair of papers essentially
completes that line of research: we resolve the key features of the
post-swallowing axisymmetric evolution of the initial horizons. This first
paper introduces a new shooting-method for finding axisymmetric MOTSs along
with a reinterpretation of the stability operator as the analogue of the Jacobi
equation for families of MOTSs. Here, these tools are used to study exact
solutions and initial data. In the sequel paper they are applied to black hole

in the first paper to locate these surfaces, we resolve several such world
tubes evolving and connecting through various bifurcations and annihilations.
This also draws a consistent picture of the full merger in terms of apparent
horizons, or more generally, marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs). The
MOTS stability operator provides a natural mechanism to identify MOTSs which
should be thought of as black hole boundaries. These are the two initial ones
and the final remnant. All other MOTSs lie in the interior and are neither
stable nor inner trapped.

  Conference (L4DC) 2021",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many robotics domains use some form of nonconvex model predictive control
(MPC) for planning, which sets a reduced time horizon, performs trajectory
optimization, and replans at every step. The actual task typically requires a
much longer horizon than is computationally tractable, and is specified via a
cost function that cumulates over that full horizon. For instance, an
autonomous car may have a cost function that makes a desired trade-off between
efficiency, safety, and obeying traffic laws. In this work, we challenge the
common assumption that the cost we optimize using MPC should be the same as the
ground truth cost for the task (plus a terminal cost). MPC solvers can suffer
from short planning horizons, local optima, incorrect dynamics models, and,
importantly, fail to account for future replanning ability. Thus, we propose
that in many tasks it could be beneficial to purposefully choose a different
cost function for MPC to optimize: one that results in the MPC rollout having
low ground truth cost, rather than the MPC planned trajectory. We formalize
this as an optimal cost design problem, and propose a zeroth-order
optimization-based approach that enables us to design optimal costs for an MPC
planning robot in continuous MDPs. We test our approach in an autonomous
driving domain where we find costs different from the ground truth that
implicitly compensate for replanning, short horizon, incorrect dynamics models,
and local minima issues. As an example, the learned cost incentivizes MPC to
delay its decision until later, implicitly accounting for the fact that it will
get more information in the future and be able to make a better decision. Code

surrounding the galaxy with the exponential scale length 4.9+/-0.7kpc, which
accounts for roughly half of the total line flux. Accounting for the LAH
contribution, the total Lya escape fraction, f_esc, is 40+/-26%. Combining the
dataset with existing measurements, we find a dependence of f_esc on the
galaxy's UV slope (beta) and UV luminosity (L_UV). The simultaneous use of both
parameters allows prediction of f_esc within 0.18dex, a substantial improvement
over 0.23dex when only beta is used. The correlation between f_esc and E(B-V)
suggests that Lya photons undergo interstellar dust attenuation in a similar
manner to continuum photons. Yet, Lya transmission is typically higher than
that expected for continuum photons at similar wavelength by a factor, which
depends on UV luminosity, up to 2 in the samples we studied. These results hint
at complex geometries and physical conditions of the interstellar medium, which
affect the Lya transmission or production. Alternatively, the dust law may
change with luminosity leading to over-or under-estimation of f_esc. Finally,
we report that protocluster member LAEs tend to be bluer and more UV-luminous
than their field cousins, resulting in systematically higher f_esc values. We
speculate that it may be due to the widespread formation of young low-mass
galaxies in dense gas-rich environments.

is of particular importance in data science and machine learning. An endeavor
during the past 16 years viewing causality as real physical notion so as to
formulate it from first principles, however, seems to go unnoticed. This study
introduces to the community this line of work, with a long-due generalization
of the information flow-based bivariate time series causal inference to
multivariate series, based on the recent advance in theoretical development.
The resulting formula is transparent, and can be implemented as a
computationally very efficient algorithm for application. It can be normalized,
and tested for statistical significance. Different from the previous work along
this line where only information flows are estimated, here an algorithm is also
implemented to quantify the influence of a unit to itself. While this forms a
challenge in some causal inferences, here it comes naturally, and hence the
identification of self-loops in a causal graph is fulfilled automatically as
the causalities along edges are inferred.
  To demonstrate the power of the approach, presented here are two applications
in extreme situations. The first is a network of multivariate processes buried
in heavy noises (with the noise-to-signal ratio exceeding 100), and the second
a network with nearly synchronized chaotic oscillators. In both graphs,
confounding processes exist. While it seems to be a huge challenge to
reconstruct from given series these causal graphs, an easy application of the
algorithm immediately reveals the desideratum. Particularly, the confounding
processes have been accurately differentiated. Considering the surge of
interest in the community, this study is very timely.

coincides with that derived using the quadratic model with the same curvature.
This indicates that the constraints obtained by the quadratic model will be
used to limit the curvature of the coupling function universally in the future.

subjective questionnaires and through behavioral tasks. To optimize
measurements of trust through questionnaires, the field of HRI faces two
challenges: the development of standardized measures that apply to a variety of
robots with different capabilities, and the exploration of social and
relational dimensions of trust in robots (e.g., benevolence). In this paper we
look at how different trust questionnaires fare given these challenges that
pull in different directions (being general vs. being exploratory) by studying
whether people think the items in these questionnaires are applicable to
different kinds of robots and interactions. In Study 1 we show that after being
presented with a robot (non-humanoid) and an interaction scenario (fire
evacuation), participants rated multiple questionnaire items such as ""This
robot is principled"" as ""Non-applicable to robots in general"" or
""Non-applicable to this robot"". In Study 2 we show that the frequency of these
ratings change (indeed, even for items rated as N/A to robots in general) when
a new scenario is presented (game playing with a humanoid robot). Finally,
while overall trust scores remained robust to N/A ratings, our results revealed
potential fallacies in the way these scores are commonly interpreted. We
conclude with recommendations for the development, use and results-reporting of
trust questionnaires for future studies, as well as theoretical implications
for the field of HRI.

cases of normal and degraded visual information has been successfully evaluated
experimentally and numerically. The evaluation results indicate that the
proposed haptic guidance system is capable of providing reliable haptic
information, and is effective on improving lane following performance in the
conditions of visual occlusion from road ahead and declined visual attention
under fatigue driving. Moreover, the appropriate degree of haptic guidance is
highly related to the reliability of visual information perceived by the
driver, which suggests that designing the haptic guidance system based on the
reliability of visual information would allow for greater driver acceptance.
Furthermore, the parameterized driver model, which considers the integrated
feedback of visual and haptic information, is capable of predicting driver
behavior under shared control, and has the potential of being used for
designing and evaluating the haptic guidance system.

FedAvg is mostly studied in centralized fashions, which requires massive
communication between server and clients in each communication. Moreover,
attacking the central server can break the whole system's privacy. In this
paper, we study the decentralized FedAvg with momentum (DFedAvgM), which is
implemented on clients that are connected by an undirected graph. In DFedAvgM,
all clients perform stochastic gradient descent with momentum and communicate
with their neighbors only. To further reduce the communication cost, we also
consider the quantized DFedAvgM. We prove convergence of the (quantized)

the loss function satisfies the P{\L} property. Finally, we numerically verify

e-commerce search. A common query categorization task is to select the relevant
fine-grained product categories in a product taxonomy. For frequent queries,
rich customer behavior (e.g., click-through data) can be used to infer the
relevant product categories. However, for more rare queries, which cover a
large volume of search traffic, relying solely on customer behavior may not
suffice due to the lack of this signal. To improve categorization of rare
queries, we adapt the Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) approach to utilize the
latent knowledge embedded in semantically or lexically similar product
documents to enrich the representation of the more rare queries. To this end,
we propose a novel deep neural model named Attentive Pseudo Relevance Feedback
Network (APRF-Net) to enhance the representation of rare queries for query
categorization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect
search queries from a large commercial search engine, and compare APRF-Net to
state-of-the-art deep learning models for text classification. Our results show
that the APRF-Net significantly improves query categorization by 5.9% on F1@1
score over the baselines, which increases to 8.2% improvement for the rare

improvements in search query representation and understanding.

duration only observed at radio frequencies. The generation mechanism is still
mysterious. We have proposed a generation mechanism of both repeating and
one-off FRBs. They arise from the axion star collision with neutron star or
magnetized accretion disk of galactic black hole. Once we accept the existence
of the axions, we find that the mechanism well explain previously observed
spectral-temporal features. In this paper we show that it also explains
recently observed phenomena such as downward drifting in the repeating FRBs,
etc.. Analysis of the downward drifting based on Doppler effects has been
presented in recent papers, in which a superradiance system of molecular or
atom has been proposed as a source of FRBs. We apply the analysis to our
mechanism and find that it well explains the relation between the downward
drifting rate and the duration of the repeating FRBs. The Doppler effects lead
to the fact that the duration of radio burst with higher center frequency is
shorter than that of radio burst with lower center frequency in the repeating
FRBs. Our generation mechanism naturally explain polarization angle swing
observed in the repeating FRB180301 and one-off FRBs. We also discuss the
association between the FRB200428 and magnetar SGR J1935+2154. The X ray burst
observed just after the observation of the FRB could be triggered by the axion
star collision with the magnetar. We also explain the consistency of our
generation mechanism with observed spectral-temporal differences in the
repeating and one-off FRBs, e.g. longer duration ( smaller flux density ) of
repeating FRBs than duration ( flux density ) of one-off FRBs.

estimate and then employ this estimate to construct a cost functional which is
strictly convex on a convex bounded set with an arbitrary diameter in a Hilbert
space. The strict convexity property is rigorously proved. This result is
called the convexification theorem and is considered as the central analytical
result of this paper. Minimizing this convex functional by the gradient descent
method, we obtain the desired numerical solution to the coefficient inverse
problems. We prove that the gradient descent method generates a sequence
converging to the minimizer and we also establish a theorem confirming that the
minimizer converges to the true solution as the noise in the measured data and
the regularization parameter tend to zero. Unlike the methods that are based on
optimization, our convexification method converges globally in the sense that
it delivers a good approximation of the exact solution without requiring any
initial guess. Results of numerical studies of both computationally simulated

dialog with the bot, question answering dialog systems have gained increasing
research interests recently. Designing interactive QA systems has always been a
challenging task in natural language processing and used as a benchmark to
evaluate a machine's ability of natural language understanding. However, such
systems often struggle when the question answering is carried out in multiple
turns by the users to seek more information based on what they have already
learned, thus, giving rise to another complicated form called Conversational
Question Answering (CQA). CQA systems are often criticized for not
understanding or utilizing the previous context of the conversation when
answering the questions. To address the research gap, in this paper, we explore
how to integrate conversational history into the neural machine comprehension
system. On one hand, we introduce a framework based on a publically available
pre-trained language model called BERT for incorporating history turns into the
system. On the other hand, we propose a history selection mechanism that
selects the turns that are relevant and contributes the most to answer the
current question. Experimentation results revealed that our framework is
comparable in performance with the state-of-the-art models on the QuAC leader
board. We also conduct a number of experiments to show the side effects of
using entire context information which brings unnecessary information and noise
signals resulting in a decline in the model's performance.

tendency of the vocal tract changes. The effectiveness of this approach is
evaluated on Baby2020 with healthy infant cries and Baby Chillanto database

79.20% accuracy for healthy cries, 84.80% for asphyxiated cries, and 91.20% for

certain level at 4-month age and infants can start controlling the vocal folds
to produce discontinuous cry sounds leading to babbling. Early diagnosis of

this paper, we examine the possibility of simulating a few quantum algorithms
by using low-rank canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition to represent the input

are used to enable efficient simulation. We show that some of the algorithms
preserve the low-rank structure of the input state and can thus be efficiently
simulated on a classical computer. However, the rank of the intermediate states

more difficult. To some extent, such difficulty reflects the advantage or

  Our description is based on formal expansions and approximations. In a

makes an individual exit the niche, it must come to the niche right away, by
selecting the return point according to the underlying stochastic process. More
precisely, if the random particle exits the domain, it is forced to immediately
reenter the domain, and the new point in the domain is chosen randomly by
following a bouncing process with the same distribution as the original one.
  By a suitable definition outside the niche, the density of the population
ends up solving a mixed local/nonlocal equation, in which the dispersion is
given by the superposition of the classical and the fractional Laplacian. This
density function satisfies two types of Neumann conditions, namely the
classical Neumann condition on the boundary of the niche, and a nonlocal

intentionally overfitting this general model to a small training

widely used to extract proposal features, but they often lead to the aliasing
problem, due to lacking consideration of sampling rates. This paper aims to
verify the existence of aliasing in TAL methods and investigate utilizing low
pass filters to solve this problem by inhibiting the high-frequency band.
However, the high-frequency band usually contains large amounts of specific
information, which is important for model inference. Therefore, it is necessary
to make a tradeoff between anti-aliasing and reserving high-frequency
information. To acquire optimal performance, this paper learns different cutoff
frequencies for different instances dynamically. This design can be plugged
into most existing temporal modeling programs requiring only one additional
cutoff frequency parameter. Integrating low pass filters to the downsampling
operations significantly improves the detection performance and achieves
comparable results on THUMOS'14, ActivityNet~1.3, and Charades datasets.
Experiments demonstrate that anti-aliasing with low pass filters in TAL is
advantageous and efficient.

complex multimaterial setting, Lagrangian hydrodynamics is characterized by
moving meshes, advection-dominated solutions, and moving shock fronts with

reduction schemes from being practical. We develop several variations of
projection-based reduced order model techniques for Lagrangian hydrodynamics by
introducing three different reduced bases for position, velocity, and energy
fields. A time-windowing approach is also developed to address the challenge
imposed by the advection-dominated solutions. Lagrangian hydrodynamics is
formulated as a nonlinear problem, which requires a proper hyper-reduction
technique. Therefore, we apply the over-sampling DEIM and SNS approaches to
reduce the complexity due to the nonlinear terms. Finally, we also present both
a posteriori and a priori error bounds associated with our reduced order model.
We compare the performance of the spatial and time-windowing reduced order
modeling approaches in terms of accuracy and speed-up with respect to the
corresponding full order model for several numerical examples, namely Sedov

surprisingly abrupt phase transitions. Despite the complex behaviors of the
mobility network, we devised a novel approach to identify a small, manageable
set of recurrent critical bridges, connecting the giant component and the
second-largest component. These adaptive links, located across the United

temperature and magnetic field dependent dc magnetization measurements. UO2 is
a paramagnet at room temperature. The magnetic susceptibility, however,
deviates from Curie-Weiss (CW) like paramagnetic behavior below T = 280 K.
Further down the temperature UO2 undergoes phase transition to an
antiferromagnetic state below TN = 30.6 K. The zero field cooled (ZFC) and
field cooled (FC) magnetizations exhibit some distinct thermomagnetic
irreversibility below TN. The temperature dependence of the FC magnetization is
more like a ferromagnet, whereas ZFC magnetization exhibits distinct structures
not usually observed in the antiferromagnets. In low applied magnetic field
this thermomagnetic irreversibility in magnetization exists in a subtle way
even in the paramagnetic regime above TN up to a fairly high temperature, but
vanishes in high applied magnetic fields. Deviation from CW law and
irreversibility between ZFC and FC magnetization indicate that the paramagnetic
state above TN is not a trivial one. Magnetic response below TN changes
significantly with the increase in the applied magnetic field. Thermomagnetic
irreversibility in magnetization initially increases with the increase in the
strength of applied magnetic field, but then gets reduced in the high applied
fields. A subtle signature of a magnetic field induced phase transition is also
observed in the isothermal magnetic field vartaion of magnetization. All these
experimetal results highlight the non-trivial nature of the antiferromagnetic
state in UO2

tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is regarded as the imaging modality of
choice for the management of STSs. It is difficult to determine from imaging
studies which STS patients will develop metastases. 'Radiomics' refers to the
extraction and analysis of quantitative features from medical images and it has
been employed to help identify such tumors. The state-of-the-art in radiomics
is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Most CNNs are designed for
single-modality imaging data (CT or PET alone) and do not exploit the
information embedded in PET-CT where there is a combination of an anatomical
and functional imaging modality. Furthermore, most radiomic methods rely on
manual input from imaging specialists for tumor delineation, definition and
selection of radiomic features. This approach, however, may not be scalable to
tumors with complex boundaries and where there are multiple other sites of
disease. We outline a new 3D CNN to help predict DM in STS patients from PET-CT
data. The 3D CNN uses a constrained feature learning module and a hierarchical
multi-modality feature learning module that leverages the complementary
information from the modalities to focus on semantically important regions. Our
results on a public PET-CT dataset of STS patients show that multi-modal
information improves the ability to identify those patients who develop DM.

Recently, Wang et al. (2020) successfully employed this approach and estimated
$H_0$ from 3C 273. However, there may be a systematic deviation between the
response-weighted radius (RM measurement) and luminosity-weighted radius (SA
measurement), especially when different broad lines are adopted for size
indicators (e.g., \hb\ for RM and \pa\ for SA). Here we evaluate the size
deviations measured by six pairs of hydrogen lines (e.g., \hb, \ha\ and \pa)
via the locally optimally emitting cloud (LOC) models of BLR. We find that the
radius ratios $K$(=$R_{\rm SA}$/$R_{\rm RM}$) of the same line deviated
systematically from 1 (0.85-0.88) with dispersions between 0.063-0.083.
Surprisingly, the $K$ values from the \pa(SA)/\hb(RM) and \ha(SA)/\hb(RM) pairs
not only are closest to 1 but also have considerably smaller uncertainty.
Considering the current infrared interferometry technology, the \pa(SA)/\hb(RM)

the future, the \ha(SA)/\hb(RM) pair could be used for the high redshift

controlled chemistry, ultracold chemical physics, and quantum simulation with
molecules. Extending the ultracold association to triatomic molecules will
offer many new research opportunities and challenges in these fields. A
possible approach is to form triatomic molecules in the ultracold atom and
diatomic molecule mixture by employing the Feshbach resonance between them.
Although the ultracold atom-diatomic-molecule Feshbach resonances have been
observed recently, utilizing these resonances to form triatomic molecules
remains challenging. Here we report on the evidence of the association of
triatomic molecules near the Feshbach resonances between $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K
molecules in the rovibrational ground state and $^{40}$K atoms. We apply a
radio-frequency pulse to drive the free-bound transition and monitor the loss
of $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules. The association of triatomic molecules
manifests itself as an additional loss feature in the radio-frequency spectra,
which can be distinguished from the atomic loss feature.The binding energy of
triatomic molecule is estimated from the measurement. Our work is helpful to
understand the complex ultracold atom-molecule Feshbach resonance and may open
up an avenue towards the preparation and control of ultracold triatomic
molecules.

using the three-flavor Polyakov loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model
in which the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of the quarks is also taken into
consideration. This is done by first evaluating the thermo-magnetic spectral
function of the vector current correlator employing the real time formalism of
finite temperature field theory and the Schwinger proper time formalism. The
constituent quark mass which goes as an input in the expression of the dilepton
production rate (DPR), has been calculated using the three-flavor PNJL model
employing Pauli-Villiars (PV) regularization. The obtained constituent quark
mass being strongly dependent on the temperature, density, magnetic field and
AMM of the quarks, captures the effect of `strong' interactions specifically
around the (pseudo) chiral and confinement-deconfinement phase transition
regions. The analytic structure of the spectral function in the complex energy
plane has been analyzed in detail and a non-trivial Landau cut is found in the
physical kinematic domains resulting from the scattering of the Landau
quantized quark/antiquark with the photon which is purely a finite magnetic
field effect. Due to the emergence of the Landau cut along with the usual
unitary cut, the DPR is found to be largely enhanced in the low invariant mass
region. Owing to the magnetic field and AMM dependence of the thresholds of
these cuts, we find that the kinematically forbidden gap between the Unitary
and Landau cuts vanishes at sufficiently high temperature, density and magnetic
field leading to the generation of a continuous spectrum of dilepton emission
over the whole invariant mass region. In order to see the effects of
strangeness and confinement-deconfinement, the rates are compared with the
three-flavor NJL and the two-flavor NJL and PNJL models.

First, we provide consistency and oracle properties of the proposed estimator

Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to numerically find the solution to the
formulated problem. Third, to show the effectiveness, we present an application
identifying a biomechanical parametric model of a head position tracking task

of estimated parameters are decreased by 96.1% as compared to that of the
estimated parameters without L1-regularization. In an experimental study, our

to be estimated while maintaining variance accounted for (VAF) at above 82.5%.
Moreover, the variances of estimated parameters are reduced by 71.1% as

method is 54 times faster than the standard simplex-based optimization to solve
the regularized nonlinear regression.

deep learning models may learn, even amplify, the bias embedded in them. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view ""divide-and-rule"" (MV-DAR) model to learn
from both reliable and ambiguous annotations for lung nodule malignancy
prediction. According to the consistency and reliability of their annotations,
we divide nodules into three sets: a consistent and reliable set (CR-Set), an
inconsistent set (IC-Set), and a low reliable set (LR-Set). The nodule in
IC-Set is annotated by multiple radiologists inconsistently, and the nodule in
LR-Set is annotated by only one radiologist. The proposed MV-DAR contains three
DAR submodels to characterize a lung nodule from three orthographic views. Each
DAR consists of a prediction network (Prd-Net), a counterfactual network
(CF-Net), and a low reliable network (LR-Net), learning on CR-Set, IC-Set, and
LR-Set, respectively. The image representation ability learned by CF-Net and
LR-Net is then transferred to Prd-Net by negative-attention module (NA-Module)
and consistent-attention module (CA-Module), aiming to boost the prediction
ability of Prd-Net. The MV-DAR model has been evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI
dataset and LUNGx dataset. Our results indicate not only the effectiveness of
the proposed MV-DAR model in learning from ambiguous labels but also its
superiority over present noisy label-learning models in lung nodule malignancy
prediction.

second- and higher-order interference of light in quantum optics. Unlike the
photon statistics of thermal or pseudothermal light is well understood, the
photon statistics of superbunching pseudothermal light has not been studied
yet. In this paper, we will employ single-photon detectors to measure the
photon statistics of superbunching pseudothermal light and calculate the degree
of second-order coherence. It is found that the larger the value of the degree
of second-order coherence of superbunching pseudothermal light is, the more the
measured photon distribution deviates from the one of thermal or pseudothermal
light in the tail part. The results are helpful to understand the physics of
two-photon superbunching with classical light. It is suggested that
superbunching pseudothermal light can be employed to generate non-Rayleigh
temporal speckles.

exploit elastic strain to produce desired deformations instead of using
moveable parts. They are designed for a kinematic task (providing desired
deformations) but do not possess a kinematics in the strict sense. This leads
to difficulties while assessing the quality of a compliant mechanism's design.
The kinematics of a compliant mechanism can be seen as a fuzzy property. There
is no unique kinematics, since every deformation need a particular force system
to act; however, certain deformations are easier to obtain than others. A
parallel can be made with measurement theory: the measured value of a quantity
is not unique, but exists as statistic distribution of measures. A
representative measure of this distribution can be chosen to evaluate how far
the measures divert from a reference value. Based on this analogy, the concept
of accuracy and precision of compliant systems are introduced and discussed in
this paper. A quantitative determination of these qualities based on the

learning has been used to study sequential social dilemmas (SSDs). Recent works
show that learning to incentivize other agents can promote cooperation in SSDs.
However, we find that, with these incentivizing mechanisms, the team
cooperation level does not converge and regularly oscillates between
cooperation and defection during learning. We show that a second-order social
dilemma resulting from the incentive mechanisms is the main reason for such
fragile cooperation. We formally analyze the dynamics of second-order social
dilemmas and find that a typical tendency of humans, called homophily, provides
a promising solution. We propose a novel learning framework to encourage
homophilic incentives and show that it achieves stable cooperation in both SSDs

Heston model to make it fit for modelling motor vehicle collision rates. We
incorporate the temporally-unstable and non-deterministic nature of collision
rate fluctuations, and introduce a parameter to account for periods of
accelerated safety. We also adjust estimates to account for the seasonality of
collision patterns. Using these parameters, we perform a short-term forecast of
collision rates and explore a number of plausible scenarios using long-term
forecasts. The short-term forecast shows a close affinity with realised rates
(over 95% accuracy), and outperforms forecasting models currently used in road
safety research (Vasicek, SARIMA, SARIMA-GARCH). The long-term scenarios
suggest that modest targets to reduce collision rates (1.83% annually) and
targets to reduce the fluctuations of month-to-month collision rates (by half)
could have significant benefits for road safety. The median forecast in this
scenario suggests a 50% fall in collision rates, with 75% of simulations
suggesting that an effective change in collision rates is observed before 2044.
The main benefit the model provides is eschewing the necessity for setting
unreasonable safety targets that are often missed. Instead, the model presents
the effects that modest and achievable targets can have on road safety over the
long run, while incorporating random variability. Examining the parameters that
underlie expected collision rates will aid policymakers in determining the
effectiveness of implemented policies.

the workflow of CounterExample Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS). CEGIS is an
iterative learning model where, at each iteration, (1) a synthesizer
synthesizes a candidate solution from the current examples, and (2) a validator
accepts the candidate solution if it is correct, or rejects it providing
counterexamples as part of the next examples. Our main novelty is in the design
of a synthesizer: building on top of a usual decision tree learning algorithm,
our algorithm detects cycles in a set of example transitions and uses them for
refining decision trees. We have implemented the proposed method and obtained
promising experimental results on existing benchmark sets of (non-)termination
verification problems that require synthesis of piecewise-defined lexicographic
affine ranking functions.

noise to each query. We conduct the theoretical analysis about the
effectiveness of RND against query-based black-box attacks and the

operations on the quantum state of the system, but the desired result is only
achieved if the anyons are well separated, which requires a sufficiently large
area. Being able to reduce the area needed for the exchange, however, would
have several advantages, such as enabling a larger number of operations per
area and allowing anyon exchange to be studied in smaller systems that are
easier to handle. Here, we use optimization techniques to squeeze the charge
distribution of Abelian anyons in lattice fractional quantum Hall models, and
we show that the squeezed anyons can be exchanged within a smaller area with a
close to ideal outcome. We first use a toy model consisting of a modified
Laughlin trial state to show that one can shape the anyons without altering the
exchange statistics under certain conditions. We then squeeze and braid anyons
in the Kapit-Mueller model and an interacting Hofstadter model by adding
suitable potentials. We consider a fixed system size, for which the charge
distributions of the normal anyons overlap, and we find that the outcome of the
exchange process is closer to the ideal value for the squeezed anyons. The time
needed for the exchange is also important, and for a particular example we find
that the duration needed for the process to be close to the adiabatic limit is
about five times longer for the squeezed anyons when the path length is the
same. Finally we show that the exchange outcome is robust with respect to small
modifications of the potential away from the optimized value.

feature integration on a sequence whose length is uncertain, via a mobile 3D

for several reasons: (i) they are typically expressed at a high abstraction
level where inter-event dependencies are hidden, (ii) NFPs are difficult to be
monitored in a decentralized way, and (iii) lack of effective decomposition
techniques. We address these issues by providing a formal framework for
decentralised monitoring of LTL formulas with quantitative operators. The
presented framework employs the tableau construction and a formula unwinding
technique (i.e., a transformation technique that preserves the semantics of the
original formula) to split and distribute the input LTL formula and the
corresponding quantitative constraint in a way such that monitoring can be
performed in a decentralised manner. The employment of these techniques allows
processes to detect early violations of monitored properties and perform some
corrective or recovery actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the

This work aims to help ST practitioners and researchers by empowering them with
systematic guidelines and a framework for designing and evaluating

this end, we conduct a literature review of 129 papers between 2008 and 2022,

we complement this paper with an open corpus and an online, adaptive

for automotive electronics. The prototype's results showed that providing
better data and information structure significantly increases the efficiency

important to the model prediction,~\eg foreground regions, or it can be safely
skipped, e.g. background regions. These gates can either be implemented as an
efficient network trained jointly with convolution kernels, or can simply skip
the residuals based on their magnitude. Gating functions can also incorporate
block-wise sparsity structures, as required for efficient implementation on
hardware platforms. By replacing all convolutions with Skip-Convolutions in two

show that developing efficient strategies for related singular stochastic

with respect to the sup-norm risk of objects associated to the invariant
distribution of ergodic processes which determine the theoretical solution of
the control problem. From a statistical perspective, we exploit the exponential
$\beta$-mixing property as the common factor of both scenarios to drive the
convergence analysis, indicating that relying on general stability properties
of Markov processes is a sufficiently powerful and flexible approach to treat
complex applications requiring statistical methods. We show moreover that in

uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions that take imperfect
channel estimation into account. More specifically, we consider large-scale
fading decoding and matched-filter receiver cooperation in the uplink. The
uplink performance of a small-cell (SC) system is derived for comparison. The
CF massive MIMO system achieves higher 95\%-likely uplink SE than the SC
system. In the downlink, the coherent transmission has four times higher
95\%-likely per-user SE than the non-coherent transmission. Statistical channel
cooperation power control (SCCPC) is used to mitigate the inter-user
interference. SCCPC performs better than full power transmission, but the
benefits are gradually weakened as the channel aging becomes stronger.
Furthermore, strong spatial correlation reduces the SE but degrades the effect
of channel aging. Increasing the number of antennas can improve the SE while
decreasing the energy efficiency. Finally, we use the maximum normalized
Doppler shift to design the SE-improved length of the resource block.
Simulation results are presented to validate the accuracy of our expressions
and prove that the CF massive MIMO system is more robust to channel aging than
the SC system.

impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied
whenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the

extreme events is key in the design of a system at an ultra-reliable regime of
operation. The strict constraint of ultra-reliability corresponds to the packet
error rate (PER) in the range of $10^{-9}-10^{-5}$ within the acceptable
latency on the order of milliseconds. Extreme value theory (EVT) is a robust
framework for modeling the statistical behavior of extreme events in the
channel data. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on EVT to model the
extreme events of a non-stationary wireless channel for the ultra-reliable
regime of operation. This methodology includes techniques for splitting the
channel data sequence into multiple groups concerning the environmental factors
causing non-stationarity, and fitting the lower tail distribution of the
received power in each group to the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). The
proposed approach also consists of optimally determining the time-varying
threshold over which the tail statistics are derived as a function of time, and
assessing the validity of the derived Pareto model. Finally, the proposed
approach chooses the best model with minimum complexity that represents the
time variation behavior of the non-stationary channel data sequence. Based on
the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea under various
engine vibrations and driving scenarios, we demonstrate the capability of the
proposed methodology in providing the best fit to the extremes of the
non-stationary data, significantly outperforming the channel modeling approach
in characterizing the extreme events with the stationary channel assumption.

small device structure that controls the position and number of skyrmions, but
that a complex device geometry changes the skyrmion behaviour, including
allowing skyrmions to form at lower applied magnetic fields than in simple

recovered to good approximation and at a reduced computational cost. Our
investigation highlights the importance of the frequency-dependent

weak coupling the fermion-spin-boson coupling suppresses the N\'eel temperature
of the DMFT approximation compared to the static mean-field, whereas for large
interaction it facilitates a huge enhancement of local spin-fluctuation
exchange, giving rise to the effective-exchange energy scale $4t^2/U$. We find
that parametrizations of the vertex which neglect the nontrivial part of the

adopted by integrating the traditional LDR noise model in the mmWave band. In

satisfy the joint constraints. The maximum achievable gain of a multi-user

investigated. Simulation results show that our design outperforms the HD system
with only a few RF chains at any LDR noise level. The advantage of having
amplitude control at the analog stage is also examined, and additional gain for
the mmWave FD system becomes evident when the number of RF chains at the hybrid

even under this bias polarization eventually vanishes (converges to zero) if
the influence graph is strongly-connected. If the influence graph is a regular

converge. Our more insightful result establishes that, under some natural

modality-shared appearance features cannot capture enough modality-invariant
discriminative information due to a massive discrepancy between RGB and
infrared images. To address this issue, on the top of appearance features, we
further capture the modality-invariant relations among different person parts
(referred to as modality-invariant relation features), which are the complement
to those modality-shared appearance features and help to identify persons with
similar appearances but different body shapes. To this end, a Multi-level
Two-streamed Modality-shared Feature Extraction (MTMFE) sub-network is
designed, where the modality-shared appearance features and modality-invariant
relation features are first extracted in a shared 2D feature space and a shared
3D feature space, respectively. The two features are then fused into the final
modality-shared features such that both cross-modality variations and
intra-modality variations can be reduced. Besides, a novel cross-modality
quadruplet loss is proposed to further reduce the cross-modality variations.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art algorithms by a noticeable margin.

based on two-stream structure or single-stream structure. The former one first
uses two sub-networks to extract unimodal features from RGB and depth images,
respectively, and then fuses them for SOD. While, the latter one directly
extracts multi-modal features from the input RGB-D images and then focuses on
exploiting cross-level complementary information. However, two-stream structure
based models inevitably require more parameters and single-stream structure
based ones cannot well exploit the cross-modal complementary information since
they ignore the modality difference. To address these issues, we propose to
employ the middle-level fusion structure for designing lightweight RGB-D SOD
model in this paper, which first employs two sub-networks to extract low- and
middle-level unimodal features, respectively, and then fuses those extracted
middle-level unimodal features for extracting corresponding high-level
multi-modal features in the subsequent sub-network. Different from existing
models, this structure can effectively exploit the cross-modal complementary
information and significantly reduce the network's parameters, simultaneously.
Therefore, a novel lightweight SOD model is designed, which contains a
information-aware multi-modal feature fusion (IMFF) module for effectively
capturing the cross-modal complementary information and a lightweight
feature-level and decision-level feature fusion (LFDF) module for aggregating
the feature-level and the decision-level saliency information in different
stages with less parameters. Our proposed model has only 3.9M parameters and
runs at 33 FPS. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets verify
the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over some
state-of-the-art methods.

timescales longer than a day) is a dominant noise source in exoplanet surveys
and results predominantly from surface manifestations of stellar magnetic
activity, namely faculae and spots. The implementation of faculae in lightcurve
models is an open problem, with scaling typically based on spectra equivalent
to hot stellar atmospheres or assuming a solar-derived facular contrast. We
modelled rotational (single period) lightcurves of active G2, K0, M0 and M2
stars, with Sun-like surface distributions and realistic limb-dependent
contrasts for faculae and spots. The sensitivity of lightcurve variability to
changes in model parameters such as stellar inclination, feature area coverage,
spot temperature, facular region magnetic flux density and active band
latitudes is explored. For our lightcurve modelling approach we used actress, a
geometrically accurate model for stellar variability. actress generates
2-sphere maps representing stellar surfaces and populates them with
user-prescribed spot and facular region distributions. From this, lightcurves
can be calculated at any inclination. Quiet star limb darkening and
limb-dependent facular contrasts were derived from MURaM 3D magnetoconvection
simulations using ATLAS9. 1D stellar atmosphere models were used for the spot
contrasts. We applied actress in Monte-Carlo simulations, calculating
lightcurve variability amplitudes in the Kepler band. We found that, for a
given spectral type and stellar inclination, spot temperature and spot area
coverage have the largest effect on variability of all simulation parameters.
For a spot coverage of 1%, the typical variability of a solar-type star is
around 2 parts-per-thousand. The presence of faculae clearly affects the mean
brightness and lightcurve shape, but has relatively little influence on the
variability.

we show that this reset energy can be reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude
by minimizing the pulse width. We utilize a high-speed measurement setup to
probe the energy consumption in PCM cells with varying pulse width (0.3 to 40
nanoseconds) and uncover the power dissipation dynamics. A key finding is that
the switching power (P) remains unchanged for pulses wider than a short thermal
time constant of the PCM ($\tau$$_t$$_h$ < 1 ns in 50 nm diameter device),
resulting in a decrease of energy (E=P$\tau$) as the pulse width $\tau$ is
reduced in that range. In other words, thermal confinement during short pulses
is achieved by limiting the heat diffusion time. Our improved programming
scheme reduces reset energy density below 0.1 nJ/$\mu$m$^2$, over an order of

synchronization dynamics of oscillatory systems is the phase reduction for
weakly perturbed limit-cycle oscillators, which allows us to simplify nonlinear
dynamical models exhibiting stable limit-cycle oscillations to a simple
one-dimensional phase equation. Recently, the classical phase reduction method
has been generalized to infinite-dimensional oscillatory systems such as
spatially extended systems and time-delayed systems, and also to include
amplitude degrees of freedom representing deviations of the system state from
the unperturbed limit cycle. In this chapter, we discuss the method of
phase-amplitude reduction for spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems

corresponding Gibbs free energy. As shown in $G_L-r_+$ curve at the phase
transition temperature, there exist double wells with the same depth, providing
further support on the finding in the former literature. By numerically solving
the Fokker-Planck equation with both the initial condition and reflecting
boundary condition imposed, we probe the probabilistic evolution of charged AdS
black holes surrounded by quintessence. The peak denoting the initial black
hole state gradually decreases while the other peak starts to grow from zero,
approaching to be a stationary distribution in the long time limit with two
peaks denoting the large and small black holes respectively. We also study the
first passage process of charged AdS black holes surrounded by quintessence and
discuss the relevant quantities. We resolve the Fokker-Planck equation by
adding the absorbing boundary condition for the intermediate transition state.
It is shown intuitively that the peaks located at the large (small) black hole
decay very rapidly, irrespective of the initial black hole state. In all the
procedures above, we have compared the cases with different choices of the
state parameter of quintessence dark energy $\omega_q$. The larger $\omega_q$
is, the faster the initial black hole state decays, showing the effect of

quantum dots, is made possible by the ring-shaped geometry of the confining

We study the 27-day variations of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) based on
neutron monitor (NM), ACE/CRIS, STEREO and SOHO/EPHIN measurements, in solar
minima 23/24 and 24/25 characterized by the opposite polarities of solar
magnetic cycle. Now there is an opportunity to reanalyze the polarity
dependence of the amplitudes of the recurrent GCR variations in 2007-2009 for
negative A < 0 solar magnetic polarity and to compare it with the clear
periodic variations related to solar rotation in 2017-2019 for positive A > 0.
Methods. We use the Fourier analysis method to study the periodicity in the GCR
fluxes. Since the GCR recurrence is a consequence of solar rotation, we analyze
not only GCR fluxes, but also solar and heliospheric parameters examining the
relationships between the 27-day GCR variations and heliospheric, as well as,
solar wind parameters. Results. We find that the polarity dependence of the
amplitudes of the 27-day variations of the GCR intensity and anisotropy for NMs
data is kept for the last two solar minima: 23/24 (2007-2009) and 24/25
(2017-2019) with greater amplitudes in positive A > 0 solar magnetic polarity.
ACE/CRIS, SOHO/EPHIN and STEREO measurements are not governed by this principle
of greater amplitudes in positive A > 0 polarity. GCR recurrence caused by the
solar rotation for low energy (< 1GeV) cosmic rays is more sensitive to the
enhanced diffusion effects, resulting in the same level of the 27-day
amplitudes for positive and negative polarities. While high energy (> 1GeV)
cosmic rays registered by NMs, are more sensitive to the large-scale drift
effect leading to the 22-year Hale cycle in the 27-day GCR variation, with the
larger amplitudes in the A > 0 polarity than in the A < 0.

aims to derive information on the infection dynamics by monitoring virus

fluctuations of the viral signal in the wastewater (due to e.g., dilution;
transport and fate processes in sewer system; variation in the number of
persons discharging; variations in virus excretion and water consumption per
day) the subsequent prevalence analysis may result in misleading conclusions.
It is thus helpful to apply data filtering techniques to reduce the noise in
the signal. In this paper we investigate 13 smoothing algorithms applied to the
virus signals monitored in four wastewater treatment plants in Austria. The
parameters of the algorithms have been defined by an optimization procedure
aiming for performance metrics. The results are further investigated by means
of a cluster analysis. While all algorithms are in principle applicable,
SPLINE, Generalized Additive Model and Friedman Super Smoother are recognized
as superior methods in this context (with the latter two having a tendency to
over-smoothing). A first analysis of the resulting datasets indicates the
influence of catchment size for wastewater-based epidemiology as smaller
communities both reveal a signal threshold before any relation with infection
dynamics is visible and also a higher sensitivity towards infection clusters.

for its decisions, be able to infer the purpose of observed behaviour, and be
able to explain its decisions in the context of what its audience understands
and intends. To address these issues we present four novel contributions.
Firstly, we define an arbitrary task in terms of perceptual states, and discuss
two extremes of a domain of possible solutions. Secondly, we define the
intensional solution. Optimal by some definitions of intelligence, it describes
the purpose of a task. An agent possessed of it has a rationale for its
decisions in terms of that purpose, expressed in a perceptual symbol system
grounded in hardware. Thirdly, to communicate that rationale requires natural
language, a means of encoding and decoding perceptual states. We propose a
theory of meaning in which, to acquire language, an agent should model the
world a language describes rather than the language itself. If the utterances
of humans are of predictive value to the agent's goals, then the agent will
imbue those utterances with meaning in terms of its own goals and perceptual
states. In the context of Peircean semiotics, a community of agents must share
rough approximations of signs, referents and interpretants in order to
communicate. Meaning exists only in the context of intent, so to communicate
with humans an agent must have comparable experiences and goals. An agent that
learns intensional solutions, compelled by objective functions somewhat
analogous to human motivators such as hunger and pain, may be capable of
explaining its rationale not just in terms of its own intent, but in terms of
what its audience understands and intends. It forms some approximation of the
perceptual states of humans.

avalanches and jet zonal flows in L-mode tokamak plasma, the so-called ""plasma
staircase."" The jet zonal flows are considered as a wave packet of coupled
nonlinear oscillators characterized by a complex time- and wave-number
dependent wave function; in a mean-field approximation this function is argued
to obey a discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with subquadratic power
nonlinearity. It is shown that the subquadratic power leads directly to a white
L\'evy noise, and to a L\'evy-fractional Fokker-Planck equation for radial
transport of test particles (via wave-particle interactions). In a
self-consistent description the avalanches, which are driven by the white
L\'evy noise, interact with the jet zonal flows, which form a system of
semi-permeable barriers to radial transport. We argue that the plasma staircase
saturates at a state of marginal stability, in whose vicinity the avalanches
undergo an ever-pursuing localization-delocalization transition. At the
transition point, the event-size distribution of the avalanches is found to be
a power-law $w_\tau (\Delta n) \sim \Delta n^{-\tau}$, with the drop-off
exponent $\tau = ({\sqrt{17}} + 1)/{2} \simeq 2.56$. This value is an exact
result of the self-consistent model. The edge behavior bears signatures
enabling to associate it with the dynamics of a self-organized critical (SOC)
state. At the same time the critical exponents, pertaining to this state, are
found to be inconsistent with classic models of avalanche transport based on
sand-piles and their generalizations, suggesting that the coupled avalanche-jet
zonal flow system operates on different organizing principles. The results
obtained have been validated in a numerical simulation of the plasma staircase
using flux-driven gyrokinetic code for L-mode Tore-Supra plasma.

strong space-charge effect in a low-energy electron beam (5 MeV) is the main
obstacle in acquiring coherent gain through the ICS mechanism with a
10-micrometer laser. Subsequently, it is shown that by confining the electron
beam at the field nodes of an optical cavity, the space-charge effect is
compensated, and additionally, the ultrahigh charge density enables high
FEL-gain at confinement spots. The full-wave numerical simulations predict
enhancement of about three orders of magnitude in the radiation efficiency when
ICS is carried out with confined electrons compared to free electrons. These

GRAPES implements a weight-distribution dependent modulation of the error

it asks for high eccentricities to be acquired during the migration of the
giant planets. By adopting eccentricity and inclination damping formulae based
on hydrodynamical simulations (instead of the K-prescription), we have carried
out 20 000 numerical simulations, where we vary the initial planetary
eccentricities, the migration rate, and the dispersal time of the gas disc. Our
results confirm that highly mutually inclined systems are unlikely to be
produced by an inclination-type resonance of two migrating giant planets.
However, in ~1 per cent of the simulations, inclination-type resonance is
observed, and a dynamical study of the evolutions reveals that the
inclination-type resonance mechanism operates in three cases: (i) when the

18 repeaters and 12 non-repeating FRBs observed in the frequency bands of
400-800 MHz from CHIME. We investigated the distributions of FRB
isotropic-equivalent radio luminosity, considering the K correction.
Statistically, the luminosity distribution can be better fitted by Gaussian
form than by power-law. Based on the above results, together with the observed
FRB event rate, pulse duration, and radio luminosity, FRB origin models are
evaluated and constrained such that the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be excluded
for the non-repeaters while magnetars or neutron stars (NSs) emitting the
supergiant pulses are preferred for the repeaters. We also found the necessity
of a small FRB emission beaming solid angle (about 0.1 sr) from magnetars that

enforcing the optimum solution. But how should networks be designed to cope
with selfish agents that own parts of the network? In this setting, agents will
deviate from a minimum cost network if this decreases their individual cost.
Hence, designed networks should be both efficient in terms of total cost and
stable in terms of the agents' willingness to accept the network.
  We study this novel type of Network Design problem by investigating the
creation of $(\beta,\gamma)$-networks, that are in $\beta$-approximate Nash
equilibrium and have a total cost of at most $\gamma$ times the optimal cost,
for the recently proposed Euclidean Generalized Network Creation Game by Bil\`o
et al. [SPAA 2019]. There, $n$ agents corresponding to points in Euclidean
space create costly edges among themselves to optimize their centrality in the
created network. Our main result is a simple $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$-time algorithm
that computes a $(\beta,\beta)$-network with low $\beta$ for any given set of
points. Moreover, on integer grid point sets or random point sets our algorithm
achieves a low constant $\beta$. Besides these results, we discuss a
generalization of our algorithm to instances with arbitrary, even non-metric,
edge lengths. Moreover, we show that no such positive results are possible when
focusing on either optimal networks or perfectly stable networks as in both
cases NP-hard problems arise, there exist instances with very unstable optimal

This data labeling bottleneck may be intensified due to domain shifts among

standard SSL setting (no domain shift, a few human-labeled data) and under
virtual-to-real domain shift (many virtual-world labeled data, no human-labeled

show stability, one internal, one co-orbital, and external to the host planet
Kepler-1647b. Within the limits of these three regions, we performed numerical
simulations of planetary formation. In the regions inner and outer to the
planet, we used two different density profiles to explore different conditions
of formation. In the co-orbital region, we used eight different values of total
disc mass. We showed that many resonances are located within regions causing
much of the disc material to be ejected before a planet is formed. Thus, the
system might have two asteroid belts with Kirkwood gaps, similar to the Solar
System\'s main belt of asteroids. The co-orbital region proved to be extremely
sensitive, not allowing the planet formation, but showing that this binary

from the outer disk regions, carrying water ice with them. At the water ice
line, the water ice on the inward drifting pebbles evaporates and is released
into the gas phase, resulting in water-rich gas and dry pebbles that move into
the inner disk regions. Large planetary cores can block the inward drifting
pebbles by forming a pressure bump outside their orbit in the protoplanetary
disk. Depending on the relative position of a growing planetary core relative
to the water ice line, water-rich pebbles might be blocked outside or inside
the water ice line. Pebbles blocked outside the water ice line do not evaporate
and thus do not release their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in a
dry inner disk, while pebbles blocked inside the water ice line release their
water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in water vapor diffusing into the
inner disk. As a consequence, close-in sub-Neptunes that accrete some gas from
the disk should be dry or wet, respectively, if outer gas giants are outside or
inside the water ice line, assuming that giant planets form fast, as has been
suggested for Jupiter in our Solar System. Alternatively, a sub-Neptune could
form outside the water ice line, accreting a large amount of icy pebbles and
then migrating inward as a very wet sub-Neptune. We suggest that the water
content of inner sub-Neptunes in systems with giant planets that can
efficiently block the inward drifting pebbles could constrain the formation

widely used approach in optimization problems where sparsity of the regressors
is desired. This formulation is fundamental for many applications in signal
processing, machine learning and control. As a motivating problem, we
investigate a sparse data predictive control problem, run at a cloud service to
control a system with unknown model, using L1-regularization to limit the
behavior complexity. The input-output data collected for the system is
privacy-sensitive, hence, we design a privacy-preserving solution using
homomorphically encrypted data. The main challenges are the non-smoothness of
the L1-norm, which is difficult to evaluate on encrypted data, as well as the
iterative nature of the Lasso problem. We use a distributed ADMM formulation
that enables us to exchange substantial local computation for little
communication between multiple servers. We first give an encrypted multi-party
protocol for solving the distributed Lasso problem, by approximating the
non-smooth part with a Chebyshev polynomial, evaluating it on encrypted data,
and using a more cost effective distributed bootstrapping operation. For the
example of data predictive control, we prefer a non-homogeneous splitting of
the data for better convergence. We give an encrypted multi-party protocol for
this non-homogeneous splitting of the Lasso problem to a non-homogeneous set of
servers: one powerful server and a few less powerful devices, added for
security reasons. Finally, we provide numerical results for our proposed

shown that the beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope can be used
for targeted manipulation of individual atoms. However, the process is highly
dynamic in nature and proceeds via a large number of weakly-understood
individual steps. Hence, harnessing an electron beam towards atomic assembly
requires automated methods to control the parameters and positioning of the
beam in such a way as to fabricate atomic-scale structures reliably. Here, we
create a molecular dynamics environment wherein individual atom velocities can
be modified, effectively simulating a beam-induced interaction, and apply
reinforcement learning to model construction of specific atomic units
consisting of Si dopant atoms on a graphene lattice. We find that it is
possible to engineer the reward function of the agent in such a way as to
encourage formation of local clusters of dopants, whilst at the same time
minimizing the amplitude of momentum changes. Inspection of the learned
policies indicates that of fundamental importance is the component of velocity
perpendicular to the material plane, and further, that the high stochasticity
of the environment leads to conservative policies. This study shows the
potential for reinforcement learning agents trained in simulated environments

In this paper, a novel approach for recognizing unsegmented actions in online

to build a three-layer cognitive architecture. The unique features of an action
sequence are represented as a series of elicited key activations by the
first-layer self-organizing map. An average length of a key activation vector
is calculated for all action sequences in a training set and adjusted in
learning trials to generate input patterns to the second-layer self-organizing
map. The pattern vectors are clustered in the second layer, and the clusters
are then labeled by an action identity in the third layer neural network. The
experiment results show that although the performance drops slightly in online
experiments compared to the offline tests, the ability of the proposed
architecture to deal with the unsegmented action sequences as well as the
online performance makes the system more plausible and practical in real-case

condition is imposed as a constraint on the auxiliary variables treated as
degrees of freedom of zero inertia driven by the physical system. The method is
formulated in the Lagrangian framework, enabling the properties of the approach
to emerge naturally from a fully consistent dynamical and statistical
viewpoint. We begin by presenting MaZe for typical minimization problems where
the imposed constraints are holonomic and summarizing its key formal
properties, notably the exact Born-Oppenheimer dynamics followed by the
physical variables and the exact sampling of the corresponding physical
probability density. We then generalize the approach to the case of conditions
on the auxiliary variables that linearly involve their velocities. Such
conditions occur, for example, when describing systems in external magnetic

Poor adherence is a particular problem for patients with chronic diseases

collect information about patient adherence are resource-intensive or do not
successfully detect low-adherers with high accuracy. Acknowledging that health
measures recorded at clinic visits are more reliably recorded than a patient's
adherence, we have developed an approach to infer medication adherence rates
based on longitudinally recorded health measures that are likely impacted by
time-varying adherence behaviors. Our framework permits the inclusion of
baseline health characteristics and socio-demographic data. We employ a modular
inferential approach. First, we fit a two-component model on a training set of
patients who have detailed adherence data obtained from electronic medication
monitoring. One model component predicts adherence behaviors only from baseline
health and socio-demographic information, and the other predicts longitudinal
health measures given the adherence and baseline health measures. Posterior

algorithm applied to a new set of patients for whom no adherence data are

  to mitigate false alarms for handgun detection in video-surveillance",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the constant advances in computer vision, integrating modern
single-image detectors in real-time handgun alarm systems in video-surveillance
is still debatable. Using such detectors still implies a high number of false
alarms and false negatives. In this context, most existent studies select one
of the latest single-image detectors and train it on a better dataset or use
some pre-processing, post-processing or data-fusion approach to further reduce
false alarms. However, none of these works tried to exploit the temporal
information present in the videos to mitigate false detections. This paper
presents a new system, called MULTI Confirmation-level Alarm SysTem based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM)
(MULTICAST), that leverages not only the spacial information but also the
temporal information existent in the videos for a more reliable handgun
detection. MULTICAST consists of three stages, i) a handgun detection stage,
ii) a CNN-based spacial confirmation stage and iii) LSTM-based temporal
confirmation stage. The temporal confirmation stage uses the positions of the
detected handgun in previous instants to predict its trajectory in the next
frame. Our experiments show that MULTICAST reduces by 80% the number of false
alarms with respect to Faster R-CNN based-single-image detector, which makes it
more useful in providing more effective and rapid security responses.

effort to find exoplanets and map bright transient optical phenomena.
Supernovae (SN) are particularly interesting as cosmological standard candles
for cosmological distance measures. The limiting magnitude of TESS strongly
constrains supernova detection to the very nearby Universe ($m \sim$ 19,
$z<0.05$). We explore the possibility that more distant supernovae that are
gravitationally lensed and magnified by a foreground galaxy can be detected by
TESS, an opportunity to measure the time delay between light paths and
constrain the Hubble constant independently.
  We estimate the rate of occurrence of such systems, assuming reasonable
distributions of magnification, host dust attenuation and redshift. There are
approximately 16 type Ia and 43 core-collapse SN (SNcc) expected to be
observable with TESS each year, which translates to 18% and 43% chance of
detection per year, respectively. Monitoring the largest collections of known
strong galaxy-galaxy lenses from Petrillo et al., this translates into 0.6% and
1.3% chances of a SNIa and SNcc per year. The TESS all-sky detection rates are
lower than those of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Vera Rubin
Observatory. However, on the ecliptic poles, TESS performs almost as well as
its all-sky search thanks to its continuous coverage: 2 and 4% chance of an
observed SN (Ia or cc) each year. These rates argue for timely processing of
full-frame TESS imaging to facilitate follow-up and should motivate further
searches for low-redshift lensing system.

like motility induced phase separation (MIPS) observed in repulsive active

asymmetric shape, mass distribution or catalysis coating can induce an active
torque on the particle, which makes it a chiral active particle. Here using
computer simulations and dynamic mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the
large enough torque of circle active Brownian particles (cABPs) in two
dimensions generates a dynamical clustering state interrupting the conventional
MIPS. Multiple clusters arise from the combination of the conventional MIPS
cohesion, and the circulating current caused disintegration. The non-vanishing
current in non-equilibrium steady states microscopically originates from the
motility ``relieved'' by automatic rotation, which breaks the detailed balance
at the continuum level. This suggests that no equilibrium-like phase separation
theory can be constructed for chiral active colloids even with tiny active
torque, in which no visible collective motion exists. This mechanism also sheds
light on the understanding of dynamic clusters observed in a variety of active
matter systems.

point where the symmetric vacuum bifurcates in energetically degenerate

lower limit, identified as the temperature value at which the spontaneous

major area of research. Many authors have reported evidence for so-called ""$Q

symmetry that is uniform in space. Not all these observations are well
understood and new experimental probes are needed. Here we use resonant soft
x-ray scattering (RSXS) to search for $Q \sim 0$ order in
Bi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) by measuring the region of a
forbidden Bragg peak, $(0,0,3)$, which is normally extinguished by symmetry but
may become allowed on resonance if valence band order is present. Using
circularly polarized light, we found that this reflection becomes allowed on
the Cu $L_3$ resonance for temperatures $T_c < T < T^\ast$, though remains
absent in linear polarization and at other temperatures. This observation
suggests the existence of spatially uniform valence band order near the
pseudogap temperature. In addition, we observed periodic oscillations in the
specular reflectivity from the sample surface that resemble thin film
interference fringes, though no known film is present. These fringes are highly
resonant, appear in all polarizations, and exhibit a period that depends on the
location where the beam strikes the sample surface. We speculate that these
fringes arise from interaction between some intrinsic valence band instability
and extrinsic structural surface morphologies of the material. Our study
supports the existence of some kind of $Q \sim 0$ broken symmetry state in
Bi-2212 at intermediate temperatures, and calls for further study using a
microfocused beam that could disentangle microscopic effects from macroscopic
heterogeneities.

symmetries) and/or the data generation process may be a composite process that
yields useful intermediate or auxiliary information in addition to the value of
the optimization objective. However, surrogate models traditionally employed in
BO, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), scale poorly with dataset size and do not
easily accommodate known structure. Instead, we use Bayesian neural networks, a
class of scalable and flexible surrogate models with inductive biases, to
extend BO to complex, structured problems with high dimensionality. We
demonstrate BO on a number of realistic problems in physics and chemistry,
including topology optimization of photonic crystal materials using
convolutional neural networks, and chemical property optimization of molecules
using graph neural networks. On these complex tasks, we show that neural
networks often outperform GPs as surrogate models for BO in terms of both

game analysis, sports like hockey, tennis and polo may require additional
detections, that include the object the player is holding (e.g. racket, stick).
The baseline solution for this problem involves detecting these objects as
separate classes, and matching them to player detections based on the
intersection over union (IoU). This approach, however, leads to poor matching
performance in crowded situations, as it does not model the relationship
between players and objects. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient
way to detect and match players and related objects at once without extra cost,
by considering an implicit association for prediction of multiple objects

ice hockey videos, and also a new public dataset we introduce called COCO

The bandwidth-reduced SBS gain spectrum is detected by the sweep optical
signals at different specific time, mapping the RF frequencies to the time
domain. An experiment is performed. RF frequencies from 0.3 to 7.6 GHz are
simultaneously measured with a root mean square error of less than 1 MHz. In

relations that connect the moment of inertia, the spin-induced quadrupole
moment, and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. In this paper, we study
the I-Love-Q relations for superfluid neutron stars for a general relativistic
two-fluid model: one fluid being the neutron superfluid and the other a
conglomerate of all charged components. We study to what extent the two-fluid
dynamics might affect the robustness of the I-Love-Q relations by using a
simple two-component polytropic model and a relativistic mean field model with
entrainment for the equation-of-state. Our results depend crucially on the spin
ratio $\Omega_{\rm n}/\Omega_{\rm p}$ between the angular velocities of the
neutron superfluid and the normal component. We find that the I-Love-Q
relations can still be satisfied to high accuracy for superfluid neutron stars
as long as the two fluids are nearly co-rotating $\Omega_{\rm n}/\Omega_{\rm p}
\approx 1$. However, the deviations from the I-Love-Q relations increase as the
spin ratio deviates from unity. In particular, the deviation of the Q-Love
relation can be as large as $O(10\%)$ if $\Omega_{\rm n}/\Omega_{\rm p}$ differ
from unity by a few tens of percent. As $\Omega_{\rm n}/\Omega_{\rm p} \approx
1$ is expected for realistic neutron stars, our results suggest that the
two-fluid dynamics should not affect the accuracy of any gravitational waveform
models for neutron star binaries that employ the relation to connect the
spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability.

  Exploration","Accepted by CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Text-based image captioning (TextCap) which aims to read and reason images
with texts is crucial for a machine to understand a detailed and complex scene
environment, considering that texts are omnipresent in daily life. This task,
however, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and
visual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing
methods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve
this task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global
caption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information
cannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we
seek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of
an image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1)
it is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase;
2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts
in an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still
an open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method.
Specifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid
more attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor,
we group its relevant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph
(ACG). Last, based on different ACGs, we conduct multi-view caption generation
to improve the content diversity of generated captions. Experimental results
show that our method not only achieves SOTA performance but also generates
diverse captions to describe images.

winter season (deltaT = ~1.15 C) than in other seasons (average warming effect
for these seasons deltaT = ~0.95 C). We show that a centenary warming is mainly
related to the change of solar activity (estimated by sunspot numbers (SSN) and
total solar irradiance (TSI)); particularly, a time interval about ~70 years
(1890-1960), when a correlation coefficients between 11 years smoothed SSN and
T, and TSI and T are high, r = 0.66+/-0.07 and r = 0.73+/-0.07 for Poland and r

solar activity contributes decisively in the global warming. We show that a
global warming effect equals zero based on the temperature T data in Poland for
period 1781-1880, when human activities were relatively less than in 1881-2016.
We recognize a few feeble ~20+/-3 years disturbances in the temperature changes

magnetic cycles. We distinguish the fluctuations of ~7-8 years in Poland's T
