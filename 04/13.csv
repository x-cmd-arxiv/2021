problems, we define several hard problems in Entropoid based cryptography, such
as Discrete Entropoid Logarithm Problem (DELP), Computational Entropoid
Diffie-Hellman problem (CEDHP), and Decisional Entropoid Diffie-Hellman Problem
(DEDHP). We post a conjecture that DEDHP is hard in Sylow $q$-subquasigroups.
Next, we instantiate an entropoid Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Due to
the non-commutativity and non-associativity, the entropoid based cryptographic
primitives are supposed to be resistant to quantum algorithms. At the same
time, due to the proposed succinct notation for the power indices, the
communication overhead in the entropoid based Diffie-Hellman key exchange is
very low: for 128 bits of security, 64 bytes in total are communicated in both
directions, and for 256 bits of security, 128 bytes in total are communicated
in both directions.
  Our final contribution is in proposing two entropoid based digital signature
schemes. The schemes are constructed with the Fiat-Shamir transformation of an
identification scheme which security relies on a new hardness assumption:
computing roots in finite entropoids is hard. If this assumption withstands the
time's test, the first proposed signature scheme has excellent properties: for
the classical security levels between 128 and 256 bits, the public and private
key sizes are between 32 and 64, and the signature sizes are between 64 and 128
bytes. The second signature scheme reduces the finding of the roots in finite
entropoids to computing discrete entropoid logarithms. In our opinion, this is
a safer but more conservative design, and it pays the price in doubling the key
sizes and the signature sizes.
  We give a proof-of-concept implementation in SageMath 9.2 for all proposed
algorithms and schemes in an appendix.

semantic frames that will occur in the next 10, 100, or even 1,000 sentences in
a running story. Prior work focused on predicting the immediate future of a
story, such as one to a few sentences ahead. However, when novelists write long
stories, generating a few sentences is not enough to help them gain high-level
insight to develop the follow-up story. In this paper, we formulate a long
story as a sequence of ""story blocks,"" where each block contains a fixed number
of sentences (e.g., 10, 100, or 200). This formulation allows us to predict the
follow-up story arc beyond the scope of a few sentences. We represent a story
block using the term frequencies (TF) of semantic frames in it, normalized by
each frame's inverse document frequency (IDF). We conduct semantic frame
forecast experiments on 4,794 books from the Bookcorpus and 7,962 scientific
abstracts from CODA-19, with block sizes ranging from 5 to 1,000 sentences. The
results show that automated models can forecast the follow-up story blocks
better than the random, prior, and replay baselines, indicating the task's
feasibility. We also learn that the models using the frame representation as
features outperform all the existing approaches when the block size is over 150

of work in supervised learning have shown the importance of model
overparameterization in the convergence of the gradient descent (GD) to
globally optimal solutions. In contrast, the unsupervised setting and GANs in
particular involve non-convex concave mini-max optimization problems that are
often trained using Gradient Descent/Ascent (GDA). The role and benefits of
model overparameterization in the convergence of GDA to a global saddle point
in non-convex concave problems is far less understood. In this work, we present
a comprehensive analysis of the importance of model overparameterization in
GANs both theoretically and empirically. We theoretically show that in an
overparameterized GAN model with a $1$-layer neural network generator and a
linear discriminator, GDA converges to a global saddle point of the underlying
non-convex concave min-max problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first result for global convergence of GDA in such settings. Our theory is
based on a more general result that holds for a broader class of nonlinear
generators and discriminators that obey certain assumptions (including deeper
generators and random feature discriminators). We also empirically study the
role of model overparameterization in GANs using several large-scale
experiments on CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A datasets. Our experiments show that
overparameterization improves the quality of generated samples across various
model architectures and datasets. Remarkably, we observe that
overparameterization leads to faster and more stable convergence behavior of
GDA across the board.

\[\mathrm{diam} (G_n)=O\left(|V_n|^{1/(1+\epsilon)}\right) \text{ as

for Bernoulli bond percolation. More precisely, we prove under these conditions
that for each $0<\alpha <1$ there exists $p_c(\alpha)<1$ such that for each
$p\geq p_c(\alpha)$, Bernoulli-$p$ bond percolation on $G_n$ has a cluster of
size at least $\alpha |V_n|$ with probability tending to $1$ as $n\to \infty$.
In fact, we prove more generally that there exists a universal constant $a$

  We also prove a generalization of this result to quasitransitive graph
sequences with a bounded number of vertex orbits and prove that one may indeed
take $a=1$ when the graphs $G_n$ are all Cayley graphs of Abelian groups. A key
step in our proof is to adapt the methods of Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi,
Severo, and Yadin from infinite graphs to finite graphs. This adaptation also
leads to an isoperimetric criterion for infinite graphs to have a nontrivial
uniqueness phase (i.e., to have $p_u<1$) which is of independent interest. We
also prove that the set of possible values of the critical probability of an
infinite quasitransitive graph has a gap at $1$ in the sense that for every
$k,n<\infty$ there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that every infinite graph $G$ of

Positive Operator Valued Measures (POVMs) in dimension $d$ using only classical
resources and a single ancillary qubit. Our method is based on the
probabilistic implementation of $d$-outcome measurements which is followed by
postselection of some of the received outcomes. We conjecture that the success
probability of our scheme is larger than a constant independent of $d$ for all
POVMs in dimension $d$. Crucially, this conjecture implies the possibility of
realizing arbitrary nonadaptive quantum measurement protocol on a
$d$-dimensional system using a single auxiliary qubit with only a
\emph{constant} overhead in sampling complexity. We show that the conjecture
holds for typical rank-one Haar-random POVMs in arbitrary dimensions.
Furthermore, we carry out extensive numerical computations showing success
probability above a constant for a variety of extremal POVMs, including
SIC-POVMs in dimension up to 1299. Finally, we argue that our scheme can be
favourable for the experimental realization of POVMs, as noise compounding in
circuits required by our scheme is typically substantially lower than in the
standard scheme that directly uses Naimark's dilation theorem.

based on certain observed context to maximize the cumulative reward over
iterations. Recently there have been a few studies using a deep neural network
(DNN) to predict the expected reward for an action, and the DNN is trained by a
stochastic gradient based method. However, convergence analysis has been
greatly ignored to examine whether and where these methods converge. In this
work, we formulate the SCB that uses a DNN reward function as a non-convex
stochastic optimization problem, and design a stage-wise stochastic gradient
descent algorithm to optimize the problem and determine the action policy. We
prove that with high probability, the action sequence chosen by this algorithm
converges to a greedy action policy respecting a local optimal reward function.
Extensive experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and

induces a monotone-light factorization system that we characterize, and it is
then possible to describe the coverings in V-Grp. We next classify these
coverings as internal actions of a Galois groupoid. Finally, we observe that
the subcategory of separated V-groups is also a torsion-free subcategory for a
pretorsion theory whose torsion subcategory is the one of symmetric V-groups.
As recently proved by Clementino and Montoli, this latter category is actually

both clusters. The comparison of the radio source catalogues between the two

significance. We derived the radio luminosity function at 1.28 GHz in both

  Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO
  2021)",,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose optimisers that come with
several parameters like the sizes of parent and offspring populations or the
mutation rate. It is well known that the performance of EAs may depend
drastically on these parameters. Recent theoretical studies have shown that
self-adjusting parameter control mechanisms that tune parameters during the
algorithm run can provably outperform the best static parameters in EAs on
discrete problems. However, the majority of these studies concerned elitist EAs
and we do not have a clear answer on whether the same mechanisms can be applied
for non-elitist EAs.
  We study one of the best-known parameter control mechanisms, the one-fifth
success rule, to control the offspring population size $\lambda$ in the
non-elitist $(1,\lambda)$ EA. It is known that the $(1,\lambda)$ EA has a sharp
threshold with respect to the choice of $\lambda$ where the expected runtime on
the benchmark function OneMax changes from polynomial to exponential time.
Hence, it is not clear whether parameter control mechanisms are able to find
and maintain suitable values of $\lambda$.
  For OneMax we show that the answer crucially depends on the success rate $s$
(i.\,e.\ a one-$(s+1)$-th success rule). We prove that, if the success rate is
appropriately small, the self-adjusting $(1,\lambda)$ EA optimises OneMax in
$O(n)$ expected generations and $O(n \log n)$ expected evaluations, the best
possible runtime for any unary unbiased black-box algorithm. A small success
rate is crucial: we also show that if the success rate is too large, the
algorithm has an exponential runtime on OneMax and other functions with similar
characteristics.

to potentially changing dynamics when transferring a policy to the online

this paper we address this problem with Augmented World Models (AugWM). We
augment a learned dynamics model with simple transformations that seek to
capture potential changes in physical properties of the robot, leading to more
robust policies. We not only train our policy in this new setting, but also
provide it with the sampled augmentation as a context, allowing it to adapt to
changes in the environment. At test time we learn the context in a
self-supervised fashion by approximating the augmentation which corresponds to
the new environment. We rigorously evaluate our approach on over 100 different
changed dynamics settings, and show that this simple approach can significantly
improve the zero-shot generalization of a recent state-of-the-art baseline,
often achieving successful policies where the baseline fails.

Mandelstam-Tamm limit constrains the evolution at all times, and a second where
a crossover to the Margolus-Levitin limit is manifested at longer times. We
take a geometric approach to quantify the deviation from the speed limit,
measuring how much the matter wave's quantum evolution deviates from the

establishing quantum speed limits beyond the simple two-level system, are
important to understand the ultimate performance of quantum computing devices

recent meta-research revealed major flaws with respect to algorithm validation.
Performance metrics are particularly key for meaningful, objective, and
transparent performance assessment and validation of the used automatic
algorithms, but relatively little attention has been given to the practical
pitfalls when using specific metrics for a given image analysis task. These are
typically related to (1) the disregard of inherent metric properties, such as
the behaviour in the presence of class imbalance or small target structures,
(2) the disregard of inherent data set properties, such as the non-independence
of the test cases, and (3) the disregard of the actual biomedical domain
interest that the metrics should reflect. This living dynamically document has
the purpose to illustrate important limitations of performance metrics commonly
applied in the field of image analysis. In this context, it focuses on
biomedical image analysis problems that can be phrased as image-level
classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, or object
detection task. The current version is based on a Delphi process on metrics
conducted by an international consortium of image analysis experts from more
than 60 institutions worldwide.

well-suited set of action-angle coordinates to solve the dynamics, showing that
the well-known Kepler equation and eccentric anomaly parametrisation are valid
for any isochrone orbit (and not just Keplerian ellipses). Second, by using the
powerful machinery of Birkhoff normal forms, we provide a self-consistent proof
of the isochrone theorem, that relates isochrone potentials to parabolae in the
plane, which is the basis of all literature on the subject. Along the way, we
show how some fundamental results of celestial mechanics such as the Bertrand
theorem and Kepler's third law are naturally encoded in the formalism.

58 counties, we find that when full information is known on invasion status and

performance remains relatively high using different network metrics or with
less information (median above 80% and lower quartile above 60% of optimal for

Additionally, performance is generally stable across counties with varying lake

ideas of fine-tuning, transfer learning, and generative model-based training
data augmentation towards improving fruit quality image classification. A
linear network topology search is performed to tune a VGG16 lemon quality
classification model using a publicly-available dataset of 2690 images. We find
that appending a 4096 neuron fully connected layer to the convolutional layers
leads to an image classification accuracy of 83.77%. We then train a
Conditional Generative Adversarial Network on the training data for 2000
epochs, and it learns to generate relatively realistic images. Grad-CAM
analysis of the model trained on real photographs shows that the synthetic
images can exhibit classifiable characteristics such as shape, mould, and
gangrene. A higher image classification accuracy of 88.75% is then attained by
augmenting the training with synthetic images, arguing that Conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks have the ability to produce new data to
alleviate issues of data scarcity. Finally, model pruning is performed via
polynomial decay, where we find that the Conditional GAN-augmented
classification network can retain 81.16% classification accuracy when

symmetry breaking or collapse, are among the most important dynamic coherent
structures. The nonlinear mechanical waves of this type play a major role in
many modern applications involving the transmission of mechanical information
in systems ranging from crystal lattices and metamaterials to macroscopic civil
engineering structures. While many different classes of such dynamic fronts are
known, the interrelation between them remains obscure. Here we consider a
minimal prototypical mechanical system, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chain with
piecewise linear nonlinearity, and show that there are exactly three distinct
classes of switching fronts, which differ fundamentally in how (and whether)
they produce and transport oscillations. The fact that all three types of
fronts could be obtained as explicit Wiener-Hopf solutions of the same discrete
FPU problem, allows one to identify the exact mathematical origin of the
particular features of each class. To make the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics
analytically transparent, we construct a minimal quasicontinuum approximation
of the FPU model that captures all three classes of the fronts and
interrelation between them. This approximation is of higher order than
conventional ones (KdV, Boussinesq) and involves mixed space-time derivatives.
The proposed framework unifies previous attempts to classify the mechanical
transition fronts as radiative, dispersive, topological or compressive and
categorizes them instead as different types of dynamic lattice defects.

radial velocities we obtain $M_{\rm b} = 8.61_{ - 1.46 } ^ { + 1.36 }$
$M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{\rm c} = 11.84_{ - 3.23 } ^ { + 3.38 }$ $M_{\oplus}$. The
star is moderately active with a complex activity pattern, which necessitated
the use of Gaussian process regression for both the light curve detrending and
the radial velocity modelling, in the latter case guided by suitable activity
indicators. We successfully disentangle the stellar-induced signal from the
planetary signals, underlining the importance and usefulness of the Gaussian
Process approach. We test the system's stability against atmospheric
photoevaporation and find that the TOI-1260 planets are classic examples of the
structure and composition ambiguity typical for the $2-3$ $R_{\oplus}$ range.

learning-based model for maximizing social welfare in the dynamic matching
market. The key features of our model is a fixed rule-based function and a
learnable component that can be trained by data gathered online with no prior

probability distribution over the matching decisions for the individual
customers. The proposed hybrid model enables the learning algorithm to find an
effective matching policy that simultaneously satisfies the customers'

an effective matching policy for different generation-consumption profiles and
exhibits better performance compared to standard online matching heuristics

force for the long, sustained effort in superconductivity research. Recent
progress in hydrides with Tcs up to 287 K under 267 GPa has heralded a new era
of room-temperature superconductivity (RTS) with immense technological promise.
Indeed, RTS has lifted the temperature barrier for the ubiquitous application
of superconductivity. Unfortunately, formidable pressure is required to attain
such high Tcs. The most effective relief to this impasse is to remove the
pressure needed while retaining the pressure-induced Tc without pressure. Here
we show such a possibility in the pure and doped high-temperature
superconductor (HTS) FeSe by retaining, at ambient via pressure-quenching (PQ),
its Tc up to 37 K (quadrupling that of a pristine FeSe) and other
pressure-induced phases. We have also observed that some phases remain stable
without pressure at up to 300 K and for at least 7 days. The observations are
in qualitative agreement with our ab initio simulations using the solid-state
nudged elastic band (SSNEB) method. We strongly believe that the PQ technique
developed here can be adapted to the RTS hydrides and other materials of value

derive an uncertainty relation that plays the role of a number-phase
uncertainty for spin systems. It is important that the relation is given with
well-defined and easily measurable quantities, and that it does not need
assuming infinite dimensional systems. Based on this uncertainty relation, we
show how to detect bipartite entanglement in an unpolarized Dicke state of many
spin-1/2 particles. The particles are split into two subensembles, then
collective angular momentum measurements are carried out locally on the two
parts. First, we present a bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering
criterion. Then, we present an entanglement condition that can detect bipartite
entanglement in such systems. We demonstrate the utility of the criteria by
applying them to a recent experiment given in K. Lange et al. [Science 360, 416
(2018)] realizing a Dicke state in a Bose-Einstein condensate of cold atoms, in
which the two subensembles were spatially separated from each other. Our
methods also work well if split spin-squeezed states are considered. We show in
a comprehensive way how to handle experimental imperfections, such as the
nonzero particle number variance including the partition noise, and the fact
that, while ideally BECs occupy a single spatial mode, in practice the
population of other spatial modes cannot be fully suppressed.

achieved by exploiting a semantic feature space shared by both seen and unseen
classes, e.g., attributes or word vectors, as the bridge. In ZSL, the common
practice is to train a mapping function between the visual and semantic feature
spaces with labeled seen class examples. When inferring, given unseen class
examples, the learned mapping function is reused to them and recognizes the
class labels on some metrics among their semantic relations. However, the
visual and semantic feature spaces are generally independent and exist in
entirely different manifolds. Under such a paradigm, the ZSL models may easily
suffer from the domain shift problem when constructing and reusing the mapping
function, which becomes the major challenge in ZSL. In this thesis, we explore
effective ways to mitigate the domain shift problem and learn a robust mapping
function between the visual and semantic feature spaces. We focus on fully
empowering the semantic feature space, which is one of the key building blocks
of ZSL. In summary, this thesis targets fully empowering the semantic feature
space and design effective solutions to mitigate the domain shift problem and
hence obtain a more robust visual-semantic mapping function for ZSL. Extensive

  -- Convergence Analysis and Numerical Examples",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The parallel solution of large scale non-linear programming problems, which
arise for example from the discretization of non-linear partial differential
equations, is a highly demanding task. Here, a novel solution strategy is
presented, which is inherently parallel and globally convergent. Each global
non-linear iteration step consists of asynchronous solutions of local
non-linear programming problems followed by a global recombination step. The
recombination step, which is the solution of a quadratic programming problem,
is designed in a way such that it ensures global convergence. As it turns out,
the new strategy can be considered as a globalized additively preconditioned
inexact Newton (ASPIN) method. However, in our approach the influence of
ASPIN's non-linear preconditioner on the gradient is controlled in order to
ensure a sufficient decrease condition. Two different control strategies are
described and analyzed. Convergence to first-order critical points of our
non-linear solution strategy is shown under standard trust-region assumptions.
The strategy is investigated along difficult minimization problems arising from
non-linear elasticity in 3D solved on a massively parallel computer with
several thousand cores.

we start by considering a Ricci-flat, but not conformally flat, boundary and
the corresponding Poincar\'e-Einstein spacefilling metric. Here we are able to
match the UV logarithmic divergence of the boundary with the IR logarithmic
divergence of the bulk, very much like in the known 4D/5D setting, under the
assumptions of factorization of the higher derivative CHS kinetic operator and
WKB-exactness of the heat kernel of the dual bulk field. A key technical
ingredient in this construction is the determination of the fourth heat kernel
coefficient b6 for Lichnerowicz Laplacians on both 6D and 7D Einstein
manifolds. These results allow to obtain, in addition to the already known
type-A Weyl anomaly, two of the three independent type-B anomaly coefficients
in terms of the third, say c_3 for instance. In order to gain access to c_3,
and thus determine the four central charges independently, we further consider
a generic non Ricci-flat Einstein boundary. However, in this case we find a
mismatch between boundary and bulk computations for spins higher than two. We
close by discussing the nature of this discrepancy and perspectives for a

practitioners to leverage tools from the deep learning community for building

non-vanishing because of the unstable nature of the hyperon resonance. If all
form factor combinations in the differential decay formulae are replaced by
their respective values at the photon point, one obtains a QED type

Drivers
deal with multiple concurrent tasks, such as keeping the vehicle in the lane,
observing and anticipating the actions of other road users, reacting to
hazards, and dealing with distractions inside and outside the vehicle. Failure
to notice and respond to the surrounding objects and events can cause
accidents. The ongoing improvements of the road infrastructure and vehicle
mechanical design have made driving safer overall. Nevertheless, the problem of
driver inattention has remained one of the primary causes of accidents.
Therefore, understanding where the drivers look and why they do so can help
eliminate sources of distractions and identify unsafe attention patterns.
Research on driver attention has implications for many practical applications
such as policy-making, improving driver education, enhancing road
infrastructure and in-vehicle infotainment systems, as well as designing
systems for driver monitoring, driver assistance, and automated driving. This
report covers the literature on changes in drivers' visual attention
distribution due to factors, internal and external to the driver. Aspects of
attention during driving have been explored across multiple disciplines,
including psychology, human factors, human-computer interaction, intelligent
transportation, and computer vision, each offering different perspectives,
goals, and explanations for the observed phenomena. We link cross-disciplinary
theoretical and behavioral research on driver's attention to practical
solutions. Furthermore, limitations and directions for future research are
discussed. This report is based on over 175 behavioral studies, nearly 100

leading order nonlinear shear stress ($\sigma_\mathrm{3} \sim

expectation. Expanding on the work by Natalia et al. [J. Rheol. 64 625-635
(2020)], we report an extensive data set of noncubical, noninteger power law
scalings $m_\mathrm{3}$ for particle suspensions in two immiscible fluids with
a capillary attractive interaction, known as capillary suspensions. Here, we
show that distinct power law exponents are found for the storage and loss
moduli and these noninteger scalings occur at every secondary fluid
concentration for two different contact angles. These compelling results
indicate that the noninteger scalings are related to the underlying
microstructure of capillary suspensions. We show that the magnitude of the
third harmonic elastic stress scaling $m_\mathrm{3,elastic}$ originates from
Hertzian-like contacts in combination with the attractive capillary force. The
related third harmonic viscous stress scaling $m_\mathrm{3,viscous}$ is, found
to be associated with adhesive-controlled friction. These observations,
conducted for a wide range of compositions, can help explain previous reports
of noninteger scaling for materials involving particle contacts and offers a
new opportunity using the variable power law exponent of MAOS rheology to
reveal the physics of particle bonds and friction in the rheological response
under low deformation instead of at very high shear rates.

extend much beyond the canonical Mi ~100, Msun limit, but the impact of such
hypothesis on the chemical enrichment of galaxies still remains to be
clarified. We aim to address this question by analysing the observed abundances
of thin- and thick-disc stars in the Milky Way with chemical evolution models
that account for the contribution of very massive stars dying as
pair-instability supernovae. We built new sets of chemical yields from massive
and very massive stars up to Mi ~ 350 Msun, by combining the wind ejecta
extracted from our hydrostatic stellar evolution models with explosion ejecta
from the literature. Using a simple chemical evolution code we analyse the
effects of adopting different yield tables by comparing predictions against
observations of stars in the solar vicinity. After several tests, we focus on
the [O/Fe] ratio which best separates the chemical patterns of the two Milky
Way components. We find that with a standard IMF, truncated at Mi ~ 100 Msun,
we can reproduce various observational constraints for thin-disc stars, but the
same IMF fails to account for the [O/Fe] ratios of thick-disc stars. The best
results are obtained by extending the IMF up to Mi = 350 Msun and including the
chemical ejecta of very massive stars, in the form of winds and
pair-instability supernova explosions.Our study indicates that PISN played a
significant role in shaping the chemical evolution of the Milky Way thick disc.
By including their chemical yields it is easier to reproduce not only the level
of the alpha-enhancement but also the observed slope of thick-disc stars in the
[O/Fe] vs [Fe/H] diagram. The bottom line is that the contribution of very
massive stars to the chemical enrichment of galaxies is potentially quite
important and should not be neglected in chemical evolution models.

local low mass galaxies is crucial to our understanding of the origins of
SMBHs. This statement assumes that low mass galaxies have had a relatively
quiet cosmic history, so that their black holes have not undergone significant
growth and therefore can be treated as relics of the original SMBH seeds. While
recent studies have found optical signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
in a growing population of dwarf galaxies, these studies are biased against low
metallicity and relatively merger-free galaxies, thus missing precisely the
demographic in which to search for the relics of SMBH seeds. Here, we report
the detection of the [\ion{Si}{6}]1.963~$\mu$m coronal line (CL), a robust
indicator of an AGN in the galaxy SDSS~J160135.95+311353.7, a nearby
($z=0.031$) low metallicity galaxy with a stellar mass approximately an order
of magnitude lower than the LMC ($M_*\approx10^{8.56}$~M$_\odot$) and no
optical evidence for an AGN. The AGN bolometric luminosity implied by the CL
detection is $\approx10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, precisely what is predicted from
its near-infrared continuum emission based on well-studied AGNs. Our results
are consistent with a black hole of mass $\approx~10^5$~M$_\odot$, in line with
expectations based on its stellar mass. This is the first time a near-infrared
CL has been detected in a low mass, low metallicity galaxy with no optical
evidence for AGN activity, providing confirmation of the utility of infrared
CLs in finding AGNs in low mass galaxies when optical diagnostics fail. These
observations highlight a powerful avenue of investigation to hunt for low mass

reveal that the central halo emission is more extended toward low frequencies.
We find that the integrated spectrum of the halo follows a power-law between
150 MHz and 3 GHz, while its subregions show significantly different spectra,
also featuring high frequency spectral steepening. The halo also shows local
regions in which the spectral index is significantly different from the average
value. Our results highlight that an overall power-law spectrum, as observed in
many radio halos, may also arise from the superposition of different
subcomponents. The comparison of the radio surface brightness and spectral
index with the X-ray brightness and temperature reveals for the first time
different trends, indicating that the halo consists of two main components. All
four relics in this system follow a power-law radio spectrum, compatible with
shocks with Mach numbers in the range $3.0-4.5$. All relics are also highly
polarized from 1-4 GHz and show low Faraday dispersion measures, suggesting
that they are located in the outermost regions of the cluster. The complexity
in the distribution and properties of nonthermal components in Abell 2744
supports a multiple merger scenario, as also highlighted by previous X-ray and
lensing studies. Our unique results demonstrate the importance of sensitive and
high-resolution, multi-frequency radio observations for understanding the
interplay between the thermal and non-thermal components of the ICM.

time-stamping that enable UED probes with unprecedented temporal resolution.
This technique utilizes two counter-propagating quasi-single-cycle THz pulses

improved temporal resolution from 178 fs down to 85 fs when the THz-compressed
UED probes are used with no time-stamping correction. Furthermore, we use a
novel time-stamping technique to reveal transient oscillations in the dynamical

standard UED, achieving a time-stamped temporal resolution down to 5 fs.

inductive biases through masks that implicitly act as cloze reductions for
downstream tasks. While appealing, we show that the success of the random
masking strategy used in practice cannot be explained by such cloze-like masks
alone. We construct cloze-like masks using task-specific lexicons for three
different classification datasets and show that the majority of pretrained

demonstrate a correspondence between the Masked Language Model (MLM) objective

Using this, we derive a method for extracting these learned statistical

results of the analyses of galaxy clustering with photometrically-selected
galaxies (GCph) and weak lensing. In the next decade, space missions like
Euclid will collect photometric measurements for millions of galaxies. These
data should be complemented with upcoming ground-based observations to derive
precise and accurate photo-zs. In this paper, we explore how the tomographic
redshift binning and depth of ground-based observations will affect the
cosmological constraints expected from Euclid. We focus on GCph and extend the
study to include galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL). We add a layer of complexity to
the analysis by simulating several realistic photo-z distributions based on the
Euclid Consortium Flagship simulation and using a machine learning photo-z
algorithm. We use the Fisher matrix formalism and these galaxy samples to study
the cosmological constraining power as a function of redshift binning, survey
depth, and photo-z accuracy. We find that bins with equal width in redshift
provide a higher Figure of Merit (FoM) than equipopulated bins and that
increasing the number of redshift bins from 10 to 13 improves the FoM by 35%
and 15% for GCph and its combination with GGL, respectively. For GCph, an
increase of the survey depth provides a higher FoM. But the addition of faint
galaxies beyond the limit of the spectroscopic training data decreases the FoM
due to the spurious photo-zs. When combining both probes, the number density of
the sample, which is set by the survey depth, is the main factor driving the
variations in the FoM. We conclude that there is more information that can be
extracted beyond the nominal 10 tomographic redshift bins of Euclid and that we
should be cautious when adding faint galaxies into our sample, since they can
degrade the cosmological constraints.

processes that underlie morphogenesis, wound healing, or cancer progression. In
such coordinated behaviours, cells are organised in coherent structures and
actively migrate to serve different biological purposes. In some contexts,
namely during epithelial wound healing, it is well known that a migrating
free-edge monolayer develops finger-like instabilities, yet the onset is still
under debate. Here, by means of theory and numerical simulations, we shed light
on the main mechanisms driving the instability process, analysing the linear
and nonlinear dynamics of a continuum compressible polar fluid. In particular,
we assess the role of cell polarisation, substrate friction, and contractile
stresses. Linear theory shows that it is crucial to analyse the perturbation
transient dynamics, since we unravel a plethora of crossovers between different
exponential growth rates during the linear regime. Numerical simulations
suggest that cell-substrate friction could be the mechanism responsible for the
formation of complex finger-like structures at the edge, since it triggers
secondary fingering instabilities and tip-splitting phenomena. Finally, we
obtain a critical contractile stress that depends on cell-substrate friction
and the initial-to-nematic length ratio, characterising an active
wetting-dewetting transition. In the dewetting scenario, the monolayer retracts
and becomes stable without developing finger-like structures.

guidance for QED as a successful quantum field theory with a defining gauge
symmetry through the Lamb shift, Casimir effect, and spontaneous emission. In
an accelerated frame, the thermalisation of the zero-point electromagnetic
field gives rise to the Unruh effect linked to the Hawking effect of a black
hole via the equivalence principle. This principle is the basis of general
covariance, the symmetry of general relativity as the classical theory of
gravity. If quantum gravity exists, the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the
gravitational field should also lead to the quantum decoherence and
dissertation of general forms of energy and matter. Here we present a novel
theoretical effect involving the spontaneous emission of soft gravitons by
photons as they bend around a heavy mass and discuss its observational
prospects. Our analytic and numerical investigations suggest that the
gravitational bending of starlight predicted by classical general relativity
should also be accompanied by the emission of gravitational waves. This in turn
redshifts the light causing a loss of its energy somewhat analogous to the
bremsstrahlung of electrons by a heavier charged particle. It is suggested that
this new effect may be important for a combined astronomical source of intense
gravity and high-frequency radiation such as X-ray binaries and that the

convolutional networks (GCNs) for learning on point clouds. The basic graph
convolution that is typically composed of a $K$-nearest neighbor (KNN) search
and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is examined. By mathematically analyzing the
operations there, two findings to improve the efficiency of GCNs are obtained.
(1) The local geometric structure information of 3D representations propagates
smoothly across the GCN that relies on KNN search to gather neighborhood
features. This motivates the simplification of multiple KNN searches in GCNs.
(2) Shuffling the order of graph feature gathering and an MLP leads to
equivalent or similar composite operations. Based on those findings, we
optimize the computational procedure in GCNs. A series of experiments show that
the optimized networks have reduced computational complexity, decreased memory
consumption, and accelerated inference speed while maintaining comparable
accuracy for learning on point clouds. Code will be available at

transformer network originates from machine translation and is particularly
good at modelling long-range dependencies within a long sequence. Although the
global interaction between the token embeddings could be well modelled by the
self-attention mechanism of transformers, what is lacking a locality mechanism
for information exchange within a local region. Yet, locality is essential for
images since it pertains to structures like lines, edges, shapes, and even
objects.
  We add locality to vision transformers by introducing depth-wise convolution
into the feed-forward network. This seemingly simple solution is inspired by
the comparison between feed-forward networks and inverted residual blocks. The
importance of locality mechanisms is validated in two ways: 1) A wide range of
design choices (activation function, layer placement, expansion ratio) are
available for incorporating locality mechanisms and all proper choices can lead
to a performance gain over the baseline, and 2) The same locality mechanism is
successfully applied to 4 vision transformers, which shows the generalization
of the locality concept. In particular, for ImageNet2012 classification, the
locality-enhanced transformers outperform the baselines DeiT-T and PVT-T by
2.6\% and 3.1\% with a negligible increase in the number of parameters and

the case of axion-like particles (ALPs) and show that the predicted large scale

a coherent conversion of thermal photons. Using recent state-of-the-art SN

solutions to the isentropic compressible Euler equations. These solutions model
a gas that implodes isotropically, ending in a singularity formation in finite
time. The existence of smooth solutions that vanish at infinity and do not have
vacuum regions was recently proved and, in this paper, we provide the first
construction of such smooth profiles, the first characterization of their
spectrum of radial perturbations as well as some endpoints of unstable
directions. Numerical simulations of the Euler equations provide evidence that
one of these endpoints is a shock formation that happens before the singularity
at the origin, showing that the implosion process is unstable.

theoretical models of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), since they substantially
reduce the computational burden inherent in the multi-dimensional
neutrino-radiation hydrodynamical simulations. The approximation, however,
comes at a price; the detailed structure of angular distribution of neutrinos
is sacrificed, that is the main drawback of this approach. In this paper, we
develop a novel method by which to construct angular distributions of neutrinos
from the zero-th and first angular moments. In our method, the angular
distribution is expressed with two quadratic functions of the neutrino angle in
a piecewise fashion. We determine the best parameters in the fitting function
by comparing to the neutrino data in a spherically symmetric CCSN model with
full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We demonstrate the capability of our method
by using our recent 2D CCSN model. We find that the essential features of the
angular distributions can be well reconstructed, whereas the angular
distributions of incoming neutrinos tend to have large errors that increase
with flux factor ($\kappa$). This issue originates from the insensitiveness of
incoming neutrinos to $\kappa$, that is an intrinsic limitation in moment
methods. Based on the results of the demonstration, we assess the reliability
of ELN-crossing searches with two-moment neutrino transport. This analysis is
complementary to our another paper that scrutinizes the limitation of crossing
searches with a few moments. We find that the systematic errors of angular
distributions for incoming neutrinos lead to misjudgements of the crossing at
$\kappa \gtrsim 0.5$. This casts doubt on the results of ELN-crossing searches
based on two-moment methods in some previous studies.

magnetic field description to determine the level of UHECR deflections expected
from an ensemble of source positions. Besides deflections in magnetic fields,
we also take into account energy losses with background photon fields as well

between the PAO anisotropy measurement and the local star-forming galaxy
density for large extragalactic magnetic field strengths with $B > 0.2 \ \rm
nG$ (for a coherence length of $1 \ \rm Mpc$) at the $5\sigma$ confidence
level. Larger source densities lead to more isotropic background and
consequently allow for weaker extragalactic magnetic fields. However, the
acceleration of UHECR by such abundant sources is more challenging to motivate.
Too large source densities and extragalactic magnetic field strengths, on the
other hand, are also disfavored as that decreases the expected level of
anisotropy. This leads to upper limits of $B < 22 \ \rm nG$ and $\rho_0 < 8.4

ground state degeneracy (GSD) in both isotropic and anisotropic lattices. We
decompose and reconstruct ground states through a consistent collection of

three-dimensional position-velocity domain using a parametric model described
by three structural and four kinematic parameters. Best-fit values for the

of our modelling method are carefully determined via tests using mock data. We
detect ionised extraplanar gas in both galaxies, with scale heights
$0.83^{+0.27}_{-0.40}\,\mathrm{kpc}$ (NGC 3982) and
$1.87^{+0.43}_{-0.56}\,\mathrm{kpc}$ (NGC 4152) and flux fraction between the
extraplanar gas and the regularly rotating gas within the disc of 27% and 15%

lagging rotation of the ionized extraplanar gas in both galaxies, with vertical
rotational gradients $-22.24^{+6.60}_{-13.13} \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$

weak evidence for vertical and radial inflow in both galaxies. The above
results are similar to the kinematics of the neutral extraplanar gas found in
several galaxies, though this is the first time that 3D kinematic modelling of

However, a dynamical model is required to better understand the formation of

both machine-learning and optimization-based methods have been proposed to
lighten the full UC formulation by removing as many superfluous line-flow

over-optimistic and result in infeasible UC solutions. For their part,
optimization-based methods seek to identify redundant constraints in the full

doing so, these methods only get rid of line-flow constraints whose removal
leaves the feasibility region of the original UC problem unchanged. In this
paper, we propose a procedure to substantially increase the line-flow

jeopardizing their appealing ability of preserving feasibility. Our approach is
based on tightening the LP-relaxation that the optimization-based method uses
with a valid inequality related to the objective function of the UC problem and

a unitary time evolution is a meanwhile well-established phenomenon apart from
a few equally well-established exceptions. Here we report the surprising
theoretical observation that integrable as well as non-integrable spin rings
with nearest-neighbor or long-range isotropic Heisenberg interaction not only
equilibrate but moreover also synchronize the directions of the expectation
values of the individual spins. We highlight that this differs from spontaneous
synchronization in quantum dissipative systems. Here, we observe mutual
synchronization of local spin directions in closed systems under unitary time
evolution. Contrary to dissipative systems, this synchronization is independent
of whether the interaction is ferro- or antiferromagnetic. In our numerical
simulations, we investigate the free induction decay (FID) of an ensemble of up
to $N = 25$ quantum spins with $s = 1/2$ each by solving the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation numerically exactly. Our findings are related to, but
not fully explained by conservation laws of the system. The synchronization is
very robust against for instance random fluctuations of the Heisenberg
couplings and inhomogeneous magnetic fields. Synchronization is not observed
with strong enough symmetry-breaking interactions such as the dipolar
interaction. We also compare our results to closed-system classical spin
dynamics which does not exhibit phase synchronization due to the lack of
entanglement. For classical spin systems the fixed magnitude of individual
spins effectively acts like additional $N$ conservation laws.

entry and exit of domestic industries in Irish regions before, during, and
after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Specifically, we are interested in whether the
presence of MNEs in a region results in knowledge spillovers and the creation
of new domestic industries in related sectors. To quantify how related an
industry is to a region's industry basket we propose two cohesion measures,
weighted closeness and strategic closeness, which capture direct linkages and
the complex connectivity structure between industries in a region respectively.
We use a dataset of government-supported firms in Ireland (covering 90% of
manufacturing and exporting) between 2006-2019. We find that domestic
industries are both more likely to enter and less likely to leave a region if
they are related to so-called 'overlapping' industries containing both domestic
and MNE firms. In contrast, we find a negative impact on domestic entry and
survival from cohesion to 'exclusive MNE' industries, suggesting that domestic
firms are unable to 'leap' and thrive in MNE-proximate industries likely due to
a technology or know-how gap. This dynamic was broken, with domestic firms
entering MNE exclusive sectors, by a large injection of Brexit diversification
funds in 2017-18. Finally, the type of cohesion matters. For example, strategic
rather than weighted closeness to exclusive domestic sectors matters for both

field representation of gravity on a piecewise linear lattice. It is a part of
the program concerning the classical relativistic theory of fundamental
interactions, represented by minimally coupled gauge vector field densities and
half-densities. The correspondence between the local Darboux coordinates on
phase space and the local structure of the links of the lattice, embedded in
the spatial manifold, is demonstrated. Thus, the canonical coordinates are
replaceable by links-related quantities. This idea and the significant part of
formalism are directly based on the model of canonical loop quantum gravity
(CLQG).
  The first stage of this program is formulated regarding the gauge field,
which dynamics is independent of other fundamental fields, but contributes to
their dynamics. This gauge field, which determines systems equivalence in the
actions defining all fundamental interactions, represents Einsteinian gravity.
The related links-defined quantities depend on holonomies of gravitational
connections and fluxes of densitized dreibeins. This article demonstrates how
to determine these quantities, which lead to a nonpertubative formalism that
preserves the general postulate of relativity. From this perspective, the
formalism presented in this article is analogous to the Ashtekar-Barbero-Holst
formulation on which CLQG is based. However, in this project, it is
additionally required that the fields' coordinates are quantizable in the
standard canonical procedure for a gauge theory and that any approximation in
the construction of the model is at least as precisely demonstrated as the
gauge invariance. These requirements lead to new relations between holonomies
and connections, and the representation of the densitized deibein determinant
that is more precise than the volume representation in CLQG.

dynamics, the on-resonance terahertz transmission at 0.4 THz varies in a
nonlinear manner with incident terahertz power. The second resonator layer
dampens this nonlinear response. In samples where the two layers are aligned,
the resonance disappears and total nonlinear modulation of the on-resonance

an alignment offset is imposed between the two resonator arrays. Structurally
tunable metamaterials can therefore act as a design template for tunable

require very large model sizes, thereby bringing a series of deployment
challenges. Although various prior works have been proposed to reduce the RNN
model sizes, executing RNN models in resource-restricted environments is still
a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to develop extremely
compact RNN models with fully decomposed hierarchical Tucker (FDHT) structure.
The HT decomposition does not only provide much higher storage cost reduction
than the other tensor decomposition approaches but also brings better accuracy
performance improvement for the compact RNN models. Meanwhile, unlike the
existing tensor decomposition-based methods that can only decompose the
input-to-hidden layer of RNNs, our proposed fully decomposition approach
enables the comprehensive compression for the entire RNN models with
maintaining very high accuracy. Our experimental results on several popular
video recognition datasets show that our proposed fully decomposed hierarchical
tucker-based LSTM (FDHT-LSTM) is extremely compact and highly efficient. To the
best of our knowledge, FDHT-LSTM, for the first time, consistently achieves
very high accuracy with only few thousand parameters (3,132 to 8,808) on
different datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art compressed RNN models,

improved output voltage quality, lower switching losses, low EMI, and ability
to handle higher voltage and power levels. To generate the desired output
voltage in the MLIs, there are different switching methods including
multicarrier pulse-width modulation (PWM), selective harmonic elimination
(SHE), and multilevel space-vector PWM (SVPWM) methods. The SHE method
minimizes the number of switching and hence the switching losses. Also, the
method eliminates or attenuates specified low-order harmonics and adjusts the
fundamental output voltage to the desired value. However, problems arise in the
low modulation indexes where the harmonic distortion of the output voltage
increases considerably. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a method to
adjust the DC voltage when the low output voltage is required. Therefore, the
modulation index will increase and the output voltage quality will be improved.
The proposed method is verified on a 7-level Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter
using the SHE method solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

unstable to long waves or short wavenumbers, with a specific wavenumber in that

treatment is overlap (a.k.a. positivity): the distributions of the features
used to perform causal adjustment cannot be too different in the treated and
control groups. In cases where overlap is poor, causal effect estimators can
become brittle, especially when they incorporate weighting. To address this
problem, a number of proposals (including confounder selection or dimension
reduction methods) incorporate feature representations to induce better overlap
between the treated and control groups. A key concern in these proposals is
that the representation may introduce confounding bias into the effect
estimator. In this paper, we introduce deconfounding scores, which are feature
representations that induce better overlap without biasing the target of
estimation. We show that deconfounding scores satisfy a zero-covariance
condition that is identifiable in observed data. As a proof of concept, we
characterize a family of deconfounding scores in a simplified setting with
Gaussian covariates, and show that in some simple simulations, these scores can
be used to construct estimators with good finite-sample properties. In
particular, we show that this technique could be an attractive alternative to
standard regularizations that are often applied to IPW and balancing weights.

domains always have Ulrich modules. In this paper, we answer the question of
existence for both Ulrich modules and weakly lim Ulrich sequences -- a weaker
notion recently introduced by Ma -- in the negative. We construct many local
domains in all dimensions $d \geq 2$ that do not have any Ulrich modules.
Moreover, we show that when $d = 2$, these local domains do not have weakly lim
Ulrich sequences. A key insight in our proofs is the classification of MCM
$R$-modules via the $S_2$-ification of $R$. For local domains of dimension $2$,
we show that the existence of weakly lim Ulrich sequences implies the existence
of lim Ulrich sequences.

This is
important because most reliable, up-to-date information in biomedicine is dense
with jargon and thus practically inaccessible to the lay audience. Furthermore,
manual simplification does not scale to the rapidly growing body of biomedical
literature, motivating the need for automated approaches. Unfortunately, there
are no large-scale resources available for this task. In this work we introduce
a new corpus of parallel texts in English comprising technical and lay
summaries of all published evidence pertaining to different clinical topics. We
then propose a new metric based on likelihood scores from a masked language
model pretrained on scientific texts. We show that this automated measure
better differentiates between technical and lay summaries than existing
heuristics. We introduce and evaluate baseline encoder-decoder Transformer
models for simplification and propose a novel augmentation to these in which we
explicitly penalize the decoder for producing ""jargon"" terms; we find that this
yields improvements over baselines in terms of readability.

curved space. As a remedy, we introduce a curved space background geometry with
a Minkowski metric tensor and locally non-zero curvature and torsion. Based on
this geometry, we propose a `third'/vacuum quantization model as a consequence
of Unruh effect. Accordingly, we introduce a `third' quantization scalar field
as a general coordinate transformation of spacetime for the second quantization
fields. Then we show that in the classical limit, the `third' quantization
fields appear as Riemannian manifolds with an emergent metric on which the
second quantization fields are located. This way, the standard model of field
theory turns out as an effective theory. Moreover, using the proposed `third'
quantization fields, we build a $U(1)\times SU(4)$ Yang-Mills gauge theory for
gravity. According to this gravitational model, we indicate that an analytical
solution of the presented gravitational model, for the `third' quantum field
particle trajectory (such as a star), corresponds to the trajectory of a test
particle in the Mannheim-Kazanas space. Furthermore, by using non-perturbative
methods and lattice gauge theory results, we render a solution for the
potential of the constructed model that can explain the galaxy rotation curves
and gravitational lensing without any need to dark matter. We also address the
cosmic microwave background phenomenon and the expansion of the universe.

discriminate among parameters that affect the neutrino flux model. From fitting

P\'al for the bipartite case in the random-order model. While the weighted
bipartite matching problem is solved in the random-order model, this is not the
case in recent and exciting online models in which the online player is
provided with a sample, and the arrival order is adversarial. The greedy-based
algorithm is arguably the most natural and practical algorithm to be applied in
these models. Despite its simplicity and appeal, and despite being studied in
multiple works, the greedy-based algorithm was not fully understood in any of
the studied online models, and its actual performance remained an open question
for more than a decade.
  We provide a thorough analysis of the greedy-based algorithm in several
online models. For vertex arrivals in bipartite graphs, we characterize the
exact competitive-ratio of this algorithm in the random-order model, for any
arrival order of the vertices subsequent to the sampling phase (adversarial and
random orders in particular). We use it to derive tight analysis in the recent
adversarial-order model with a sample (AOS model) for any sample size,
providing the first result in this model beyond the simple secretary problem.
Then, we generalize and strengthen the black box method of converting results
in the random-order model to single-sample prophet inequalities, and use it to
derive the state-of-the-art single-sample prophet inequality for the problem.
Finally, we use our new techniques to analyze the greedy-based algorithm for
edge arrivals in general graphs and derive results in all the mentioned online

reinterpreted as training of a neural network that estimates the state
trajectory from available measurements. The technology associated with neural
network optimization/training allows an easy extension to nonlinear models. The

sodium-cooled fast reactors in the United States. US research reactors have
been using and testing this fuel type since the 1960s and accumulated
considerable experience and knowledge about the fuel performance. However, most
of knowledge remains empirical. The lack of mechanistic understanding of fuel
performance is preventing the qualification of UZr fuel for commercial use.
This paper proposes a data-driven approach, coupled with advanced post
irradiation examination, powered by machine learning algorithms, to facilitate
the development of such understandings by providing unpreceded quantified new
insights into fission gas bubbles. Specifically, based on the advanced
postirradiation examination data collected on a neutron-irradiated U-10Zr
annular fuel, we developed a method to automatically detect, classify ~19,000
fission gas bubbles into different categories, and quantitatively link the data
to lanthanide transpiration along the radial temperature gradient. The approach
is versatile and can be modified to study different coupled irradiation
effects, such as secondary phase redistribution and degradation of thermal
conductivity, in irradiated nuclear fuel.

for stochastic analysis. Such an approach is often called static reduction in
dynamic team theory (or decentralized stochastic control) and has been an
effective method for establishing existence and approximation results for
optimal policies. In this paper, we place such static reductions into three
categories: (i) those that are policy-independent (as those introduced by
Witsenhausen), (ii) those that are policy-dependent (as those introduced by Ho
and Chu for partially nested dynamic teams), and (iii) those that we will refer
to as static measurements with control-sharing reduction (where the
measurements are static although control actions are shared according to the
partially nested information structure). For the first type, we show that there
is a bijection between person-by-person optimal (globally optimal) policies of
dynamic teams and their policy-independent static reductions. For the second
type, although there is a bijection between globally optimal policies of
dynamic teams with partially nested information structures and their static
reductions, in general there is no bijection between person-by-person optimal
policies of dynamic teams and their policy-dependent static reductions. We also
establish a stronger negative result concerning stationary solutions. We
present sufficient conditions under which bijection relationships hold. Under
static measurements with control-sharing reduction, connections between
optimality concepts can be established under relaxed conditions. An implication
is a convexity characterization of dynamic team problems under static
measurements with control-sharing reduction. Finally, we introduce multi-stage
refinements of such reductions. Part II of the paper addresses similar issues
in the context of stochastic dynamic games, where further subtleties arise.

regarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We
argue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no
extra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can
lead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the
underlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is
trained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown
to be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking
the local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions
with low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially
Varying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the
structural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends
itself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are
available. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical
segmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and
single and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS,
despite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved

mechanics, but has only limited relevance for a relativistic theory such as
classical electrodynamics. In this article, we discuss harmonic-oscillator
thermal equilibrium from three different perspectives. First, we contrast the
thermal equilibrium of nonrelativistic mechanical oscillators (where point
collisions are allowed and frequency is irrelevant) with the equilibrium of
relativistic radiation modes (where frequency is crucial). The Rayleigh-Jeans
law appears from applying a dipole-radiation approximation to impose the
nonrelativistic mechanical equilibrium on the radiation spectrum. In this
discussion, we note the possibility of zero-point energy for relativistic
radiation, which possibility does not arise for nonrelativistic
classical-mechanical systems. Second, we turn to a simple electromagnetic model
of a harmonic oscillator and show that the oscillator is fully in radiation
equilibrium (which involves all radiation multipoles, dipole, quadrupole, etc.)
with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, but is not in equilibrium
with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Finally, we discuss the contrast between the
flexibility of nonrelativistic mechanics with its arbitrary potential functions
allowing separate scalings for length, time, and energy, with the
sharply-controlled behavior of relativistic classical electrodynamics with its
single scaling connecting together the scales for length, time, and energy. It
is emphasized that within classical physics, energy-sharing, velocity-dependent
damping is associated with the low-frequency, nonrelativistic part of the
Planck thermal radiation spectrum, whereas acceleration-dependent radiation
damping is associated with the high-frequency adiabatically-invariant and
Lorentz-invariant part of the spectrum corresponding to zero-point radiation.

the first stage, relevant sites are identified via a screening routine that
discards the locations with little impact on system design. In the second
stage, the subset of relevant RES sites previously identified is used in a CEP
problem to determine the optimal configuration of the power system. The
proposed method is tested on a realistic EU case study and its performance is
benchmarked against a CEP set-up in which the entire set of candidate RES sites
is available. The method shows great promise, with the screening stage
consistently identifying 90% of the optimal RES sites while discarding up to
54% of the total number of candidate locations. This leads to a peak memory

explanation for this dynamical confinement is the existence of a yet-undetected

trans-Neptunian objects, which originate within the scattered disk population
of the Kuiper belt, can be corralled into orbital alignment by Planet Nine's
gravity over ~Gyr timescales, and characteristic P9 parameters have been
derived by matching the properties of a synthetic Kuiper belt generated within
numerical simulations to the available observational data. In this work, we
show that an additional dynamical process is in play within the framework of
the Planet Nine hypothesis, and demonstrate that P9-induced dynamical evolution
facilitates orbital variations within the otherwise dynamically frozen inner
Oort cloud. As a result of this evolution, inner Oort cloud bodies can acquire
orbits characteristic of the distant scattered disk, implying that if Planet
Nine exists, the observed census of long-period trans-Neptunian objects is
comprised of a mixture of Oort cloud and Kuiper belt objects. Our simulations
further show that although inward-injected inner Oort cloud objects exhibit
P9-driven orbital confinement, the degree of clustering is weaker than that of
objects originating within the Kuiper belt. Cumulatively, our results suggest
that a more eccentric Planet Nine is likely necessary to explain the data than

the local atomic arrangements at the interface and the doping level.

transport; interface states and standing waves in the semiconductor due to
quantum confinement. We find that the latter can be associated with rises in

accurate assessments by having higher correlations with human judgments. A
critical bottleneck of obtaining a reliable learnable evaluation metric is the
lack of high-quality training data for classifiers to efficiently distinguish
plausible and implausible machine-generated stories. Previous works relied on
\textit{heuristically manipulated} plausible examples to mimic possible system
drawbacks such as repetition, contradiction, or irrelevant content in the text
level, which can be \textit{unnatural} and \textit{oversimplify} the
characteristics of implausible machine-generated stories. We propose to tackle
these issues by generating a more comprehensive set of implausible stories
using {\em plots}, which are structured representations of controllable factors
used to generate stories. Since these plots are compact and structured, it is
easier to manipulate them to generate text with targeted undesirable
properties, while at the same time maintain the grammatical correctness and
naturalness of the generated sentences. To improve the quality of generated
implausible stories, we further apply the adversarial filtering procedure
presented by \citet{zellers2018swag} to select a more nuanced set of
implausible texts. Experiments show that the evaluation metrics trained on our

efficiency and accuracy based on Nesterov's smoothing technique. Basically, the
non-smooth c-transform of the Kantorovich potential is approximated by the
smooth Log-Sum-Exp function, which finally smooths the original non-smooth
Kantorovich dual functional (energy). The smooth Kantorovich functional can be
optimized by the fast proximal gradient algorithm (FISTA) efficiently.
Theoretically, the computational complexity of the proposed method is given by
$O(n^{\frac{5}{2}} \sqrt{\log n} /\epsilon)$, which is lower than that of the

the action and its boundary terms. We choose the least restrictive boundary
conditions possible. The fixed boundary data consists of the radiative modes
alone (two degrees of freedom per point). All other boundary fields are
dynamical. We introduce the covariant phase space and explain how the Holst
term alters the boundary symmetries. To infer the Poisson brackets among Dirac
observables, we define an auxiliary phase space, where the $SL(2\mathbb{R})$
symmetries of the boundary fields is manifest. We identify the gauge generators
and second-class constraints that remove the auxiliary variables. All gauge
generators are at most quadratic in the fundamental $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$
variables on phase space. We compute the Dirac bracket and identify the Dirac
observables on the light cone. Finally, we discuss various truncations to
quantise the system in an effective way.

  Models of Lithium-ion Batteries","26 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the problem of parameterizing Newman-type models of Li-ion
batteries focusing on quantifying the inherent uncertainty of this process and
its dependence on the discharge rate. In order to rule out genuine experimental
error and instead isolate the intrinsic uncertainty of model fitting, we
concentrate on an idealized setting where ""synthetic"" measurements in the form
of voltage curves are manufactured using the full, and most accurate, Newman
model with parameter values considered ""true"", whereas parameterization is
performed using simplified versions of the model, namely, the single-particle
model and its recently proposed corrected version. By framing the problem in
this way, we are able to eliminate aspects which affect uncertainty, but are
hard to quantity such as, e.g., experimental errors. The parameterization is
performed by formulating an inverse problem which is solved using a
state-of-the-art Bayesian approach in which the parameters to be inferred are
represented in terms of suitable probability distributions; this allows us to
assess the uncertainty of their reconstruction. The key finding is that while
at slow discharge rates the voltage curves can be reconstructed quite
accurately, this can be achieved with some parameter varying by 300\% or more,
thus providing evidence for very high uncertainty of the parameter inference
process. As the discharge rate increases, the reconstruction uncertainty is
reduced but at the same time the fits to the voltage curves becomes less
accurate. These observations highlight the ill-posedness of the inverse problem
of parameter reconstruction in models of Li-ion battery operation.In practice,
using simplified model appears to be a viable and useful strategy provided that
the assumptions facilitating the model simplification are truly valid for the
battery operating regimes in which the data was collected.

due to the popularity of 3D sensors in safety-critical applications. Existing
adversarial attacks against 3D PC classifiers are all test-time evasion (TTE)
attacks that aim to induce test-time misclassifications using knowledge of the
classifier. But since the victim classifier is usually not accessible to the
attacker, the threat is largely diminished in practice, as PC TTEs typically
have poor transferability. Here, we propose the first backdoor attack (BA)
against PC classifiers. Originally proposed for images, BAs poison the victim
classifier's training set so that the classifier learns to decide to the
attacker's target class whenever the attacker's backdoor pattern is present in
a given input sample. Significantly, BAs do not require knowledge of the victim
classifier. Different from image BAs, we propose to insert a cluster of points
into a PC as a robust backdoor pattern customized for 3D PCs. Such clusters are
also consistent with a physical attack (i.e., with a captured object in a
scene). We optimize the cluster's location using an independently trained
surrogate classifier and choose the cluster's local geometry to evade possible
PC preprocessing and PC anomaly detectors (ADs). Experimentally, our BA
achieves a uniformly high success rate (> 87%) and shows evasiveness against
state-of-the-art PC ADs.

Theory and Methods: We present an improved model for qMT bSSFP, which
incorporates finite radio-frequency (RF) pulse effects as well as simultaneous
exchange and relaxation. Further, a correction to finite RF pulse effects for
sinc-shaped excitations is derived. The new model is compared to the original
one in numerical simulations of the Bloch-McConnell equations and in previously
acquired in-vivo data. Results: Our numerical simulations show that the
original signal equation is significantly biased in typical brain tissue
structures (by 7-20 %) whereas the new signal equation outperforms the original
one with minimal bias (< 1%). It is further shown that the bias of the original
model strongly affects the acquired qMT parameters in human brain structures,
with differences in the clinically relevant parameter of pool-size-ratio of up
to 31 %. Particularly high biases of the original signal equation are expected
in an MS lesion within diseased brain tissue (due to a low T2/T1-ratio),
demanding a more accurate model for clinical applications. Conclusion: The
improved model for qMT bSSFP is recommended for accurate qMT parameter mapping
in healthy and diseased brain tissue structures.

recently. However, most methods require handcrafted (high-precision) rules in
their generative process, hindering the exploration of diverse unseen data. In
this work, we propose a generative model which features a (non-neural) PCFG
that models the composition of programs (e.g., SQL), and a BART-based
translation model that maps a program to an utterance. Due to the simplicity of
PCFG and pre-trained BART, our generative model can be efficiently learned from
existing data at hand. Moreover, explicitly modeling compositions using PCFG
leads to a better exploration of unseen programs, thus generate more diverse
data. We evaluate our method in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings of
text-to-SQL parsing on the standard benchmarks of GeoQuery and Spider,
respectively. Our empirical results show that the synthesized data generated
from our model can substantially help a semantic parser achieve better
compositional and domain generalization.

This is the goal of semi-supervised learning, which exploits more widely

we propose a novel framework for discriminative pixel-level tasks using a
generative model of both images and labels. Concretely, we learn a generative
adversarial network that captures the joint image-label distribution and is
trained efficiently using a large set of unlabeled images supplemented with
only few labeled ones. We build our architecture on top of StyleGAN2, augmented
with a label synthesis branch. Image labeling at test time is achieved by first
embedding the target image into the joint latent space via an encoder network
and test-time optimization, and then generating the label from the inferred
embedding. We evaluate our approach in two important domains: medical image
segmentation and part-based face segmentation. We demonstrate strong in-domain
performance compared to several baselines, and are the first to showcase
extreme out-of-domain generalization, such as transferring from CT to MRI in
medical imaging, and photographs of real faces to paintings, sculptures, and

a minimized Total Cost Of Transport (TCOT) and payload. This approach revealed

that the effective nonlinear parameter and nonlinear FOM can be increased by up

benchmark to evaluate the nonlinear performance, examining the tradeoff between
enhancing Kerr nonlinearity and minimizing loss. By optimizing the device
parameters to balance this, a high spectral broadening factor of 27.8 can be
achieved, more than 6 times that achieved in previous experiments. Finally, the
influence of pulse chirp, material anisotropy, and the interplay between

planets to assemble, and thus it is one of the fundamental parameters in
theories of planetary formation. Disk dispersal is determined by several
properties of the central star, the disk itself, and the surrounding
environment. In particular, the metallicity of disks may impact their
evolution, even if to date controversial results exist: in low-metallicity
clusters disks seem to rapidly disperse, while in the Magellanic Clouds some
evidence supports the existence of accreting disks few tens of Myrs old. In
this paper we study the dispersal timescale of disks in Dolidze~25, the young
cluster in proximity of the Sun with lowest metallicity, with the aim of
understanding whether disk evolution is impacted by the low-metallicity of the
cluster. We have analyzed Chandra/ACIS-I observations of the cluster and
combined the resulting source catalog with existing optical and infrared
catalogs of the region. We selected the disk-bearing population and the
disk-less population of Dolidze 25. We have derived stellar parameters from
isochrones fitted to color-magnitude diagrams. We derived a disk fraction of
about 34% and a median age of 1.2 Myrs. By comparing this estimate with
existing estimates of the disk fraction of clusters younger than 10 Myrs, our
study suggests that the disk fraction of Dolidze 25 is lower than what is
expected from its age alone. Even if our results are not conclusive given the
intrinsic uncertainty on stellar ages estimated from isochrones fitting to
color-magnitude diagrams, we suggest that disk evolution in Dolidze 25 may be
impacted by the environment. Given the poor O star population and low stellar
density of the cluster, it is more likely that disks dispersal timescale is
dictated more by the low metallicity of the cluster rather than external
photoevaporation or dynamical encounters.

fields. The growing demand makes their scalability and sustainability
challenges more evident than ever. As a result, more and more blockchains have
begun to adopt proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocols to address those
challenges. One of the fundamental characteristics of any blockchain technology
is its crypto-economics and incentives. Lately, each PoS blockchain has
designed a unique reward mechanism, yet, many of them are prone to free-rider
and nothing-at-stake problems. To better understand the ad-hoc design of reward
mechanisms, in this paper, we develop a reward mechanism framework that could
apply to many PoS blockchains. We formulate the block validation game wherein
the rewards are distributed for validating the blocks correctly. Using
evolutionary game theory, we analyze how the participants' behaviour could
potentially evolve with the reward mechanism. Also, penalties are found to play
a central role in maintaining the integrity of blockchains.

perturbative calculation of the interaction between two dissimilar atoms, we
show that a time-dependent approach in the weak-interaction approximation is
essential in considering the identical atoms limit in the perturbative regime.
In this limit we find that, at leading order, the van-der-Waals forces are
fully-resonant and grow linearly in time, being different upon each atom. The
resultant net force upon the two-atom system is related to the directionality
of spontaneous emission, which results from the violation of parity symmetry.
In contrast to the usual stationary van-der-Waals forces, the time-dependent
conservative forces cannot be written as the gradients of the expectation
values of the interaction potentials, but as the expectation values of the
gradients of the interaction potentials only.

demonstrates that for bulk stoichiometric compounds, there are several new
low-energy rocksalt-like structures in which Mg atoms are octahedrally
six--coordinated and form trigonal prismatic motifs with different stacking
sequences. Furthermore, we find a dense spectrum of novel non-stoichiometric
crystal phases of Mg$_x$O$_{1-x}$ for each composition of $x$. These structures
are mostly similar to the rock salt structure with octahedral coordination and
five--coordinated Mg atoms. Due to the removal of one oxygen atom, the energy
landscape becomes more glass-like with oxygen-vacancy type structures that all
lie very close to each other energetically. For the same number of magnesium
and oxygen atoms our oxygen-deficient structures are lower in energy if the
vacancies are aligned along lines or planes than rock salt structures with
randomly distributed oxygen vacancies. We also found the putative global minima

temperature, baryon density and in the presence of a magnetic field, from the
point of view of effective models, whose main ingredient is chiral symmetry. We
concentrate our attention on two of these models: The linear sigma model with
quarks and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We show that a main ingredient to
understand the characteristics of the phase transitions is the inclusion of
plasma screening effects that capture the physics of collective, long-wave
modes, and thus describe a prime property of plasmas near transition lines,
namely, long distance correlations. Inclusion of plasma screening makes
possible to understand the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon even without
the need to consider magnetic field-dependent coupling constants. Screening is
also responsible for the emergence of a critical end point in the phase diagram
even for small magnetic field strengths. Although versatile, the NJL model is
also a more limited approach since, being a non-renormalizable model, a clear
separation between pure vacuum and medium effects is not always possible. The
model cannot describe inverse magnetic catalysis unless a magnetic field
dependent coupling is included. The location of the critical end point strongly
depends on the choice of the type of interaction and on the magnetic field
dependence of the corresponding coupling. Overall, both models provide sensible
tools to explore the properties of magnetized, strongly interacting matter.
However, a cross talk among them as well as a consistent physical approach to
determine the model parameters is much needed.

stable, shared expectations about how the words we say correspond to the
beliefs and intentions in our heads. Yet language use in a variable and

flexible: old words acquire new ad hoc or partner-specific meanings on the fly.
In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Continual Hierarchical Adaptation through
Inference), a hierarchical Bayesian theory of coordination and convention
formation that aims to reconcile the long-standing tension between these two
basic observations. We argue that the central computational problem of
communication is not simply transmission, as in classical formulations, but
continual learning and adaptation over multiple timescales. Partner-specific
common ground quickly emerges from social inferences within dyadic
interactions, while community-wide social conventions are stable priors that
have been abstracted away from interactions with multiple partners. We present
new empirical data alongside simulations showing how our model provides a
computational foundation for several phenomena that have posed a challenge for
previous accounts: (1) the convergence to more efficient referring expressions
across repeated interaction with the same partner, (2) the gradual transfer of
partner-specific common ground to strangers, and (3) the influence of
communicative context on which conventions eventually form.

detection, which suffers from the ill-posed depth estimation. We first conduct
a thorough analysis to reveal how existing methods fail to consistently
localize objects when different geometric shifts occur. In particular, we
design a series of geometric manipulations to diagnose existing detectors and
then illustrate their vulnerability to consistently associate the depth with
object apparent sizes and positions. To alleviate this issue, we propose four
geometry-aware data augmentation approaches to enhance the geometric
consistency of the detectors. We first modify some commonly used data
augmentation methods for 2D images so that they can maintain geometric
consistency in 3D spaces. We demonstrate such modifications are important. In
addition, we propose a 3D-specific image perturbation method that employs the
camera movement. During the augmentation process, the camera system with the
corresponding image is manipulated, while the geometric visual cues for depth
recovery are preserved. We show that by using the geometric consistency
constraints, the proposed augmentation techniques lead to improvements on the

  Workshop",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While deep learning has obtained state-of-the-art results in many
applications, the adaptation of neural network architectures to incorporate new
output features remains a challenge, as neural networks are commonly trained to
produce a fixed output dimension. This issue is particularly severe in online
learning settings, where new output features, such as items in a recommender
system, are added continually with few or no associated observations. As such,
methods for adapting neural networks to novel features which are both time and
data-efficient are desired. To address this, we propose the Contextual
HyperNetwork (CHN), an auxiliary model which generates parameters for extending
the base model to a new feature, by utilizing both existing data as well as any
observations and/or metadata associated with the new feature. At prediction
time, the CHN requires only a single forward pass through a neural network,
yielding a significant speed-up when compared to re-training and fine-tuning
approaches.
  To assess the performance of CHNs, we use a CHN to augment a partial
variational autoencoder (P-VAE), a deep generative model which can impute the
values of missing features in sparsely-observed data. We show that this system
obtains improved few-shot learning performance for novel features over existing

to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement

extensive efforts to manually curate a labeled dataset. When the classification
purpose changes (e.g. identifying bugs versus usability issues or sentiment),
new datasets should be labeled, which prevents the extensibility of the
developed models for new desired classes/tasks in practice. Recent pre-trained
neural language models (PTM) are trained on large corpora in an unsupervised
manner and have found success in solving similar Natural Language Processing
problems. However, the applicability of PTMs is not explored for app review
classification Objective: We investigate the benefits of PTMs for app review
classification compared to the existing models, as well as the transferability
of PTMs in multiple settings. Method: We empirically study the accuracy and
time efficiency of PTMs compared to prior approaches using six datasets from
literature. In addition, we investigate the performance of the PTMs trained on
app reviews (i.e. domain-specific PTMs) . We set up different studies to
evaluate PTMs in multiple settings: binary vs. multi-class classification,
zero-shot classification (when new labels are introduced to the model),
multi-task setting, and classification of reviews from different resources. The
datasets are manually labeled app review datasets from Google Play Store, Apple
App Store, and Twitter data. In all cases, Micro and Macro Precision, Recall,
and F1-scores will be used and we will report the time required for training
and prediction with the models.

a family of symmetric polynomials indexed by a tuple of (possibly

been shown that these polynomials can be seen as the partition function of a
certain vertex model whose boundary conditions are determined by

of $t$, which in turn implies that the corresponding LLT polynomials are equal
up to the same overall factor. Using these techniques, we are also able to
systematically determine linear relations within families of LLT polynomials.

couplings during the double ionization of deuterated water using
momentum-resolved coincidence spectroscopy. By examining the three-body
dicationic dissociation channel, D$^{+}$/D$^{+}$/O, for both few- and
multi-cycle laser pulses, strong evidence for intra-pulse dynamics is observed.
The extracted angle- and energy-resolved double ionization yields are compared
to classical trajectory simulations of the dissociation dynamics occurring from
different electronic states of the dication. In contrast with measurements of
single photon double ionization, pronounced departure from the expectations for
vertical ionization is observed, even for pulses as short as 10~fs in duration.
We outline numerous mechanisms by which the strong laser field can modify the
nuclear wavefunction en-route to final states of the dication where molecular
fragmentation occurs. Specifically, we consider the possibility of a
coordinate-dependence to the strong-field ionization rate, intermediate nuclear
motion in monocation states prior to double ionization, and near-resonant
laser-induced dipole couplings in the ion. These results highlight the fact
that, for small and light molecules such as D$_2$O, a vertical-transition
treatment of the ionization dynamics is not sufficient to reproduce the

circumvention. Balboa provides a general framework for tunneling data through
existing applications. Balboa sits between an application and the operating
system, intercepting outgoing network traffic and rewriting it to embed data.
To avoid introducing any distinguishable divergence from the expected
application behavior, Balboa only rewrites traffic that matches an externally
specified \emph{traffic model} pre-shared between the communicating parties.
The traffic model captures some subset of the network traffic (e.g., some
subset of music an audio streaming server streams). The sender uses this model
to replace outgoing data with a pointer to the associated location in the model
and embed data in the freed up space. The receiver then extracts the data,
replacing the pointer with the original data from the model before passing the
data on to the application. When using TLS, this approach means that
application behavior with Balboa is \emph{equivalent}, modulo small
(protocol-dependent) timing differences, to if the application was running
without Balboa.
  Balboa differs from prior approaches in that it (1) provides a framework for
tunneling data through arbitrary (TLS-protected) protocols/applications, and
(2) runs the unaltered application binaries on standard inputs, as opposed to
most prior tunneling approaches which run the application on non-standard --
and thus potentially distinguishable -- inputs.
  We present two instantiations of Balboa -- one for audio streaming and one
for web browsing -- and demonstrate the difficulty of identifying Balboa by a
machine learning classifier.

develop a compressed sensing (CS) based beam training scheme with constrained

reduced training length in AoA/AoD estimation and is thus more suitable for UAV

several advantages over traditional low rank decompositions based on
orthonormal bases. These include the preservation of properties such as
sparsity or non-negativity, the ability to interpret data, and reduced storage
requirements. The problem of finding the skeleton sets that minimize the norm
of the residual error is known to be NP-hard, but classical pivoting schemes
such as column pivoted QR work tend to work well in practice. When combined
with randomized dimension reduction techniques, classical pivoting based
methods become particularly effective, and have proven capable of very rapidly

are based on drawing the columns and rows randomly from the full index sets,
using specialized probability distributions based on leverage scores. Such
sampling based techniques are particularly appealing for very large scale

is that the solution to the optimization problem is typically not tractable to

developed statistical guarantees -- which all involve the (data) asymptotic

thin Class III disks and how they correlate to younger and older disks. In this
work, we collect literature and ALMA archival millimeter fluxes for 85 disks
(8%) of all Class III disks across nearby star-forming regions. We derive
millimeter-dust masses $M_{\text{dust}}$ and compare these with Class II and
debris disk samples in the context of excess infrared luminosity, accretion
rate, and age. The mean $M_{\text{dust}}$ of Class III disks is $0.29 \pm
0.19~M_{\oplus}$. We propose a new evolutionary scenario wherein radial drift
is very efficient for non-structured disks during the Class II phase resulting
in a rapid decrease of $M_{\text{dust}}$. However, we find long infrared
protoplanetary disk timescales of ${\sim}$8~Myr, which are consistent with
overall slow disk evolution. In structured disks, the presence of dust traps
allows for the formation of planetesimal belts at large radii, such as those
observed in debris disks. We propose therefore that the planetesimal belts in
debris disks are the result of dust traps in structured disks, whereas
protoplanetary disks without dust traps decrease in dust mass through radial
drift and are therefore undetectable as debris disks after the gas has
dissipated. These results provide a hypothesis for a novel view of disk
evolution.

is formulated as a two-timescale optimization problem to jointly optimize FTCDs

accurate models of the system, but sometimes impractical because of their
unaffordable effort on modelling. In this paper, a novel bi-level off-policy
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem in a
model-free manner. A Bi-level Markov decision process (BMDP) is defined to
describe the two-timescale VVC problem and separate agents are set up for the

facilitating optical data storage (ODS) for information security and data
storage capacity escalation. However, despite recent advances in nanophotonic
techniques vastly enhancing the feasibility of applying polarization channels,
the data fidelity in reconstructed bits has been constrained by severe
crosstalks occurring between varied polarization angles during data recording
and reading process, which gravely hindered the utilization of this technique
in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate an ultra-low crosstalk
polarization-encoding multilayer optical data storage technique for
high-fidelity data recording and retrieving by utilizing a nanofibre-based
nanocomposite film involving highly aligned gold nanorods (GNRs). With
parallelizing the gold nanorods in the recording medium, the information
carrier configuration minimizes miswriting and misreading possibilities for
information input and output, respectively, compared with its randomly
self-assembled counterparts. The enhanced data accuracy has significantly
improved the bit recall fidelity that is quantified by a correlation
coefficient higher than 0.99. It is anticipated that the demonstrated technique
can facilitate the development of multiplexing ODS for a greener future.

stress required for dislocations to bypass the $\gamma'$ precipitates
distributed in the $\gamma$ matrix. A rich variety of bypass mechanism has been
identified, with various shearing and Orowan looping processes giving way to
climb bypass as the operating conditions change from the low/intermediate
temperatures and high stress regime, to the high temperature and low stress
regime. When anti phase boundary (APB) shearing and Orowan looping mechanisms
operate, the bypass mechanism changes from shearing to looping with increased
particle size and within a broad coexistence size window. Another possibility,
supported by indirect experimental evidence, is that a third ""hybrid""
transition mechanism may operate. In this paper we use discrete dislocation
dynamics (DDD) simulations to study dislocation bypass mechanisms in Ni-based
superalloys. We develop a new method to compute generalized stacking fault
forces in DDD simulations. We use this method to study the mechanisms of bypass
of a square lattice of spherical $\gamma'$ precipitates by
$a/2\langle110\rangle\{111\}$ edge dislocations, as a function of the
precipitates volume fraction and size. We show that the hybrid mechanism is
possible and it operates as a transition mechanism between the shearing and
looping regimes over a large range of precipitates volume fraction and radii.
We also consider the effects of a $\gamma/\gamma'$ lattice misfit on the bypass
mechanisms, which we approximate by an additional precipitate stress computed
according to Eshelby's inclusion theory. We show that in the shearing and
hybrid looping-shearing regimes, a lattice misfit generally results in an
increased bypass stress. For sufficiently high lattice misfit, the bypass
stress is controlled by the pinning of the trailing dislocation on the exit
side of the precipitates.

less than 0.3 day, they would evolve toward ultra-compact binary pulsars due to
the rapid orbital shrinkage by the gravitational wave (GW) radiation. During
the orbital decay, the MSP with an ellipticity would spin down by the GW
radiation and the magnetic dipole radiation. Our calculations indicate that the
angular momentum loss is dominated by the GW radiation when the ellipticities
of the neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $(1-50)\times 10^{-7}$, and the
frequencies of high-frequency GW signals from the rotating NSs are $10-100$ Hz
when the binary pulsars can be visible as low-frequency GW sources. These
high-frequency GW signals are possible to be detected by the aLIGO and the
third-generation GW detectors such as Einstein Telescope, depending on the
frequencies and the distances. Therefore, some ultra-compact binary pulsars
have an opportunity to become intriguing dual-line GW sources. By detecting the
low-frequency GW signals, the NS mass can be accurately derived. A dual-line
detection of two band GW signals could provide a constraint on the moment of
inertia and the ellipticity of the NS. Thus the dual-line GW sources can be
potentially applied to constrain the equation of state of the NS.

modified version of an NFW profile for the ICL. We take advantage of a wide
sample of BCG+ICL systems simulated with our state-of-art semi-analytic model
to: (a) investigate the reliability of our BCG+ICL distribution by looking at
several scaling relations between the BCG+ICL stellar mass within different
apertures and the total BCG+ICL/halo mass, at different redshift; (b) make a
prediction of the distance where the radial distribution transitions from BCG
to ICL dominated. We find that our model nicely reproduces all the observed
scaling relations investigated at the present time with a compelling degree of
precision, but slightly biased-low with respect to observations at higher
redshifts ($z\gtrsim 0.5$). The transition radius predicted by our model is in
good agreement with recent observational results, and spans a range between
$\sim 15$ kpc and $\sim 100$ kpc. It mostly depends on the morphology of the
BCG, whether it is bulge or disk dominated, on the amount of ICL with respect

environmental, ecological, and evolutionary forces. Understanding the effects
of these forces on species' range dynamics is a major goal of spatial ecology.
Previous mathematical models have jointly captured the dynamic changes in
species' population distributions and the selective evolution of
fitness-related phenotypic traits in the presence of an environmental gradient.
These models inevitably include some unrealistic assumptions, and biologically
reasonable ranges of values for their parameters are not easy to specify. As a
result, simulations of the seminal models of this type can lead to markedly
different conclusions about the behavior of such populations, including the
possibility of maladaptation setting stable range boundaries. Here, we
harmonize such results by developing and simulating a continuum model of range
evolution in a community of species that interact competitively while diffusing
over an environmental gradient. Our model extends existing models by
incorporating both competition and freely changing intraspecific trait
variance. Simulations of this model predict a spatial profile of species' trait
variance that is consistent with experimental measurements available in the
literature. Moreover, they reaffirm interspecific competition as an effective
factor in limiting species' ranges, even when trait variance is not
artificially constrained. These theoretical results can inform the design of,
as yet rare, empirical studies to clarify the evolutionary causes of range
stabilization.

Distribution (SED) has suggested that the maximum dust size is $\sim$ mm. To
solve the contradiction, we investigate the impact of differential settling of
dust grains on the SED and polarization. If the disk is optically thick, longer
observing wavelength traces more interior layer which would be dominated by
larger grains. We find that, the SED of the center part of the HL Tau disk can
be explained with mm-sized grains for a broad range of turbulence strength,
while $160~{\rm \mu m}$-sized grains can explain barely only if the turbulence
strength parameter $\alpha_{\rm t}$ is lower than $10^{-5}$. We also find that
the observed polarization fraction can be potentially explained with the
maximum dust size of $1~{\rm mm}$ if $\alpha_{\rm t}\lesssim10^{-5}$, although
models with $160~{\rm \mu m}$-sized grains are also acceptable. However, if the
maximum dust size is $\sim3~{\rm mm}$, the simulated polarization fraction is
too low to explain the observations even if the turbulence strength is
extremely small, indicating the maximum dust size of $\lesssim1$ mm. The
degeneracy between 100 ${\rm \mu m}$-sized and mm-sized grains can be solved by
improving the ALMA calibration accuracy or polarimetric observations at

two-stage heterogeneous centralized training which allows the training of

make them learn cooperative behaviors while attempting to maximize shared

role rewards and team rewards simultaneously. The proposed method is applied to

insufficient for safe navigation around pedestrians and remaining on the
sidewalk space. Thus, our approach takes advantage of natural human motion to

stable linear systems, all previously-known sets of contracting recurrent
neural networks and echo state networks, all deep feedforward neural networks,

success for NISQ computers. Several 3rd party compilers are evolving to offer
improved performance for large quantum circuits. These 3rd parties, or just a
certain release of an otherwise trustworthy compiler, may possibly be untrusted
and this could lead to an adversary to Reverse Engineer (RE) the quantum
circuit for extracting sensitive aspects e.g., circuit topology, program, and
its properties. In this paper, we propose obfuscation of quantum circuits to
hide the functionality. Quantum circuits have inherent margin between correct
and incorrect outputs. Therefore, obfuscation (i.e., corruption of
functionality) by inserting dummy gates is nontrivial. We insert dummy SWAP
gates one at a time for maximum corruption of functionality before sending the
quantum circuit to an untrusted compiler. If an untrusted party clones the
design, they get incorrect functionality. The designer removes the dummy SWAP
gate post-compilation to restore the correct functionality. Compared to a
classical counterpart, the quantum chip does not reveal the circuit
functionality. Therefore, an adversary cannot guess the SWAP gate and
location/validate using an oracle model. Evaluation of realistic quantum
circuit with/without SWAP insertion is impossible in classical computers.
Therefore, we propose a metric-based SWAP gate insertion process. The objective
of the metric is to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using
Total Variation Distance (TVD). The proposed approach is validated using IBM
default noisy simulation model. Our metric-based approach predicts the SWAP
position to achieve TVD of upto 50%, and performs 7.5% better than average TVD,
and performs within 12.3% of the best obtainable TVD for the benchmarks. We
obtain an overhead of < 5% for the number of gates and circuit depth after SWAP
addition.

(SPDL)-based traffic control model at isolated intersections under the mixed

cross the intersection during the shared phases with HVs. A three-level
optimization model is developed. At the upper level, a standard NEMA (National
Electrical Manufacturers Association) ring barrier structure is used for the
signal optimization and barrier durations are optimized by dynamic programming
to minimize the total vehicle delay. At the middle level, phase sequence and
phase durations are optimized by enumeration for the given barrier from the
upper level and the minimum vehicle delay is fed to the upper level. At the
lower level, CAV platooning in the buffer zone and trajectory planning in the
passing zone are conducted based on the signal timings of the barrier from the
middle level and the travel time of CAVs is fed to the middle level. A
rolling-horizon scheme is further designed for the dynamical implementation of
the proposed model with time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical studies
validate the advantages of the SPDL-based control over the blue-phase based
control in previous studies in terms of average vehicle delay and intersection
capacity. Further, the SPDL-based model is extended to serve as an alternative
approach without the buffer zone.

mismatch between power consumption and production, causing generators to

have been designed to perform frequency and load/renewables-following control.
In particular, the literature addressed a plethora of grid- and
frequency-control challenges with a focus on linearized, differential equation
models whereby algebraic constraints (i.e., power flows) are eliminated. This
is in contrast with the more realistic nonlinear differential algebraic
equation (NDAE) models. Yet, as grids are increasingly pushed to their limits
via intermittent renewables and varying loads, their physical states risk
escaping operating regions due to either a poor prediction or sudden changes in
renewables or demands -- deeming a feedback controller based on a linearization
point virtually unusable. In lieu of linearized differential equation models,
the objective of this paper is to design a simple, purely decentralized,
linearization-free, feedback control law for NDAE models of power networks. The
aim of such a controller is to primarily stabilize frequency oscillations after
a significant, unknown disturbance in renewables or loads. Although the
controller design involves advanced NDAE system theory, the controller itself
is as simple as a decentralized proportional or linear quadratic regulator in
its implementation. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed controller is
able to stabilize dynamic and algebraic states under significant disturbances.

the minimizer of the Hamiltonian, in which the gradient is substituted with

the context of control-theoretic problem. We begin by discussing SAAF of OUM.
We then prove some properties of the value function and its gradient, which
provide the key motivation for constructing our method. Based on these

the qualitative agreement between tidal theory and the observed exoplanet
distribution. Nevertheless, due to the time-varying interchange of spin-orbit
angular momentum in star-planet systems, the expected amount of tidal friction
is unknown and depends on the dissipative properties of stellar and planetary
interiors. In this work, we couple structural changes in the star and the
planet resulting from the energy released per tidal cycle and simulate the
orbital evolution of USP planets and the spin-up produced on their host star.
For the first time, we allow the strength of magnetic braking to vary within a
model that includes photo-evaporation, drag caused by the stellar wind, stellar
mass loss, and stellar wind enhancement due to the in-falling USP planet. We
apply our model to the two exoplanets with the shortest periods known to date,
NGTS-10b and WASP-19b. We predict they will undergo orbital decay in
time-scales that depend on the evolution of the tidal dissipation reservoir
inside the star, as well as the contribution of the stellar convective envelope
to the transfer of angular momentum. Contrary to previous work, which predicted
mid-transit time shifts of $\sim30-190$ s over 10 years, we found that such
changes would be smaller than 10 s. We note this is sensitive to the
assumptions about the dissipative properties of the system. Our results have
important implications for the search for observational evidence of orbital
decay in USP planets, using present and future observational campaigns.

average $\sim 2.2$ and $1.8$ times lower than its galaxy averages. The obtained
carbon abundances from different DGR assumptions show flat profiles with
galactocentric radii, and the average carbon abundance of the galaxies is
comparable to the usually adopted value of $3 \times 10^{-5}$. We find that
both metallicity and infrared luminosity correlate moderately with the

presumed to lack selectivity. The few known methods of designing selectivity in
solid-state reactions have limited scope, such as topotactic reactions or
strain stabilization. This contribution describes a general approach for
searching large chemical spaces to identify selective reactions. This novel
approach explains the ability of a nominally ""innocent"" Na$_2$CO$_3$ precursor
to enable the metathesis synthesis of single-phase Y$_2$Mn$_2$O$_7$ -- an
outcome that was previously only accomplished at extreme pressures and which
cannot be achieved with closely related precursors of Li$_2$CO$_3$ and
K$_2$CO$_3$. By calculating the required change in chemical potential across
all possible reactant-product interfaces in an expanded chemical space
including Y, Mn, O, alkali metals, and halogens, using thermodynamic parameters
obtained from density functional theory calculations, we identify reactions
that minimize the thermodynamic competition from intermediates. In this manner,
only the Na-based intermediates minimize the distance in the hyperdimensional
chemical potential space to Y$_2$Mn$_2$O$_7$, thus providing selective access
to a phase which was previously thought to be metastable. Experimental evidence
validating this mechanism for pathway-dependent selectivity is provided by
intermediates identified from in situ synchrotron-based crystallographic
analysis. This approach of calculating chemical potential distances in
hyperdimensional compositional spaces provides a general method for designing
selective solid-state syntheses that will be useful for gaining access to
metastable phases and for identifying reaction pathways that can reduce the
synthesis temperature, and cost, of technological materials.

sampling of novel identities. We combine this generative model with a
parametric face model and gain explicit control over head pose and facial

enforces a pose-independent latent space and in consequence, allows learning a
one-to-many mapping between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions.
The resulting method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel

novel identities, changing the head pose, expression transfer, and more. Code

Each combination of these eight hyper-parameters constitutes a 'datapoint' in
the parameter space. The best combination of these parameters leads to the
neural network's output power spectral peak being constraint within the alpha
band. Further, constraints were introduced to the BO algorithm based on
qualitative observation of the network output time series, so that high
amplitude pseudo-periodic oscillations are removed. Upon successful
implementation for alpha band, we further optimised the network to oscillate
within the theta (4 - 8 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz) bands. The changing rhythms
in the model can now be studied using the identified optimal hyper-parameters
for the respective frequency bands. We have previously tuned parameters in the

hydrogen (HI) in galaxies are ubiquitous, but the reasons for these
disturbances remain unclear. While some studies suggest that asymmetries in
integrated HI spectra (global HI asymmetry) are higher in HI-rich systems,
others claim that they are preferentially found in HI-poor galaxies. In this
work, we utilise the ALFALFA and xGASS surveys, plus a sample of post-merger
galaxies, to clarify the link between global HI asymmetry and the gas
properties of galaxies. Focusing on star-forming galaxies in ALFALFA, we find
that elevated global HI asymmetry is not associated with a change in the HI
content of a galaxy, and that only the galaxies with the highest global HI
asymmetry show a small increase in specific star-formation rate (sSFR).
However, we show that the lack of a trend with HI content is because ALFALFA
misses the gas-poor tail of the star-forming main-sequence. Using xGASS to
obtain a sample of star-forming galaxies that is representative in both sSFR
and HI content, we find that global HI asymmetric galaxies are typically more
gas-poor than symmetric ones at fixed stellar mass, with no change in sSFR. Our
results highlight the complexity of the connection between galaxy properties
and global HI asymmetry. This is further confirmed by the fact that even
post-merger galaxies show both symmetric and asymmetric HI spectra,
demonstrating that merger activity does not always lead to an asymmetric global
HI spectrum.

enforced at primal 0-cells with the help of musical isomorphisms mapping
cochains to smooth fields and vice versa. The balance of linear momentum is
established at primal 0-cells. The governing equations are solved as a Laplace
equation with a non-local and non-diagonal material Hodge star. Numerical
simulations of several classical problems with analytic solutions are presented

the structure is required to follow a prescribed macroscopic elastic behaviour.

for improving physical-layer secret communication in multi-user downlink
systems. It is assumed that there are out-of-band D2D channels, on each of
which a selected legitimate user transmits an amplified version of the received
downlink signal to other legitimate users. A key technical challenge for
designing such systems is that eavesdroppers can overhear downlink as well as
D2D cooperation signals. We tackle the problem of jointly optimizing the
downlink precoding, artificial noise covariance, and amplification coefficients
that maximize the minimum rate. An iterative alternating optimization algorithm
is proposed based on the matrix fractional programming. Numerical results
confirm the performance gains of the proposed D2D cooperation scheme compared
to benchmark secret communication schemes.

cognitive radio inspired non-orthogonal multiple access (CR-NOMA) networks,
where time-division multiple access (TDMA) is used to serve multiple primary
users and an energy-constrained secondary user is admitted to the primary
users' time slots via NOMA. During each time slot, the secondary user performs
the two tasks: data transmission and energy harvesting based on the signals
received from the primary users. The goal of the paper is to maximize the
secondary user's long-term throughput, by optimizing its transmit power and the
time-sharing coefficient for its two tasks. The long-term throughput
maximization problem is challenging due to the need for making decisions that
yield long-term gains but might result in short-term losses. For example, when
in a given time slot, a primary user with large channel gains transmits,
intuition suggests that the secondary user should not carry out data
transmission due to the strong interference from the primary user but perform
energy harvesting only, which results in zero data rate for this time slot but
yields potential long-term benefits. In this paper, a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) approach is applied to emulate this intuition, where the deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed together with convex
optimization. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL assisted
NOMA transmission scheme can yield significant performance gains over two

the Finite Volume Neural Network (FINN). The FINN method adopts the numerical
structure of the well-known Finite Volume Method for handling partial

adaptable conservation law, while it concurrently accommodates learnable
parameters. As a result, FINN enables better handling of fluxes between control
volumes and therefore proper treatment of different types of numerical boundary
conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a subsurface
contaminant transport problem, which is governed by a non-linear
diffusion-sorption process. FINN does not only generalize better to differing
boundary conditions compared to other methods, it is also capable to explicitly
extract and learn the constitutive relationships (expressed by the retardation
factor). More importantly, FINN shows excellent generalization ability when
applied to both synthetic datasets and real, sparse experimental data, thus
underlining its relevance as a data-driven modeling tool.

the classical calculation of $k_2$ when quantum expectation values are replaced
by the corresponding classical quantities, as dictated by the Bohr
correspondence principle. The standard derivation of $k_2$ for classical
relativistic stars relies on fixing boundary conditions on the surface of the
star for the Einstein equations in the presence of an external perturbing
field. An alternative method for calculating $k_2$ uses properties of the
spectrum of the non-relativistic fluid modes of the star. We adopt this
alternative method and use it to derive an effective description of the
interior modes in terms of a collection of driven harmonic oscillators
characterized by different frequencies and amplitudes. We compare these two
classical methods and find that most of the interior information can be
integrated out, reducing the problem of calculating $k_2$ to fixing a single
boundary condition for the perturbed Einstein equations on the surface of the
deformed star. We then determine this single boundary condition in terms of the
spectrum of the object and proceed to identify the relationship between
classical quantities and quantum expectation values and to verify the agreement
between the results of the effective classical calculation and the quantum
calculation.

groups of closed negatively curved surfaces, and generalized by O. Guichard and
A. Wienhard [19] to representations of arbitrary Gromov hyperbolic groups into
real semisimple Lie groups. In this paper, we focus on Anosov representations
into the identity component O0(2, n) of O(2, n) for n $\ge$ 2. Our main result
is that any Anosov representation with negative limit set as defined in [8] is
the holonomy group of a spatially compact, globally hyperbolic maximal (abbrev.
CGHM) conformally flat spacetime. The proof of the spatial compactness needs a
particular care. The key idea is to notice that for any spacetime M , the space
of lightlike geodesics of M is homeomorphic to the unit tangent bundle of a
Cauchy hypersurface of M. For this purpose, we introduce the space of causal
geodesics containing timelike and lightlike geodesics of anti-de Sitter space
and lightlike geodesics of its conformal boundary: the Einstein spacetime. The
spatial compactness is a consequence of the following theorem : Any Anosov
representation acts properly discontinuously by isometries on the set of causal
geodesics avoiding the limit set; besides, this action is cocompact. It is
stated in a general setting by O. Guichard, F. Kassel and A. Wienhard in [11].
We can see this last result as a Lorentzian analogue of the action of convex
cocompact Kleinian group on the complementary of the limit set in H n. Lastly,
we show that the conformally flat spacetime in our main result is the union of
two conformal copies of a strongly causal AdS-spacetime with boundary which
contains-when the limit set is not a topological (n -- 1)-sphere-a globally
hyperbolic region having the properties of a black hole as defined in [2], [3],

security masks remains a bottleneck of FL. This paper proposes a
communication-efficient FL framework with Adaptive Quantized Gradient (AQG)
which adaptively adjusts the quantization level based on local gradient's
update to fully utilize the heterogeneousness of local data distribution for
reducing unnecessary transmissions. Besides, the client dropout issues are
taken into account and the Augmented AQG is developed, which could limit the
dropout noise with an appropriate amplification mechanism for transmitted
gradients. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed
AQG leads to 25%-50% of additional transmission reduction as compared to
existing popular methods including Quantized Gradient Descent (QGD) and Lazily
Aggregated Quantized (LAQ) gradient-based method without deteriorating
convergence properties. Particularly, experiments with heterogenous data
distributions corroborate a more significant transmission reduction compared
with independent identical data distributions. Meanwhile, the proposed AQG is
robust to a client dropping rate up to 90% empirically, and the Augmented AQG
manages to further improve the FL system's communication efficiency with the
presence of moderate-scale client dropouts commonly seen in practical FL
scenarios.

family of quadruple perovskite manganites that exhibit an incommensurate
structural modulation associated with an orbital density wave. It has been
found that the structural modulation in PbMn$_{7}$O$_{12}$ onsets at 294 K with
the incommensurate propagation vector $\mathbf{k}_s=(0,0,\sim2.08)$. At 110 K
another structural transition takes place where the propagation vector suddenly
drops down to a \emph{quasi}-commensurate value $\mathbf{k}_s=(0,0,2.0060(6))$.
The \emph{quasi}-commensurate phase is stable in the temperature range of 40K -
110 K, and below 40 K the propagation vector jumps back to the incommensurate
value $\mathbf{k}_s=(0,0,\sim2.06)$. Both low temperature structural
transitions are strongly first order with large thermal hysteresis. The orbital
density wave in the \emph{quasi}-commensurate phase has been found to be
substantially suppressed in comparison with the incommensurate phases, which
naturally explains unusual magnetic behaviour recently reported for this
perovskite. Analysis of the refined structural parameters revealed that that
the presence of the \emph{quasi}-commensurate phase is likely to be associated
with a competition between the Pb$^{2+}$ lone electron pair and Mn$^{3+}$

attention in the literature. From the point of view of regularization it is of
special interest because of the occurrence of a non-compact forward operator
with non-closed range. Consequently, HMP constitutes one of few examples of a
linear ill-posed problem of type~I in the sense of Nashed. In this paper we
highlight this property and its consequences, for example, the existence of a
infinite-dimensional subspace of stability. On the other hand, we show
conditional stability estimates for the HMP in Sobolev spaces that indicate
severe ill-posedness for the full recovery of a function from its moments,
because H\""{o}lder-type stability can be excluded. However, the associated
recovery %of the linear functional that characterizes of the function value at
the rightmost point of the unit interval is stable of H\""{o}lder-type in an

where the forward operator becomes compact. Some numerical case studies

applied in a non-Hermitian interpolating Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Fibonacci (IAAF)
model, which combines the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr{\'e} (AA) model and the
non-Hermitian Fibonacci model through a varying parameter, and the
non-Hermiticity in this model is introduced by the non-reciprocal hopping. In
the non-Hermitian AA limit, the system undergoes a delocalization transition by
tuning the potential strength. At the critical point, the spatial distribution
of the critical state shows a self-similar structure with the relative distance
between the peaks being the Fibonacci sequence, and the finite-size scaling of
the inverse participation ratios $({\rm IPRs})$ of the critical ground state
with lattice size $L$ shows that ${\rm IPR}_g\propto L^{-0.1189}$. In the
non-Hermitian Fibonacci limit, we find that the system is always in the
extended phase. Along the continuous deformation from the non-Hermitian AA
model into the non-Hermitian Fibonacci model in the IAAF model, the cascade of
the delocalization transition is found, but only a few plateaux appear.
Moreover, the self-similar structure of spatial distribution for the critical
modes along the cascade transition is also found. In addition, we find that the
delocalization transition and the real-complex transition for the excited
states happen at almost the same parameter. Our results show that the
non-Hermiticity provides an additional knob to control the cascade of the
delocalization transition besides the on-site potential.

different for both cases. This highlights that two systems with different
chemical composition can yield the same multiplicities after resonance decays.
The nature of these two minima is further investigated by studying the
time-dependent particle yields and extracted thermodynamic properties of the

not well capturing the spatial relationships in neighbored image pixels or
being hard to handle the noisy nature of the monocular pseudo-LiDAR point
cloud. To overcome these issues, in this paper we propose a novel
object-centric voxel representation tailored for monocular 3D object detection.
Specifically, voxels are built on each object proposal, and their sizes are
adaptively determined by the 3D spatial distribution of the points, allowing
the noisy point cloud to be organized effectively within a voxel grid. This
representation is proved to be able to locate the object in 3D space
accurately. Furthermore, prior works would like to estimate the orientation via
deep features extracted from an entire image or a noisy point cloud. By
contrast, we argue that the local RoI information from the object image patch
alone with a proper resizing scheme is a better input as it provides complete
semantic clues meanwhile excludes irrelevant interferences. Besides, we
decompose the confidence mechanism in monocular 3D object detection by
considering the relationship between 3D objects and the associated 2D boxes.
Evaluated on KITTI, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large

  Hyperparameter Optimisation in Graph Neural Network For Molecular Property
  Prediction",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, the study of graph neural network (GNN) has attracted much
attention and achieved promising performance in molecular property prediction.
Most GNNs for molecular property prediction are proposed based on the idea of
learning the representations for the nodes by aggregating the information of
their neighbor nodes (e.g. atoms). Then, the representations can be passed to
subsequent layers to deal with individual downstream tasks. Therefore, the
architectures of GNNs can be considered as being composed of two core parts:
graph-related layers and task-specific layers. Facing real-world molecular
problems, the hyperparameter optimization for those layers are vital.
Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) becomes expensive in this situation because
evaluating candidate solutions requires massive computational resources to
train and validate models. Furthermore, a larger search space often makes the
HPO problems more challenging. In this research, we focus on the impact of
selecting two types of GNN hyperparameters, those belonging to graph-related
layers and those of task-specific layers, on the performance of GNN for
molecular property prediction. In our experiments. we employed a
state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm (i.e., CMA-ES) for HPO. The results
reveal that optimizing the two types of hyperparameters separately can gain the
improvements on GNNs' performance, but optimising both types of hyperparameters
simultaneously will lead to predominant improvements. Meanwhile, our study also
further confirms the importance of HPO for GNNs in molecular property
prediction problems.

corrections and study how the quadrupole moment can be constrained with
TianQin. We find that TianQin can measure the dimensionless quadrupole moment

choice of the waveform cutoff is found to have significant effect on the

the mass of the massive black hole, while the spin has negligible impact; if
the Kerr cutoff is used, however, the dependence on the spin is more
significant. We have also analyzed the cases when TianQin is observing

been under debate. It is well known that the dynamical pairing affects the
nuclear matrix element of the Gamow-Teller (GT) transition and the double beta
decay. Purpose: We investigate the effect of the pn-pair interaction in the
$T=0, S=1$ channel on the low-lying spin-dipole (SD) transition. We then aim at
clarifying the distinction of the role in between the SD and GT transitions.
Method: We perform a three-body model calculation for the transition
${}^{80}\mathrm{Ni}\to{}^{80}\mathrm{Cu}$, where ${}^{78}\mathrm{Ni}$ is taken
as a core. The strength of the pair interaction is varied to see the effect on
the SD transition-strength distribution. To fortify the finding obtained by the
three-body model, we employ the nuclear energy-density functional method for
the SD transitions in several nuclei, where one can expect a strong effect.
Results: The effect of the $S=1$ pn-pair interaction depends on the spatial
overlap of the pn pair and the angular momentum of the valence nucleons; the
higher the angular momentum of the orbitals, the more significant the effect.
Conclusions: The dynamical $S=1$ pairing is effective even for SD states
although the spatial overlap of the pn pair can be smaller than GT states. The
SD transition involving high-$\ell$ orbitals with the same principal quantum
number is strongly affected by the dynamical $S=1$ pairing.

Current algorithms for the synthesis of potentially interpretable models rely

interpretability is intrinsically subjective. In this paper, we propose an
approach for the synthesis of models that are tailored to the user by enabling
the user to steer the model synthesis process according to her or his

with trade-offs between accuracy and a user-specific notion of
interpretability. The latter is estimated by a neural network that is trained
concurrently to the evolution using the feedback of the user, which is
collected using uncertainty-based active learning. To maximize usability, the
user is only asked to tell, given two models at the time, which one is less
complex. With experiments on two real-world datasets involving 61 participants,
we find that our approach is capable of learning estimations of
interpretability that can be very different for different users. Moreover, the
users tend to prefer models found using the proposed approach over models found

Its peculiar configuration consisting of five sub-Earth-sized planets orbiting

about the potential presence of escaping atmospheres today. Aims. We aim to
study the orbital evolution of Kepler-444-d and Kepler-444-e and the impact of
atmospheric evaporation on Kepler-444-e. Methods. Rotating stellar models of
Kepler-444-A were computed with the Geneva stellar evolution code and coupled
to an orbital evolution code, accounting for the effects of dynamical,
equilibrium tides and atmospheric evaporation. The impacts of multiple stellar
rotational histories and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) luminosity evolutionary
tracks are explored. Results. Using detailed rotating stellar models able to
reproduce the rotation rate of Kepler-444-A, we find that its observed rotation
rate is perfectly in line with what is expected for this old K0-type star,
indicating that there is no reason for it to be exceptionally active as would
be required to explain the observed HI-Ly-$\rm \alpha$ variations from a
stellar origin. We show that given the low planetary mass ($\sim$ 0.03 M$_{\rm
\oplus}$) and relatively large orbital distance ($\sim$ 0.06 AU) of
Kepler-444-d and e, dynamical tides negligibly affect their orbits, regardless
of the stellar rotational history considered. We point out instead how
remarkable the impact is of the stellar rotational history on the estimation of
the lifetime mass loss for Kepler-444-e. We show that, even in the case of an
extremely slow rotating star, it seems unlikely that such a planet could retain
a fraction of the initial water-ice content if we assume that it formed with a

surface-defect detection problems in industrial quality control. However, with
a large amount of data needed for learning, often requiring high-precision
labels, many industrial problems cannot be easily solved, or the cost of the
solutions would significantly increase due to the annotation requirements. In
this work, we relax heavy requirements of fully supervised learning methods and
reduce the need for highly detailed annotations. By proposing a deep-learning
architecture, we explore the use of annotations of different details ranging
from weak (image-level) labels through mixed supervision to full (pixel-level)
annotations on the task of surface-defect detection. The proposed end-to-end
architecture is composed of two sub-networks yielding defect segmentation and
classification results. The proposed method is evaluated on several datasets
for industrial quality inspection: KolektorSDD, DAGM and Severstal Steel
Defect. We also present a new dataset termed KolektorSDD2 with over 3000 images
containing several types of defects, obtained while addressing a real-world
industrial problem. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on all four
datasets. The proposed method outperforms all related approaches in fully
supervised settings and also outperforms weakly-supervised methods when only
image-level labels are available. We also show that mixed supervision with only
a handful of fully annotated samples added to weakly labelled training images
can result in performance comparable to the fully supervised model's
performance but at a significantly lower annotation cost.

On the other side, communication compression algorithms such as 1-bit Adam help

However, constructing a statistically meaningful sample of tidal streams beyond

streams has yet to be realised. Here we introduce the Stellar Stream Legacy

from cosmological galaxy simulations. These tests will probe the present-day

models, which study how users interact with a ranked list of items, provide a
useful understanding of user feedback for learning ranking models. Constructing
""right"" dependencies is the key of any successful click model. However,
probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have to rely on manually assigned
dependencies, and oversimplify user behaviors. Existing neural network based
methods promote PGMs by enhancing the expressive ability and allowing flexible
dependencies, but still suffer from exposure bias and inferior estimation. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, Adversarial Imitation Click Model
(AICM), based on imitation learning. Firstly, we explicitly learn the reward
function that recovers users' intrinsic utility and underlying intentions.
Secondly, we model user interactions with a ranked list as a dynamic system
instead of one-step click prediction, alleviating the exposure bias problem.
Finally, we minimize the JS divergence through adversarial training and learn a
stable distribution of click sequences, which makes AICM generalize well across
different distributions of ranked lists. A theoretical analysis has indicated
that AICM reduces the exposure bias from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. Our studies on a
public web search dataset show that AICM not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models in traditional click metrics but also achieves superior performance in
addressing the exposure bias and recovering the underlying patterns of click
sequences.

local accumulation of polyelectrolytes. We derive a zero-field theory for the

allowed to enter the confined interplate region at the cost of a conformational
free energy penalty. The resulting disjoining pressure shows a crossover to a
repulsive regime when the interplate separation gets smaller than the size of
the polyelectrolyte chain, followed by an attractive part. We find a

  Compression",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The framework of dominant learned video compression methods is usually
composed of motion prediction modules as well as motion vector and residual
image compression modules, suffering from its complex structure and error
propagation problem. Approaches have been proposed to reduce the complexity by
replacing motion prediction modules with implicit flow networks. Error
propagation aware training strategy is also proposed to alleviate incremental
reconstruction errors from previously decoded frames. Although these methods
have brought some improvement, little attention has been paid to the framework
itself. Inspired by the success of learned image compression through
simplifying the framework with a single deep neural network, it is natural to
expect a better performance in video compression via a simple yet appropriate
framework. Therefore, we propose a framework to directly compress raw-pixel
frames (rather than residual images), where no extra motion prediction module
is required. Instead, an entropy model is used to estimate the spatiotemporal
redundancy in a latent space rather than pixel level, which significantly
reduces the complexity of the framework. Specifically, the whole framework is a
compression module, consisting of a unified auto-encoder which produces
identically distributed latents for all frames, and a spatiotemporal entropy
estimation model to minimize the entropy of these latents. Experiments showed
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under
the metric of multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and achieves
competitive results under the metric of PSNR.

theory due to their capacityachieving property. This goes hand in hand with a
quasilinear construction, encoding, and successive cancellation list decoding
procedures based on the Plotkin construction. The decoding algorithm can be
applied with slight modifications to Reed-Muller or eBCH codes, that both
achieve the capacity of erasure channels, although the list size needed for
good performance grows too fast to make the decoding practical even for
moderate block lengths. The key ingredient for proving the capacity-achieving
property of Reed-Muller and eBCH codes is their group of symmetries. It can be
plugged into the concept of Plotkin decomposition to design various permutation
decoding algorithms. Although such techniques allow to outperform the
straightforward polar-like decoding, the complexity stays impractical. In this
paper, we show that although invariance under a large automorphism group is
valuable in a theoretical sense, it also ensures that the list size needed for
good performance grows exponentially. We further establish the bounds that
arise if we sacrifice some of the symmetries. Although the theoretical analysis
of the list decoding algorithm remains an open problem, our result provides an
insight into the factors that impact the decoding complexity.

radiomics-based model, and (iii) a novel data-driven self-supervised approach.
We compare IDEAL to other baselines using the publicly available NIH chest

these assumptions might be suitable for small-amplitude aeroelastic problems at

  This paper establishes that ULLT still provides a good solution for low

Vortex (LEV) structures, resulting in a good prediction of whole wing force

accurate for small-amplitude kinematics, the ULLT cannot model 3D vortical

leading edge suction parameter criterion. This can then be used as an indicator

change into nonpropageting patterns and spiral wave patterns due to the

which poses great challenges for the training of neural networks in visual
recognition. Existing methods tackle this problem mainly from the perspective
of data quantity, i.e., the number of samples in each class. To be specific,
they pay more attention to tail classes, like applying larger adjustments to
the logit. However, in the training process, the quantity and difficulty of
data are two intertwined and equally crucial problems. For some tail classes,
the features of their instances are distinct and discriminative, which can also
bring satisfactory accuracy; for some head classes, although with sufficient
samples, the high semantic similarity with other classes and lack of
discriminative features will bring bad accuracy. Based on these observations,
we propose Adaptive Logit Adjustment Loss (ALA Loss) to apply an adaptive
adjusting term to the logit. The adaptive adjusting term is composed of two
complementary factors: 1) quantity factor, which pays more attention to tail
classes, and 2) difficulty factor, which adaptively pays more attention to hard
instances in the training process. The difficulty factor can alleviate the
over-optimization on tail yet easy instances and under-optimization on head yet
hard instances. The synergy of the two factors can not only advance the
performance on tail classes even further, but also promote the accuracy on head
classes. Unlike previous logit adjusting methods that only concerned about data
quantity, ALA Loss tackles the long-tailed problem from a more comprehensive,
fine-grained and adaptive perspective. Extensive experimental results show that
our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on challenging recognition

this, characteristics such as the number of heavy atoms in a molecule, number
of atoms of a given element, bond composition, or initial geometry on the
quality of the predictions are considered. The results indicate that training
on a chemically diverse database is crucial for obtaining good results but also
that conformational sampling can partly compensate for limited coverage of

singular bouncing solutions that rapidly approaches the $\Lambda$CDM model. The
Dynamical Time corresponds to the cosmic time as well. The theory fits with the

in science and engineering. For finding an optimal feedback controller, the
value function and associated fundamental equations such as the Bellman

numerical treatment of these equations poses formidable challenges due to their
non-linearity and their (possibly) high-dimensionality.
  In this paper we consider a finite horizon control system with associated
Bellman equation. After a time-discretization, we obtain a sequence of short
time horizon problems which we call local optimal control problems. For solving
the local optimal control problems we apply two different methods, one being
the well-known policy iteration, where a fixed-point iteration is required for
every time step. The other algorithm borrows ideas from Model Predictive
Control (MPC), by solving the local optimal control problem via open-loop
control methods on a short time horizon, allowing us to replace the fixed-point
iteration by an adjoint method.
  For high-dimensional systems we apply low rank hierarchical tensor product
approximation/tree-based tensor formats, in particular tensor trains (TT
tensors) and multi-polynomials, together with high-dimensional quadrature, e.g.
Monte-Carlo.
  We prove a linear error propagation with respect to the time discretization

receive partial votes from the surfaces of potential objects together with
severe outlier votes from the cluttered backgrounds, which hampers full
utilization of the information from the input point clouds. Inspired by the
back-tracing strategy in the conventional Hough voting methods, in this work,
we introduce a new 3D object detection method, named as Back-tracing
Representative Points Network (BRNet), which generatively back-traces the
representative points from the vote centers and also revisits complementary

every sequence generated by the proximal point algorithm converges to a

stars is generated remains an open question half a century after the discovery

determining the structure of the magnetosphere that surrounds these objects:
numerical computations based on the force-free, magnetohydrodynamic and
particle-in-cell formalisms have now established that the magnetosphere of an
oblique rotator entails a current sheet outside its light cylinder whose
rotating distribution pattern moves with linear speeds exceeding the speed of
light in vacuum. Here we insert the description of the current sheet provided
by the numerical simulations in the classical expression for the retarded
potential and thereby calculate the radiation field generated by this source in
the time domain. We find a radiation consisting of highly focused pulses whose
(i) spectrum can extend from radio waves to gamma rays, (ii) brightness
temperature can exceed 10^(40) K, (iii) linear polarization can be 100%, (iv)
two concurrent polarization position angles are approximately orthogonal often
and swing through 180 deg across the pulse profile in most cases, (v) circular
polarization reverses sense across some components of the pulse profile, (vi)
microstructure is determined by the thickness of the current sheet, and (vii)
whose flux density diminishes with the distance D from the star as D^(-3/2)
(rather than D^(-2)) in certain directions. The intrinsically transient
radiation process analysed here is thus capable of generating an emission whose
features are strikingly similar to those of the emissions received from pulsars

Emergent Behaviour in Multi-Task Transformer Models","EMNLP 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The primary paradigm for multi-task training in natural language processing
is to represent the input with a shared pre-trained language model, and add a

that is selected for outputting the final prediction. In this work, we examine
the behaviour of non-target heads, that is, the output of heads when given
input that belongs to a different task than the one they were trained for. We
find that non-target heads exhibit emergent behaviour, which may either explain
the target task, or generalize beyond their original task. For example, in a
numerical reasoning task, a span extraction head extracts from the input the
arguments to a computation that results in a number generated by a target
generative head. In addition, a summarization head that is trained with a
target question answering head, outputs query-based summaries when given a
question and a context from which the answer is to be extracted. This emergent
behaviour suggests that multi-task training leads to non-trivial extrapolation
of skills, which can be harnessed for interpretability and generalization.

extremely large luminosity ($ > 10^{40} \text{erg s}^{-1}$). While there is a
general consensus that they host an accreting, magnetized neutron star (NS),
the problem of how to produce luminosities $> 100$ times the Eddington limit,
$L_E$, of a solar mass object is still debated. A promising explanation relies
on the reduction of the opacities in the presence of a strong magnetic field,
which allows for the local flux to be much larger than the Eddington flux.
However, avoiding the onset of the propeller effect may be a serious problem.
Here, we reconsider the problem of column accretion onto a highly magnetized
NS, extending previously published calculations by relaxing the assumption of a
pure dipolar field and allowing for more complex magnetic field topologies. We
find that the maximum luminosity is determined primarily by the magnetic field
strength near the NS surface. We also investigate other factors determining the
accretion column geometry and the emergent luminosity, such as the assumptions
on the parameters governing the accretion flow at the disk-magnetosphere
boundary. We conclude that a strongly magnetized NS with a dipole component of
$\sim 10^{13} \text{G}$, octupole component of $\sim10^{14} \text{G}$ and spin
period $\sim1 \text{s}$ can produce a luminosity of $\sim 10^{41} \text{erg
s}^{-1}$ while avoiding the propeller regime. We apply our model to two PULXs,
NGC 5907 ULX-1 and NGC 7793 P13, and discuss how their luminosity and spin
period rate can be explained in terms of different configurations, either with
or without multipolar magnetic components.

DM fermion of mass of the order of a few GeV compared to the no-DM scenario.
Consequently, the maximum gravitational mass of NS is obtained consistent with
the bounds from the most massive pulsars which were not satisfied with the
hadronic matter EoS alone. The estimates of radius and tidal deformability of

efforts performed by developers with different backgrounds. Although the
quality of developers' contributions should be the only factor influencing the
evaluation of the contributions to OSS projects, recent studies have shown that
diversity issues are correlated with the acceptance or rejection of developers'
contributions. This paper assists this emerging state-of-the-art body on
diversity research with the first empirical study that analyzes how developers'
perceptible race and ethnicity relates to the evaluation of the contributions
in OSS. We performed a large-scale quantitative study of OSS projects in
GitHub. We extracted the developers' perceptible race and ethnicity from their
names in GitHub using the Name-Prism tool and applied regression modeling of
contributions (i.e, pull requests) data from GHTorrent and GitHub. We observed
that among the developers whose perceptible race and ethnicity was captured by
the tool, only 16.56% were perceptible as Non-White developers; contributions
from perceptible White developers have about 6-10% higher odds of being
accepted when compared to contributions from perceptible Non-White developers;
and submitters with perceptible non-white races and ethnicities are more likely
to get their pull requests accepted when the integrator is estimated to be from
their same race and ethnicity rather than when the integrator is estimated to
be White. Our initial analysis shows a low number of Non-White developers
participating in OSS. Furthermore, the results from our regression analysis
lead us to believe that there may exist differences between the evaluation of
the contributions from different perceptible races and ethnicities. Thus, our
findings reinforce the need for further studies on racial and ethnic diversity
in software engineering to foster healthier OSS communities.

  duality",,,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Tunnelling lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is a fundamental
process in attosecond science, molecular biology, and quantum devices. Whether
tunnelling takes time and how a microscopic particle transits through a barrier
have been debated since the early days of quantum mechanics. The time required
for an electron to tunnel through an atomic potential barrier has been measured
with attosecond angular streaking (attoclock), and a recent work on the
hydrogen atom claimed that electron tunnelling is instantaneous. However, the
time required for Rb atoms to tunnel through an optical potential barrier has
been measured to be on the order of milliseconds with a recent Larmor clock
measurement. The essence of electron and atom tunnelling is identical, but the
reason for the contradictory conclusions remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate
that the sub-barrier potential interaction is the root of the nonzero
tunnelling delay time. We reveal that the wave-particle duality of a tunnelling
electron must be fully taken into account when decoding the tunnelling delay
time from the attoclock measurements. Based on energy-resolved attoclock
measurements, we show that the tunnelling delay time of an electron ranges from
24 to 58 attoseconds, and the counterintuitive result that an electron with a
lower energy may spend less time in the barrier is consistent with the
velocity-dependent tunnelling time of atoms in Larmor clock measurements. Our
results unify the tunnelling time of microscopic particles by highlighting the
classically forbidden sub-barrier potential interactions of matter waves.

central to which is ensuring both passengers and nearby pedestrians feel safe.
This idea of `feeling safe' and perceived safety is highly subjective and
rooted in human intuition. As such, traditional analytical approaches to
autonomous navigation often fail to cater for the social expectations of
individuals. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to capture the
complexity of social expectations and integrate this complexity into a
3-layered Contextual Speed Controller. The layers were; the legal road speed
limit, the socially acceptable speed given the number of nearby pedestrians,
and the socially acceptable speed based on proximity to nearby pedestrians. An
implementation of this layered approach was tested in areas of both low and
high vehicle-pedestrian interactions. From the experiments conducted, the lower
two layers were seen working in tandem to modulate the vehicle speed to
appropriate levels that mimicked conservative human driver behaviour. In
summary, this work quantified the relationship between pedestrian context and
socially acceptable vehicle speeds, allowing for more perceivably safe
autonomous driving. Furthermore, the need for different driving schemes for
navigating different road environments was identified.

accurately (e.g., subjects, mask material and lighting) among pairs of live

  (2021) 130-145",,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Overfitting is one of the fundamental challenges when training convolutional
neural networks and is usually identified by a diverging training and test
loss. The underlying dynamics of how the flow of activations induce overfitting
is however poorly understood. In this study we introduce a perplexity-based
sparsity definition to derive and visualise layer-wise activation measures.
These novel explainable AI strategies reveal a surprising relationship between
activation sparsity and overfitting, namely an increase in sparsity in the
feature extraction layers shortly before the test loss starts rising. This
tendency is preserved across network architectures and reguralisation
strategies so that our measures can be used as a reliable indicator for
overfitting while decoupling the network's generalisation capabilities from its
loss-based definition. Moreover, our differentiable sparsity formulation can be
used to explicitly penalise the emergence of sparsity during training so that
the impact of reduced sparsity on overfitting can be studied in real-time.
Applying this penalty and analysing activation sparsity for well known
regularisers and in common network architectures supports the hypothesis that
reduced activation sparsity can effectively improve the generalisation and
classification performance. In line with other recent work on this topic, our
methods reveal novel insights into the contradicting concepts of activation
sparsity and network capacity by demonstrating that dense activations can
enable discriminative feature learning while efficiently exploiting the
capacity of deep models without suffering from overfitting, even when trained
excessively.

considered WP-CC system, a full-duplex (FD) receiver transmits artificial noise
(AN) to simultaneously charge an energy-constrained transmitter and to confuse
a warden's detection on the transmitter's communication activity. With the
probabilistic ATT protocol, the transmitter sends its information with a prior
probability, i.e., $p$, conditioned on the available energy being sufficient.
Our analysis shows that the probabilistic ATT protocol can achieve higher

the optimal design of the WP-CC system, we also derive the warden's minimum

relationship between spatial locations and received binaural audios. Then in
the visual modality, corresponding visual cues of the mono data are manually
placed at sound source positions to form the pairs. Compared to
fully-supervised paradigms, our binaural-recording-free pipeline shows great
stability in cross-dataset evaluation and achieves comparable performance under

  Networks(IJCNN2021)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reinforcement learning, which acquires a policy maximizing long-term rewards,
has been actively studied. Unfortunately, this learning type is too slow and
difficult to use in practical situations because the state-action space becomes
huge in real environments. The essential factor for learning efficiency is
rewards. Potential-based reward shaping is a basic method for enriching
rewards. This method is required to define a specific real-value function
called a potential function for every domain. It is often difficult to
represent the potential function directly. SARSA-RS learns the potential
function and acquires it. However, SARSA-RS can only be applied to the simple
environment. The bottleneck of this method is the aggregation of states to make
abstract states since it is almost impossible for designers to build an
aggregation function for all states. We propose a trajectory aggregation that
uses subgoal series. This method dynamically aggregates states in an episode
during trial and error with only the subgoal series and subgoal identification
function. It makes designer effort minimal and the application to environments
with high-dimensional observations possible. We obtained subgoal series from
participants for experiments. We conducted the experiments in three domains,
four-rooms(discrete states and discrete actions), pinball(continuous and
discrete), and picking(both continuous). We compared our method with a baseline
reinforcement learning algorithm and other subgoal-based methods, including
random subgoal and naive subgoal-based reward shaping. As a result, our reward
shaping outperformed all other methods in learning efficiency.

success in large-scale scene reconstruction tasks. However, reconstruction of
texture-less planes often fails as similarity measurement methods may become
ineffective on these regions. Thus, a new plane hypothesis inference strategy
is proposed to handle the above issue. The procedure consists of two steps:
First, multiple plane hypotheses are generated using filtered initial depth
maps on regions that are not successfully recovered; Second, depth hypotheses
are selected using Markov Random Field (MRF). The strategy can significantly
improve the completeness of reconstruction results with only acceptable
computing time increasing. Besides, a new acceleration scheme similar to
dilated convolution can speed up the depth map estimating process with only a
slight influence on the reconstruction. We integrated the above ideas into a
new MVS pipeline, Plane Hypothesis Inference Multi-view Stereo (PHI-MVS). The
result of PHI-MVS is validated on ETH3D public benchmarks, and it demonstrates
competing performance against the state-of-the-art.

numerical models of the evolving nonthermal X-ray light curves. In the simplest
cases, these X-ray light curves follow power-law profiles in time. We suggest
that TDE discs act in many respects as scaled-up versions of XRB discs, and
that such discs should undergo state transitions into harder accretion states.
XRB state transitions typically occur when the disc luminosity becomes roughly
one percent of its Eddington value. We show that if the same is true for TDE
discs then this, in turn, implies that TDEs with nonthermal X-ray spectra
should come preferentially from large-mass black holes. The characteristic
hard-state transition mass is $M_{\rm HS} \simeq 2\times10^7 M_\odot$. Hence,
subpopulations of thermal and nonthermal X-ray TDEs should come from
systematically different black hole masses. We demonstrate that the known
populations of thermal and nonthermal X-ray TDEs do indeed come from different
distributions of black hole masses. The null-hypothesis of identical black hole
mass distributions is rejected by a two-sample Anderson-Darling test with a
$p$-value $< 0.01$. Finally, we present a model for the X-ray rebrightening of
TDEs at late times as they transition into the hard state. These models of

rarefaction, defined as the ratio of the sphere radius to an equivalent free
path of gaseous particles, covering the free molecular, transition and

the last two decades with the advent of powerful new space and ground-based
telescopes. The effect of the lens mass model (usually the power-law mass
model) on cosmological parameters constraints has been performed recently in
literature. In this paper, by using SGL systems and Supernovae type Ia
observations, we explore if the power-law mass density profile ($\rho \propto
r^{-\gamma}$) is consistent with the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR),
$D_L(1+z)^{-2}/D_A=\eta(z)=1$, by considering different lens mass intervals. {
It has been obtained that the verification of the CDDR validity is
significantly dependent on lens mass interval considered: the sub-sample with
$\sigma_{ap} \geq 300$ km/s (where $\sigma_{ap}$ is the lens apparent stellar
velocity dispersion) is in full agreement with the CDDR validity, the
sub-sample with intermediate $\sigma_{ap}$ values ($200 \leq \sigma_{ap} <
300)$ km/s is marginally consistent with $\eta=1$ and, finally, the sub-sample
with low $\sigma_{ap}$ values ($\sigma_{ap} < 200$ km/s) ruled out the CDDR
validity with high statistical confidence. Therefore, if one takes the CDDR as
guarantee, our results suggest that using a single density profile is not
suitable to describe lens with low $\sigma_{ap}$ values and it is only an
approximate description to lenses with intermediate mass interval. }

few} \times 10^{6} M_\odot$). TDEs around black holes with the lowest masses
are most likely to reach super-Eddington luminosities at early times in their
evolution. By assuming that the amount of stellar debris which can form into a
compact accretion disc is set dynamically by the Eddington luminosity, we make
a number of interesting and testable predictions about the observed properties
of bright soft-state X-ray TDEs and optically bright, X-ray dim TDEs. We argue
that TDEs around black holes of the lowest masses will expel the vast majority
of their gravitationally bound debris into a radiatively driven outflow. A
large-mass outflow will obscure the innermost X-ray producing regions, leading
to a population of low black hole mass TDEs which are only observed at optical
\& UV energies. TDE discs evolving with bolometric luminosities comparable to
their Eddington luminosity will have near constant (i.e. black hole mass
independent) X-ray luminosities, of order $L_{\rm X, max} \equiv L_M \sim
10^{43} - 10^{44}$ erg/s. The range of luminosity values stems primarily from
the range of allowed black hole spins. A similar X-ray luminosity limit exists
for X-ray TDEs in the hard (Compton scattering dominated) state, and we
therefore predict that the X-ray luminosity of the brightest X-ray TDEs will be
at the scale $L_M(a) \sim 10^{43}-10^{44}$ erg/s, independent of black hole
mass and accretion state. These predictions are in strong agreement with the
properties of the existing population ($\sim 40$ sources) of observed TDEs.

This plasmoid formation is found to occur on a characteristic timescale
dependent on pressure gradients and magnetic curvature in both experiment and

is modest, but give way to turbulent plasmoid ejection when the system drive is
higher, producing plasmoids of many sizes. However, a critical pressure
gradient is also observed, below which plasmoids are never formed. A simple
heuristic model of this plasmoid formation process is presented and suggested
to be a consequence of a dynamic loss of equilibrium in the high-$\beta$ region
of the helmet streamer. This model is capable of explaining the periodicity of
plasmoids observed in the experiment and simulations and produces plasmoid
periods of 90 minutes when applied to 2D models of solar streamers with a
height of $3R_\odot$. This is consistent with the location and frequency at

that the pentagram map on twisted polygons is a discrete integrable system, in
the sense of algebraic complete integrability: the pentagram map is birational
to a self-map of a family of abelian varieties. This generalizes Soloviev's

  comments to MNRAS, comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a unification scheme which explains the varied observed properties
of TDEs in terms of simple disc physics. The unification scheme postulates that
the different observed properties of TDEs are controlled by the peak Eddington
ratio of the accretion discs which form following a stellar disruption. Our
primary result is that the TDE population can be split into four
subpopulations, which are (in order of decreasing peak Eddington ratio):
""obscured"" UV-bright and X-ray dim TDEs; X-ray bright soft-state TDEs;
UV-bright and X-ray dim ""cool"" TDEs; and X-ray bright hard-state TDEs. These 4
subpopulations of TDEs will occur around black holes of well defined masses,
and our unification scheme is therefore directly testable with observations. As
an initial test, we model the X-ray and UV light curves of six TDEs taken from
three of the four subpopulations: ASASSN-14ae, ASASSN-15oi, ASASSN-18pg,
AT2019dsg, XMMSL1 J0740 & XMMSL2 J1446. We show that all six TDEs, spanning a
wide range of observed properties, are well modelled by evolving relativistic
thin discs. The peak Eddington ratio's of the six best-fitting disc solutions
lie exactly as predicted by the unified model. The mean stellar mass of the six
sources is $\left\langle M_\star \right\rangle \sim 0.24 M_\odot$. The
so-called `missing energy problem' is resolved by demonstrating that only $\sim
1\%$ of the radiated accretion disc energy is observed at X-ray and UV
frequencies. Finally, we present an empirical, approximately linear,
relationship between the total radiated energy of the accretion disc and the
total radiated energy of an early-time, rapidly-decaying, UV component, seen in
all TDEs.

all weighted adjacency matrices of $G$?"" (The weight of an edge is positive or
negative, while the diagonal entries can be any real numbers.) This is known as
the Inverse Eigenvalue Problem for graphs (IEP-$G$). A mild relaxation of this
question considers the multiplicity list instead of the exact eigenvalues
themselves. That is, given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and an ordered partition
$\mathbf{m}= (m_1, \ldots, m_\ell)$ of $n$, is there a weighted adjacency
matrix where the $i$-th distinct eigenvalue has multiplicity $m_i$? This is
known as the ordered multiplicity IEP-$G$. Recent work solved the ordered
multiplicity IEP-$G$ for all graphs on 6 vertices.
  In this work, we develop zero forcing methods for the ordered multiplicity
IEP-$G$ in a multitude of different contexts. Namely, we utilize zero forcing
parameters on powers of graphs to achieve bounds on consecutive multiplicities.
We are able to provide general bounds on sums of multiplicities of eigenvalues
for graphs. This includes new bounds on the the sums of multiplicities of
consecutive eigenvalues as well as more specific bounds for trees. Using these
results, we verify the previous results above regarding the IEP-$G$ on six
vertices. In addition, applying our techniques to skew-symmetric matrices, we
are able to determine all possible ordered multiplicity lists for
skew-symmetric matrices for connected graphs on five vertices.

extraordinary accuracy and great generalization ability in various tasks.
However, with the ever-increasing graph sizes, more and more complicated GNN
layers, and higher feature dimensions, the computational complexity of GNNs
grows exponentially. How to inference GNNs in real time has become a
challenging problem, especially for some resource-limited edge-computing

  To tackle this challenge, we propose BlockGNN, a software-hardware co-design
approach to realize efficient GNN acceleration. At the algorithm level, we
propose to leverage block-circulant weight matrices to greatly reduce the
complexity of various GNN models. At the hardware design level, we propose a
pipelined CirCore architecture, which supports efficient block-circulant

accelerator to compute various GNNs with low latency. Moreover, to determine
the optimal configurations for diverse deployed tasks, we also introduce a
performance and resource model that helps choose the optimal hardware
parameters automatically. Comprehensive experiments on the ZC706 FPGA platform
demonstrate that on various GNN tasks, BlockGNN achieves up to $8.3\times$

the class, describe the details of how it is carried out, and discuss the
interactions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a program
offers an effective way for art students, not only to learn about science but
to have a glimpse of ""science in action"". The students have the opportunity to
become involved in the process of science as artists, as observers first and
potentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships

challenge in climate evolution research. Most models of how greenhouse gases

complex, nonlinear nature of Earth's climate history motivates study of
non-deterministic climate models. Here a maximally simple stochastic model of
CO2 evolution and climate on an Earth-like planet with an imperfect CO2
thermostat is investigated. It is shown that as stellar luminosity is increased
in this model, the decrease in the average atmospheric CO concentration renders
the climate increasingly unstable, with excursions to a low-temperature state
common once the received stellar flux approaches that of present-day Earth.
Unless climate feedbacks always force the variance in CO2 concentration to
decline rapidly with received stellar flux, this means that terrestrial planets
near the inner edge of the habitable zone may enter Snowball states quite
frequently. Observations of the albedos and color variation of terrestrial-type
exoplanets should allow this prediction to be tested directly in the future.

PINNs is a weighted sum of multiple terms, including the mismatch in the

well as the residuals of the Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, we observe
that the weighted combination of competitive multiple loss functions plays a
significant role in training PINNs effectively. We establish Gaussian
probabilistic models to define the loss terms, where the noise collection
describes the weight parameter for each loss term. We propose a self-adaptive
loss function method, which automatically assigns the weights of losses by
updating the noise parameters in each epoch based on the maximum likelihood
estimation. Subsequently, we employ the self-adaptive loss balanced

suggest that the accuracy of PINNs for effectively simulating complex
incompressible flows is improved by adaptively appropriate weights in the loss
terms. The outstanding adaptability of lbPINNs is not irrelevant to the

The proposed method can also be employed in other problems where PINNs apply

degr. The red giant is filling (or nearly filling) its Roche lobe, and the
distance set by its Roche lobe radius, d=9 kpc, is consistent with that
resulting from the giant pulsation period. The outburst magnitude of V3890 Sgr
is then very similar to those of RNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud. V3890 Sgr
shows remarkable photometric and spectroscopic activity between the nova
eruptions with timescales similar to those observed in the symbiotic recurrent

a double-temperature structure which we have associated with the presence of an

rate. We also provide evidence that V3890 Sgr contains a CO WD accreting at a
high, a few 1e-8 - 1e-7 Msun/yr, rate. The WD is growing in mass, and should

range of applications, the potential risk of UAV disruption increases. Recent
development in deep learning allows vision-based counter-UAV systems to detect
and track UAVs with a single camera. However, the coverage of a single camera
is limited, necessitating the need for multicamera configurations to match UAVs
across cameras - a problem known as re-identification (reID). While there has
been extensive research on person and vehicle reID to match objects across time
and viewpoints, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research in UAV
reID. UAVs are challenging to re-identify: they are much smaller than
pedestrians and vehicles and they are often detected in the air so appear at a
greater range of angles. Because no UAV data sets currently use multiple
cameras, we propose the first new UAV re-identification data set, UAV-reID,
that facilitates the development of machine learning solutions in this emerging
area. UAV-reID has two settings: Temporally-Near to evaluate performance across
views to assist tracking frameworks, and Big-to-Small to evaluate reID
performance across scale and to allow early reID when UAVs are detected from a
long distance. We conduct a benchmark study by extensively evaluating different
reID backbones and loss functions. We demonstrate that with the right setup,
deep networks are powerful enough to learn good representations for UAVs,
achieving 81.9% mAP on the Temporally-Near setting and 46.5% on the challenging
Big-to-Small setting. Furthermore, we find that vision transformers are the
most robust to extreme variance of scale.

$L_{bol} \sim 10^{46}\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ using Gemini GMOS-IFU's. The emission
lines were fitted with at least two Gaussian curves, the broadest of which we
attributed to gas kinetically disturbed by an outflow. We found that the
maximum extent of the outflow ranges from $\sim$1 to 8 kpc, being
${\sim}\,0.5\,{\pm}\,0.3$ times the extent of the [O$\,$III] ionized gas
region. Our `${\tt default}$' assumptions for the gas density (obtained from
the {[S$\,$II] doublet) and outflow velocities resulted in peak mass outflow

with the average efficiency being only $0.06\,\%$ ($0.01\,\%$ median), implying
little feedback powers from ionized gas outflows in the host galaxies. We
investigated the effects of varying assumptions and calculations on
$\dot{M}_{out}$ and $\dot{E}_{out}$ regarding the ionized gas densities,
velocities, masses and inclinations of the outflow relative to the plane of the
sky, resulting in average uncertainties of one dex. In particular, we found
that better indicators of the [O$\,$III] emitting gas density than the default
[S$\,$II] line ratio, such as the [Ar$\,$IV]$\lambda\lambda$4711,40 line ratio,

case of symmetric informationally complete, positive operator valued measures

and weak measurements can be used to determine Berry's phase directly, which
demonstrates that not only their real and imaginary parts but also moduli and

this paper, we present a novel brain tumor segmentation algorithm with missing

correlation model is proposed to specially represent the latent multi-source
correlation. Thanks to the obtained correlation representation, the
segmentation becomes more robust in the case of missing modality. First, the
individual representation produced by each encoder is used to estimate the
modality independent parameter. Then, the correlation model transforms all the
individual representations to the latent multi-source correlation
representations. Finally, the correlation representations across modalities are
fused via attention mechanism into a shared representation to emphasize the
most important features for segmentation. We evaluate our model on BraTS 2018

system and find a rich variety of behaviors. Specifically, quantum dynamics
with a time independent $H$ in a finite dimensional Hilbert space are
considered with repeated strong null measurements of a specified state. We
discuss four generic behaviors that emerge in these monitored systems. The
first arises in systems without symmetry, along with their associated
degeneracies in the energy spectrum, and hence in the absence of dark states as
well. In this case, a unique final state can be found which is determined by
the largest eigenvalue of the survival operator, the non-unitary operator
encoding both the unitary evolution between measurements and the measurement
itself. For a three-level system, this is similar to the well known shelving
effect. Secondly, for systems with built-in symmetry and correspondingly a
degenerate energy spectrum, the null measurements dynamically select the
degenerate energy levels, while the non-degenerate levels are effectively wiped
out. Thirdly, in the absence of dark states, and for specific choices of
parameters, two or more eigenvalues of the survival operator match in
magnitude, and this leads to an oscillatory behavior controlled by the
measurement rate and not solely by the energy levels. Finally, when the control
parameters are tuned, such that the eigenvalues of the survival operator all
coalesce to zero, one has exceptional points that corresponds to situations
that violate the null measurement condition, making the conditional measurement
process impossible.

microscopic mass distributions has, in a previous study, been confirmed to be
in general a non-linear function of two orientations (optical axis and axis of
interferometer sensitivity), linear approximations with a reduced parameter
space (considering only one of the orientation dependencies) are highly
preferable with respect to tomographic volume reconstruction from projections.
By regarding isolated volume elements and systematically exploring the full
range of possible anisotropies, direct correspondences are drawn between the
respective tensors characterizing the complete model used for signal
synthesization and the reduced linear models used for reconstruction. The
tensors' dominant orientations are found to agree to a typical accuracy of

that the orientations adopted by the 3D particles prior to imaging are unknown;
yet, this knowledge is essential for high-resolution reconstruction. We present
a method to recover these orientations directly from the acquired set of 2D
projections. Our approach consists of two steps: (i) the estimation of
distances between pairs of projections, and (ii) the recovery of the
orientation of each projection from these distances. In step (i), pairwise
distances are estimated by a Siamese neural network trained on synthetic
cryo-EM projections from resolved bio-structures. In step (ii), orientations
are recovered by minimizing the difference between the distances estimated from
the projections and the distances induced by the recovered orientations. We
evaluated the method on synthetic cryo-EM datasets. Current results demonstrate
that orientations can be accurately recovered from projections that are shifted

applied to efficiently obtain a controller that optimally track the

facet-dependent structuring of the interfacial water molecules. Moreover,
ion-specific, facet-dependent ion adsorption leads to large alterations of the
interfacial polarization. Compared to non-polarizable NPs, polarizability
modifies water local dipole densities only slightly, but has substantial
effects on the electrostatic surface potentials, and leads to significant
lateral redistributions of ions on the NP surface. Besides, interfacial
polarization effects on the individual monovalent ions cancel out in the far
field, and effective Debye-H\""uckel surface potentials remain essentially
unaffected, as anticipated from continuum `image-charge' concepts. Hence, the
explicit charge response of metal NPs is crucial for the accurate description

of candidate solutions of ill-posed inverse problems. Due to their sequential
nature, Monte Carlo sampling methods require large numbers of sampling steps
for accurate Bayesian inference and are often computationally infeasible for
large-scale inverse problems, such as seismic imaging. Our main contribution is
a data-driven variational inference approach where we train a normalizing flow
(NF), a type of invertible neural net, capable of cheaply sampling the
posterior distribution given previously unseen seismic data from neighboring
surveys. To arrive at this result, we train the NF on pairs of low- and
high-fidelity migrated images. In our numerical example, we obtain
high-fidelity images from the Parihaka dataset and low-fidelity images are
derived from these images through the process of demigration, followed by
adding noise and migration. During inference, given shot records from a new
neighboring seismic survey, we first compute the reverse-time migration image.
Next, by feeding this low-fidelity migrated image to the NF we gain access to
samples from the posterior distribution virtually for free. We use these
samples to compute a high-fidelity image including a first assessment of the
image's reliability. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train a
conditional network on what we know from neighboring images to improve the
current image and assess its reliability.

topologically nontrivial gauge field configurations associated with nontrivial
$\pi_1[SU(N)/Z_N] = Z_N$. The topological sectors are labelled by an integer
$k=0,\ldots, N-1$. However, in contrast to $QED_2$ and $QCD_4$, this topology
is not associated with an integral invariant like the magnetic flux or
Pontryagin index. These instantons may admit fermion zero modes, but there is
always an equal number of left-handed and right-handed modes, so that the
Atiyah-Singer theorem, which determines in other cases the number of the modes,
does not apply.
  The mod. 2 argument suggests that, for a generic gauge field configuration,
there is either a single doublet of such zero modes or no modes whatsoever.
However, the known solution of the Dirac problem for a wide class of gauge
field configurations indicates the presence of $k(N-k)$ zero mode doublets in
the topological sector $k$. In this note, we demonstrate in an explicit way
that these modes are not robust under a generic enough deformation of the gauge

to the code-switching domain. The meta-transfer learning quickly adapts the
model to the code-switching task from a number of monolingual tasks by learning
to learn in a multi-task learning fashion. Second, we propose a novel
multilingual meta-embeddings approach to effectively represent code-switching
data by acquiring useful knowledge learned in other languages, learning the
commonalities of closely related languages and leveraging lexical composition.
The method is far more efficient compared to contextualized pre-trained
multilingual models. Third, we introduce multi-task learning to integrate
syntactic information as a transfer learning strategy to a language model and
learn where to code-switch. To further alleviate the aforementioned issues, we
propose a data augmentation method using Pointer-Gen, a neural network using a
copy mechanism to teach the model the code-switch points from monolingual
parallel sentences. We disentangle the need for linguistic theory, and the
model captures code-switching points by attending to input words and aligning
the parallel words, without requiring any word alignments or constituency
parsers. More importantly, the model can be effectively used for languages that
are syntactically different, and it outperforms the linguistic theory-based
models.

sound and meaning. To test this hypothesis, we created two deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). While the dorsal network was trained to identify
individual spoken words, the ventral network was trained to map them onto
semantic classes. We then extracted patterns of network activation from the
penultimate level of each network and tested how well features generated by the
network supported generalization to linguistic categorization associated with
the dorsal versus ventral processing streams. Our preliminary results showed
both models successfully learned their tasks. Secondary generalization testing
showed the ventral CNN outperformed the dorsal CNN on a semantic task:
concreteness classification, while the dorsal CNN outperformed the ventral CNN
on articulation tasks: classification by onset phoneme class and syllable
length. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the divergent
processing demands of the ventral and dorsal processing streams impose
computational pressures for the development of multiple lexica.

statistics to reason about uncertainty. A key computational challenge in
Bayesian inference is to develop efficient techniques to approximate, or draw
samples from posterior distributions. Stein variational gradient decent (SVGD)
has been shown to be a powerful approximate inference algorithm for this issue.
However, the vanilla SVGD requires calculating the gradient of the target
density and cannot be applied when the gradient is unavailable or too expensive
to evaluate. In this paper we explore one way to address this challenge by the
construction of a local surrogate for the target distribution in which the
gradient can be obtained in a much more computationally feasible manner. More
specifically, we approximate the forward model using a deep neural network
(DNN) which is trained on a carefully chosen training set, which also
determines the quality of the surrogate. To this end, we propose a general
adaptation procedure to refine the local approximation online without
destroying the convergence of the resulting SVGD. This significantly reduces
the computational cost of SVGD and leads to a suite of algorithms that are
straightforward to implement. The new algorithm is illustrated on a set of
challenging Bayesian inverse problems, and numerical experiments demonstrate a
clear improvement in performance and applicability of standard SVGD.

alternative solution: threshold-based volumetric DDoS detection can be
performed directly in programmable switches to skim only potentially hazardous

introduce the BACON data structure based on sketches, to estimate
per-destination flow cardinality, and theoretically analyze it. Then we employ
it in a simple in-network DDoS victim identification strategy, INDDoS, to
detect the destination IPs for which the number of incoming connections exceeds
a pre-defined threshold. We describe its hardware implementation on a
Tofino-based programmable switch using the domain-specific P4 language, proving
that some limitations imposed by real hardware to safeguard processing speed

retouching operations are pixel-independent, i.e., the manipulation on one
pixel is uncorrelated with its neighboring pixels, we can take advantage of
this property and design a specialized algorithm for efficient global photo
retouching. We analyze these global operations and find that they can be
mathematically formulated by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Based on this

Sequential Retouching Network (CSRNet). Benefiting from the utilization of
$1\times1$ convolution, CSRNet only contains less than 37K trainable

addition to achieve global photo retouching, the proposed framework can be
easily extended to learn local enhancement effects. The extended model, namely
CSRNet-L, also achieves competitive results in various local enhancement tasks.

Using X-ray/neutron diffraction and Raman scattering, we show that high

isostuctural phase transition at $\sim$10 GPa, with a reversible collapse of
the $c$-axis. This is shown to be the high pressure analog of the $c$-axis

that dynamical instabilities of the Cu$^{+}$ cations and edge-shared MnO$_{6}$

activates the former, before an eventual predicted re-emergence of magnetism at
the highest pressures. Our results show that the lattice dynamics and local

and inserted in a quantum switch process realizing a superposition of causal
orders. The characterization of the resulting switched quantum channel is
worked out for its action on the joint state of the probe-control qubit pair.
The switched channel is then specifically investigated for the important
metrological task of phase estimation on the noisy unitary operator, with the
performance assessed by the Fisher information, classical or quantum. A
comparison is made with conventional techniques of estimation where the noisy
unitary is directly probed in a one-stage or two-stage cascade with definite
order, or several uses of them with two or more qubits. In the switched channel
with indefinite order, specific properties are reported, meaningful for
estimation and not present with conventional techniques. It is shown that the
control qubit, although it never directly interacts with the unitary, can
nevertheless be measured alone for effective estimation, while discarding the
probe qubit that interacts with the unitary. Also, measurement of the control
qubit maintains the possibility of efficient estimation in difficult conditions
where conventional estimation becomes less efficient, as with ill-configured
input probes, or in blind situations when the axis of the unitary is unknown.
Effective estimation by measuring the control qubit remains possible even when
the input probe tends to align with the axis of the unitary, or with a fully
depolarized input probe, while in these conditions conventional estimation gets
inoperative. Measurement of the probe qubit of the switched channel is also
shown to add useful capabilities for phase estimation. The results contribute

that cause one of these instabilities to dominate over the other using a novel
model to study localized ionospheric instabilities. The effect of collisions
with neutral particles plays an important role in the instability development.
It is found that the KHI is dominant in low collisionality regimes, the GDI is
dominant in high collisionality regimes, and there exists an intermediate
region in which both instabilities exist in tandem. For low collisionality
cases in which the velocity shear is sufficiently far from the density
gradient, the GDI is found to grow as a secondary instability extending from
the KHI vortices. The inclusion of a neutral wind driven electric field in the
direction of the velocity shear does not impact the dominance of either
instability. Using data from empirical ionospheric models, two altitude limits
are found. For altitudes above the higher limit, the KHI is dominant. For
altitudes below the lower limit, the GDI is dominant. In the intermediate
region, both instabilities grow together. Increasing the velocity shear causes
both limits to be lower in altitude. This implies that for ionospheric
phenomena whose density and velocity gradients span large altitude ranges, such
as subauroral polarization streams, the instabilities observed by space-based
and ground-based observation instruments could be significantly different.

model-based reinforcement learning, both for the online case when interacting

However, to date no single unified algorithm could demonstrate state-of-the-art

which uses model-based policy and value improvement operators to compute new
improved training targets on existing data points, allowing efficient learning
for data budgets varying by several orders of magnitude. We further show that
Reanalyse can also be used to learn entirely from demonstrations without any
environment interactions, as in the case of offline Reinforcement Learning
(offline RL). Combining Reanalyse with the MuZero algorithm, we introduce
MuZero Unplugged, a single unified algorithm for any data budget, including
offline RL. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm does not require any
special adaptations for the off-policy or offline RL settings. MuZero Unplugged
sets new state-of-the-art results in the RL Unplugged offline RL benchmark as
well as in the online RL benchmark of Atari in the standard 200 million frame

non-holonomic, whose structure constants give rise to extra terms in the
expression of the connection coefficients and in the expression for the
covariant derivative. In the Lyra manifold, transformations between reference
frames involving both coordinates and scale change the transformation law of
tensor fields, when compared to those of the Riemann manifold. From a direct
generalization of the Einstein-Hilbert minimal action coupled with a matter
term, it was possible to build a Lyra invariant action, which gives rise to the
associated Lyra Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity (LyST), with field equations
for $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\phi$. These equations have a well-defined Newtonian
limit, from which it can be seen that both metric and scale play a role in the
description gravitational interaction. We present a spherically symmetric

solvers. This is in stark contrast to coupled analysis of linear/weakly
non-linear circuits and EM systems in frequency domain. Here, one typically
extracts equivalent port parameters that are then fed into the circuit solver.

Port extraction is tantamount to obtaining impulse response of the linear EM

Recently, a novel approach was developed for time domain integral equations to
overcome this bottleneck. We extend this approach to time domain finite element

applied to the study of dynamic games. In this paper, we demonstrate the
limitations of such an approach for a wide class of stochastic dynamic games,
where additionally, unlike the team setting considered in Part I, informational
dependence of equilibrium behavior is significantly more complicated. We
identify three types of static reductions: (i) those that are
policy-independent (as those introduced by Witsenhausen for teams), (ii) those
that are policy-dependent (as those introduced by Ho and Chu for partially
nested dynamic teams), and (iii) a third type that we will refer to as static
measurements with control-sharing reduction as in Part I (where the
measurements are static although control actions are shared according to the
partially nested information structure). For the first type, we show that there
is a bijection between Nash equilibrium policies under the original information
structure and their policy-independent static reductions. However, for the
second type, we show that there is generally no isomorphism between Nash
equilibrium solutions under the original information structure and their
policy-dependent static reductions. Sufficient conditions are presented to
establish such an isomorphism relationship between Nash equilibria of dynamic
non-zero-sum games and their policy-dependent static reductions. For zero-sum

This negatively affects the learning of robot behaviors in the real world. In
particular, social navigation includes humans who are unpredictable moving
obstacles in an environment. We proposed a reward shaping method with subgoals
to accelerate learning. The main part is an aggregation method that use
subgoals to shape a reinforcement learning algorithm. We performed a learning
experiment with a social navigation task in which a robot avoided collisions
and then reached its goal. The experimental results show that our method
improved the learning efficiency from a base algorithm in the task.

has been actively studied. Unfortunately, this learning type is too slow and
difficult to use in practical situations because the state-action space becomes
huge in real environments. Many studies have incorporated human knowledge into
reinforcement Learning. Though human knowledge on trajectories is often used, a
human could be asked to control an AI agent, which can be difficult. Knowledge
on subgoals may lessen this requirement because humans need only to consider a
few representative states on an optimal trajectory in their minds. The
essential factor for learning efficiency is rewards. Potential-based reward
shaping is a basic method for enriching rewards. However, it is often difficult
to incorporate subgoals for accelerating learning over potential-based reward
shaping. This is because the appropriate potentials are not intuitive for
humans. We extend potential-based reward shaping and propose a subgoal-based
reward shaping. The method makes it easier for human trainers to share their
knowledge of subgoals. To evaluate our method, we obtained a subgoal series
from participants and conducted experiments in three domains,
four-rooms(discrete states and discrete actions), pinball(continuous and
discrete), and picking(both continuous). We compared our method with a baseline
reinforcement learning algorithm and other subgoal-based methods, including
random subgoal and naive subgoal-based reward shaping. As a result, we found
out that our reward shaping outperformed all other methods in learning
efficiency.

Since detonations in carbon-oxygen WDs are supposed to produce normal

of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) in a large variety of star

phase interactions between iCOMs and grain surfaces influence the thermal
desorption process and, therefore, the presence of molecular species in the gas
phase. In laboratory, it is possible to simulate the thermal desorption process
deriving important parameters such as the desorption temperatures and energies.
We report new laboratory results on temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
from olivine dust of astrophysical relevant ice mixtures of water,
acetonitrile, and acetaldehyde. We found that in the presence of grains, only a
fraction of acetaldehyde and acetonitrile desorbs at about 100 K and 120 K
respectively, while 40% of the molecules are retained by fluffy grains of the
order of 100 {\mu}m up to temperatures of 190-210 K. In contrast with the
typical assumption that all molecules are desorbed in regions with temperatures
higher than 100 K, this result implies that about 40% of the molecules can
survive on the grains enabling the delivery of volatiles towards regions with
temperatures as high as 200 K and shifting inwards the position of the
snowlines in protoplanetary disks. These studies offer a necessary support to
interpret observational data and may help our understanding of iCOMs formation

real-time responses (latency) for a better user experience. Existing works
either focus on algorithmic optimization for improving precision while
neglecting hardware implementations or focus on distributed global graph
processing on large-scale systems for improving throughput rather than response
time. Optimizing low-latency local PPR algorithm with a tight memory budget on
edge devices remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient,
low-latency PPR solution, namely MeLoPPR, with largely reduced memory
requirement and a flexible trade-off between latency and precision. MeLoPPR is
composed of stage decomposition and linear decomposition and exploits the node
score sparsity: Through stage and linear decomposition, MeLoPPR breaks the
computation on a large graph into a set of smaller sub-graphs, that
significantly saves the computation memory; Through sparsity exploitation,
MeLoPPR selectively chooses the sub-graphs that contribute the most to the
precision to reduce the required computation. In addition, through
software/hardware co-design, we propose a hardware implementation on a hybrid

between precision and execution time: when the precision is 80%, the speedup on
CPU is up to 15x and up to 707x on FPGA; when the precision is around 90%, the
speedup is up to 70x on FPGA.

heterogeneous time-varying arrival rates and multiple user equipment types,
proving its applicability in realistic wireless network scenarios.

(e.g., offices, airports, libraries, schools), preventative measures enabling
resumption of work are quickly becoming a necessity. In this paper, we present
the need for Vitals Screening Techniques (VIST) where more than one vital is
screened to ensure the safety of the population (e.g. temperature, heart rate,
and blood oxygen levels). VIST can be deployed in crowded environments to
provide the new necessary layer of safety. We provide extensive coverage of
state-of-art technology that can assist in tackling this emerging problem, and
evaluate one of the existing products on the market that employ VIST.

  Hospital-Course Summarization","NAACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Summarization of clinical narratives is a long-standing research problem.
Here, we introduce the task of hospital-course summarization. Given the
documentation authored throughout a patient's hospitalization, generate a
paragraph that tells the story of the patient admission. We construct an
English, text-to-text dataset of 109,000 hospitalizations (2M source notes) and
their corresponding summary proxy: the clinician-authored ""Brief Hospital
Course"" paragraph written as part of a discharge note. Exploratory analyses
reveal that the BHC paragraphs are highly abstractive with some long extracted
fragments; are concise yet comprehensive; differ in style and content
organization from the source notes; exhibit minimal lexical cohesion; and
represent silver-standard references. Our analysis identifies multiple
implications for modeling this complex, multi-document summarization task.

widely used in many fields. Because the classic likelihood functions are too
strict for extreme data in practical applications, Yager proposed soft ordered
weighted average (OWA) operator. In the quantum method, probability is
represented by Euler's function. How to establish a connection between quantum
theory and OWA is also an open question. This article proposes OWA opreator
under quantum theory, and discusses the relationship between quantum soft OWA
operater and classical soft OWA operator through some examples. Similar to
other quantum models, this research has more extensive applications in quantum

tool that allows to control an external device or to emit a message at the

to correctly implement these types of BCI, we must be able to detect from a
continuous signal, when the subject starts to imagine words. In this work, five
methods of feature extraction based on wavelet decomposition, empirical mode
decomposition, frequency energies, fractal dimension and chaos theory features
are presented to solve the task of detecting imagined words segments from
continuous EEG signals as a preliminary study for a latter implementation of an
asynchronous BCI based on imagined speech. These methods are tested in three
datasets using four different classifiers and the higher F1 scores obtained are
0.73, 0.79, and 0.68 for each dataset, respectively. This results are promising
to build a system that automatizes the segmentation of imagined words segments
for latter classification.

jointly optimize the quality level selection, beamforming, and subcarrier,
