negative energy density values in the past can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, as
well as the discrepancy with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
Lyman-$\alpha$ data, both which prevail within the $\Lambda$CDM model. We then
investigate whether two minimal extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model, together
or separately, can successfully realize such a scenario: (i) the spatial
curvature, which, in the case of spatially closed universe, mimics a negative
density source and (ii) simple-graduated dark energy (gDE), which promotes the
null inertial mass density of the usual vacuum energy to an arbitrary
constant--if negative, the corresponding energy density decreases with redshift
similar to the phantom models, but unlike them crosses below zero at a certain
redshift. We find that, when the Planck data are not included in the
observational analysis, the models with simple-gDE predict interesting and some
significant deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model. In particular, a spatially
closed universe along with a simple-gDE of positive inertial mass density,
which work in contrast to each other, results in minor improvement to the $H_0$
tension. The joint dataset, including the Planck data, presents no evidence for
a deviation from spatial flatness but almost the same evidence for a
cosmological constant and the simple-gDE with an inertial mass density of order
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})\,\rm eV^4$. The latter case predicts almost no deviation
from the $\Lambda$CDM model up until today--so that it results in no
improvement regarding the BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data--except that it slightly
aggravates the $H_0$ tension. We also study via dynamical analysis the history
of the Universe in the models, as the simple-gDE results in futures different
than the de Sitter future of the $\Lambda$CDM model.

Deep Field South survey to extend studies of high-mass X-ray binary systems

Our analysis evaluates correlations between X-ray luminosities ($L_X$), star
formation rates (SFR) and stellar metallicities ($Z_\star$) to higher redshifts
and over a wider range in galaxy properties than hitherto. Using a stacking
analysis performed in bins of both redshift and SFR for sources with robust
spectroscopic redshifts without AGN signatures, we find convincing evolutionary
trends in the ratio $L_X$/SFR to the highest redshifts probed, with a stronger
trend for galaxies with lower SFRs. Combining our data with published samples
at lower redshift, the evolution of $L_X$/SFR to $z\simeq5$ proceeds as $(1 +
z)^{1.03 \pm 0.02}$. Using stellar metallicities derived from photospheric
absorption features in our spectroscopic data, we confirm indications at lower
redshifts that $L_X$/SFR is stronger for metal-poor galaxies. We use
semi-analytic models to show that metallicity dependence of $L_X$/SFR alone may
not be sufficient to fully explain the observed redshift evolution of X-ray
emission from high-mass XRBs, particularly for galaxies with SFR $<30$
$M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We speculate that the discrepancy may arise due to reduced
overall stellar ages in the early Universe leading to higher $L_X$/SFR for the
same metallicity. We use our data to define the redshift-dependent contribution
of XRBs to the integrated X-ray luminosity density and, in comparison with
models, find that the contribution of high-mass XRBs to the cosmic X-ray
background at $z>6$ may be $\gtrsim 0.25$ dex higher than previously estimated.

simulations of molecular outflows in the past. One side of the outflow is
shorter and shows a stronger deceleration, suggesting that the medium through

off-shell vector multiplets. The theory is governed at two-derivative level by
the symmetric tensor $\mathcal{C}_{IJK}$ (the intersection numbers of the
Calabi-Yau) and at four-derivative level by the gauge-gravitational
Chern-Simons coupling $c_I$ (the second Chern class of the Calabi-Yau). The
quantum entropy is an $N_V + 2$-dimensional integral parameterised by one real
parameter $\varphi^I$ for each vector multiplet and an additional parameter
$\varphi^0$ for the gravity multiplet. The integrand consists of an action
governed completely by $\mathcal{C}_{IJK}$ and $c_{I}$, and a one-loop
determinant. Consistency with the on-shell logarithmic corrections to the
entropy, the symmetries of the very special geometry of the moduli space, and
an assumption of analyticity constrains the one-loop determinant up to a
scale-independent function $f(\varphi^0)$. For $f=1$ our result agrees
completely with the topological M-theory conjecture of Dijkgraaf, Gukov,
Nietzke, and Vafa for static black holes at two derivative level, and provides
a natural extension to higher derivative corrections. For rotating BMPV black

guaranteeing such stability, allows for modular ImGs interconnecting multiple
subsystems, that is, dynamic RLC lines, nonlinear constant impedance, current,
power (ZIP) and exponential (EXP) loads, and inverter-based distributed

The underlying idea of the framework is based one equilibrium-independent
passivity (EIP) of the ImG subsystems, which enables stability certificates of
ImG equilibria without their explicit knowledge. In order to render DGUs EIP,
we propose a decentralized controller synthesis algorithm based on
port-Hamiltonian systems (PHSs). We also show that EIP, being the key to
stability, provides a general framework which can embrace other solutions

LaSalle's theorem for proving asymptotic voltage and frequency stability.
Finally, we analyze the impact of actuator saturation on the stability results

second-order coherence measurements for single-photon and single-photon-pair
input states is summarized and compared. These theoretical predictions are then
tested in an innovative experimental setup that is easily able to switch
between implementing an interferometer consisting of only one or two nonlinear
elements. The resulting singles and coincidence rates are measured in both
configurations and the results are seen to fit well with the presented theory.
The measured results of coherence are tied back to the presented classification
scheme, revealing that our experimental design can be useful in gaining insight
into the properties of the various interferometeric setups containing different
degrees of nonlinearity.

Surfaces of polished limestone would not only have reflected diffusely in all
directions, but would also likely have produced specular reflections in
particular directions. Reflections toward points on the horizon would have been
visible from large distances. On a particular day and time when the sun was
properly situated, an observer stationed at a distant site would have seen a
momentary flash as the sun's reflection moved across the face of the pyramid.
The positions of the sun that are reflected to the horizon are confined to
narrow arcs in the sky, one arc for each side of the pyramid. We model specular
reflections from the pyramid of Khufu and derive the annual dates and times
when they would have been visible at important ancient sites. Certain of these
events might have coincided with significant dates on the Egyptian calendar, as
well as with solar equinoxes, solstices and cross-quarter days. The celebration
of Wepet-Renpet, which at the time of the pyramid's construction occurred near
the spring cross-quarter day, would have been marked by a specular sweep of
sites on the southern horizon. On the autumn and winter cross-quarter days
reflections would have been directed to Heliopolis. We suggest that on those
days the pyramidion of Khafre might have been visible in specular reflection
over the truncated top of Khufu's pyramid.

and radiation and ultimately fragments to heavy ($D$ or $B$) mesons. The energy
loss imprinted in the transverse momenta ($p_T$) distributions of those mesons,
leads to the celebrated phenomenon of $jet-quenching$. An alternate measure of
in-medium energy loss, recently discussed by PHENIX Collaboration, comes
through the effective shift in transverse momentum spectra of hadrons recorded
in nucleus-nucleus collisions when it was compared to the same in proton-proton
collisions. We have advocated a similar formalism and estimated the fractional
energy loss of heavy mesons for Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and Au+Au
collisions at RHIC experiment. We have parameterised the invariant momentum
yield of heavy mesons by Hagedorn function. The fit parameters and the
experimental data of jet-quenching are utilised to estimate the fractional
energy loss ($\Delta m_T$) of heavy mesons at RHIC and LHC experiment. The
$\Delta m_T$ is found to scale with the transverse mass ($m_T$) of heavy mesons
through a power law at different energies and centralities of collisions. We
have also calculated the total energy loss suffered by a charm quark in
quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energies. The
evolution of the plasma is described by (2+1) dimensional longitudinal
boost-invariant ideal hydrodynamics. It is found the total energy loss of charm
quarks scales with the transverse mass of charm quarks through a similar power
law which supports our analysis of fractional energy loss.

from lower scales obtained by means of a nonlinear numerical homogenization

simulations explicitly incorporate the true microscale response, maintaining
the same level of accuracy that would be obtained with online micro-macro
simulations but with a computational cost comparable to classical model-driven

specifically driver, behaviors in ride-hailing services. We use a data-driven
hybrid reinforcement learning and imitation learning approach for this. First,
the agent utilizes behavioral cloning to mimic driver behavior using a
real-world data set. Next, reinforcement learning is applied on top of the
pre-trained agents in a simulated environment, to allow them to adapt to

perceptual quality in SR under the assumption of the availability of
high-resolution RF images paired with low-resolution (LR) inputs at testing. As
the RF images should be similar in terms of content, colors, contrast, etc. to
the test image, this hinders the applicability in a real scenario. Other
approaches to increase the perceptual quality of images, including perceptual
loss and adversarial losses, tend to dramatically decrease fidelity to the
ground-truth through significant decreases in PSNR/SSIM. Addressing both
issues, we propose a simple yet universal approach to improve the perceptual
quality of the HR prediction from a pre-trained SR network on a given LR input
by further fine-tuning the SR network on a subset of images from the training
dataset with similar patterns of activation as the initial HR prediction, with
respect to the filters of a feature extractor. In particular, we show the
effects of fine-tuning on these images in terms of the perceptual quality and
PSNR/SSIM values. Contrary to perceptually driven approaches, we demonstrate
that the fine-tuned network produces a HR prediction with both greater
perceptual quality and minimal changes to the PSNR/SSIM with respect to the
initial HR prediction. Further, we present novel numerical experiments
concerning the filters of SR networks, where we show through filter
correlation, that the filters of the fine-tuned network from our method are
closer to ""ideal"" filters, than those of the baseline network or a network
fine-tuned on random images.

Callisto - is not fully understood yet. Here we use N-body numerical
simulations to study the formation of Galilean satellites in a gaseous
circumplanetary disk around Jupiter. Our model includes the effects of pebble
accretion, gas-driven migration, and gas tidal damping and drag.
Satellitesimals in our simulations first grow via pebble accretion and start to
migrate inwards. When they reach the trap at the disk inner edge, scattering
events and collisions take place promoting additional growth. Growing
satellites eventually reach a multi-resonant configuration anchored at the disk
inner edge. Our best match to the masses of the Galilean satellites is produced
in simulations where the integrated pebble flux is 1e-3 MJ. These simulations
typically produce between 3 and 5 satellites. In our best analogues, adjacent
satellite pairs are all locked in 2:1 mean motion resonances. However, they
have also moderately eccentric orbits (0.1), unlike the current real
satellites. We propose that the Galilean satellites system is a primordial
resonant chain, similar to exoplanet systems as TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-223, and
TOI-178. Callisto was probably in resonance with Ganymede in the past but left
this configuration - without breaking the Laplacian resonance - via divergent
migration due to tidal planet-satellite interactions. These same effects
further damped the orbital eccentricities of these satellites down to their
current values (0.001). Our results support the hypothesis that Io and Europa
were born with water-ice rich compositions and lost all/most of their water
afterwards. Firmer constraints on the primordial compositions of the Galilean
satellites are crucial to distinguish formation models.

method to estimate the variance of the IPW estimator with our new weights. It
accounts for between-subject correlations induced by the sampling processes for
both cases and controls through perturbing their sampling indicator variables,

proposed in Samuelsen (1997) for a standard NCC design. We illustrate the

popular and effective algorithm for estimating node influence. However,
conventional PageRank method considers neither the heterogeneity of network
structures nor additional network information, causing a major impedance to
performance improvement and an underestimation of non-hub nodes' importance. As
these problems are only partially studied, existing solutions are still not

PageRank-based model framework, dubbed Hetero-NodeRank, that accounts for
heterogeneous network topology and incorporates node attribute information to
capture both link- and node-based effects in measuring node influence.
Moreover, the framework enables the calibration of the proposed model against

multi-qubit interactions. This makes the precise manipulation of quantum states
particularly difficult for multi-qubit interactions because tunability
unavoidably introduces sensitivity to fluctuations in the tuned parameters,
leading to erroneous multi-qubit gate operations. The performance of quantum
algorithms may be severely compromised by coherent multi-qubit errors. It is
therefore imperative to understand how these fluctuations affect multi-qubit
interactions and, more importantly, to mitigate their influence. In this study,
we demonstrate how to implement dynamical-decoupling techniques to suppress the
two-qubit analogue of the dephasing on a superconducting quantum device
featuring a compact tunable coupler, a trending technology that enables the
fast manipulation of qubit--qubit interactions. The pure-dephasing time shows
an up to ~14 times enhancement on average when using robust sequences. The
results are in good agreement with the noise generated from room-temperature
circuits. Our study further reveals the decohering processes associated with
tunable couplers and establishes a framework to develop gates and sequences
robust against two-qubit errors.

reaction networks in nature. However, little is known about their stochastic
behavior and the variety of network phenotypes they can exhibit. In this study,
we provide full characterizations of the properties of stochastic multimodality
of FFLs, and how switching between different network phenotypes are controlled.
We have computed the exact steady state probability landscapes of all eight
types of coherent and incoherent FFLs using the finite-butter ACME algorithm,
and quantified the exact topological features of their high-dimensional
probability landscapes using persistent homology. Through analysis of the
degree of multimodality for each of a set of 10,812 probability landscapes,
where each landscape resides over 10^5-10^6 microstates, we have constructed
comprehensive phase diagrams of all relevant behavior of FFL multimodality over
broad ranges of input and regulation intensities, as well as different regimes
of promoter binding dynamics. Our results show that with slow binding and
unbinding dynamics of transcription factor to promoter, FFLs exhibit strong
stochastic behavior that is very different from what would be inferred from
deterministic models. In addition, input intensity play major roles in the
phenotypes of FFLs: At weak input intensity, FFL exhibit monomodality, but
strong input intensity may result in up to 6 stable phenotypes. Furthermore, we
found that gene duplication can enlarge stable regions of specific
multimodalities and enrich the phenotypic diversity of FFL networks, providing
means for cells towards better adaptation to changing environment. Our results
are directly applicable to analysis of behavior of FFLs in biological processes
such as stem cell differentiation and for design of synthetic networks when
certain phenotypic behavior is desired.

generally, we define a map $f:W\to W$ to be compulsive if for every $w\in W$,
$f(w)$ is less than or equal to $\mathsf{Pop}(w)$ in the right weak order. We

cm HI emission are systematically low due to a cold opaque atomic gas
component. If true, this opaque component necessitates a ~35% correction factor
relative to the mass from assuming optically-thin HI emission. These mass
corrections are based on fitting HI spectra with a single opaque component
model that produces a distinct ""top-hat"" shaped line profile. Here, we
investigate this issue using deep, high spectral resolution HI VLA observations
of M31 and M33 to test if these top-hat profiles are instead superpositions of
multiple HI components along the line-of-sight. We fit both models and find
that >80% of the spectra strongly prefer a multi-component Gaussian model while
<2% prefer the single opacity-corrected component model. This strong preference
for multiple components argues against previous findings of lines-of-sight
dominated by only cold HI. Our findings are enabled by the improved spectral
resolution (0.42 km/s), whereas coarser spectral resolution blends multiple
components together. We also show that the inferred opaque atomic ISM mass
strongly depends on the goodness-of-fit definition and is highly uncertain when
the inferred spin temperature has a large uncertainty. Finally, we find that
the relation of the HI surface density with the dust surface density and
extinction has significantly more scatter when the inferred HI opacity
correction is applied. These variations are difficult to explain without
additionally requiring large variations in the dust properties. Based on these
findings, we suggest that the opaque HI mass is best constrained by HI
absorption studies.

Therefore, it is essential to develop algorithms that can adapt to different

researches on domain adaption focus on giving the model a better
initialization, rather than optimizing the adaptation process. We propose an
efficient domain adaptive task-oriented dialog system model, which incorporates
a meta-teacher model to emphasize the different impacts between generated
tokens with respect to the context. We first train our base dialog model and
meta-teacher model adversarially in a meta-learning setting on rich-resource

different contexts across different domains. During adaptation, the
meta-teacher guides the dialog model to focus on important tokens in order to
achieve better adaptation efficiency. We evaluate our model on two multi-domain

Graham [Dutta, Sarit and Graham, Michael D., JNNFM 251 (2018)], a constitutive
model for describing the behavior of dilute wormlike micelle solutions. The RRM
treats wormlike micelle solutions as dilute suspensions of rigid Brownian rods
undergoing reversible scission and growth in flow. Evolution equations for
micelle orientation and stress contribution are coupled to a kinetic reaction
equation for a collective micelle length, producing dynamic variations in the
length and rotational diffusivity of the rods. This model has previously shown
success in capturing many critical steady-state rheological features of dilute
wormlike micelle solutions, particularly shear-thickening and -thinning,
non-zero normal stress differences, and a reentrant shear stress-shear rate
curve, and could fit a variety of steady state experimental data. The present
work improves on this framework, which showed difficulty in capturing transient
dynamics and high-shear behavior, by reformulating the kinetic equation for
micelle growth on a more microstructural (though still highly idealized) basis.
In particular, we allow for micelle growth associated with strong alignment of
rods and breakage due to tensile stresses along the micelles. This new
formulation captures both steady and transient shear rheology in good agreement
with experiments. We also find good agreement with available steady state
extensional rheology.

enables one to look at the parameters associated with unit root dynamics and

novel factorization of the VAR polynomial that partitions the polynomial
spectrum into unit root and stable and zero roots via polynomial factors. The
proposed factorization adds to the literature of spectral factorization of
matrix polynomials. The main benefit is that using the parameterization,
actions could be taken to model the dynamics due to a particular class of
roots, e.g. unit roots or zero roots, without changing the properties of the
dynamics due to other roots. For example, using the parameterization one is
able to estimate cointegrating space with appropriate rank that maintains the
root structure of the original VAR processes or one can estimate a reduced rank
causal VAR process maintaining the constraints of causality. In essence, this
parameterization provides the practitioner an option to perform estimation of
VAR processes with constrained root structure (e.g., conintegrated VAR or

investigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed

imbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness,
uncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a
systematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction

robust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error
limits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose
a clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated

nebular processing, planetesimal differentiation, and planetary accretion. We
investigate iron meteorites as an archive of volatile loss during planetesimal

meteorites are reconstructed by thermodynamic modelling. Calculated
solid/molten alloy partitioning of C increases greatly with liquid S
concentration and inferred parent body C concentrations range from 0.0004 to
0.11 wt.%. Parent bodies fall into 2 compositional clusters characterized by
cores with medium, and low C/S. Both of these require significant planetesimal
degassing, as metamorphic devolatilization on chondrite-like precursors is
insufficient to account for their C depletions. Planetesimal core formation
models, ranging from closed system extraction to degassing of a wholly molten
body, show that significant open system silicate melting and volatile loss is
required to match medium and low C/S parent body core compositions. Greater
depletion in C relative to S is the hallmark of silicate degassing, indicating
that parent body core compositions record processes that affect composite
silicate/iron planetesimals. Degassing of bare cores stripped of their silicate
mantles would deplete S with negligible C loss, and could not account for
inferred parent body core compositions. Devolatilization during small-body
differentiation is thus a key process in shaping the volatile inventory of

studied in a new control-theoretic framework for uncertain nonlinear systems.
The framework can be systematically used in transfer learning and sim-to-real
applications, where an optimal policy learned for a nominal system needs to
remain effective in the presence of significant variations in parameters. Given
unknown parameters within a bounded range, the resulting adaptive control laws
guarantee convergence of the closed-loop system to the state of zero cost.
Online adjustment of the learning rate is used as a key stability mechanism,
and preserves certainty equivalence when designing optimal policies without
assuming uncertainty to be within the control range. The approach is
illustrated on the familiar mountain car problem, where it yields near-optimal
performance despite the presence of parametric model uncertainty.

  We demonstrate that, for generic second-order PDEs (for instance, for all

three-dimensional shape and field strength along each loop. McCarthy et al.
(2019) used this novel method to compute the total magnetic flux
interconnecting a pair of active regions observed by SDO/AIA. They adopted the
common assumption that each loop had a circular cross section. The accuracy of
inferred shape and circularity of cross sections can both be tested using
observations of the same loops from additional vantage points as provided by
STEREO/EUVI. Here, we use multiple viewing angles to confirm the
three-dimensional structure of loops. Of 151 viable cases, 105 (69.5%) matched
some form of visible coronal structure when viewed approximately in quadrature.
A loop with a circular cross-section should appear of a similar width in
different perspectives. In contradiction to this, we find a puzzling lack of
correlation between loop diameters seen from different perspectives, even an
anti-correlation in some cases. Features identified as monolithic loops in AIA
may, in fact, be more complex density enhancements. The 30.5% of
reconstructions from AIA which did not match any feature in EUVI might be such
enhancements. Others may be genuine loop structures, but with elliptical cross
sections. We observe an anti-correlation between diameter and brightness,
lending support to the latter hypothesis. Of 13 suitable for width analysis,
four loops are consistent with non-circular cross sections, where we find
anti-correlation in both comparisons.

Under a total phase condition, unequal phases at the three momenta break the
rotation symmetry generally. The $3Q$ complex orders constitute a rich
Haldane-model phase diagram. When effective time-reversal symmetries arise
under 1-site translations, the Dirac semimetals are protected. The breakdown of
these symmetries gaps the Dirac points and leads to the trivial and Chern
insulator phases. These phases are deformations of purely real and imaginary
orders, which exhibit trivial site and/or bond density and chiral flux orders,
respectively. The exotic single-Dirac-point semimetals also appear along the
gapless phase boundary. We further show that the theoretical model offers

quantum many-body localized (MBL) phase holds long-term memory, which can be
attributed to the emergent local integrals of motion. On the other hand, MBL
phase does not provide sufficient nonlinearity in learning highly-nonlinear
time sequences, which we show in a parity check task. This is reversed in the
quantum ergodic phase, which provides sufficient nonlinearity but compromises
memory capacity. In a complex learning task of Mackey-Glass prediction that
requires both sufficient memory capacity and nonlinearity, we find optimal
learning performance near the MBL-to-ergodic transition. This leads to a
guiding principle of quantum reservoir engineering at the edge of quantum
ergodicity reaching optimal learning power for generic complex reservoir
learning tasks. Our theoretical finding can be readily tested with present

path towards resolution of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, provided their
constraints are shown to be free from systematics such as the Malmquist bias.
In the traditional Bayesian framework, accounting for selection effects in the
likelihood requires calculation of the expected number (or fraction) of
detections as a function of the parameters describing the population and
cosmology; a potentially costly and/or inaccurate process. This calculation
can, however, be bypassed completely by performing the inference in a framework
in which the likelihood is never explicitly calculated, but instead fit using
forward simulations of the data, which naturally include the selection. This is
Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI). Here, we use density-estimation LFI, coupled
to neural-network-based data compression, to infer $H_0$ from mock catalogues
of binary neutron star mergers, given noisy redshift, distance and peculiar
velocity estimates for each object. We demonstrate that LFI yields
statistically unbiased estimates of $H_0$ in the presence of selection effects,
with precision matching that of sampling the full Bayesian hierarchical model.
Marginalizing over the bias increases the $H_0$ uncertainty by only $6\%$ for
training sets consisting of $O(10^4)$ populations. The resulting LFI framework
is applicable to population-level inference problems with selection effects
across astrophysics.

from an inverse seesaw mechanism at one loop level thanks to a remnant

a new scheme for tackling the challenges in the annotation of such large
dataset. Our technique reduces the overall cost of annotation in terms of time
as well as budget. We demonstrate performing fps analysis to reduce the effort
and time of annotation. We investigate several annotation methods for
efficiently generating tight bounding boxes. Our results prove that
interpolating bounding boxes between keyframes is the most efficient method of
bounding box generation amongst several other methods and is 3x times faster
than the naive baseline method. We introduce a novel way of aligning the
identity of runners in disjoint cameras. Our inter-camera alignment tool
integrated with the state-of-the-art person re-id system proves to be
sufficient and effective in the alignment of the runners across multiple
cameras with non-overlapping views. Our proposed framework of annotation
reduces the annotation cost of the dataset by a factor of 16x, also effectively
aligning 93.64% of the runners in the cross-camera setting.

interpretation of seismic data. Seismic inversion enables estimation of rock
properties over the complete seismic section. Traditional and machine
learning-based seismic inversion workflows are limited to inverting each
seismic trace independently of other traces to estimate impedance profiles,
leading to lateral discontinuities in the presence of noise and large
geological variations in the seismic data. In addition, machine learning-based
approaches suffer the problem of overfitting if there is a small number of
wells on which the model is trained. We propose a two-pronged strategy to
overcome these problems. We present a Temporal Convolutional Network that
models seismic traces temporally. We further inject spatial context for each
trace into its estimations of the impedance profile. To counter the problem of
limited labeled data, we also present a joint learning scheme whereby multiple
datasets are simultaneously used for training, sharing beneficial information
among each other. This results in the improvement in generalization performance
on all datasets. We present a case study of acoustic impedance inversion using
the open source SEAM and Marmousi 2 datasets. Our evaluations show that our
proposed approach is able to perform robust and laterally consistent
estimations of impedance in the presence of noisy seismic data and limited
labels. We compare and contrast our approach to other learning-based seismic
inversion methodologies in the literature. On SEAM, we are able to obtain an
average MSE of 0.0966, the lowest among all other methodologies.

Redundant systems are common in modular robots that consist of multiple modules

different needs. Different from robots with fixed geometry or configurations,
the kinematics model of a modular robotic system can alter as the robot

RNN-T is more robust against additive perturbations, especially on long

is $(k,t)$-robust if, roughly speaking, no coalition of $t$ players can

Even though implementing $(k,t)$-robust mediators seems closely related to
implementing asynchronous multiparty $(k+t)$-secure computation \cite{BCG93},
to the best of our knowledge there is no known straightforward reduction from
one problem to another. Nevertheless, we show that there is a non-trivial
reduction from a slightly weaker notion of $(k+t)$-secure computation, which we
call $(k+t)$-strict secure computation, to implementing $(k,t)$-robust

on $n$ variables that cannot be $(k+t)$-strictly securely computed if $n \le

camera with that of a LIDAR. This allows fine details and texture to be
captured while still accurately representing featureless subjects. However,
fusing these two sensor modalities is challenging due to their fundamentally
different characteristics. Rather than directly fusing image features and LIDAR
points, we propose to leverage common geometric features that are detected in
both the LIDAR scans and image data, allowing data from the two sensors to be
processed in a higher-level space. In particular, we propose to find
correspondences between 3D lines extracted from LIDAR scans and 2D lines
detected in images before performing a bundle adjustment to refine poses. We
also exploit the detected and optimized line segments to improve the quality of

\mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(Y) \rtimes \mathbb{C} G, \triangleright)$ that depends

Hopf-algebraic constructions; prove that they are canonically independent of
the triangulations; and find a 2+1D TQFT whose state spaces on surfaces give

finite spaces, in this case obtained as classifying spaces of finite groupoids

the unlicensed 5 GHz U-NII bands. We focus on the misbehavior opportunities due

control plane. We define selfish misbehavior strategies for the LTE that yield
an unfair share of the spectrum resources. Such strategies are based on
manipulating the operational parameters of the LTE-LAA standard, namely the
backoff mechanism, the traffic class parameters, the clear channel access (CCA)
threshold, and others. Prior methods for detecting misbehavior in homogeneous
settings are not applicable in a spectrum sharing scenario because the devices
of one system cannot decode the transmissions of another. We develop implicit
sensing techniques that can accurately estimate the operational parameters of
LTE transmissions under various topological scenarios and {\em without
decoding.} These techniques apply correlation-based signal detection to infer
the required information. Our techniques are validated through experiments on a
USRP testbed. We further apply a statistical inference framework for
determining deviations of the LTE behavior from the coexistence etiquette. By
characterizing the detection and false alarm probabilities, we show that our
framework yields high detection accuracy at a very low false alarm rate.

deep learning method to measure photometry from galaxy images. Lumos builds on
BKGnet, an algorithm to predict the background and its associated error, and
predicts the background-subtracted flux probability density function. We have
developed Lumos for data from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey
(PAUS), an imaging survey using a 40 narrow-band filter camera (PAUCam). PAUCam
images are affected by scattered light, displaying a background noise pattern
that can be predicted and corrected for. On average, Lumos increases the SNR of
the observations by a factor of 2 compared to an aperture photometry algorithm.
It also incorporates other advantages like robustness towards distorting
artefacts, e.g. cosmic rays or scattered light, the ability of deblending and
less sensitivity to uncertainties in the galaxy profile parameters used to
infer the photometry. Indeed, the number of flagged photometry outlier
observations is reduced from 10% to 2%, comparing to aperture photometry.
Furthermore, with Lumos photometry, the photo-z scatter is reduced by ~10% with
the Deepz machine learning photo-z code and the photo-z outlier rate by 20%.
The photo-z improvement is lower than expected from the SNR increment, however
currently the photometric calibration and outliers in the photometry seem to be
its limiting factor.

can be explained by gap-opening planets less massive than Jupiter. Meanwhile,
recent studies have suggested that protoplanetary discs should have low levels
of turbulence. Past computational work on low-viscosity discs has hinted that
these two developments might not be self-consistent because even low-mass
planets can be accompanied by vortices instead of conventional double rings. We
investigate this potential discrepancy by conducting hydrodynamic simulations
of growing planetary cores in discs with various aspect ratios ($H/r=0.04$,
0.06, 0.08) and viscosities ($1.5 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 3
\times 10^{-4}$), having these cores accrete their gas mass directly from the
disc. With $\alpha < 10^{-4}$, we find that sub-Saturn-mass planets in discs
with $H/r \le 0.06$ are more likely to be accompanied by dust asymmetries
compared to Jupiter-mass planets because they can trigger several generations
of vortices in succession. We also find that vortices with $H/r = 0.08$ survive
$>6000$ planet orbits regardless of the planet mass or disc mass because they
are less affected by the planet's spiral waves. We connect our results to
observations and find that the outward migration of vortices with $H/r \ge
0.08$ may be able to explain the cavity in Oph IRS 48 or the two clumps in MWC
758. Lastly, we show that the lack of observed asymmetries in the disc
population in Taurus is unexpected given the long asymmetry lifetimes in our
low viscosity simulations ($\alpha \sim 2 \times 10^{-5}$), a discrepancy we
suggest is due to these discs having higher viscosities.

ratio (as a trade-off parameter between coverage and movements) and facilitates
coverage with the generated movements according to this value. Extensive

The problem of localization has been of interest for many years. However,
visual localization is a relatively new subject in the literature of
transportation. Moreover, the inevitable application of this type of
localization in the context of autonomous vehicles demands special attention
from the transportation community to this problem. This study proposes a
two-step localization method that requires a database of geotagged images and a
camera mounted on a vehicle that can take pictures while the car is moving. The
first step which is image retrieval uses SIFT local feature descriptor to find
an initial location for the vehicle using image matching. The next step is to
utilize the Kalman filter to estimate a more accurate location for the vehicle
as it is moving. All stages of the introduced method are implemented as a
complete system using different Python libraries. The proposed system is tested
on the KITTI dataset and has shown an average accuracy of 2 meters in finding

this choice, our approach uses the unique semantics of the TLL architecture to
divide the repair problem into two significantly decoupled sub-problems, one of
which is concerned with repairing the un-safe counterexample -- and hence is
essentially of local scope -- and the other of which ensures that the repairs
are realized in the output of the network -- and hence is essentially of global

us to formulate the TLL repair problem as two separate, but significantly
decoupled, convex optimization problems. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on

that has been reported several times, but the optical counterpart has been
unclear due to source confusion in a crowded region of the SMC. Previous works
proposed [MA93] 302 as the counterpart, however we show here, using data
obtained from the S-CUBED project, that the X-ray positio is inconsistent with
that object. Instead we propose a previously unclassified object which has all
the indications of being a newly identified Be star exhibiting strong HU
emission. Evidence for the presence of significant I-band variability strongly
suggest that this is, in fact, a Be type star with a large circumstellar disk.
Over 18 years worth of optical monitoring by the OGLE project reveal a periodic
modulation at a period of 413d, probably the binary period of the system. A
SALT optical spectrum shows strong Balmer emission and supports a proposed
spectral classification of B1-3 III-IVe. The X-ray data obtained from the
S-CUBED project reveal a time-averaged spectrum well fitted by a photon index =
0.93 pm 0.16. Assuming the known distance to the SMC the flux corresponds to a
luminosity 10E35 erg/s. All of these observational facts suggest that this is
confirmed as a Be star-neutron star X-ray binary (BeXRB) in the SMC, albeit one
with an unusually long binary period at the limits of the Corbet Diagram.

tiny individual cell compartments is one of many challenges faced by
biologists. This paper aims at solving this problem by building an end-to-end
process that employs methods from the deep learning field to automatically
segment, detect and classify cell compartments of fluorescence microscopy
images of yeast cells. With this intention we used Mask R-CNN to automatically
segment and label a large amount of yeast cell data, and YOLOv4 to
automatically detect and classify individual yeast cell compartments from these
images. This fully automated end-to-end process is intended to be integrated
into an interactive e-Science server in the PerICo1 project, which can be used
by biologists with minimized human effort in training and operation to complete
their various classification tasks. In addition, we evaluated the detection and
classification performance of state-of-the-art YOLOv4 on data from the

dividing original images into 4 quadrants YOLOv4 outputs good detection and

which is optimally suited for the native resolution of the microscope and
current GPU memory sizes. Although the application domain is optical microscopy

The spiral shape contains smooth gradients of curvature, which lead to smooth
gradients of bending energy. We show these gradients can drive nanoscillators.
We also carry out an energy analysis by approximating the carbon nanotube to a
thin rod and discuss how torsional gradients can be used to drive motion. For
the nanoribbons, we also analyzed the role of layer orientation. Our results
show that motion is not sustainable for commensurate orientations, in which AB
stacking occurs. For incommensurate orientations, friction almost vanishes, and
in this instance, the motion can continue even if the driving forces are not
very high. This suggests that mild curvature gradients, which can already be

to mitigate some of these challenges by offering a vision of a more holistic
ecosystem that takes researchers and practitioners from the data collection
through validation, with transparent, accessible, and extensible subcomponents.
This proposed approach is demonstrated through two data pipelines (crop yield
and synthetic population) that take users from data download through the
cleaning and processing until users of have data that can be integrated into an
ABM. These pipelines are built to be transparent: by walking users step by step
through the process, accessible: by being skill scalable so users can leverage
them without code or with code, and extensible by being freely available on the
coding sharing repository GitHub to facilitate community development. Reusing
code that simulates complex phenomena is a significant challenge but one that
must be consistently addressed to help the community move forward. This
research seeks to aid that progress by offering potential new tools extended
from the already robust ecosystem to help the community collaborate more
effectively internally and across disciplines.

contact-based fingerprints, and vi) different image qualities of smartphone

for analysing the global properties of a system, such as a phase transition
temperature. Here, we address this challenge by using statistical analyses of
magnetic-field maps to characterize the first-order temperature-driven
metamagnetic phase transition from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic
state in FeRh. After imaging the phase transition and identifying the regimes
of nucleation, growth, and coalescence of ferromagnetic domains, we
statistically characterize the spatial magnetic-field maps to extract the
transition temperature and thermal hysteresis width. By analysing the spatial
correlations of the maps and their dependence on an external magnetic field, we
investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and detect a reorientation of
domain walls across the phase transition. The employed statistical approach can
be extended to the study of other magnetic phenomena with NV magnetometry or
other sensing techniques.

increasingly important that humans (including those are who not experts in RL)
understand the reasoning behind the actions taken by an RL agent, particularly

PolicyExplainer, a visual analytics interface which lets the user directly

systems based on CAs mostly depends on two factors: the properties of the
mask's attenuation pattern, that we refer to as ""codification"" and the
computational techniques used to recover the quantity of interest from the
coded snapshot. In this work, we introduce the idea of using time-varying CAs
synchronized with spatially varying pixel shutters. We divide the exposure of a
sensor into sub-exposures at the beginning of which the CA mask changes and at
which the sensor's pixels are simultaneously and individually switched ""on"" or
""off"". This is a practically appealing codification as it does not introduce
additional optical components other than the already present CA but uses a
change in the pixel shutter that can be easily realized electronically. We show
that our proposed time multiplexed coded aperture (TMCA) can be optimized
end-to-end and induces better coded snapshots enabling superior reconstructions
in two different applications: compressive light field imaging and
hyperspectral imaging. We demonstrate both in simulation and on real captures
(taken with prototypes we built) that this codification outperforms the
state-of-the-art compressive imaging systems by more than 4dB in those

inside ~.3 AU and at ~1 AU provides an answer to longstanding questions about
scattering and energization of solar wind electrons. The waves can have rapid
nonlinear interactions with electrons over a broad energy range.
Counter-propagation between electrons and waves is not required for resonance
with the obliquely propagating waves in contrast to the case for parallel
propagation. Using a full 3d particle tracing code, we have examined
interactions of electrons with energies from 0 eV to 2 keV with whistler-mode
waves with amplitudes of 20 mV/m and propagation angles from 0 to 180 degrees
to the background magnetic field. Interactions with wave packets and single
waves are both modeled based on observations at ~.3 AU and 1 AU. The
simulations demonstrate the key role played by these waves in rapid scattering
and energization of electrons. Results provide evidence for nonlinear effects,
indicating that quasi-linear methods are not adequate for modeling the role of
whistlers in the evolution of solar wind electrons. Strong scattering and
energization for some initial energy and pitch angle ranges occurs for both
counter-propagating and obliquely propagating waves. The strong scattering of
strahl electrons counteracts the pitch angle narrowing due to conservation of
the first adiabatic invariant as electrons propagate away from the sun into
regions of smaller magnetic field. Scattering also produces the hotter
isotropic halo. The concomitant limiting of the electron heat flux is also
relevant in other astrophysical settings.

of 1% per Kelvin, which is 100 times larger than the modulation of scattering
intensity. In addition, fluorescence emission is free of speckles, thus much
improving the image quality. Moreover, fluorophores can target specific

the models trained on standard cloth datasets fail miserably on ethnic outfits.
To address these challenges, we introduce the first large-scale ethnic dataset

classification of Indian ethnic clothes. We gathered a diverse dataset from a
large number of Indian e-commerce websites. We then evaluate several baselines

hyperspectral image (HI) sequences due to its ability to reveal the evolution
of materials over time and space in a scene. However, significant spectral
variability is often observed between collection of images due to variations in
acquisition or seasonal conditions. This characteristic has to be considered in
the design of SU algorithms. Because of its good performance, the multiple
endmember spectral mixture analysis algorithm (MESMA) has been recently used to
perform SU in multitemporal scenarios arising in several practical
applications. However, MESMA does not consider the relationship between the
different HIs, and its computational complexity is extremely high for large
spectral libraries. In this work, we propose an efficient multitemporal SU
method that exploits the high temporal correlation between the abundances to
provide more accurate results at a lower computational complexity. We propose
to solve the complex general multitemporal SU problem by separately addressing
the endmember selection and the abundance estimation problems. This leads to a
simpler solution without sacrificing the accuracy of the results. We also
propose a strategy to detect and address abrupt abundance variations in time.
Theoretical results demonstrate how the proposed method compares to MESMA in
terms of quality, and how effective it is in detecting abundance changes. This
analysis provides valuable insight into the conditions under which the
algorithm succeeds. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance at a smaller computational cost.

Remarkably, many of these $\gamma$ rays were observed apart from known very
high energy (E$>$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray sources. These results are best
understood if these diffuse $\gamma$ rays: 1) were produced by a conventional
rather than an exotic (i.e. dark matter decay or annihilation) process, 2) have
a hadronic rather than a leptonic origin, 3) were produced in impulsive rather
than stable sources or, alternatively, in optically thick sources. In addition
to that, the detection of the sub-PeV diffuse $\gamma$ rays implies a limit on
the flux of neutrinos from the Galactic disk and a lower limit on the rigidity
of the cutoff in the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum.

can convey rich social information among agents. In contrast, such crucial
social characteristics are mostly missing in the existing scene understanding
literature. In this paper, we incorporate different nonverbal communication
cues (e.g., gaze, human poses, and gestures) to represent, model, learn, and
infer agents' mental states from pure visual inputs. Crucially, such a mental
representation takes the agent's belief into account so that it represents what
the true world state is and infers the beliefs in each agent's mental state,
which may differ from the true world states. By aggregating different beliefs
and true world states, our model essentially forms ""five minds"" during the
interactions between two agents. This ""five minds"" model differs from prior
works that infer beliefs in an infinite recursion; instead, agents' beliefs are
converged into a ""common mind"". Based on this representation, we further devise
a hierarchical energy-based model that jointly tracks and predicts all five
minds. From this new perspective, a social event is interpreted by a series of
nonverbal communication and belief dynamics, which transcends the classic
keyframe video summary. In the experiments, we demonstrate that using such a
social account provides a better video summary on videos with rich social
interactions compared with state-of-the-art keyframe video summary methods.

structures. For instance, the trajectories of a robotic manipulator can be
broken down into a collection of its transitional and rotational motions, fully
characterized by the corresponding Lie groups and Lie algebras. In this work,
we take advantage of these structures to build effective dynamical models that
are amenable to sample-based learning. We hypothesize that learning the
dynamics on a Lie algebra vector space is more effective than learning a direct
state transition model. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce the Group
Enhanced Model (GEM). GEMs significantly outperform conventional transition
models on tasks of long-term prediction, planning, and model-based
reinforcement learning across a diverse suite of standard continuous-control

essential task in terms of visual quality and subsequent processing. Most
existing destriping methods are designed by combining a particular image
regularization with a stripe noise characterization that cooperates with the
regularization, which precludes us to examine and activate different
regularizations to adapt to various target images. To resolve this, two
requirements need to be considered: a general framework that can handle a
variety of image regularizations in destriping, and a strong stripe noise
characterization that can consistently capture the nature of stripe noise,
regardless of the choice of image regularization. To this end, this paper
proposes a general destriping framework using a newly-introduced stripe noise
characterization, named flatness constraint, where we can handle various
regularization functions in a unified manner. Specifically, we formulate the
destriping problem as a nonsmooth convex optimization problem involving a
general form of image regularization and the flatness constraint. The
constraint mathematically models that the intensity of each stripe is constant
along one direction, resulting in a strong characterization of stripe noise.
For solving the optimization problem, we also develop an efficient algorithm
based on a diagonally preconditioned primal-dual splitting algorithm (DP-PDS),
which can automatically adjust the stepsizes. The effectiveness of our
framework is demonstrated through destriping experiments, where we
comprehensively compare combinations of a variety of image regularizations and
stripe noise characterizations using hyperspectral images (HSI) and infrared
(IR) videos.

high-resolution aerial imagery. Over the past few years, most studies focus on
classifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it
is more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this
paper, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task -- multi-scene
recognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset,
called MultiScene, composed of 100,000 unconstrained high-resolution aerial
images. Considering that manually labeling such images is extremely arduous, we
resort to low-cost annotations from crowdsourcing platforms, e.g.,
OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, OSM data might suffer from incompleteness and
incorrectness, which introduce noise into image labels. To address this issue,
we visually inspect 14,000 images and correct their scene labels, yielding a
subset of cleanly-annotated images, named MultiScene-Clean. With it, we can
develop and evaluate deep networks for multi-scene recognition using clean
data. Moreover, we provide crowdsourced annotations of all images for the
purpose of studying network learning with noisy labels. We conduct experiments

models, including nnU-Net: reducing the mean Hausdorff distance (HD) by
7.7-14.3mm and improving the worst case Dice-Sorensen coefficient (DSC) by
1.2-2.3%. More critically, cross-dataset experiments on a dataset directly
reflecting clinical deployment scenarios demonstrate that DISSMs improve the

DSC by 5.4-7.3%. These improvements are over and above any benefits from

we test the novel majorization uncertainty relations of three incompatible

compare the compactness of various entropy uncertainty relations. The
experimental results confirm that for general mixed quantum system, the
majorization uncertainty relation tends to be the tightest constraint on

the majorzation uncertainty relation is the optimal one. Our experimental setup
provides an easy means for preparing mixed states, and based on this simple

recently due to their controllable scattering elements that are able to direct
electromagnetic waves into desirable directions. Although RISs share some

performance. To harness the benefits of both relaying and RISs, a multi-user
communication system is proposed in this paper wherein a relay and an RIS
cooperate to improve performance in terms of energy efficiency. To utilize the
RIS efficiently, the discrete phase shifts of the RIS elements are optimized
along with the beamforming matrices at the transmitter and the relay, targeting
the minimization of the total transmit power subject to a quality-of-service
(QoS) constraint. Then, two suboptimal efficient solutions are proposed for the
resulting discrete and non-convex problem, one based on singular value
decomposition (SVD) and uplink-downlink duality and the other is based on SVD
combined with zero-forcing. Simulations show that the proposed solutions
outperform a system with either a relay or an RIS only, especially when both
are closer to the users than to the base-station.

extrinsic information transfer (EPEXIT) algorithm to facilitate the analysis of
protograph codes in the IM-BICM-ID systems. With the use of EPEXIT algorithm, a
simple design method is conceived for the construction of a family of high-rate
protograph codes, called irregular-mapped accumulate-repeat-accumulate (IMARA)
codes, which possess both excellent decoding thresholds and
linear-minimum-distance-growth property. Furthermore, motivated by the
voltage-region iterative gain characteristics of IM-BICM-ID systems, a novel
read-voltage optimization scheme is developed to acquire accurate read-voltage
levels, thus minimizing the decoding thresholds of protograph codes.
Theoretical analyses and error-rate simulations indicate that the proposed
IMARA-aided IM-BICM-ID scheme and the proposed read-voltage optimization scheme
remarkably improve the convergence and decoding performance of flash-memory

attention to neighboring frames of the query at a high resolution, and the
dilation mechanism summarizes distant information to allow attending to it with
a lower resolution. Different methods for summarizing distant frames are

Recently, several papers have suggested using a learned value function as the
terminal cost for MPC. If the value function is accurate, it effectively allows
MPC to reason over an infinite horizon. Unfortunately, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) solutions to value function approximation can be difficult to realize for
robotics tasks. In this paper, we suggest a more efficient method for value
function approximation that applies to goal-directed problems, like reaching

trajectory returned by a planner. However, this strategy is brittle in that
unexpected perturbations to the robot will require replanning, which can be
costly at runtime. Instead, we show how the intermediate data structures used
by modern planners can be interpreted as an approximate value function. We show
that that this value function can be used by MPC directly, resulting in more
efficient and resilient behavior at runtime.

video is therefore essential to reduce the workload of clinicians and assist in
improving the accuracy of disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep
model to ground shooting range of small intestine from a capsule endoscope
video which has duration of tens of hours. This is the first attempt to attack
the small intestine grounding task using deep neural network method. We model
the task as a 3-way classification problem, in which every video frame is
categorized into esophagus/stomach, small intestine or colorectum. To explore
long-range temporal dependency, a transformer module is built to fuse features
of multiple neighboring frames. Based on the classification model, we devise an
efficient search algorithm to efficiently locate the starting and ending
shooting boundaries of the small intestine. Without searching the small
intestine exhaustively in the full video, our method is implemented via
iteratively separating the video segment along the direction to the target
boundary in the middle. We collect 113 videos from a local hospital to validate
our method. In the 5-fold cross validation, the average IoU between the small
intestine segments located by our method and the ground-truths annotated by
broad-certificated gastroenterologists reaches 0.945.

affordance representations and novel object representations from additional

affordance transfer learning, the model is also capable of inferring the
affordances of novel objects from known affordance representations. The
proposed method can thus be used to 1) improve the performance of HOI

quickly adapt to similar tasks with the same partners by carrying over
conventions that they have developed (e.g. raising hand signals pass the ball),

humans, AI agents should adapt quickly to new partners and new tasks as well.
However, current approaches have not attempted to distinguish between the
complexities intrinsic to a task and the conventions used by a partner, and
more generally there has been little focus on leveraging conventions for

teases apart rule-dependent representation from convention-dependent

coordinate with old partners on new tasks in a zero-shot manner. We
experimentally validate our approach on three collaborative tasks varying in

a simple CTC project layer without many complicated forward calculations of the

sight of this, we propose a fast 3D beam training strategy to jointly realize
the angle estimation and the beamforming. Specifically, we first develop a
novel hierarchical codebook that predefines some codewords (including narrow
beams and wide beams) stage by stage. The narrow beams are designed as the
beamforming solution candidates, whereas the wide beams are designed for
reducing the training complexity. Then, we propose a 3D beam training procedure
to find the optimal beamforming solution, i.e., the optimal narrow-beam pair,
in a fast manner. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme.

recalibrate the MRS measurements throughout the electron decay period,
temporally-resolved LRS measurements of the local gas density were performed
over the event duration. Local gas density was measured to be 30% of the

splines (TPS) into FAT, thus creating Spatial FAT, which is the first method
that can transfer geometric attributes in addition to color and texture.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the

(1) ensuring high-fidelity color transfer; (2) allowing for geometric
transformation of facial parts; (3) handling facial variations (such as poses
and shadows) and (4) supporting high-resolution face generation.

which entails filling in a blank within an expression to make it true. Solving
these tasks with deep learning requires that the neural model learn how to

systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). Motivated by AVs that operate in
both day and night, we study multimodal object detection with RGB and thermal
cameras, since the latter provides much stronger object signatures under poor
illumination. We explore strategies for fusing information from different
modalities. Our key contribution is a probabilistic ensembling technique,
ProbEn, a simple non-learned method that fuses together detections from
multi-modalities. We derive ProbEn from Bayes' rule and first principles that
assume conditional independence across modalities. Through probabilistic
marginalization, ProbEn elegantly handles missing modalities when detectors do
not fire on the same object. Importantly, ProbEn also notably improves
multimodal detection even when the conditional independence assumption does not
hold, e.g., fusing outputs from other fusion methods (both off-the-shelf and
trained in-house). We validate ProbEn on two benchmarks containing both aligned
(KAIST) and unaligned (FLIR) multimodal images, showing that ProbEn outperforms
prior work by more than 13% in relative performance!

rotation cycle, rough surface, temperature dependent thermal parameters, as
well as contributions of sunlight reflection to observations, hence being able
to produce precise temperature distribution and thermal emission of airless
small bodies regarding the variations in orbital time scales. Details of the
physics, mathematics and numerical algorithms of RSTPM are presented. When used
to interpret multi-epoch thermal lightcurves by WISE/NEOWISE, RSTPM can give
constraints on the spin orientation and surface physical properties, like mean
thermal inertia or mean size of dust grains, roughness fraction, albedo and so
on via radiometric procedure. As an application example, we apply this model to
the main-belt object (24) Themis, the largest object of the Themis family,
which is believed to be the source region of many main-belt comets. We find
multi-epoch (2010, 2014-2018) observations of Themis by WISE/NEOWISE, yielding
18 thermal lightcurves. By fitting these data with RSTPM, best-fit spin
orientation of Themis is derived to be ($\lambda=137^\circ$, $\beta=59^\circ$)
in ecliptic coordinates, the mean radius of dust grains on the surface is
estimated to be $\tilde{b}=140^{+500}_{-114}(6\sim640)~\mu$m, indicating the
surface thermal inertia to vary from $\sim3\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$ to
$\sim60\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$ due to seasonal temperature variation.
Further analysis found that thermal light curves of Themis show a weak
rotation-phase dependent feature, indicative of heterogeneous thermal
properties or imperfections of lightcurve inversion shape model.

pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars and identify the appropriate model of tau_c for

strengths of the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT; lambda 8498, 8542, 8662 A)

have N_R < 10^{-1.0} and show R' \sim 10^{-4.2} as large as the maximum R' of
the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars. However, because all R' was saturated
against N_R, it was not possible to estimate the appropriate tau_c model for
the PMS stars. We noticed that Mg I emission lines at 8808 A is an optically
thin chromospheric line, appropriate for determination of the adequate tau_c
for PMS stars. Using the archive data of the Anglo-Australian Telescope
(AAT)/the University College London Echelle Spectrograph (UCLES), we
investigated the Mg I line of 52 ZAMS stars. After subtracting photospheric
absorption component, the Mg I line is detected as an emission line in 45 ZAMS

saturated yet in ""the saturated regime for the Ca II emission lines"", i.e.
10^{-1.6} < N_R < 10^{-0.8}. Therefore, the adequate tau_c for PMS stars can be

involves assigning a quantum state to an individual system at some time,
conditioned on the results of continuous observations. The quality of the
estimation depends on how much observed information is used and on how
optimality is defined for the estimate. In this work, we consider problems of
quantum state estimation where some of the measurement records are not
available, but where the available records come from both before (past) and
after (future) the estimation time, enabling better estimates than is possible
using the past information alone. Past-future information for quantum systems
has been used in various ways in the literature, in particular, the quantum
state smoothing, the most-likely path, and the two-state vector and related
formalisms. To unify these seemingly unrelated approaches, we propose a
framework for partially-observed quantum system with continuous monitoring,
wherein the first two existing formalisms can be accommodated, with some
generalization. The unifying framework is based on state estimation with
expected cost minimization, where the cost can be defined either in the space
of the unknown record or in the space of the unknown true state. Moreover, we
connect all three existing approaches conceptually by defining five new cost
functions, and thus new types of estimators, which bridge the gaps between
them. We illustrate the applicability of our method by calculating all seven
estimators we consider for the example of a driven two-level system
dissipatively coupled to bosonic baths. Our theory also allows connections to
classical state estimation, which create further conceptual links between our
quantum state estimators.

each iteration, the next iterate is obtained by moving along the negative
gradient with a stepsize and then projecting the resulted point onto the
weighted $\ell_{1}$ ball to approximate the $\ell_{p}$ ball. Specifically, if
the current iterate is in the interior of the feasible set, then the weighted
$\ell_{1}$ ball is formed by linearizing the $\ell_{p}$ norm at the current
iterate. If the current iterate is on the boundary of the feasible set, then
the weighted $\ell_{1}$ ball is formed differently by keeping those zero

the generated iterates converge to a first-order stationary point. Numerical

a growing desire to understand how and why such black-box methods perform
prediction. Much work has focused on understanding what part of the input
pattern (an image, say) is responsible for a particular class being predicted,
and how the input may be manipulated to predict a different class. We focus
instead on understanding which of the internal features computed by the neural
net are responsible for a particular class. We achieve this by mimicking part
of the neural net with an oblique decision tree having sparse weight vectors at
the decision nodes. Using the recently proposed Tree Alternating Optimization
(TAO) algorithm, we are able to learn trees that are both highly accurate and
interpretable. Such trees can faithfully mimic the part of the neural net they
replaced, and hence they can provide insights into the deep net black box.
Further, we show we can easily manipulate the neural net features in order to
make the net predict, or not predict, a given class, thus showing that it is
possible to carry out adversarial attacks at the level of the features. These
insights and manipulations apply globally to the entire training and test set,
not just at a local (single-instance) level. We demonstrate this robustly in
the MNIST and ImageNet datasets with LeNet5 and VGG networks.

the non-trivial ternary relations of the ASTs were sets of ordered triples of
pairwise distinct points of the underlying set left invariant by the group; and
the given permutation group was a subgroup of automorphisms of the AST. In this
paper, we consider ASTs that do not necessarily admit 2-transitive groups as
automorphism groups but instead a transitive cyclic subgroup of the symmetric
group acts as automorphisms. Such ASTs are called circulant ASTs and the
corresponding ternary relations are called circulant relations. We give a
complete characterisation of circulant ASTs in terms of AST-regular partitions
of the underlying set. We also show that a special type of circulant, that we

  Electronic Health Record Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has been of tremendous utility in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare such as predicting future clinical
events. These tasks, however, often come with many challenges when using
classical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including class
imbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To
address some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting
contrastive learning framework and proposes a novel contrastive regularized
clinical classification model. The contrastive loss is found to substantially
augment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the
similar/dissimilar patterns (by its ""push-and-pull"" form), meanwhile mitigating
the highly skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces
(as also echoed by recent findings). In particular, when naively exporting the
contrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in generating positive
samples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data.
To this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies
specifically tailored for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that
exploits the feature space neighborhood structure to reinforce the feature
learning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates
pre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity. Both
sampling approaches are designed with an awareness of unique high intra-class
variance in EHR data. Our overall framework yields highly competitive
experimental results in predicting the mortality risk on real-world COVID-19
EHR data with a total of 5,712 patients admitted to a large, urban health
system. Specifically, our method reaches a high AUROC prediction score of
0.959, which outperforms other baselines and alternatives: cross-entropy(0.873)

payment channel is one of the most prominent approaches. With payment channels
and the network they construct, two users can move some transactions off-chain
in a predetermined duration to avoid expensive and time-consuming on-chain
settlements. Existing work is devoted to designing high-throughput payment
channel networks (PCNs) or efficient PCN routing policies to reduce the fee. In
this paper, we investigate the PCN routing from a different perspective by
answering whether the routing fee of transactions can be saved by being a bit
more patient. The key idea is to reorder the processing sequence of atomic
transactions, other than to handle each of them separately and immediately. We
present two mechanisms, one is periodic transaction processing assisted by a
PCN broker and the other is purely strategic waiting. In the former, all the
incoming transactions in a short time interval are processed collectively. We
formulate an optimization model to minimize their total routing fee and derive
the optimal permutation of processing transactions as well as the routing
policy for each of them. A Shapley value based scheme is presented to
redistribute the benefit of reordering among the transactions efficiently and
fairly. In the latter, we model the waiting time of a strategic transaction on
a single payment channel as the first passage time problem in queueing theory
when the transaction value is higher than the edge capacity upon its arrival.
By capturing the capacity dynamics, we are able to calculate the recursive
expression of waiting for time distribution that is useful to gauge a user's
cost of patience. Experimental results manifest that our cost redistribution
mechanism can effectively save routing fees for all the transactions, and the
waiting time distribution coincides with the model well.

open-set discrimination are: 1) discriminatively learning an open-vs-closed
binary discriminator by exploiting some outlier data as the open-set, and 2)
unsupervised learning the closed-set data distribution with a GAN, using its
discriminator as the open-set likelihood function. However, the former
generalizes poorly to diverse open test data due to overfitting to the training
outliers, which are unlikely to exhaustively span the open-world. The latter
does not work well, presumably due to the instable training of GANs. Motivated
by the above, we propose OpenGAN, which addresses the limitation of each
approach by combining them with several technical insights. First, we show that
a carefully selected GAN-discriminator on some real outlier data already
achieves the state-of-the-art. Second, we augment the available set of real
open training examples with adversarially synthesized ""fake"" data. Third and

Additionally, a transient searching algorithm has been executed on the

enabled identification of a wide variety of transient classes, ranging from
human-made radio-frequency interference to genuine astrophysical events.
Observations at the frequency 159.4 MHz and higher in a single coarse channel
(0.926 MHz) were made with 2s time resolution, and multiple nights were
analysed. Despite having modest sensitivity (~few Jy/beam), using a single
coarse channel and 2-s imaging, the system detected bright transients from PSR

being due to a combination of refractive and diffractive scintillation or

curvature. If the curvature magnitude is larger than a resolution-dependent
threshold, it uses a neural network to yield a better approximation. Our
networks are multilayer perceptrons fitted to synthetic data sets composed of
sinusoidal- and circular-interface samples at various configurations. To reduce

determine the additional ingredients that must be added to the DIM to account
for the observed rebrightenings. We analyse in detail a recently discovered
system, TCP J21040470+4631129, which has shown very peculiar rebrightenings,
model its light curve using our numerical code including mass transfer
variations from the secondary, inner-disc truncation, disc irradiation by a hot
white dwarf and, in some cases, the mass-transfer stream over(under)flow. We
show that the luminosity in quiescence is dominated by a hot white dwarf that
cools down on time scales of months. The mass transfer rate from the secondary
has to increase by several orders of magnitudes during the initial
superoutburst for a reason that remains elusive, slowly returning to its
secular average, causing the observed succession of outbursts with increasing
quiescence durations, until the disc can be steady, cold, and neutral; its
inner parts being truncated either by the white dwarf magnetic field or by
evaporation. The very short, quiescence phases between reflares are reproduced
when the mass-transfer stream overflows the disc. Using similar additions to
the DIM, we have also produced light curves close to those observed in two WZ
Sge stars, the prototype and EG Cnc. Our model successfully explains the
reflares observed in WZ Sge systems. It requires, however, the inner disc
truncation in dwarf novae to be due not (only) to the white dwarf magnetic
field but, as in X-ray binaries, rather to evaporation of the inner disc. A
similar model could also explain reflares observed in soft X-ray transients.

imaging scanning tunneling microscopy and first principles calculations.
Monolayer NbSe2 surprisingly displays two types of Star-of-David (SD) motifs

variation. And, bilayer 1T-NbSe2 shows Mott collapse by interlayer coupling.
Our calculation unveils the two types of SDs possess distinct structural

Our calculation suggests the Mott gap, the same parameter for determining the

near-term quantum computation. In such algorithms, a parameterized quantum
circuit is controlled via a classical optimization method that seeks to
minimize a problem-dependent cost function. Although such algorithms are
powerful in principle, the non-convexity of the associated cost landscapes and
the prevalence of local minima means that local optimization methods such as
gradient descent typically fail to reach good solutions. In this work we
suggest a method to improve gradient-based approaches to variational quantum
circuit optimization, which involves coupling the output of the quantum circuit
to a classical neural network. The effect of this neural network is to peturb
the cost landscape as a function of its parameters, so that local minima can be
escaped or avoided via a modification to the cost landscape itself. We present
two algorithms within this framework and numerically benchmark them on small
instances of the Max-Cut optimization problem. We show that the method is able
to reach deeper minima and lower cost values than standard gradient descent
based approaches. Moreover, our algorithms require essentially the same number
of quantum circuit evaluations per optimization step as the standard approach
since, unlike the gradient with respect to the circuit, the neural network
updates can be estimated in parallel via the backpropagation method. More
generally, our approach suggests that relaxing the cost landscape is a fruitful
path to improving near-term quantum computing algorithms.

two-dimensional ($L^{}_x\times L^{}_y$) assembly of magnetic nanoparticles as a
function of dipolar interaction strength $h^{}_d$, temperature $T$, aspect
ratio $A^{}_r=L^{}_y/L^{}_x$, and the applied alternating magnetic field's
direction. In the absence of magnetic interaction ($h^{}_d\approx0$) and
thermal fluctuations ($T=0$ K), the hysteresis follows the Stoner and Wohlfarth
model, as expected. For weak dipolar interaction and substantial temperature,
the hysteresis has the dominance of superparamagnetic behaviour, irrespective
of the applied magnetic field's direction and $A^{}_r$. Interestingly, the
hysteresis curve has all the characteristics of antiferromagnetic interaction
dominance for $A^{}_r\leq6$ and considerable dipolar interaction strength
($h^{}_d>0.2)$, which is independent of applied magnetic direction. When the
magnetic field is applied along the system's shorter axis ($x$-direction), a
non-hysteresis straight line is observed with large $h^{}_d$. In the case of
the magnetic field applied along the long axis of the sample ($y$-direction),
ferromagnetic interaction dominates the hysteresis for large $h^{}_d$ and
$A^{}_r>6$. Irrespective of $h^{}_d$ and applied magnetic field's direction,
the coercive field $\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ and remanence $M^{}_r$ are minimal for
$A^{}_r\leq6$ and significant temperature. They are found to increase with
$h^{}_d$ when $A^{}_r$ is enormous. Remarkably, the variation of hysteresis
loop area $E^{}_H$ as a function of these parameters is the same as that of the
coercive field variation. We believe that the concepts presented in this work
are relevant in various technological applications such as spintronics and
magnetic hyperthermia, in which such self-assembled nanoparticle arrays are
ubiquitous.

most remarkable properties of MW. The cold accretion theory for the
cosmological gas accretion provides one viable explanation to this phenomenon.
In this scenario, the rapid cold-mode accretion in the early epoch creates the
first generation stars relatively rich in $\alpha$-elements(O,Mg,Si,S,Ca,etc)
and later cooling flow produces iron-rich second generation stars, creating the
bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio. We employ a cosmologically motivated
chemical evolution model for disc galaxies to elucidate the role played by type
Ia supernovae (SNIa), which serve as the major source of iron, in the creation
of the bimodality. To this end, we divide SNIa into two groups, those formed
from the 1st generation stars (the first SNIa) and those formed from the 2nd
generation stars (the second SNIa). The model with the first SNIa suppressed
during the {\it second} star formation stage produces stars having high
[$\alpha$/Fe] in the early phase of this stage, whereas the model which
prohibits the second SNIa produces high [$\alpha$/Fe] stars in the late phase.
Both models fail to create a well-defined bimodality. We thus conclude that the
cooperation of the first and the second SNIa plays a crucial role in creating
the bimodality by maintaining rich iron content in the interstellar gas
throughout the second star formation stage.

  Here, it is shown that amplitude modulation AM-KPFM, which is by far the most
common KPFM measurement mode, is not suitable to measure workfunction
variations at GBs on rough samples, such as Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and CH3NH3PbI3. This
is a direct consequence of a change in the cantilever-sample distance that
varies on rough samples.
  Furthermore, we critically discuss the impact of different environments (air

  Frequency modulation FM-KPFM measurements on non-air-exposed CIGSe and

inspection systems. In order to detect defects, supervised learning is often
utilized, but necessitates a large amount of annotated images, which can be
costly: collecting, cleaning, and annotating the data is tedious and limits the
speed at which a system can be deployed as everything the system must detect
needs to be observed first. This can impede the inspection of rare defects,
since very few samples can be collected by the manufacturer. In this work, we
focus on simulations to solve this issue. We first present a generic simulation
pipeline to render images of defective or healthy (non defective) parts. As
metallic parts can be highly textured with small defects like holes, we design
a texture scanning and generation method. We assess the quality of the
generated images by training deep learning networks and by testing them on real
data from a manufacturer. We demonstrate that we can achieve encouraging
results on real defect detection using purely simulated data. Additionally, we
are able to improve global performances by concatenating simulated and real
data, showing that simulations can complement real images to boost
performances. Lastly, using domain adaptation techniques helps improving
slightly our final results.

reinforcement learning (RL) to recommendation systems (RS). In this paper, we
summarize three key practical challenges of large-scale RL-based recommender
systems: massive state and action spaces, high-variance environment, and the
unspecific reward setting in recommendation. All these problems remain largely
unexplored in the existing literature and make the application of RL
challenging. We develop a model-based reinforcement learning framework, called
GoalRec. Inspired by the ideas of world model (model-based), value function
estimation (model-free), and goal-based RL, a novel disentangled universal
value function designed for item recommendation is proposed. It can generalize
to various goals that the recommender may have, and disentangle the stochastic
environmental dynamics and high-variance reward signals accordingly. As a part
of the value function, free from the sparse and high-variance reward signals, a
high-capacity reward-independent world model is trained to simulate complex
environmental dynamics under a certain goal. Based on the predicted
environmental dynamics, the disentangled universal value function is related to
the user's future trajectory instead of a monolithic state and a scalar reward.
We demonstrate the superiority of GoalRec over previous approaches in terms of
the above three practical challenges in a series of simulations and a real
application.

relative to the Galactic center. Many, perhaps most, of these hyper-velocity
stars (HVSs) are B stars, similar to the disk and S stars in a nuclear cluster
around a super-massive black hole (SMBH) near $\rm Sgr~A^{\star}$. In the paper
I of this series, we showed that the eccentricity of the stars emerged from a
hypothetical disk around the SMBH can be rapidly excited by the secular
perturbation of its intermediate-mass companion (IMC), and we suggested IRS 13E
as a potential candidate for the IMC. Here, we show that this process leads to
an influx of stars on parabolic orbits to the proximity of $\rm Sgr~A^{\star}$
on a secular timescale of a few Myr. This timescale is much shorter than the
diffusion timescale into the lost cone through either the classical or the
resonant relaxation. Precession of the highly-eccentric stars' longitude of
periastron, relative to that of the IMC, brings them to its proximity within a
few Myr. The IMC's gravitational perturbation scatters a fraction of the stars
from nearly parabolic to hyperbolic orbits, with respect to the SMBH. Their
follow-up close encounters with the SMBH induce them to escape with
hyper-velocity. This scenario is a variant of the hypothesis proposed by Hills
based on the anticipated breakup of some progenitor binary stars in the
proximity of the SMBH, and its main objective is to account for the limited
lifespan of the known HVSs. We generalize our previous numerical simulations of
this process with a much wider range of orbital configurations. We demonstrate
the robustness and evaluate the efficiency of this channel of HVS formation.
From these numerical simulations, we infer observable kinematic properties for
the HVSs.

pressure-temperature phase diagram beyond the Doniach one in CeCuP2. At ambient
pressure, CeCuP2 displays typical heavy-fermion behavior, albeit with a very
low carrier density. With lowering temperature, it shows a crossover from a non

coherence temperature decreases with increasing pressure, opposite to that in
most Ce-based heavy fermion compounds. Upon further compression, two
superconducting phases are revealed. At 48.0 GPa, the transition temperature
reaches 6.1 K, the highest among all Ce-based heavy fermion superconductors. We
argue for possible roles of valence tuning and fluctuations associated with its
special crystal structure in addition to the hybridization effect. These
unusual phase diagrams suggest that CeCuP2 is a novel platform for studying the

bidding process, one phase in the game is to select two skat cards, whose
quality may influence subsequent playing performance drastically. This paper
looks into different skat selection strategies. Besides predicting the
probability of winning and other hand strength functions we propose hard
expert-rules and a scoring functions based on refined skat evaluation features.
Experiments emphasize the impact of the refined skat putting algorithm on the
playing performance of the bots, especially for AI bidding and AI game
selection.

most widely used method for defending against adversarial attacks. It has also
been extended to defend against universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs). The
SOTA universal adversarial training (UAT) method optimizes a single

that a UAP does not attack all classes equally. Inspired by this observation,
we identify it as the source of the model having unbalanced robustness. To this
end, we improve the SOTA UAT by proposing to utilize class-wise UAPs during

superior performance for both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness against

becomes highly desired to develop an automatic evaluation approach that
correlates well with human perception while not requiring ground truth data. In
this paper, we use self-supervised pre-trained models for MOS prediction. We
show their representations can distinguish between clean and noisy audios.
Then, we fine-tune these pre-trained models followed by simple linear layers in
an end-to-end manner. The experiment results showed that our framework
outperforms the two previous state-of-the-art models by a significant
improvement on Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 and achieves comparable or
superior performance on Voice Conversion Challenge 2016. We also conducted an
ablation study to further investigate how each module benefits the task. The
experiment results are implemented and reproducible with publicly available

  Matching","25 pages",,,,"cs.DB cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The task of calculating similarities between strings held by different
organizations without revealing these strings is an increasingly important
problem in areas such as health informatics, national censuses, genomics, and
fraud detection. Most existing privacy-preserving string comparison functions
are either based on comparing sets of encoded character q-grams, allow only
exact matching of encrypted strings, or they are aimed at long genomic
sequences that have a small alphabet. The set-based privacy-preserving
similarity functions commonly used to compare name and address strings in the
context of privacy-preserving record linkage do not take the positions of
sub-strings into account. As a result, two very different strings can
potentially be considered as an exact match leading to wrongly linked records.
Existing set-based techniques also cannot identify the length of the longest
common sub-string across two strings. In this paper we propose a novel approach
for accurate and efficient privacy-preserving string matching based on suffix
trees that are encoded using chained hashing. We incorporate a hashing based
encoding technique upon the encoded suffixes to improve privacy against
frequency attacks such as those exploiting Benford's law. Our approach allows
various operations to be performed without the strings to be compared being
revealed: the length of the longest common sub-string, do two strings have the
same beginning, middle or end, and the longest common sub-string similarity
between two strings. These functions allow a more accurate comparison of, for
example, bank account, credit card, or telephone numbers, which cannot be
compared appropriately with existing privacy-preserving string matching
techniques. Our evaluation on several data sets with different types of strings
validates the privacy and accuracy of our proposed approach.

Although
in recent years a large number of binaries have been proven to host exoplanets,
how planet formation proceeds in multiple stellar systems has not been studied
much yet from the theoretical standpoint. In this paper we focus on the
evolution of the dust grains in planet-forming discs in binaries. We take into
account the dynamics of gas and dust in discs around each component of a binary
system under the hypothesis that the evolution of the circumprimary and the
circumsecondary discs is independent. It is known from previous studies that
the secular evolution of the gas in binary discs is hastened due to the tidal
interactions with their hosting stars. Here we prove that binarity affects dust
dynamics too, possibly in a more dramatic way than the gas. In particular, the
presence of a stellar companion significantly reduces the amount of solids
retained in binary discs because of a faster, more efficient radial drift,
ultimately shortening their lifetime. We prove that how rapidly discs disperse
depends both on the binary separation, with discs in wider binaries living
longer, and on the disc viscosity. Although the less-viscous discs lose high
amounts of solids in the earliest stages of their evolution, they are
dissipated slowly, while those with higher viscosities show an opposite
behaviour. The faster radial migration of dust in binary discs has a striking
impact on planet formation, which seems to be inhibited in this hostile
environment, unless other disc substructures halt radial drift further in. We
conclude that if planetesimal formation were viable in binary discs, this
process would take place on very short time scales.

their assumptions, therefore leading to similar but different expressions.
Here, we revisit the derivation of the GT equation to clarify the system
definition, corresponding thermodynamic ensemble, and assumptions made along
the way. We also discuss the role of the thermodynamic conditions in the
external reservoir on the final result. We then turn to numerical simulations
of a model system to compute independently the various terms entering in the GT

temperatures determined under confinement by means of hyper-parallel tempering
grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. We highlight some difficulties related
to the sampling of crystallization under confinement in simulations. Overall,
despite its limitations, the GT equation may provide an interesting alternative
route to predict the melting temperature in large pores, using molecular
simulations to evaluate the relevant quantities entering in this equation. This
approach could for example be used to investigate the nanoscale capillary
freezing of ionic liquids recently observed experimentally between the tip of

design aspects, connectivity properties and network-layer inter-dependencies
are still poorly understood. In this work, we set out to fill this gap and
study the most important overlay network structural properties and robustness
to targeted attacks of seven distinct BC networks. In particular, we probe and
crawl these BC networks every two hours to gather information about all their
available peers, over a duration of 28 days. We analyze 335 network snapshots
per BC network, for a total of 2345 snapshots. We construct, at frequent
intervals, connectivity graphs for each BC network, consisting of all potential
connections between peers. We analyze the structural graph properties of these
networks and compare them across the seven BC networks. We also study how these
properties associate with the resilience of each network to partitioning
attacks, i.e., when peers are selected, attacked and taken offline, using
different selection strategies driven by the aforementioned structural
properties. In fact, we show that by targeting fewer than 10 highly-connected
peers, major BCs such as Bitcoin can be partitioned into disjoint, i.e.,
disconnected, components. Finally, we uncover a hidden interconnection between
different BC networks, where certain peers participate in more than one BC
network, which has serious implications for the robustness of the overall BC

computer vision. By focusing on a discrete set of objects or image regions,
these mechanisms identify the most relevant features and use them to build more
powerful representations. Recently, continuous-domain alternatives to discrete
attention models have been proposed, which exploit the continuity of images.
These approaches model attention as simple unimodal densities (e.g. a
Gaussian), making them less suitable to deal with images whose region of
interest has a complex shape or is composed of multiple non-contiguous patches.
In this paper, we introduce a new continuous attention mechanism that produces
multimodal densities, in the form of mixtures of Gaussians. We use the EM
algorithm to obtain a clustering of relevant regions in the image, and a
description length penalty to select the number of components in the mixture.
Our densities decompose as a linear combination of unimodal attention
mechanisms, enabling closed-form Jacobians for the backpropagation step.
Experiments on visual question answering in the VQA-v2 dataset show competitive
accuracies and a selection of regions that mimics human attention more closely
in VQA-HAT. We present several examples that suggest how multimodal attention
maps are naturally more interpretable than their unimodal counterparts, showing
the ability of our model to automatically segregate objects from ground in
complex scenes.

algorithms that can continually learn new concepts from a few data points,
without forgetting knowledge of old classes. The difficulty lies in that
limited data from new classes not only lead to significant overfitting issues
but also exacerbate the notorious catastrophic forgetting problems. Moreover,
as training data come in sequence in FSCIL, the learned classifier can only
provide discriminative information in individual sessions, while FSCIL requires
all classes to be involved for evaluation. In this paper, we address the FSCIL
problem from two aspects. First, we adopt a simple but effective decoupled
learning strategy of representations and classifiers that only the classifiers
are updated in each incremental session, which avoids knowledge forgetting in
the representations. By doing so, we demonstrate that a pre-trained backbone
plus a non-parametric class mean classifier can beat state-of-the-art methods.
Second, to make the classifiers learned on individual sessions applicable to
all classes, we propose a Continually Evolved Classifier (CEC) that employs a
graph model to propagate context information between classifiers for
adaptation. To enable the learning of CEC, we design a pseudo incremental
learning paradigm that episodically constructs a pseudo incremental learning
task to optimize the graph parameters by sampling data from the base dataset.
Experiments on three popular benchmark datasets, including CIFAR100,
miniImageNet, and Caltech-USCD Birds-200-2011 (CUB200), show that our method
significantly outperforms the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results

link, while at the same time using the harvested power to multicast the
backhauled information over the radio frequency (RF) links to multiple ground
users (GUs). We derive the UAV's achievable MC rate under the Poisson point

and the UAV altitude, we maximize the system-level energy efficiency (EE),

robots have to be created with novel materials, or be robust to internal or
external changes. In order to create robots automatically, without the need for
human intervention, it is necessary to optimise both the behaviour and the body
design of the robot. However, when co-optimising the morphology and controller
of a locomoting agent the morphology tends to converge prematurely, reaching a
local optimum. Approaches such as explicit protection of morphological
innovation have been used to reduce this problem, but it might also be possible
to increase exploration of morphologies using a more indirect approach. We
explore how changing the environment, where the agent locomotes, affects the
convergence of morphologies. The agents' morphologies and controllers are
co-optimised, while the environments the agents locomote in are evolved
open-endedly with the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET). We compare the
diversity, fitness and robustness of agents evolving in environments generated
by POET to agents evolved in handcrafted curricula of environments. Our agents
each contain of a population of individuals being evolved with a genetic
algorithm. This population is called the agent-population. We show that
agent-populations evolving in open-endedly evolving environments exhibit larger
morphological diversity than agent-populations evolving in hand crafted
curricula of environments. POET proved capable of creating a curriculum of
environments which encouraged both diversity and quality in the populations.
This suggests that POET may be capable of reducing premature convergence in
co-optimisation of morphology and controllers.

speed limit, number of lanes, permitted travel modes), the algorithm also
captures minor roads usually favoured by pedestrians and cyclists, along with
road attributes such as bicycle-specific infrastructure, traffic signals, and
road gradient. Furthermore, it simplifies the network's complex geometries and
merges parallel roads if applicable to make it suitable for large-scale

it to create a network representation for Greater Melbourne, Australia and
compared the output with a network created using an existing transport
simulation toolkit along with another network from an existing city-scale
transport model from the Victorian government. Through simulation experiments
with these networks, we illustrated that our algorithm achieves a very good
balance between simulation accuracy and run-time. For routed trips on our
network for walking and cycling it is of comparable accuracy to the common

while being more than two times faster when used for simulating different

that consist of a large number of characters and has attracted a lot of
attention in recent years. However, existing methods for font generation are
often in supervised learning. They require a large number of paired data, which
is labor-intensive and expensive to collect. Besides, common image-to-image
translation models often define style as the set of textures and colors, which
cannot be directly applied to font generation. To address these problems, we
propose novel deformable generative networks for unsupervised font generation
(DGFont). We introduce a feature deformation skip connection (FDSC) which
predicts pairs of displacement maps and employs the predicted maps to apply
deformable convolution to the low-level feature maps from the content encoder.
The outputs of FDSC are fed into a mixer to generate the final results. Taking
advantage of FDSC, the mixer outputs a high-quality character with a complete
structure. To further improve the quality of generated images, we use three
deformable convolution layers in the content encoder to learn style-invariant
feature representations. Experiments demonstrate that our model generates
characters in higher quality than state-of-art methods. The source code is

to recognize rare classes in the presence of frequent classes. To address
unbalanced data, most studies try balancing the data, the loss, or the
classifier to reduce classification bias towards head classes. Far less
attention has been given to the latent representations learned with unbalanced
data. We show that the feature extractor part of deep networks suffers greatly
from this bias. We propose a new loss based on robustness theory, which
encourages the model to learn high-quality representations for both head and
tail classes. While the general form of the robustness loss may be hard to
compute, we further derive an easy-to-compute upper bound that can be minimized
efficiently. This procedure reduces representation bias towards head classes in
the feature space and achieves new SOTA results on CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT,
and iNaturalist long-tail benchmarks. We find that training with robustness
increases recognition accuracy of tail classes while largely maintaining the
accuracy of head classes. The new robustness loss can be combined with various
classifier balancing techniques and can be applied to representations at
several layers of the deep model.

interesting phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density waves,
topological states and ferromagnetism, but direct evidence for
antiferromagnetism in the monolayer has been lacking. Nevertheless,
antiferromagnets have attracted enormous interest recently in spintronics due
to the absence of stray fields and their terahertz resonant frequency. Despite
the great advantages of antiferromagnetic spintronics, controlling and
detecting N\'eel vectors have been limited in bulk materials. In this work, we
developed a sensitive second harmonic generation (SHG) microscope and detected
long-range N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and N\'eel vector switching
down to the monolayer in MnPSe$_3$. Temperature-dependent SHG measurement in
repetitive thermal cooling surprisingly collapses into two curves, which
correspond to the switching of an Ising type N\'eel vector reversed by the
time-reversal operation, instead of a six-state clock ground state expected
from the threefold rotation symmetry in the structure. We imaged the spatial
distribution of the N\'eel vectors across samples and rotated them by an
arbitrary angle irrespective of the lattice in the sample plane by applying
strain. By studying both a Landau theory and a microscopic model that couples
strain to nearest-neighbor exchange, we conclude that the phase transition of
the XY model in the presence of strain falls into the Ising universality class
instead of the XY one, which could explain the extreme strain tunability.
Finally, we found that the 180{\deg} AFM domain walls are highly mobile down to
the monolayer after thermal cycles, paving the way for future control of the
antiferromagnetic domains by strain or external fields on demand for
ultra-compact 2D AFM terahertz spintronics.

systems to study the photovoltaic characteristics of intrinsic 2D out-of-plane

photoelectric properties by changing the strength of ferroelectric
polarization. Due to the spatial inversion symmetry broken caused by special 3R
stacking, spontaneous OOP ferroelectric polarization will appear in the 3R
bilayer BX, which can be swichable through a specific interlayer sliding. The
OOP ferroelectricity leads to charge transfer between layers, realizes
efficient spatial separation between holes and electrons, and forms the
characteristics of type-II band alignment. Moreover, due to perfect lattice
match on account of two identical layers, the 3R bilayer BX is more stable and
easy to realize in experiments than most of traditional 2D heterostructures
made up of different materials. The 3R bilayer BX shows moderate band gap,
ultra-high carrier mobility and efficient optical absorption, and its
nano-devices present large photocurrent, high photon responsivity and excellent
external quantum efficiency. More importantly, all these photoelectric
parameters depend on the intrinsic OOP ferroelectric strength. By changing the
interlayer distance of bilayer BX, the ferroelectric polarization can be

compensate geometric and chromatic aberrations. This poses high constraints on
the optical hash or low cost applications. Although one can utilize algorithmic
reconstruction to remove the artifacts of low-end lenses, the degeneration from
optical aberrations is spatially varying and the computation has to trade off
efficiency for performance. For example, we need to conduct patch-wise
optimization or train a large set of local deep neural networks to achieve high
reconstruction performance across the whole image. In this paper, we propose a
PSF aware plug-and-play deep network, which takes the aberrant image and PSF
map as input and produces the latent high quality version via incorporating
lens-specific deep priors, thus leading to a universal and flexible optical
aberration correction method. Specifically, we pre-train a base model from a
set of diverse lenses and then adapt it to a given lens by quickly refining the
parameters, which largely alleviates the time and memory consumption of model
learning. The approach is of high efficiency in both training and testing
stages. Extensive results verify the promising applications of our proposed
approach for compact low-end cameras.

analysis. Electrostatic ion-acoustic waves are the common wave emissions
observed between the local electron and proton plasma frequency in the soler
wind. The occurrence rate of ion-acoustic waves peaks around perihelion at

local proton moments and magnetic field are highly variable. A more detailed

frequency at about 3 kHz and wave amplitude about 2.5 mV/m. The wave amplitude
varies as 1/R^(1.38) with the heliocentric distance. The relative phase
distribution between two components of the E-field shows a mostly linear wave
polarization. Electric field fluctuations are closely aligned with the
directions of the ambient field lines. Only a small number (3%) of ion-acoustic

potential as a sublimable lead-free ferroelectric. However, studies on
ferroelectric properties of its thin films are only in their early stages and
its capability to be incorporated in nanoscale devices is unknown. In this
work, we demonstrate, upon ferroelectric switching at the nanoscale, stable and
enduring room temperature polarization with no leakage current in Croconic Acid
thin films. We thus show that it is a promising lead-free organic ferroelectric
toward integration in nanoscale devices. The challenging switching current and
polarization reversal characterization at the nanoscale was done using a unique
combination of piezoresponse force microscopy, polarization switching current
spectroscopy and the concurrent electromechanical strain response. Indeed, this
combination can help to rationalize otherwise asymmetric polarization-voltage
data and distorted hysteresis due to current jumps below the background noise,
which are statistically washed away in macrojunctions but become prevalent at
the nanoscale. These results are valid irrespective of the ferroelectrics'
nature, organic or inorganic. Beyond the potential of Croconic Acid as an

Zeeman width, thwarting the application of the WFA. Furthermore, we have

techniques, one can easily estimate relative camera poses between image pairs

supervised framework LIFE to train a neural network for estimating accurate
lighting-invariant flows between image pairs. Sparse correspondences are
conventionally established via feature matching with descriptors encoding local
image contents. However, local image contents are inevitably ambiguous and
error-prone during the cross-image feature matching process, which hinders
downstream tasks. We propose to guide feature matching with the flows predicted
by LIFE, which addresses the ambiguous matching by utilizing abundant context
information in the image pairs. We show that LIFE outperforms previous flow
learning frameworks by large margins in challenging scenarios, consistently
improves feature matching, and benefits downstream tasks.

only a handful of galaxies at high redshift (z>4) have been examined in such a
way. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program to
INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) survey observed a statistically
significant sample of 118 star-forming main sequence galaxies at z=4.4-5.9 in
[CII]158um emission, increasing the number of such observations by nearly 10x.
A preliminary qualitative classification of these sources revealed a diversity
of kinematic types (i.e., rotators, mergers, and dispersion-dominated systems).
In this work, we supplement the initial classification by applying quantitative
analyses to the ALPINE data: a tilted ring model (TRM) fitting code (3DBarolo),
a morphological classification (Gini-M20), and a set of disk identification
criteria. Of the 75 [CII]-detected ALPINE galaxies, 29 are detected at
sufficient significance and spatial resolution to allow for TRM fitting and the
derivation of morphological and kinematic parameters. These 29 sources
constitute a high-mass subset of the ALPINE sample (M_*>10^9.5Msol). We
robustly classify 14 of these sources (six rotators, five mergers, and three
dispersion-dominated systems); the remaining sources showing complex behaviour.
By exploring the G-M20 of z>4 rest-frame FIR and [CII] data for the first time,
we find that our 1""~6kpc resolution data alone are insufficient to separate
galaxy types. We compare the rotation curves and dynamical mass profiles of the
six ALPINE rotators to the two previously detected z~4-6 unlensed main sequence
rotators, finding high rotational velocities (~50-250km/s) and a diversity of
rotation curve shapes.

information of direct coordinate regression, and has revolutionized the task of
face alignment. Yet it suffers from quantization errors caused by neglecting
subpixel coordinates in image resizing and network downsampling. In this paper,
we first quantitatively analyze the quantization error on benchmarks, which
accounts for more than 1/3 of the whole prediction errors for state-of-the-art
methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Heatmap In Heatmap(HIH)
representation and a coordinate soft-classification (CSC) method, which are
seamlessly integrated into the classic hourglass network. The HIH
representation utilizes nested heatmaps to jointly represent the coordinate
label: one heatmap called integer heatmap stands for the integer coordinate,
and the other heatmap named decimal heatmap represents the subpixel coordinate.
The range of a decimal heatmap makes up one pixel in the corresponding integer
heatmap. Besides, we transfer the offset regression problem to an interval
classification task, and CSC regards the confidence of the pixel as the
probability of the interval. Meanwhile, CSC applying the distribution loss
leverage the soft labels generated from the Gaussian distribution function to
guide the offset heatmap training, which makes it easier to learn the
distribution of coordinate offsets. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HIH can achieve state-of-the-art
results. In particular, our HIH reaches 4.08 NME (Normalized Mean Error) on
WFLW, and 3.21 on COFW, which exceeds previous methods by a significant margin.

is less concentrated than that of Br$\gamma$, presenting a radius that contains
half of the flux 60% greater, on average. The H$_2$ emission is driven by
thermal processes - X-ray heating and shocks - at most locations for all
galaxies, where $0.4<H_2/Br\gamma<6$. For regions where H$_2$/Br$\gamma>6$
(seen in 40% of the galaxies), shocks are the main H$_2$ excitation mechanism,
while in regions with H$_2$/Br$\gamma<0.4$ (25% of the sample) the H$_2$

smaller in type 1 than in type 2 due to a larger contribution to the continuum

to resolve certain discrepancies between theory and observation (e.g. angular
momentum transport), but such fields are difficult to detect and characterise.
Asteroseismology is a powerful technique for inferring the internal structures
of stars by measuring their oscillation frequencies, and succeeds particularly
with evolved stars, owing to their mixed modes, which are sensitive to the deep
interior. The goal of this work is to present a phenomenological study of the
combined effects of rotation and magnetism in evolved stars, where both are
assumed weak enough that first-order perturbation theory applies, and we focus
on the regime where Coriolis and Lorentz forces are comparable. Axisymmetric
""twisted-torus"" field configurations are used, which are confined to the core
and allowed to be misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. Factors such as
the field radius, topology and obliquity are examined. We observe that fields
with finer-scale radial structure and/or smaller radial extent produce smaller
contributions to the frequency shift. The interplay of rotation and magnetism
is shown to be complex: we demonstrate that it is possible for nearly symmetric
multiplets of apparently low multiplicity to arise even under a substantial
field, which might falsely appear to rule out its presence. Our results suggest
that proper modelling of rotation and magnetism, in a simultaneous fashion, may
be required to draw robust conclusions about the existence/non-existence of a
core magnetic field in any given object.

  with the GrabCut for Real-Time UAV Tracking",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based tracking is attracting increasing
attention and developing rapidly in applications such as agriculture, aviation,
navigation, transportation and public security. Recently, discriminative
correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers have stood out in UAV tracking
community for their high efficiency and appealing robustness on a single CPU.
However, due to limited onboard computation resources and other challenges the
efficiency and accuracy of existing DCF-based approaches is still not
satisfying. In this paper, we explore using segmentation by the GrabCut to
improve the wildly adopted discriminative scale estimation in DCF-based
trackers, which, as a mater of fact, greatly impacts the precision and accuracy
of the trackers since accumulated scale error degrades the appearance model as
online updating goes on. Meanwhile, inspired by residue representation, we
exploit the residue nature inherent to videos and propose residue-aware
correlation filters that show better convergence properties in filter learning.
Extensive experiments are conducted on four UAV benchmarks, namely,
UAV123@10fps, DTB70, UAVDT and Vistrone2018 (VisDrone2018-test-dev). The
results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

slower than in EJS. By further quantifying the degree of overlap between

OVL from a chondritic isotopic mixing model of Earth and Mars, which indicates
that the giant planets are likely to have resided on more circular orbits than

performance, this paper considers bootstrap-based inference for interval
estimation and testing. Specifically, for a wide class of point process models
we consider a novel bootstrap scheme labeled 'fixed intensity bootstrap' (FIB),
where the conditional intensity is kept fixed across bootstrap repetitions. The
FIB, which is very simple to implement and fast in practice, extends previous
ideas from the bootstrap literature on time series in discrete time, where the
so-called 'fixed design' and 'fixed volatility' bootstrap schemes have shown to
be particularly useful and effective. We compare the FIB with the classic
recursive bootstrap, which is here labeled 'recursive intensity bootstrap'
(RIB). In RIB algorithms, the intensity is stochastic in the bootstrap world
and implementation of the bootstrap is more involved, due to its sequential
structure. For both bootstrap schemes, we provide new bootstrap (asymptotic)
theory which allows to assess bootstrap validity, and propose a
'non-parametric' approach based on resampling time-changed transformations of
the original waiting times. We also establish the link between the proposed
bootstraps for point process models and the related autoregressive conditional
duration (ACD) models. Lastly, we show effectiveness of the different bootstrap
schemes in finite samples through a set of detailed Monte Carlo experiments,
and provide applications to both financial data and social media data to
illustrate the proposed methodology.

Systems of Tightly-Packed Inner Planets (STIPs) via {\it in situ} formation and
growth of the planets. It predicts that a pebble ring is established at the
pressure maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB) with an
inner disk magnetorotational instability (MRI)-active region. Using direct
$N$-body simulations, we study the collisional evolution of planetesimals
formed from such a pebble ring, in particular examining whether a single
dominant planet emerges. We consider a variety of models, including some in
which the planetesimals are continuing to grow via pebble accretion. We find
that the planetesimal ring undergoes oligarchic evolution, and typically turns
into 2 or 3 surviving oligarchs on nearly coplanar and circular orbits,
independent of the explored initial conditions or form of pebble accretion. The
most massive oligarchs typically consist of about $70\%$ of the total mass,
with the building-up process typically finishing within $\sim 10^5$ years.
However, a relatively massive secondary planet always remains with
$\sim30-65\%$ of the mass of the primary. Such secondary planets have
properties that are inconsistent with the observed properties of the innermost
pairs of planets in STIPs. Thus, for IOPF to be a viable theory for STIP
formation, it needs to be shown how oligarchic growth of a relatively massive
secondary from the initial pebble ring can be avoided. We discuss some
potential additional physical processes that should be included in the modeling
and explored as next steps.

reduce the multivalued consensus problem to the one of binary consensus, e.g.,
Mostefaoui-Raynal-Tronel and Zhang-Chen.
  Our study aims at the design of an even more reliable solution. We do so
through the lenses of self-stabilization -- a very strong notion of
fault-tolerance. In addition to node and communication failures,
self-stabilizing algorithms can recover after the occurrence of arbitrary
transient-faults; these faults represent any violation of the assumptions
according to which the system was designed to operate (as long as the algorithm

gains research interest due to the observed large open-circuit voltage. The

crystallized with multiphase coexistence. Hence, the computational difficulty
in building a multi-phase system restricts the detailed photovoltaic studies
through phenomenological and shift current theory. In this work, ferroelectric
Ba$_{1- x}$(Bi$_{0.5}$K$_{0.5}$)$_x$TiO$_3$ (BBKT) oxide is designed to
crystallize in single-phase tetragonal symmetry with improved polarization
characteristics, and it is found to exhibits large PV response. Both
experimental and theoretical studies on BBKT samples reveal ~18% reduction in
bandgap compared to the parent BaTiO$_3$. Short-circuit current measured as a
function of light intensity and light polarization angle reveal linear and
sinusoidal response, respectively. The observed features are in accordance with
phenomenological theory. Remarkably, x = 0.125 sample displays ~8 times higher
open-circuit voltage (7.39 V) than the parent compound. The enhanced PV effect
is attributed to the large shift current along z-direction as evidenced from
the additional charge-center shift of valence band occupied by O-2p orbital and
conduction band occupied by Bi-6p orbital. Notably, the degenerate Bi-p$_z$
state at conduction band minimum in BBKT favours the large shift current
response in the z-direction.

Entropy consuming trajectories of the particles are related to specific

Gramineae, belonging to cold season turfgrass, but has poor disease resistance.
Up to now, little is known about the induced systemic resistance (ISR)
mechanism, especially the relevant functional proteins, which is important to
disease resistance of turfgrass. Achieving more information of proteins of
infected creeping bentgrass is helpful to understand the ISR mechanism.
Results: With BDO treatment, creeping bentgrass seedlings were grown, and the
ISR response was induced by infecting Rhizoctonia solani. High-quality protein
sequences of creeping bentgrass seedlings were obtained. Some of protein
sequences were functionally annotated according to the database alignment while
a large part of the obtained protein sequences was left non-annotated. To treat
the non-annotated sequences, a prediction model based on convolutional neural
network was established with the dataset from Uniport database in three domains
to acquire good performance, especially the higher false positive control rate.
With established model, the non-annotated protein sequences of creeping
bentgrass were analyzed to annotate proteins relevant to disease-resistance
response and signal transduction. Conclusions: The prediction model based on
convolutional neural network was successfully applied to select good candidates
of the proteins with functions relevant to the ISR mechanism from the protein
sequences which cannot be annotated by database alignment. The waste of
sequence data can be avoided, and research time and labor will be saved in
further research of protein of creeping bentgrass by molecular biology
technology. It also provides reference for other sequence analysis of turfgrass
disease-resistance research.

that in certain regimes, internal waves in the gas centrifuge have the same

air filled centrifuge with a radius of circa 50 cm, the optimal rotational
frequency for realistic atmosphere-like waves is around 10 000 rounds per
minute. Using gases of lower heat capacities at constant pressure, like xenon,
the rotational frequencies can be even halved to obtain the same results.
Similar to the atmosphere, it is feasible in the gas centrifuge to generate a
clear scale separation of wave frequencies and therefore phase speeds between
acoustic waves and internal waves. In addition to the centrifugal force, the
Coriolis force acts in the same plane. However, its influence on axially
homogeneous internal waves appears only as a higher-order correction. We
conclude that the gas centrifuge provides an unprecedented opportunity to

tighter bounds. Our study suggests that the isotropic flux is an extremely
promising target for future missions in improving the sensitivity to PBHs as

better diagnose cases of shortcut learning. These cases happen when a model
exploits spurious statistical regularities to produce correct answers but does
not actually deploy the desired behavior. There is a need to identify possible
shortcuts in a dataset and assess their use before deploying a model in the
real world. The research community in VQA has focused exclusively on
question-based shortcuts, where a model might, for example, answer ""What is the
color of the sky"" with ""blue"" by relying mostly on the question-conditional
training prior and give little weight to visual evidence. We go a step further
and consider multimodal shortcuts that involve both questions and images. We
first identify potential shortcuts in the popular VQA v2 training set by mining
trivial predictive rules such as co-occurrences of words and visual elements.
We then introduce VQA-CounterExamples (VQA-CE), an evaluation protocol based on
our subset of CounterExamples i.e. image-question-answer triplets where our
rules lead to incorrect answers. We use this new evaluation in a large-scale
study of existing approaches for VQA. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art
models perform poorly and that existing techniques to reduce biases are largely
ineffective in this context. Our findings suggest that past work on
question-based biases in VQA has only addressed one facet of a complex issue.

However, due to limited human cognitive capability, a human cannot
simultaneously monitor multiple robots and identify the abnormal ones, largely
limiting the efficiency of the human-MRS collaboration. There is an urgent need
to proactively reduce unnecessary human engagements and further reduce human
cognitive loads. Human trust in human MRS collaboration reveals human
expectations on robot performance. Based on trust estimation, the work between
a human and MRS will be reallocated that an MRS will self-monitor and only
request human guidance in critical situations. Inspired by that, a novel
Synthesized Trust Learning (STL) method was developed to model human trust in
the collaboration. STL explores two aspects of human trust (trust level and
trust preference), meanwhile accelerates the convergence speed by integrating
active learning to reduce human workload. To validate the effectiveness of the
method, tasks ""searching victims in the context of city rescue"" were designed

was conducted to generate real human trust feedback. The results showed that by
maximally utilizing human feedback, the STL achieved higher accuracy in trust

recent works focus on producing disturbances of the environment. Existing
approaches of the literature to generate meaningful disturbances of the

the problem as a two-player game between the protagonist agent, which learns to
perform a task in an environment, and the adversary agent, which learns to
disturb the protagonist via modifications of the considered environment. Both
protagonist and adversary are trained with deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Alternatively, we propose in this paper to build on gradient-based
adversarial attacks, usually used for classification tasks for instance, that
we apply on the critic network of the protagonist to identify efficient
disturbances of the environment. Rather than learning an attacker policy, which
usually reveals as very complex and unstable, we leverage the knowledge of the
critic network of the protagonist, to dynamically complexify the task at each
step of the learning process. We show that our method, while being faster and
lighter, leads to significantly better improvements in policy robustness than
existing methods of the literature.

wide array of biological and engineering processes. Recent advances in
experimental, theoretical, and numerical techniques have provided access into a
world full of nonlinear physics, yet most of our quantitative understanding to
date has been centered on a spherically symmetric description of the cavitation
process. However, cavitation bubble growth and collapse rarely occur in a
perfectly symmetrical fashion, particularly in soft materials. Predicting the
onset of dynamically arising, non-spherical instabilities has remained a
significant, unresolved challenge in part due to the additional constitutive
complexities introduced by the surrounding nonlinear viscoelastic solid. Here,
we provide a new theoretical model capable of accurately predicting the onset
of non-spherical instability shapes of a bubble in a soft material by
explicitly accounting for all pertinent nonlinear interactions between the
fluid-like cavitation bubble and the solid-like surroundings. Comparison
against high-resolution experimental images from laser-induced cavitation
events in a polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogel show excellent agreement.
Interestingly, and consistent with experimental findings, our model predicts
the emergence of various dynamic instability shapes for hoop stretch ratios
greater than one in contrast to most quasi-static investigations. Our new
theoretical framework not only provides unprecedented insight into the
cavitation dynamics in a soft solid, but it also provides a quantitative means
of interpreting bubble dynamics relevant to a wide array of engineering and
medical applications as well as natural phenomena.

and carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). They are classified into
two types: intrinsic or extrinsic, based on the presence or absence of
technetium (Tc). The Tc-rich or intrinsic S stars are thermally-pulsing
(TP-)AGB stars internally producing s-process elements (including Tc) which are
brought to their surface via the third dredge-up (TDU). Tc-poor or extrinsic S
stars gained their s-process overabundances via accretion of s-process-rich
material from an AGB companion which has since turned into a dim white dwarf.
Our goal is to investigate the evolutionary status of Tc-rich S stars by
locating them in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram using the results of Gaia
early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We combine the current sample of 13 Tc-rich stars
with our previous studies of 10 Tc-rich stars to determine the observational
onset of the TDU in the metallicity range [-0.7; 0]. We also compare our
abundance determinations with dedicated AGB nucleosynthesis predictions. The
stellar parameters are derived using an iterative tool which combines HERMES
high-resolution spectra, accurate Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, stellar evolution
models and tailored MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Using these
stellar parameters we determine the heavy-element abundances by line synthesis.
In the HR diagram, the intrinsic S stars are located at higher luminosities
than the predicted onset of the TDU. These findings are consistent with Tc-rich
S stars being genuinely TP-AGB stars. The comparison of the derived s-process
abundance profiles of our intrinsic S stars with the nucleosynthesis
predictions provide an overall good agreement. Stars with highest [s/Fe] tend
to have the highest C/O ratios.

classification tasks in deep learning, aiming to improve the performance of a

regression with a scalar response variable has been rarely studied, and there
exists no KD method applicable to both classification and regression tasks yet.
Moreover, existing KD methods often require a practitioner to carefully select
or adjust the teacher and student architectures, making these methods less
flexible in practice. To address the above problems in a unified way, we
propose a comprehensive KD framework based on cGANs, termed cGAN-KD.
Fundamentally different from existing KD methods, cGAN-KD distills and
transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model via cGAN-generated
samples. This novel mechanism makes cGAN-KD suitable for both classification
and regression tasks, compatible with other KD methods, and insensitive to the
teacher and student architectures. An error bound for a student model trained
in the cGAN-KD framework is derived in this work, providing a theory for why
cGAN-KD is effective as well as guiding the practical implementation of
cGAN-KD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 show that we can
combine state of the art KD methods with the cGAN-KD framework to yield a new
state of the art. Moreover, experiments on Steering Angle and UTKFace
demonstrate the effectiveness of cGAN-KD in image regression tasks, where

Yet, the integration of prosumers in the energy market imposes new
considerations in designing unified and sustainable frameworks for efficient
use of the power and communication infrastructure. Furthermore, several issues
need to be tackled to adequately promote the adoption of decentralized
renewable-oriented systems, such as communication overhead, data privacy,
scalability, and sustainability.
  In this article, we present the different aspects and challenges to be
addressed for building efficient energy trading markets in relation to
communication and smart decision-making. Accordingly, we propose a multi-level
pro-decision framework for prosumer communities to achieve collective goals.
Since the individual decisions of prosumers are mainly driven by individual
self-sufficiency goals, the framework prioritizes the individual prosumers'
decisions and relies on the 5G wireless network for fast coordination among
community members. In fact, each prosumer predicts energy production and
consumption to make proactive trading decisions as a response to
collective-level requests. Moreover, the collaboration of the community is
further extended by including the collaborative training of prediction models
using Federated Learning, assisted by edge servers and prosumer home-area
equipment. In addition to preserving prosumers' privacy, we show through
evaluations that training prediction models using Federated Learning yields
high accuracy for different energy resources while reducing the communication
overhead.

One of their unique features is the synthesis, that could be performed by the
crystallization from the solution. This method is fast, but practically
couldn't be optimized due to the strongly non-equilibrium conditions of crystal
growth. Another quality limitation is the typical incorporation of organic
solvent molecules into crystals when perovskite crystallization is performed
from solution with organic solvent. Here we report an alternative method of
perovskite single crystal growth based on the counterdiffusion of reagents in
the gel medium. This counterdiffusion-in-gel crystallization (CGC) method is
based on the difference of solubility between perovskites and lead halide in
the corresponding halide acid, HX. The difference of solubility between
perovskites and lead halide leads to the formation of perovskite single
crystals of sufficiently large size with an excellent optical quality at
constant room temperature. Particularly, here we report the growth of MAPbI3
and MAPbBr3 halide perovskite single crystals (MA = CH3NH3+) by the
counterdiffusion of the organic-solvent-free reagents in the U-tube filled with
the silica gel. Their photoluminescence spectra recorded at 4 K demonstrate the
excitonic resonances with the full width < 2.5 meV, which proves their
excellent optical quality. The proposed method can be used in fabrication of
high-quality halide perovskite single crystals for both fundamental research,

SMPL-X bodies fit to 3D scans as well as poses from AMASS, which we refine to
ensure good contact. Second, we leverage this to create the Mimic-The-Pose
(MTP) dataset of images, collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, containing
people mimicking the 3DCP poses with selfcontact. Third, we develop a novel HPS
optimization method, SMPLify-XMC, that includes contact constraints and uses
the known 3DCP body pose during fitting to create near ground-truth poses for
MTP images. Fourth, for more image variety, we label a dataset of in-the-wild

optimization method, SMPLify-DC, that exploits discrete contacts during pose
optimization. Finally, we use our datasets during SPIN training to learn a new

We show that the new self-contact training data significantly improves 3D human

making them attractive for safety-critical applications. Such scenarios demand
that GP decisions are not only accurate, but also robust to perturbations. In
this paper we present a framework to analyse adversarial robustness of GPs,
defined as invariance of the model's decision to bounded perturbations. Given a
compact subset of the input space $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, a point $x^*$ and
a GP, we provide provable guarantees of adversarial robustness of the GP by
computing lower and upper bounds on its prediction range in $T$. We develop a
branch-and-bound scheme to refine the bounds and show, for any $\epsilon > 0$,
that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to values $\epsilon$-close to the
actual values in finitely many iterations. The algorithm is anytime and can
handle both regression and classification tasks, with analytical formulation
for most kernels used in practice. We evaluate our methods on a collection of
synthetic and standard benchmark datasets, including SPAM, MNIST and
FashionMNIST. We study the effect of approximate inference techniques on
robustness and demonstrate how our method can be used for interpretability. Our
empirical results suggest that the adversarial robustness of GPs increases with

classification of known traffic is a well investigated subject with supervised
classification tools (such as ML and DL models) are known to provide
satisfactory performance, detection of unknown (or zero-day) traffic is more
challenging and typically handled by unsupervised techniques (such as
clustering algorithms).
  In this paper, we share our experience on a commercial-grade DL traffic
classification engine that is able to (i) identify known applications from
encrypted traffic, as well as (ii) handle unknown zero-day applications. In
particular, our contribution for (i) is to perform a thorough assessment of
state of the art traffic classifiers in commercial-grade settings comprising
few thousands of very fine grained application labels, as opposite to the few
tens of classes generally targeted in academic evaluations. Additionally, we
contribute to the problem of (ii) detection of zero-day applications by
proposing a novel technique, tailored for DL models, that is significantly more
accurate and light-weight than the state of the art.
  Summarizing our main findings, we gather that (i) while ML and DL models are
both equally able to provide satisfactory solution for classification of known
traffic, however (ii) the non-linear feature extraction process of the DL
backbone provides sizeable advantages for the detection of unknown classes.

speed measured from an anemometer on the turbine's nacelle. Unfortunately, the
measured wind speed from such a single measurement point does not give a good
representation of the effective wind speed over the blades, as it does not take
the varying wind condition within the entire rotor area into account. As such,
Blade Effective Wind Speed (BEWS) estimation can be seen as a more accurate
alternative. This paper introduces a novel Subspace Predictive Repetitive
Estimator (SPRE) approach to estimate the BEWS using blade load measurements.
In detail, the azimuth-dependent cone coefficient is firstly formulated to
describe the mapping between the out-of-plane blade root bending moment and the
wind speed over blades. Then, the SPRE scheme, which is inspired by Subspace
Predictive Repetitive Control (SPRC), is proposed to estimate the BEWS. Case
studies exhibit the proposed method's effectiveness at predicting BEWS and
identifying wind shear in varying wind speed conditions. Moreover, this novel
technique enables complicated wind inflow conditions, where a rotor is impinged
and overlapped by wake shed from an upstream turbine, to be estimated.

conditional independence structure of a set of random variables. Circular
variables are special variables, characterized by periodicity, arising in
several contexts and fields. However, models for studying the
dependence/independence structure of circular variables are under-explored.
This paper analyses three multivariate circular distributions, the von Mises,
the Wrapped Normal and the Inverse Stereographic distributions, focusing on
their properties concerning conditional independence. For each one of these
distributions, we discuss the main properties related to conditional
independence and introduce suitable classes of graphical models. The usefulness
of the proposed models is shown by modelling the conditional independence among
dihedral angles characterizing the three-dimensional structure of some

the time evolution of the two-nucleon wave function is strongly impacted by the

possesses what has come to be known as `weather regimes', loosely categorised
as regions of phase space with above-average density and/or extended
persistence. Their existence and behaviour has been extensively studied in
meteorology and climate science, due to their potential for drastically
simplifying the complex and chaotic mid-latitude dynamics. Several well-known,
simple non-linear dynamical systems have been used as toy-models of the
atmosphere in order to understand and exemplify such regime behaviour.
Nevertheless, no agreed-upon and clear-cut definition of a `regime' exists in
the literature. We argue here for an approach which equates the existence of
regimes in a dynamical system with the existence of non-trivial topological
structure of the system's attractor. We show using persistent homology, an
algorithmic tool in topological data analysis, that this approach is
computationally tractable, practically informative, and identifies the relevant
regime structure across a range of examples.

experiments with categorical variables. This study improves parts of the theory
underlying the use of contingency tables. Specifically, the linkage
disequilibrium parameter as a measure of two-way interactions applied to
three-way tables makes it possible to quantify Simpsons paradox by a simple
formula. With tests on three-way interactions, there is only one that
determines whether the partial interactions of all variables agree or whether
there is at least one variable whose partial interactions disagree. To date,
there has been no test available that determines whether the partial
interactions of a certain variable agree or disagree, and the presented work
closes this gap. This work reveals the relation of the multiplicative and the
additive measure of a three-way interaction. Another contribution addresses the
question of which cells in a contingency table are fixed when the first- and
second-order marginal totals are given. The proposed procedure not only detects
fixed zero counts but also fixed positive counts. This impacts the
determination of the degrees of freedom. Furthermore, limitations of methods
that simulate contingency tables with given pairwise associations are
addressed.

observables could be sensitive to the underlying physics beyond the SM to which
$a_\mu$ may be pointing. While from the effective field theory (EFT) point of
view no direct correlations exist, this changes in specific new physics models.
In particular, in the case of explanations involving heavy new particles above

evade exclusion limits from direct searches, correlations with other
observables sensitive to EW symmetry breaking are expected. Such scenarios can
be classified according to the $SU(2)_L$ representations and the hypercharges

video captioning method can be used in many applications. However, this paper
focuses on one application: video captioning for fostering and facilitating
physical activities. In broad terms, the work can be considered to be assistive
technology. Lack of physical activity appears to be increasingly widespread in
many nations due to many factors, the most important being the convenience that
technology has provided in workplaces. The adopted sedentary lifestyle is
becoming a significant public health issue. Therefore, it is essential to
incorporate more physical movements into our daily lives. Tracking one's daily
physical activities would offer a base for comparison with activities performed
in subsequent days. With the above in mind, this paper proposes a video
captioning framework that aims to describe the activities in a video and
estimate a person's daily physical activity level. This framework could
potentially help people trace their daily movements to reduce an inactive
lifestyle's health risks. The work presented in this paper is still in its
infancy. The initial steps of the application are outlined in this paper. Based
on our preliminary research, this project has great merit.

heat transport contributions of the large-scale plume ejecting versus plume
impacting zones in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. Based on direct
numerical simulations of the two dimensional (2-D) problem, we show the
existence of a crossover in the wall heat transport from initially impacting
dominated to ultimately ejecting dominated at a Rayleigh number of $Ra\approx 3
\times 10^{11}$. This is consistent with the trends observed in 3-D convection
at lower Ra, and we therefore expect a similar crossover to also occur there.
We identify the development of a turbulent mixing zone, connected to thermal
plume emission, as the primary mechanism for the crossover. The mixing zone
gradually extends vertically and horizontally, therefore becoming more and more
dominant for the overall heat transfer.

carried out on UT 2017 April 11 and 15, shortly after its April 4 outburst.
These measurements of HCN, CS, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and HNC (along with continuum
emission from dust) probed the inner coma of C/2015 ER61, revealing asymmetric
outgassing and discerning parent from daughter/distributed source species. This
work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra,
production rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule, and a stringent
upper limit for CO. HCN is consistent with direct nucleus release in C/2015
ER61, whereas CS, H$_2$CO, HNC, and potentially CH$_3$OH are associated with
distributed sources in the coma. Adopting a Haser model, parent scale lengths
determined for H$_2$CO (L$_p$ $\sim$ 2200 km) and HNC (L$_p$ $\sim$ 3300 km)
are consistent with previous work in comets, whereas significant extended
source production (L$_p$ $\sim$ 2000 km) is indicated for CS, suggesting
production from an unknown parent in the coma. The continuum presents a
point-source distribution, with a flux density implying an excessively large
nucleus, inconsistent with other estimates of the nucleus size. It is best
explained by the thermal emission of slowly-moving outburst ejectas, with total
mass 5--8 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ kg. These results demonstrate the power of the ACA

disentanglement learning. However, unlike the independence assumption,
interpretability has rarely been exploited to encourage disentanglement in the
unsupervised setting. In this paper, we examine the interpretability of
disentangled representations by investigating two questions: where to be
interpreted and what to be interpreted? A latent code is easily to be
interpreted if it would consistently impact a certain subarea of the resulting
generated image. We thus propose to learn a spatial mask to localize the effect
of each individual latent dimension. On the other hand, interpretability
usually comes from latent dimensions that capture simple and basic variations
in data. We thus impose a perturbation on a certain dimension of the latent
code, and expect to identify the perturbation along this dimension from the
generated images so that the encoding of simple variations can be enforced.
Additionally, we develop an unsupervised model selection method, which
accumulates perceptual distance scores along axes in the latent space. On
various datasets, our models can learn high-quality disentangled
representations without supervision, showing the proposed modeling of
interpretability is an effective proxy for achieving unsupervised
disentanglement.

vehicle (AV) community to develop vehicle control systems and test
environments. A key requirement for simulation-based development and
verification is determinism, since a deterministic process will always produce
the same output given the same initial conditions and event history. Thus, in a
deterministic simulation environment, tests are rendered repeatable and yield
simulation results that are trustworthy and straightforward to debug. However,
game engines are seldom deterministic. This paper reviews and identifies the
potential causes of non-deterministic behaviours in game engines. A case study
using CARLA, an open-source autonomous driving simulation environment powered
by Unreal Engine, is presented to highlight its inherent shortcomings in
providing sufficient precision in experimental results. Different
configurations and utilisations of the software and hardware are explored to
determine an operational domain where the simulation precision is sufficiently
low i.e.\ variance between repeated executions becomes negligible for
development and testing work. Finally, a method of a general nature is
proposed, that can be used to find the domains of permissible variance in game
engine simulations for any given system configuration.

different environmental stimuli. To date, many modeling research has focused on
the crawling-based Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) cells migration induced by
chemotaxis, yet recent experimental results reveal that even without adhesion
or contact to a substrate, Dd cells can still swim to follow chemoattractant
signals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to investigate the
chemotaxis induced amoeboid cell swimming dynamics. A minimal swimming system
consists of one deformable Dd amoeboid cell and a dilute suspension of
bacteria, and the bacteria produce chemoattractant signals that attract the Dd
cell. We use the mathematical amoeba model to generate Dd cell deformation and
solve the resulting low Reynolds number flows, and use a moving mesh based
finite volume method to solve the reaction-diffusion-convection equation. Using
the computational model, we show that chemotaxis guides a swimming Dd cell to
follow and catch bacteria, while on the other hand, bacterial rheotaxis may
help the bacteria to escape from the predator Dd cell.

is a need to use compression methods to store, manage or transfer them better

resolution. This technique stimulates human vision and divides regions in
pictures into two different parts, including the area of interest that needs
more detail and periphery parts with less detail. This results in better
compression. The variable resolution was used for image, video, and 3D motion
data compression. This paper investigates the mentioned technique and some

(OTOC) is a significant new tool within the framework of quantum field theory,
which now-a-days is treated as a measure of random fluctuations. In this paper,
by following the canonical quantization technique, we demonstrate a
computational method to quantify the two different types of cosmological
auto-correlated OTO functions during the epoch when the non-equilibrium
features dominates in primordial cosmology. In this formulation, two distinct
dynamical time scales are involved to define the quantum mechanical operators
arising from the cosmological perturbation scenario. We have provided detailed
explanation regarding the necessity of this new formalism to quantify any
random events generated from quantum fluctuations in primordial cosmology. We
have performed an elaborative computation for the two types of two-point and
four-point auto-correlated OTO functions in terms of the cosmological
perturbation field variables and its canonically conjugate momenta to quantify
random auto-correlations in the non-equilibrium regime. For both of the cases,
we found significantly distinguishable non-chaotic, but random, behaviour in
the OTO auto-correlations, which was not pointed out before in this type of
study. Finally, we have also demonstrated the classical limiting behaviour of
the mentioned two types of auto-correlated OTOC functions from the thermally
weighted phase-space averaged Poisson brackets, which we found to exactly match
the large time limiting behaviour of the auto-correlations in the super-horizon
regime of the cosmological scalar mode fluctuation.
