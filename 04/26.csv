  nanoparticles in aqueous environment","16 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.atm-clus physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Functionalized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed as promising
radiosensitizing agents for more efficient radiotherapy treatment using photons
and ion beams. Radiosensitizing properties of NPs may depend on many different
parameters (such as size, composition and density) of the metal core, organic
coatings and the molecular environment. A systematic exploration of each of
these parameters on the atomistic level remains a costly experimental task but
it can be addressed by means of advanced computational modeling. This paper
outlines a detailed computational procedure for the construction and
atomistic-level characterization of radiosensitizing metal NPs in explicit
molecular media. The procedure is general and extensible to many different
combinations of the core, coating and environment. As an illustrative and
experimentally relevant case study, we consider nanometre-sized gold NPs coated
with thiol-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine molecules of different length and
surface density and solvated in water at ambient conditions. Radial
distribution of different atoms in the coatings as well as distribution and
structural properties of water around the coated NPs are analyzed and linked to
radiosensitizing properties of the NPs. It is revealed that the structure of
the coating layer on the solvated NPs depends strongly on the surface density
of ligands. At surface densities below $\sim$3 molecules/nm$^{2}$ the coating
represents a mixture of different conformation states, whereas elongated
""brush""-like structures are formed at higher densities of ligands. The water
content in denser coatings is significantly lower at distances from 1 to 3 nm
from the gold surface depending on the length of ligands. Such dense and thick
coatings may suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals by low-energy
electrons emitted from the metal NPs and thus diminish their radiosensitizing
properties.

The main focus of the study is the determination of the material dependence of
the formation of electrical discharges in GEM-based detectors. For this task,
discharge probability measurements are conducted with several Thick GEM samples
using a basic electronics readout chain. In addition to that, optical
spectroscopy methods are employed to study the light emitted during discharges
from the different foils. It is observed that the light spectra of GEMs include
emission lines from the conductive layer material. This indicates the presence
of the foil material in the discharge plasma after the initial spark. However,
no lines associated with the coating material are observed while studying spark
discharges induced in Thick GEMs. It is concluded that the conductive layer
material does not play a substantial role in terms of stability against primary
discharges. However, a strong material dependence is observed in the case of
secondary discharge formation, pointing to molybdenum coating as the one
providing increased stability.

""General programming errors"", ""Poor security management"", ""Invalid

architected core structures for use as the core in composite sandwich
structures. A traditional foam core or honeycomb structure is lightweight and
stiff, but susceptible to permanent deformation when subjected to excessive
loading. Here we propose the use of an architected structure composed of arrays
of hollow truncated cone unit cells that dissipate energy and exhibit
structural recovery. These structures printed with a viscoelastic material rely
on buckling of their sidewalls to dissipate energy and snap-back to prevent
permanent deformation. We explore the mechanical response of these conical unit
cells in terms of their buckling strength and post-buckling stability
condition, and develop design maps for the same, by relating them to
non-dimensional geometric parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, where
$\alpha$ represents the slenderness of the curved sidewalls, $\beta$ is the
angle of the sidewall to the base, and $\gamma$ represents the curvature of the
sidewall. A validated finite element model is developed and used to investigate
the effect of these parameters. We see that the peak buckling load is directly
proportional to both $\alpha$ & $\beta$ and is not dependent on $\gamma$ when
the load is normalized by the volume of material in the curved sidewall.
Interestingly, the post-buckling stability is influenced by $\gamma$, or the
initial curvature of the sidewall, where a larger radius of curvature makes the
structure less susceptible to exhibit structural bistability. The structures
presented here are printed using a viscoelastic material, that causes them to
exhibit pseudo-bistability, or a time-delayed recovery. This allows the
structures to buckle and dissipate energy, and then recover to their original
configurations without the need for external stimuli or energy.

interpret black-box machine learning models, but their exact calculation is

the computation of Shapley values can be expressed as a summation over a set of
permutations, a common approach is to sample a subset of these permutations for
approximation. Unfortunately, standard Monte Carlo sampling methods can exhibit
slow convergence, and more sophisticated quasi-Monte Carlo methods have not yet
been applied to the space of permutations. To address this, we investigate new
approaches based on two classes of approximation methods and compare them
empirically. First, we demonstrate quadrature techniques in a RKHS containing
functions of permutations, using the Mallows kernel in combination with kernel
herding and sequential Bayesian quadrature. The RKHS perspective also leads to
quasi-Monte Carlo type error bounds, with a tractable discrepancy measure
defined on permutations. Second, we exploit connections between the hypersphere
$\mathbb{S}^{d-2}$ and permutations to create practical algorithms for
generating permutation samples with good properties. Experiments show the above

sample from the Walsh Spectrum of $f$. Using this, we obtain improved results
than what we obtain from the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and in turn it has
implications in resiliency checking. Furthermore, we use similar idea to obtain
a technique in estimating the cross-correlation (and thus autocorrelation)
value at any point, improving upon the existing algorithms. Finally, we tweak
the quantum algorithm with superposition of linear functions to obtain a
cross-correlation sampling technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first cross-correlation sampling algorithm with constant query complexity. This
also provides a strategy to check if two functions are uncorrelated of degree
$m$. We further modify this using Dicke states so that the time complexity
reduces, particularly for constant values of $m$.

presence of nuclear transitions between spin-orbit partners can be manifested
by the subsequent de-excitation via gamma ray emissions. The transition rates
can also be studied in the context of radiative axion absorption by a nucleus.
The elementary interaction is obtained in the context of the axion-quark
couplings predicted by existing axion models. Then these couplings will be
transformed to the nucleon level utilizing reasonable existing models, which
lead to effective transition operators. Using these operators we calculate the
needed nuclear matrix elements employing wave functions obtained in the context
of the nuclear shell model. With these ingredients, we discuss possibilities of
experimental observation of the axion-induced nuclear gamma-rays. In the second
part, we will examine the axion-induced production of X-rays (axion-photon
conversion) or ionization from deeply bound electron orbits. In this case, the
axion electron coupling is predicted by existing axion models, no
renormalization is needed. The experimental signal is the observation of
directly produced electrons and/or the emission of hard X-rays and Auger
electrons, following the de-excitation of the final atom. Critical discussion
is made on the experimental feasibility of detecting the solar axions by using

Obtaining precise lesion bounding boxes through automatic mining procedures,
however, is difficult. We provide here a quantitative evaluation of the effect
of bounding box coordinate noise on the performance of Faster R-CNN object
detection networks for breast mass detection. Varying degrees of noise are
simulated by randomly modifying the bounding boxes: in our experiments,
bounding boxes could be enlarged up to six times the original size. The noise
is injected in the CBIS-DDSM collection, a well curated public mammography
dataset for which accurate lesion location is available. We show how, due to an
imperfect matching between the ground truth and the network bounding box
proposals, the noise is propagated during training and reduces the ability of
the network to correctly classify lesions from background. When using the
standard Intersection over Union criterion, the area under the FROC curve
decreases by up to 9%. A novel matching criterion is proposed to improve
tolerance to noise.

  Experimentation: Guidance for Platforms",,,,,"stat.ME econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-sided marketplace platforms often run experiments to test the effect of
an intervention before launching it platform-wide. A typical approach is to
randomize individuals into the treatment group, which receives the
intervention, and the control group, which does not. The platform then compares
the performance in the two groups to estimate the effect if the intervention
were launched to everyone. We focus on two common experiment types, where the
platform randomizes individuals either on the supply side or on the demand
side. The resulting estimates of the treatment effect in these experiments are
typically biased: because individuals in the market compete with each other,
individuals in the treatment group affect those in the control group and vice
versa, creating interference. We develop a simple tractable market model to
study bias and variance in these experiments with interference. We focus on two
choices available to the platform: (1) Which side of the platform should it
randomize on (supply or demand)? (2) What proportion of individuals should be
allocated to treatment? We find that both choices affect the bias and variance
of the resulting estimators but in different ways. The bias-optimal choice of
experiment type depends on the relative amounts of supply and demand in the
market, and we discuss how a platform can use market data to select the
experiment type. Importantly, we find in many circumstances, choosing the
bias-optimal experiment type has little effect on variance. On the other hand,
the choice of treatment proportion can induce a bias-variance tradeoff, where
the bias-minimizing proportion increases variance. We discuss how a platform
can navigate this tradeoff and best choose the treatment proportion, using a
combination of modeling as well as contextual knowledge about the market, the
risk of the intervention, and reasonable effect sizes of the intervention.

we introduce a general framework built on top of what we call Vector Neuron

enable a simple mapping of SO(3) actions to latent spaces thereby providing a
framework for building equivariance in common neural operations -- including
linear layers, non-linearities, pooling, and normalizations. Due to their
simplicity, vector neurons are versatile and, as we demonstrate, can be
incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones, allowing them to

predict health conditions $-$ are evaluated with a variety of performance
metrics. An important first step in assessing the practical utility of a model
is to evaluate its average performance over an entire population of interest.
In many settings, it is also critical that the model makes good predictions
within predefined subpopulations. For instance, showing that a model is fair or
equitable requires evaluating the model's performance in different demographic
subgroups. However, subpopulation performance metrics are typically computed
using only data from that subgroup, resulting in higher variance estimates for
smaller groups. We devise a procedure to measure subpopulation performance that
can be more sample-efficient than the typical subsample estimates. We propose
using an evaluation model $-$ a model that describes the conditional
distribution of the predictive model score $-$ to form model-based metric (MBM)
estimates. Our procedure incorporates model checking and validation, and we
propose a computationally efficient approximation of the traditional
nonparametric bootstrap to form confidence intervals. We evaluate MBMs on two
main tasks: a semi-synthetic setting where ground truth metrics are available
and a real-world hospital readmission prediction task. We find that MBMs
consistently produce more accurate and lower variance estimates of model
performance for small subpopulations.

21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization
(z~30-6). In both interferometric and global signal experiments, systematic
calibration is the leading source of error. Though many aspects of calibration
have been studied, the overlap between the two types of instruments has
received less attention. We investigate the sky based calibration of total
power measurements with a HERA dish and an EDGES style antenna to understand
the role of auto-correlations in the calibration of an interferometer and the
role of sky in calibrating a total power instrument. Using simulations we study
various scenarios such as time variable gain, incomplete sky calibration model,
and primary beam model. We find that temporal gain drifts, sky model
incompleteness, and beam inaccuracies cause biases in the receiver gain
amplitude and the receiver temperature estimates. In some cases, these biases
mix spectral structure between beam and sky resulting in spectrally variable
gain errors. Applying the calibration method to the HERA and EDGES data, we
find good agreement with calibration via the more standard methods. Although
instrumental gains are consistent with beam and sky errors similar in scale to
those simulated, the receiver temperatures show significant deviations from
expected values. While we show that it is possible to partially mitigate biases
due to model inaccuracies by incorporating a time-dependent gain model in
calibration, the resulting errors on calibration products are larger and more
correlated. Completely addressing these biases will require more accurate sky
and primary beam models.

high-accuracy linear-response time-dependent density functional theory
calculations. In particular, the macroscopic dielectric response functions
$\bar\epsilon$ of both bulk CeO$_2$ and Ce$_2$O$_3$ are derived, which compare
remarkably well with the available experimental data. These results stress the
importance of appropriately accounting for local field effects to model the

evaluation of the momentum transfer dispersion from first-principles. In this
respect, by using a Mermin-type parametrization we are able to model the
contribution of different electronic excitations to the dielectric loss
function. Finally, from the knowledge of the electron inelastic mean free path,

built upon the standard single-stage object detector. Furthermore, an embedded
branch is introduced to generate the object's representation feature, and their

problems using adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) collocation. The method is
divided into several parts. First, a structure detection method is developed
that identifies switch times in the control and analyzes the corresponding
switching function for segments where the solution is either bang-bang or
singular. Second, after the structure has been detected, the domain is
decomposed into multiple domains such that the multiple-domain formulation
includes additional decision variables that represent the switch times in the
optimal control. In domains classified as bang-bang, the control is set to
either its upper or lower limit. In domains identified as singular, the
objective function is augmented with a regularization term to avoid the
singular arc. An iterative procedure is then developed for singular domains to
obtain a control that lies in close proximity to the singular control. The
method is demonstrated on four examples, three of which have either a bang-bang
and/or singular optimal control while the fourth has a smooth and nonsingular
optimal control. The results demonstrate that the method of this paper provides
accurate solutions to problems whose solutions are either bang-bang or singular
when compared against previously developed mesh refinement methods that are not
tailored for solving nonsmooth and/or singular optimal control problems, and
produces results that are equivalent to those obtained using previously

observational times. In particular, in astronomy there are a large number of
surveys that gather information over irregular time gaps and in more than one
passband. Some examples are Pan-STARRS, ZTF and also the LSST. However, current
commonly used time series models that estimate the time dependency in
astronomical light curves consider the information of each band separately
(e.g, CIAR, IAR and CARMA models) disregarding the dependency that might exist
between different passbands. In this paper we propose a novel bivariate model
for irregularly sampled time series, called the bivariate irregular
autoregressive (BIAR) model. The BIAR model assumes an autoregressive structure
on each time series, it is stationary, and it allows to estimate the
autocorrelation, the cross-correlation and the contemporary correlation between
two unequally spaced time series. We implemented the BIAR model on light
curves, in the g and r bands, obtained from the ZTF alerts processed by the
ALeRCE broker. We show that if the light curves of the two bands are highly
correlated, the model has more accurate forecast and prediction using the
bivariate model than a similar method that uses only univariate information.
Further, the estimated parameters of the BIAR are useful to characterize
LongPeriod Variable Stars and to distinguish between classes of stochastic
objects, providing promising features that can be used for classification
purposes

will discuss some of the existing constraints and potentially new ones with

The majority of existing fake news detection algorithms focus on mining news
content and/or the surrounding exogenous context for discovering deceptive

spread a piece of fake news or not is ignored. The confirmation bias theory has
indicated that a user is more likely to spread a piece of fake news when it
confirms his/her existing beliefs/preferences. Users' historical, social
engagements such as posts provide rich information about users' preferences
toward news and have great potential to advance fake news detection. However,
the work on exploring user preference for fake news detection is somewhat
limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study the novel problem of exploiting
user preference for fake news detection. We propose a new framework, UPFD,
which simultaneously captures various signals from user preferences by joint

this end, the paper first formalizes the COCO construction paradigm for
augmented continuation problems compatible with simultaneous analysis of
implicitly defined manifolds of solutions to nonlinear equations and the
corresponding adjoint variables associated with optimization of scalar
objective functions along such manifolds. The paper uses applications to data
assimilation from finite time histories and phase response analysis of periodic

during the gas phase of the protoplanetary disc. The phenomenon is also invoked
to explain resonant and near-resonant exoplanetary system structures. The early
inward migration may also have affected our Solar System and sculpted its
different minor planet reservoirs. In this study we explore how the early
inward migration of the giant planets shapes the Kuiper Belt. We test different
scenarios with only Neptune and Uranus and with all the four giant planets,
including also some models with the subsequent outward planetesimal-driven
migration of Neptune after the gas dispersal. We find objects populating mean
motion resonances even when Neptune and Uranus do not migrate at all or only
migrate inwards. When the planets are fixed, planetesimals stick only
temporarily to the mean motion resonances, while inwards migration yields a new
channel to populate the resonances without invoking convergent migration. In
these cases, however, it is hard to populate mean motion resonances that do not
cross the planetesimal disc (such as 2:1 and 5:2) and there is a lack of
resonant KBOs that cross Neptune's orbit. These Neptune crossers are an

position and the growth rate of Neptune matters for the contamination of the
classical Kuiper belt region from neighbouring regions. The eccentricity and
inclination space of the hot classicals and the scattered disc region become
much more populated when all the giant planets are included. The 5:2 resonance
with Neptune becomes increasingly populated with deeper inward migrations of
Neptune. The overall inclination distribution, however, is still narrower than
from observations, as is generally the case for Kuiper belt population models.

considered to model the advective transport and growth of sessile biomass and
the diffusive transport and conversion of soluble substrates. The reactor has
been modelled as a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) through a system of first

granular biofilms, and cyanobacteria and microalgae are taken into account
separately to model their differences in growth rate and light harvesting and
utilization. To describe the key role of cyanobacteria in the photogranules
formation process, the attachment velocity of all suspended microbial species
has been modelled as a function of the cyanobacteria concentration in suspended

involved in OPGs based systems: heterotrophic and photoautotrophic activities
of cyanobacteria and microalgae, metabolic activity of heterotrophic and
nitrifying bacteria, microbial decay, EPS secrection, diffusion and conversion
of soluble substrates (inorganic and organic carbon, ammonia, nitrate and

investigating the evolution and microbial composition of photogranules and the
treatment efficiency of the OPGs-based system. The results show the consistency

functions of the curve coordinates and as the ends of the curve tend to
coincide, they converge to the corresponding Vassiliev invariants of the
resulting knot. We focus on the second Vassiliev measure from the enhanced
Jones polynomial for closed and open curves in 3-space. For closed curves, this
second Vassiliev measure can be computed by a Gauss code diagram and it has an

alternating self-linking integral is a topological invariant for closed curves

For polygonal curves, the double alternating self-linking integral obtains a

simplicial complex is the matrix reduction algorithm. Its output is a
particular decomposition of the total boundary matrix, from which the
persistence diagrams and generating cycles can be derived.
  Persistence diagrams are known to vary continuously with respect to their
input, which motivates the algorithmic study of persistence computations for
time-varying filtered complexes. Computationally, simulating persistence
dynamically can be reduced to maintaining a valid decomposition under adjacent
transpositions in the filtration order.
  In practice, the quadratic scaling in the number of such transpositions often
makes this maintenance procedure slower than simply computing the decomposition
from scratch, limiting the application of dynamic persistence to relatively
small data sets. In this work, we propose a coarser strategy for maintaining
the decomposition over a 1-parameter family of filtrations. Our first result is
an analysis of a simple linear-time strategy which reduces the number of column
operations needed to simulate persistence across a fixed homotopy by at most a
factor of 2. We show a modification of this technique which maintains only a
sublinear number of valid states, as opposed to a quadratic number of states,
and we provide tight lower bounds for this technique.
  Finally, we present results showing that the decrease in operations to
compute diagrams across a family of filtrations is proportional to the
difference between the expected quadratic number of states, and the proposed
sublinear coarsening.
  Applications to multi-dimensional persistence and crocker stacks are also
presented.

space analysis. However, many applications lead to datasets with additional
spatial information and a ground truth with spatially coherent classes, which
will not necessarily be reconstructed well by standard clustering methods.
Motivated by applications in hyperspectral imaging, we introduce in this work
clustering models based on orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization, which
include an additional total variation (TV) regularization procedure on the
cluster membership matrix to enforce the needed spatial coherence in the
clusters. We propose several approaches with different optimization techniques,
where the TV regularization is either performed as a subsequent postprocessing
step or included into the clustering algorithm. Finally, we provide a numerical
evaluation of all proposed methods on a hyperspectral dataset obtained from a
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation imaging measurement, which leads to
significantly better clustering results compared to classical clustering
models.

networks is how to connect the extracted feature map to the final
classification layer. VGG models used two sets of fully connected layers for
the classification part of their architectures, which significantly increases
the number of models' weights. ResNet and next deep convolutional models used
the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer to compress the feature map and feed it
to the classification layer. Although using the GAP layer reduces the
computational cost, but also causes losing spatial resolution of the feature
map, which results in decreasing learning efficiency. In this paper, we aim to
tackle this problem by replacing the GAP layer with a new architecture called
Wise-SrNet. It is inspired by the depthwise convolutional idea and is designed
for processing spatial resolution and also not increasing computational cost.
We have evaluated our method using three different datasets: Intel Image
Classification Challenge, MIT Indoors Scenes, and a part of the ImageNet
dataset. We investigated the implementation of our architecture on several
models of Inception, ResNet and DensNet families. Applying our architecture has
revealed a significant effect on increasing convergence speed and accuracy. Our
Experiments on images with 224x224 resolution increased the Top-1 accuracy

512x512 resolution images of the MIT Indoors Scenes dataset showed a notable
result of improving the Top-1 accuracy within 3% to 26%. We will also
demonstrate the GAP layer's disadvantage when the input images are large and

constraints on heating rate and heating load is studied. The ascent vehicle is
modeled as a three-stage rocket that places the vehicle onto a suborbital
exo-atmopheric trajectory after which the vehicle undergoes an unpowered entry
and descent to a vertically downward terminal condition. The entry vehicle is
modeled as a high lift-to-drag ratio vehicle that is capable of withstanding
high levels of thermal and structural loads. A performance index is designed to
improve control margin while attenuating phugoid oscillations during
atmospheric entry. Furthermore, a mission corresponding to a prototype launch
and target point is used in this study. The trajectory optimization problem is
formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control problem, and the optimal control
problem is solved using an adaptive Gaussian quadrature collocation method. A
key aspect of the optimized trajectories is that, for particular ranges of
maximum allowable heating rate and heating load during entry, relatively small
adjustments made during ascent can potentially decrease the control effort
required during atmospheric entry. Outside of these ranges for maximum
allowable heating rate and heating load, however, it is found that the required
control effort increases and eventually saturates the commanded angle of attack
upon initial descent. The key features of the optimized trajectories and
controls are identified, and the approach developed in this paper provides a

ALRR obtains a similarity graph that can preserve the intrinsic geometrical

IRS. In this paper, we adopt a deep learning approach to implicitly learn the
historical channel features and directly predict the IRS phase shifts for the
next time slot to maximize the average achievable sum-rate of an IRS-MUC system
taking into account the user mobility. By doing this, only a low-dimension
multiple-input single-output (MISO) CE is needed for transmit beamforming
design, thus significantly reducing the CE overhead. To this end, a
location-aware convolutional long short-term memory network (LA-CLNet) is first
developed to facilitate predictive beamforming at IRS, where the convolutional
and recurrent units are jointly adopted to exploit both the spatial and
temporal features of channels simultaneously. Given the predictive IRS phase
shift beamforming, an instantaneous CSI (ICSI)-aware fully-connected neural
network (IA-FNN) is then proposed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix
at the access point. Simulation results demonstrate that the sum-rate
performance achieved by the proposed method approaches that of the genie-aided
scheme with the full perfect ICSI.

experimentally validate that the vortex rotation direction can be changed by

popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex non-linear

advances in deep generative models and the concept of state space models to
propose a stochastic adaptation of the recurrent neural network for
multistep-ahead time series forecasting, which is trained with stochastic
gradient variational Bayes. In our model design, the transition function of the
recurrent neural network, which determines the evolution of the hidden states,
is stochastic rather than deterministic as in a regular recurrent neural
network; this is achieved by incorporating a latent random variable into the
transition process which captures the stochasticity of the temporal dynamics.
Our model preserves the architectural workings of a recurrent neural network
for which all relevant information is encapsulated in its hidden states, and
this flexibility allows our model to be easily integrated into any deep
architecture for sequential modelling. We test our model on a wide range of
datasets from finance to healthcare; results show that the stochastic recurrent
neural network consistently outperforms its deterministic counterpart.

mass of galaxies and does not change significantly with HI gas fraction at
fixed stellar mass. Furthermore, the physical size of the bar is small and
nearly constant in high Hi gas fraction and low-mass galaxies, and becomes
larger with increasing galactic stellar mass in low gas fraction galaxies. When
the stellar masses are fixed, the relative bar length normalized to the disk
shows a decrease with increasing HI gas fraction due to the larger disks in
gas-richer galaxies. We measure the gas deficiency of the samples and find that
the gas-rich galaxies have longer and stronger bars compared with the Hi
gas-deficient galaxies at fixed stellar mass, especially for the massive ones.
When splitting the samples into star forming and quiescent subgroups, the star
forming galaxies tend to have longer bars than the quiescent ones at fixed
stellar mass and gas deficiency. In addition, our results suggest two different
types of bar properties, in which the bars in gas-rich galaxies grow longer but
retain similar axial ratio over time, while they grow longer and fatter over
time in gas-poor galaxies.

PINNs is simulation-free, and does not require any training dataset to be
obtained from numerical PDE solvers. Instead, it only requires the physical
problem description, including the governing laws of physics, domain geometry,
initial/boundary conditions, and the material properties. This training usually
involves solving a non-convex optimization problem using variants of the
stochastic gradient descent method, with the gradient of the loss function
approximated on a batch of collocation points, selected randomly in each
iteration according to a uniform distribution. Despite the success of PINNs in
accurately solving a wide variety of PDEs, the method still requires
improvements in terms of computational efficiency. To this end, in this paper,
we study the performance of an importance sampling approach for efficient
training of PINNs. Using numerical examples together with theoretical
evidences, we show that in each training iteration, sampling the collocation
points according to a distribution proportional to the loss function will
improve the convergence behavior of the PINNs training. Additionally, we show
that providing a piecewise constant approximation to the loss function for
faster importance sampling can further improve the training efficiency. This
importance sampling approach is straightforward and easy to implement in the

others find that the time-lag measurements are consistent with (or only
slightly larger than) that of the SSD model. These conflicting observational
results might be symptoms of our poor understanding of AGN accretion physics.
Here we show that sources with larger-than-expected time lags tend to be
less-luminous AGNs. Such a dependence is unexpected if the inter-band time lags
are attributed to the light-travel-time delay of the illuminating variable
X-ray photons to the static SSD. If, instead, the measured inter-band lags are
related not only to the static SSD but also to the outer broad emission-line
regions (BLRs; e.g., the blended broad emission lines and/or diffuse continua),
our result indicates that the contribution of the non-disk BLR to the observed
UV/optical continuum decreases with increasing luminosity ($L$), i.e., an
anti-correlation resembling the well-known Baldwin effect. Alternatively, we
argue that the observed dependence might be a result of coherent disk thermal
fluctuations as the relevant thermal timescale, $\tau_{\mathrm{TH}}\propto

two scenarios can be distinguished by inspecting the dependence of inter-band

to the prevalence of cloud computing. There are two main security concerns in
outsourcing computation: how to guarantee the cloud server performs the
computation correctly and how to keep the client's data secret. The {\em
single-server verifiable computation} (SSVC) of Gennaro, Gentry and Parno
(Crypto'10) enables a client to delegate the computation of a function $f$ on
any input $x$ with both concerns highly relieved, but only results in {\em
computationally secure} schemes that
  {\em lack practical efficiency}.
  While the SSVC schemes use a single server, in this paper we develop a {\em
multi-server verifiable computation} (MSVC) model where the client shares both
$f$ and $x$ among multiple servers, each server performs a set of computations
on its shares, and finally the client reconstructs $f(x)$ from all servers'
results. In this MSVC model we propose a generic construction for outsourcing
computations of the form $F{\bf x}$, where $F$ is a matrix and $\bf x$ is a
vector. Our generic construction achieves {\em information-theoretic security,
input privacy} and {\em function privacy}. By optimizing the parameters, we
obtain both a 3-server scheme,which uses the least number of servers, and a
4-server scheme, which incurs the least workload. By decomposing many
polynomial computations as a two-stage computation, where the first-stage has
the form $F{\bf x}$ and the second-stage is fast, and delegating the
first-stage computation, we obtain MSVC schemes for these polynomials. We
implement our MSVC schemes and show that they are among the most {\em
practical} ones to date.

observation that, different dataflows share common hardware modules, which can
be reused across different designs. To build such a framework, TensorLib first
uses Space-Time Transformation to explore different dataflows, which can
compactly represent the hardware dataflow using a simple transformation matrix.
Next, we identify the common structures of different dataflows and build
parameterized hardware module templates with Chisel. Our generation framework
can select the needed hardware modules for each dataflow, connect the modules
using a specified interconnection pattern, and automatically generate the
complete hardware accelerator design. TensorLib remarkably improves the
productivity for the development and optimization of spatial hardware
architecture, providing a rich design space with trade-offs in performance,
area, and power. Experiments show that TensorLib can automatically generate
hardware designs with different dataflows and achieve 21\% performance

acknowledged as having an indirect effect on the relationship between certain
artifact characteristics, captured via metrics, and faultproneness, and
therefore it is recommended to control for size when designing fault prediction
models. AIM: To use robust statistical methods to assess whether there is
evidence of any true effect of class size on fault prediction models. METHOD:
We examine the potential mediation and moderation effects of class size on the
relationships between OO metrics and number of faults. We employ regression
analysis and bootstrapping-based methods to investigate the mediation and
moderation effects in two widely-used datasets comprising seventeen systems.
RESULTS: We find no strong evidence of a significant mediation or moderation
effect of class size on the relationships between OO metrics and faults. In
particular, size appears to have a more significant mediation effect on CBO and
Fan-out than other metrics, although the evidence is not consistent in all
examined systems. On the other hand, size does appear to have a significant
moderation effect on WMC and CBO in most of the systems examined. Again, the
evidence provided is not consistent across all examined systems CONCLUSION: We
are unable to confirm if class size has a significant mediation or moderation
effect on the relationships between OO metrics and the number of faults. We
contend that class size does not fully explain the relationships between OO
metrics and the number of faults, and it does not always affect the
strength/magnitude of these relationships. We recommend that researchers
consider the potential mediation and moderation effect of class size when
building their prediction models, but this should be examined independently for
each system.

colorization quality and spatiotemporal consistency, the mainstream of
generator in VCGAN is assisted by two additional networks, i.e., global feature
extractor and placeholder feature extractor, respectively. The global feature
extractor encodes the global semantics of grayscale input to enhance
colorization quality, whereas the placeholder feature extractor acts as a

spin currents are crucial steps towards building practical spintronics devices.
Transverse magnetic focusing is a potential technique to accomplish both those
tasks. In a material where there is significant Rashba spin--orbit interaction,
electrons of different spins will traverse different paths in the presence of
an external magnetic field. Experiments have demonstrated the viability of this
technique by measuring conductance spectra that indicate the separation of
spin-up and spin-down electrons. However the effect that the geometry of the
leads has on these measurements is not well understood. We show that the
resolution of features in the conductance spectra is affected by the shape,
separation and width of the leads. Furthermore, the number of subbands occupied
by the electrons in the leads affects the ratio between the amplitudes of the
spin-split peaks in the spectra. We simulated devices with random onsite
potentials and observed that transverse magnetic focusing devices are sensitive
to disorder. Ultimately we show that careful choice and characterisation of
device geometry is crucial for correctly interpreting the results of transverse
magnetic focusing experiments.

The research motivation of this study is to design a deep model that fully
exploits the temporal-spectral-spatial information of multi-channel signals for
estimating cRM directly and efficiently in complex domain. As a result, a novel
TSS network is designed consisting of two modules, a complex neural spatial

MVDR module is cascaded to the cNSF module to reduce the nonlinear speech
distortions introduced by neural network. Specifically, to fit the cRM target,
all input features of cNSF are reformulated into complex-valued representations
following the supervised learning paradigm. Then, to achieve good hierarchical
feature abstraction, a complex deep neural network (cDNN) is delicately
designed with U-Net structure. Experiments conducted on simulated multi-channel

Hilbert space (RKHS) covariance and cross-covariance operators associated with
the corresponding covariance functions. Using this representation, we show that
the Sinkhorn divergence between two centered Gaussian processes can be

alternatively, their sample covariance operators. Consequently, this leads to a
consistent and efficient algorithm for estimating the Sinkhorn divergence from
finite samples generated by the two processes. For a fixed regularization
parameter, the convergence rates are {\it dimension-independent} and of the

potential for reducing the cold-start emissions.

contractions, nonexpansive mappings, generalized inward mappings, and of the
tool theorems. The manuscript was written about ten years ago.
  At first Nadler's concept of contraction for multivalued mappings is replaced
here by a more general, and yet elegant condition: for some $\alpha + \epsilon
<1$, and each $x \in X$ there exists a $y \in F(x)$ such that $d(F(y),y) \leq
\alpha d(y,x) \leq (\alpha + \epsilon) d(F(x),x)$}.
  For ``nonexpansive'' mappings we apply bead spaces that are more general than
uniformly convex spaces, and our requirements on mappings are weaker than
nonexpansivity in the sense of the Hausdorff distance.
  In the last, third section the Caristi theorem is replaced by more
specialized ``tools'', and we apply them to obtain stronger fixed point
theorems on generalized inward mappings. In particular, if for each $x \in X$ a
nearest point of $F(x)$ belongs to the generalized inward set, then the values
of $F$ need not to be closed.

solution of the detailed hydro-chemical problem with many particles is
challenging and computationally expensive. Most current methods rely on the
Green's functions of the Laplace and Stokes operators to approximate the
particle signatures in the far-field, which is only valid in the very dilute

forcing of the Stokes equations. Unlike far-field models based on singularity
superposition, DFCM accounts for mutually-induced dipoles. The accuracy of the
method is evaluated against exact and accurate numerical solutions for a few

stars are similar in size to those on Am/Fm stars, and both are weaker than

social connections and interactions, working status, mobility, and social

included 2,886 bi-weekly PHQ-8 records collected from 316 participants

nonlinear features for measuring periodicity and regularity of individuals'
life rhythms. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore associations
between Bluetooth features and the PHQ-8 score. We then applied hierarchical
Bayesian linear regression models to predict the PHQ-8 score from the extracted
Bluetooth features. A number of significant associations were found between
Bluetooth features and depressive symptom severity. Compared with commonly used
machine learning models, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian linear regression
model achieved the best prediction metrics, R2= 0.526, and root mean squared
error (RMSE) of 3.891. Bluetooth features can explain an extra 18.8% of the
variance in the PHQ-8 score relative to the baseline model without Bluetooth
features (R2=0.338, RMSE = 4.547).

avenue for tackling the conjecture using insights from affine differential
geometry. As every strongly convex hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a
centro-affine unit-sphere, it has constant centro-affine Ricci curvature equal
to $n-2$, in stark contrast to the standard weighted Ricci curvature of the
associated metric-measure space, which will in general be negative. In
particular, we may use the classical argument of Lichnerowicz and a
centro-affine Bochner formula to give a new proof of the Brunn-Minkowski
inequality. For origin-symmetric convex bodies enjoying fairly generous
curvature pinching bounds (improving with dimension), we are able to show
global uniqueness in the $L^p$- and log-Minkowski problems, as well as the
corresponding global $L^p$- and log-Minkowski conjectured inequalities. As a
consequence, we resolve the isomorphic version of the log-Minkowski problem:
for any origin-symmetric convex body $\bar K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists
an origin-symmetric convex body $K$ with $\bar K \subset K \subset 8 \bar K$,
so that $K$ satisfies the log-Minkowski conjectured inequality, and so that $K$
is uniquely determined by its cone-volume measure $V_K$. If $\bar K$ is not
extremely far from a Euclidean ball to begin with, an analogous isometric
result, where $8$ is replaced by $1+\epsilon$, is obtained as well.

promoted new investigations on the mechanisms through which a BNS merger
remnant can launch such a powerful relativistic outflow and on the propagation

great strides have been made in jet propagation models, establishing
connections between the initial jet launching conditions, including the

parameters, and the observable SGRB prompt and afterglow emission. However,
present semi-analytical models and numerical simulations (with one notable

environment that is directly imported from the outcome of a previous general
relativistic BNS merger simulation. Our results show that the evolution and
final properties of the jet can be largely affected by the anisotropies and the
deviations from axisymmetry and homologous expansion characterizing more
realistic BNS merger environments. In addition, we find that the inclusion of
the gravitational pull from the central compact object, often overlooked, can
have a major impact. Finally, we consider different jet launching times
referred to the same BNS merger model and discuss the consequences for the
ultimate jet properties.

proposed from theoretical arguments that the non-thermal velocity dispersion
should be narrower both for molecular ions (compared to neutrals) and for
transitions with higher critical densities. To test these hypotheses, we
compare the velocity dispersion of N$_2$H$^+$ (1--0) (n$_{\rm crit}$ =
$6\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}) and NH$_3$ (n$_{\rm crit}=2\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}), in
the dense core Barnard 5. We analyse well resolved and high signal-to-noise
observations of NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) obtained with combining GBT and VLA
data, and N$_2$H$^+$ (1--0) obtained with GBT Argus, which present a similar
morphology. % Surprisingly, the non-thermal velocity dispersion of the ion is
systematically higher than that of the neutral by 20\%. The derived sonic Mach
number, $\mathcal{M}_s = \sigma_{\rm NT}/c_s$, has peak values $\mathcal{M}_{s,
{\rm N_2H^+}} = 0.59$ and $\mathcal{M}_{s, {\rm NH}_3} = 0.48$ for N$_2$H$^+$

magnetic field even deep within the dense core is still oscillating, as it is
in the turbulent region outside the core. The ions should be more strongly
dynamically coupled to this oscillating field than the neutrals, thus
accounting for their broader linewidth. If corroborated by further
observations, this finding would shed additional light on the transition to
quiescence in dense cores.

the temporal variability of solar irradiance resulting from the cloud cover

satellite observations. Despite encouraging results, a recurrent limitation of
existing deep learning approaches lies in the ubiquitous tendency of reacting
to past observations rather than actively anticipating future events. This
leads to a frequent temporal lag and limited ability to predict sudden events.
To address this challenge, we introduce ECLIPSE, a spatio-temporal neural
network architecture that models cloud motion from sky images to not only
predict future irradiance levels and associated uncertainties, but also
segmented images, which provide richer information on the local irradiance map.
We show that ECLIPSE anticipates critical events and reduces temporal delay
while generating visually realistic futures. The model characteristics and
properties are investigated with an ablation study and a comparative study on
the benefits and different ways to integrate auxiliary data into the modelling.
The model predictions are also interpreted through an analysis of the principal

charge order confined to only 2D remains elusive. Here we report a distinct

Systematic scanning tunneling microscopy experiments reveal that bilayer
VSe$_2$ largely retains the bulk electronic structure, hosting a
tri-directional CDW. However, monolayer VSe$_2$ -- consistently across distinct
substrates -- exhibits a dimensional crossover, hosting two CDWs with distinct
wavelengths and transition temperatures. Electronic structure calculations
reveal that while one CDW is bulk-like and arises from the well-known Peierls
mechanism, the other is decidedly unconventional. The observed CDW-lattice
decoupling and the emergence of a flat band suggest that the new CDW could
arise from enhanced electron-electron interactions in the 2D limit. These
findings establish monolayer-VSe$_2$ as a host of coexisting charge orders with
distinct origins, and enable the tailoring of electronic phenomena via emergent

be used in the momentum balance law to derive a mathematical model for the
resulting deformation. We consider such a dynamic linear viscoelastic model
problem resulting from using a \textit{Dirichlet-Prony} series of decaying
exponentials to provide the fading memory in the Volterra kernel. We introduce
two types of \textit{internal variable} to replace the Volterra integral with a
system of auxiliary ordinary differential equations and then use a spatially

promising approach to control chemical reactions in a non-intrusive and
efficient manner. The underlying mechanism that distinguishes between steering,
accelerating, or decelerating a chemical reaction has, however, remained
unclear, hampering progress in this frontier area of research. We leverage
quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory to unveil the microscopic
mechanism behind the experimentally observed reduced reaction rate under cavity
induced resonant vibrational strong light-matter coupling. We observe multiple
resonances and obtain the thus far theoretically elusive but experimentally
critical resonant feature for a single strongly-coupled molecule undergoing the
reaction. While we do not explicitly account for collective coupling or
intermolecular interactions, the qualitative agreement with experimental
measurements suggests that our conclusions can be largely abstracted towards
the experimental realization. Specifically, we find that the cavity mode acts
as mediator between different vibrational modes. In effect, vibrational energy
localized in single bonds that are critical for the reaction is redistributed
differently which ultimately inhibits the reaction.

constructed based on a functional time series's correlated lags and the
essential exogenous climate variables. Rainfall, temperature, and evaporation
variables were hypothesized to have substantial functionality in river flow
simulation. Because an actual time series model is unspecified and the input
variables' significance for the learning process is unknown in practice, it was
employed a variable selection procedure to determine only the significant
variables for the model. A nonparametric bootstrap model was also proposed to
investigate predictions' uncertainty and construct pointwise prediction
intervals for the river flow curve time series. Historical datasets at three
meteorological stations (Mosul, Baghdad, and Kut) located in the semi-arid
region, Iraq, were used for model development. The prediction performance of
the proposed model was validated against existing functional and traditional
time series models. The numerical analyses revealed that the proposed model
provides competitive or even better performance than the benchmark models.
Also, the incorporated exogenous climate variables have substantially improved
the modeling predictability performance. Overall, the proposed model indicated
a reliable methodology for modeling river flow within the semi-arid region.

of the defect symmetry and the strong spin-orbit coupling may restrict the
allowed spin transitions, giving rise to defect spins that are long lived, but
hard to address via microwave spin manipulation. Here, we show via analytical
and numerical results that the presence of a central nuclear spin can lead to a
non-trivial mixing of electronic spin states, while preserving the defect
symmetry. The interplay between a small applied magnetic field and hyperfine
coupling opens up magnetic microwave transitions that are forbidden in the
absence of hyperfine coupling, enabling efficient manipulation of the
electronic spin. We also find that an electric microwave field parallel to the

properties remain elusive. Here we demonstrate an inherent surface
ferromagnetic-metal state of FeSi thin films and its strong spin-orbit-coupling
(SOC) properties through multiple characterizations of the two-dimensional (2D)
conductance, magnetization and spintronic functionality. Terminated
covalent-bonding orbitals constitute the polar surface state with
momentum-dependent spin textures due to Rashba-type spin splitting, as
corroborated by unidirectional magnetoresistance measurements and
first-principles calculations. As a consequence of the spin-momentum locking,
non-equilibrium spin accumulation causes magnetization switching. These surface
properties are closely related to the Zak phase of the bulk band topology. Our
findings propose another route to explore noble-metal-free materials for
SOC-based spin manipulation.

how the accuracy/precision of these Image Quality Assessment (IQA) meters can
be increased by mapping them into a Logistic Function (LF). The precisions are
tested over a variety of image/video databases. Our experimental tests indicate
while the used high-quality images can be discriminated by 23% resolution on
the MOS subjective scores, discrimination resolution by the widely used IQAs
are only 2%, but their mapped IQAs to Logistic Function at this quality range
can be improved to 9.4%. Moreover, their precision at low to mid quality range
can also be improved. At this quality range, while the discrimination
resolution of MOS of the tested images is 23.2%, those of raw IQAs is nearly
8.9%, but their adapted logistic functions can lead to 17.7%, very close to
that of MOS. Moreover, with the used image databases the Pearson correlation of

compressing 3D scenes are based on a separation of compression and rendering:
each of the original views is compressed using traditional 2D image formats;
the receiver decompresses the views and then performs the rendering. We unify
these steps by directly compressing an implicit representation of the scene, a
function that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field, which can
then be queried to render arbitrary viewpoints. The function is implemented as
a neural network and jointly trained for reconstruction as well as
compressibility, in an end-to-end manner, with the use of an entropy penalty on
the parameters. Our method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art
conventional approach for scene compression, achieving simultaneously higher
quality reconstructions and lower bitrates. Furthermore, we show that the
performance at lower bitrates can be improved by jointly representing multiple

impacting every aspect of computational chemistry. To obtain reliable
predictions, one needs to maintain the proper balance between the black-box
nature of ML frameworks and the physics of the target properties. One of the
most appealing quantum-chemical properties for regression models is the
electron density, and some of us recently proposed a transferable and scalable
model based on the decomposition of the density onto an atom-centered basis
set. The decomposition, as well as the training of the model, is at its core a
minimization of some loss function, which can be arbitrarily chosen and may
lead to results of different quality. Well-studied in the context of density
fitting (DF), the impact of the metric on the performance of ML models has not
been analyzed yet. In this work, we compare predictions obtained using the
overlap and the Coulomb-repulsion metrics for both decomposition and training.
As expected, the Coulomb metric used as both the DF and ML loss functions leads
to the best results for the electrostatic potential and dipole moments. The
origin of this difference lies in the fact that the model is not constrained to
predict densities that integrate to the exact number of electrons $N$. Since an
\textit{a posteriori} correction for the number of electrons decreases the
errors, we proposed a modification of the model where $N$ is included directly
into the kernel function, which allowed to lower the errors on the test and
out-of-sample sets.

whether or not it is active - say, because of an incoming message. When
communication is sparse with information being sent once in a long while,
channel sensing becomes a significant source of energy consumption. How to
reliably detect messages while minimizing the receiver energy consumption? This
paper addresses this problem through a reconfigurable scheme, referred to as
AdaSense, which exploits the dependency between the receiver noise figure
(i.e., the receiver added noise) and the receiver power consumption; a higher
power typically translates into less noisy channel observations. AdaSense
begins in a low power low reliability mode and makes a first tentative decision
based on a few channel observations. If a message is declared, it switches to a
high power high reliability mode to confirm the decision, else it sleeps for
the entire duration of the second phase. Compared to prominent detection
schemes such as the BMAC protocol, AdaSense provides relative energy gains that
grow unbounded in the small probability of false-alarm regime, as communication
gets sparser. In the non-asymptotic regime energy gains are 30% to 75% for
communication scenarios typically found in the context of wake-up receivers.

geospatial data domain, e.g., for climate data. However, most existing
approaches work with temporal snapshots or assume 1D time-series; few are able
to capture spatio-temporal processes simultaneously. Beyond this, Earth-systems
data often exhibit highly irregular and complex patterns, for example caused by
extreme weather events. Because of climate change, these phenomena are only
increasing in frequency. Here, we proposed a novel GAN-based approach for
generating spatio-temporal weather patterns conditioned on detected extreme
events. Our approach augments GAN generator and discriminator with an encoded
extreme weather event segmentation mask. These segmentation masks can be
created from raw input using existing event detection frameworks. As such, our
approach is highly modular and can be combined with custom GAN architectures.
We highlight the applicability of our proposed approach in experiments with

effectiveness of medical image captioning. Multi-modal medical image captioning
is one of the approaches utilized to address this problem. In multi-modal
medical image captioning, textual input, e.g., expert-defined keywords, is
considered as one of the main drivers of medical description generation. Thus,
encoding the textual input and the medical image effectively are both important
for the task of multi-modal medical image captioning. In this work, a new
end-to-end deep multi-modal medical image captioning model is proposed.
Contextualized keyword representations, textual feature reinforcement, and

Consequently, mitigating label noise has attracted immense research in recent

with label noise, as these methods only require changing the loss function and
do not require changing the design of the classifier itself, which can be
expensive in terms of development time. In this work we focus on losses that
use output regularization (such as label smoothing and entropy). Although these
losses perform well in practice, their ability to mitigate label noise lack
mathematical rigor. In this work we aim at closing this gap by showing that
losses, which incorporate an output regularization term, become symmetric as
the regularization coefficient goes to infinity. We argue that the
regularization coefficient can be seen as a hyper-parameter controlling the
symmetricity, and thus, the noise robustness of the loss function.

applications such as recommender system and online advertising. It models
users' preference on target items by the items they have interacted with.
Recent models use methods such as attention mechanism and deep neural network
to learn the user representation and scoring function more accurately. However,
despite their effectiveness, such models still overlook a problem that
performance of ICF methods heavily depends on the quality of item
representation especially the target item representation. In fact, due to the
long-tail distribution in the recommendation, most item embeddings can not
represent the semantics of items accurately and thus degrade the performance of
current ICF methods. In this paper, we propose an enhanced representation of
the target item which distills relevant information from the co-occurrence
items. We design sampling strategies to sample fix number of co-occurrence
items for the sake of noise reduction and computational cost. Considering the
different importance of sampled items to the target item, we apply attention
mechanism to selectively adopt the semantic information of the sampled items.
Our proposed Co-occurrence based Enhanced Representation model (CER) learns the
scoring function by a deep neural network with the attentive user
representation and fusion of raw representation and enhanced representation of
target item as input. With the enhanced representation, CER has stronger
representation power for the tail items compared to the state-of-the-art ICF
methods. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of CER.

be driven by a function that measures the quality of diverse types of patterns
of interest. However, due to its computational complexity, the exploration of
the search space is usually guided by an algorithmic strategy, sometimes
introducing random factors that simplify the computational cost (e.g. greedy
search or evolutionary computation).
  Shifting patterns are specially interesting as they account constant
fluctuations in data, i.e. they capture situations in which all the values in
the pattern move up or down for one dimension maintaining the range amplitude
for all the dimensions. This behaviour is very common in nature, e.g. in the
analysis of gene expression data, where a subset of genes might go up or down
for a subset of patients or experimental conditions, identifying functionally
coherent categories.
  Boolean reasoning was recently revealed as an appropriate methodology to
address the search for constant biclusters. In this work, this direction is
extended to search for more general biclusters that include shifting patterns.
The mathematical foundations are described in order to associate Boolean
concepts with shifting patterns, and the methodology is presented to show that
the induction of shifting patterns by means of Boolean reasoning is due to the
ability of finding all inclusion--maximal {\delta}-shifting patterns.
  Experiments with a real dataset show the potential of our approach at finding
biclusters with {\delta}-shifting patterns, which have been evaluated with the
mean squared residue (MSR), providing an excellent performance at finding
results very close to zero.

identity of a random variable in a system is determined by its joint
distribution with all other random variables in the same context. When context
changes, a variable measuring some property is instantly replaced by another
random variable measuring the same property, or instantly disappears if this
property is not measured in the new context. This replacement/disappearance
requires no action, signaling, or disturbance, although it does not exclude
them. The difference between two random variables measuring the same property
in different contexts is measured by their maximal coupling, and the system is
noncontextual if one of its overall couplings has these maximal couplings as
its marginals.

present study is related to the utilization of MSW incinerator bottom ash and
recycled demolition waste aggregate as partial replacement materials for fine

adopted an innovative pretreatment technique for stabilizing the MSW
incinerator bottom ash. Five distinct M20 grade concrete mixes were produced
with different proportions of fine aggregate, MSW incinerator bottom ash,
coarse aggregate, and recycled demolition waste aggregate along with cement and
water. The incinerator bottom ash was replaced at 5% and 10% quantities with
fine aggregate and the recycled demolition waste aggregate was replaced at 40%
and 60% of the weight of the coarse aggregate. The strength and durability
properties of the M20 grade concrete were analyzed. It was noticed that the
strength and durability properties of the eco-friendly concrete specimens
produced by incorporating 5% - incinerator bottom ash and 40% - recycled
demolition waste aggregate were superior to that of the control mix concrete.
Laboratory tank leaching tests showed that the eco-friendly concrete do not
pose any significant environmental hazard. Furthermore, the microstructural
analysis through scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, revealed dense
aggregate paste matrix interfaces with less micro-pores and insignificant
micro-cracks due to the incorporation of incinerator bottom ash as a partial

study of compact objects. A weak dual notion called 0-cocompact objects was
introduced in arXiv:1801.07995, motivated by the fact that sets of such objects
cogenerate co-t-structures, dual to the t-structures generated by sets of
compact objects. In the present paper, we show that the notion of 0-cocompact
objects also appears naturally in the presence of certain dualities.
  We introduce ""partial Serre duality"", which is shown to link compact to
0-cocompact objects. We show that partial Serre duality gives rise to an
Auslander--Reiten theory, which in turn implies a weaker notion of duality
which we call ""non-degenerate composition"", and throughout this entire
hierarchy of dualities the objects involved are 0-(co)compact.
  Furthermore, we produce explicit partial Serre functors for multiple flavors
of homotopy categories, thus illustrating that this type of duality, as well as
the resulting 0-cocompact objects, are abundant in prevalent triangulated
categories.

and increase fuel efficiency, a two-layer control architecture is proposed. The
first layer is in charge of optimizing the leader's long-term motion profile
using the traffic light and road slope information. The long-term planning
model is defined based on the reachability analysis of the platoon to the green
light windows. An event-triggered mechanism is proposed to operate the
long-term planning model. The second layer is the short-term adaptation, in
which the leader attempts to follow the planning motion profile in real time,
while the follower keeps track of the nearest preceding vehicle and the leader,
to preserve the desired inter-vehicular distances. A Newton's method-based
algorithm is implemented to effectively solve both the long-term planning and
short-term adaptation problems. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation
and algorithm is illustrated by the simulations.

satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) in video streaming applications, in
which past network statistics are mainly leveraged for future network bandwidth
prediction. However, most algorithms, either rules-based or learning-driven
approaches, feed throughput traces or classified traces based on traditional
statistics (i.e., mean/standard deviation) to drive ABR decision, leading to
compromised performances in specific scenarios. Given the diverse network
connections (e.g., WiFi, cellular and wired link) from time to time, this paper
thus proposes to learn the ANT (a.k.a., Accurate Network Throughput) model to
characterize the full spectrum of network throughput dynamics in the past for
deriving the proper network condition associated with a specific cluster of
network throughput segments (NTS). Each cluster of NTS is then used to generate
a dedicated ABR model, by which we wish to better capture the network dynamics
for diverse connections. We have integrated the ANT model with existing
reinforcement learning (RL)-based ABR decision engine, where different ABR
models are applied to respond to the accurate network sensing for better rate
decision. Extensive experiment results show that our approach can significantly
improve the user QoE by 65.5% and 31.3% respectively, compared with the

formal methods to synthesize (i.e., derive automatically) a safe and optimal

catchment area and the rain forecasts, as a hybrid Markov decision process.
Subsequently, we use the tool Uppaal Stratego to synthesize a control strategy
minimizing the cost related to pollution (optimality) while guaranteeing no
emergency overflow of the detention pond (safety). Simulation results for an
existing pond show that Uppaal Stratego can learn optimal strategies that
prevent emergency overflows, where the current static control is not always
able to prevent it. At the same time, our approach can improve sedimentation

dissociation constant $K_w$ in nanospaces has been assessed from experiments

Here, using carefully designed ab-initio simulations and data-science tools, we
demonstrate, challenging current misconceptions, that the energetics of bulk
water dissociation remains unchanged to surprisingly small length-scales
including clusters of only a dozen water molecules. This is rooted in the fact
that most of the free-energy involved in water autoionization comes from
breaking the O-H covalent bond, which has a comparable barrier in the bulk
liquid or in droplets of nanometer size. The subsequent separation of the
hydroxide and hydronium species contributes a marginal fraction of the total
free-energy, for which reason it turns out that confinement exerts little
control on this process. The present work provides a definitive and fundamental
description of the mechanism and thermodynamics of water dissociation at
different scales with broader implications on water's self-ionization at the
air-liquid interface and on chemical reactivity under nanoconfinement.

  machine learning: A longitudinal analysis","19 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As we gain access to a greater depth and range of health-related information
about individuals, three questions arise: (1) Can we build better models to
predict individual-level risk of ill health? (2) How much data do we need to
effectively predict ill health? (3) Are new methods required to process the
added complexity that new forms of data bring? The aim of the study is to apply
a machine learning approach to identify the relative contribution of personal,
social, health-related, biomarker and genetic data as predictors of future
health in individuals. Using longitudinal data from 6830 individuals in the UK
from Understanding Society (2010-12 to 2015-17), the study compares the
predictive performance of five types of measures: personal (e.g. age, sex),
social (e.g. occupation, education), health-related (e.g. body weight, grip
strength), biomarker (e.g. cholesterol, hormones) and genetic single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). The predicted outcome variable was limiting long-term
illness one and five years from baseline. Two machine learning approaches were
used to build predictive models: deep learning via neural networks and XGBoost
(gradient boosting decision trees). Model fit was compared to traditional
logistic regression models. Results found that health-related measures had the
strongest prediction of future health status, with genetic data performing
poorly. Machine learning models only offered marginal improvements in model
accuracy when compared to logistic regression models, but also performed well
on other metrics e.g. neural networks were best on AUC and XGBoost on
precision. The study suggests that increasing complexity of data and methods
does not necessarily translate to improved understanding of the determinants of
health or performance of predictive models of ill health.

  Neural Network","Accepted for publication in International Joint Conference on Neural
  Networks (IJCNN-2021)",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Research in deep learning models to forecast traffic intensities has gained
great attention in recent years due to their capability to capture the complex
spatio-temporal relationships within the traffic data. However, most
state-of-the-art approaches have designed spatial-only (e.g. Graph Neural
Networks) and temporal-only (e.g. Recurrent Neural Networks) modules to
separately extract spatial and temporal features. However, we argue that it is
less effective to extract the complex spatio-temporal relationship with such
factorized modules. Besides, most existing works predict the traffic intensity
of a particular time interval only based on the traffic data of the previous
one hour of that day. And thereby ignores the repetitive daily/weekly pattern
that may exist in the last hour of data. Therefore, we propose a Unified
Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (USTGCN) for traffic forecasting that
performs both spatial and temporal aggregation through direct information
propagation across different timestamp nodes with the help of spectral graph
convolution on a spatio-temporal graph. Furthermore, it captures historical
daily patterns in previous days and current-day patterns in current-day traffic
data. Finally, we validate our work's effectiveness through experimental
analysis, which shows that our model USTGCN can outperform state-of-the-art
performances in three popular benchmark datasets from the Performance
Measurement System (PeMS). Moreover, the training time is reduced significantly
with our proposed USTGCN model.

Hall concentration and the Hall coefficient, for both 2D and 3D cases. The main
result is that the three concentrations always differ from one another in the

the electronic ground state. Similarly, the optical conductivity is calculated

1500 Be stars and 50 OB stars per square degree, out to several kpc. It can

data augmentation is a quite effective technique for regularizing the neural

semantic transposition of the transcriptions via syntax rules for end-to-end
Mandarin ASR. Specifically, we first segment the transcriptions based on
part-of-speech tags. Then transposition strategies, such as placing the object
in front of the subject or swapping the subject and the object, are applied on
the segmented sentences. Finally, the acoustic features corresponding to the
transposed transcription are reassembled based on the audio-to-text
forced-alignment produced by a pre-trained ASR system. The combination of
original data and augmented one is used for training a new ASR system. The
experiments are conducted on the Transformer[2] and Conformer[3] based ASR. The
results show that the proposed method can give consistent performance gain to
the system. Augmentation related issues, such as comparison of different
strategies and ratios for data combination are also investigated.

  Hyperbolicity Computation",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hyperbolicity is a graph parameter which indicates how much the shortest-path
distance metric of a graph deviates from a tree metric. It is used in various
fields such as networking, security, and bioinformatics for the classification
of complex networks, the design of routing schemes, and the analysis of graph
algorithms. Despite recent progress, computing the hyperbolicity of a graph
remains challenging. Indeed, the best known algorithm has time complexity
$O(n^{3.69})$, which is prohibitive for large graphs, and the most efficient
algorithms in practice have space complexity $O(n^2)$. Thus, time as well as
space are bottlenecks for computing hyperbolicity.
  In this paper, we design a tool for enumerating all far-apart pairs of a
graph by decreasing distances. A node pair $(u, v)$ of a graph is far-apart if
both $v$ is a leaf of all shortest-path trees rooted at $u$ and $u$ is a leaf
of all shortest-path trees rooted at $v$. This notion was previously used to
drastically reduce the computation time for hyperbolicity in practice. However,
it required the computation of the distance matrix to sort all pairs of nodes
by decreasing distance, which requires an infeasible amount of memory already
for medium-sized graphs. We present a new data structure that avoids this
memory bottleneck in practice and for the first time enables computing the
hyperbolicity of several large graphs that were far out-of-reach using previous
algorithms. For some instances, we reduce the memory consumption by at least
two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we show that for many graphs, only a very
small fraction of far-apart pairs have to be considered for the hyperbolicity
computation, explaining this drastic reduction of memory.
  As iterating over far-apart pairs in decreasing order without storing them
explicitly is a very general tool, we believe that our approach might also be
relevant to other problems.

are the outcome statistics data produced by locally measuring target quantum

quantum states, this quantity is coherent information, which is a lower bound

multipartite quantum states, we choose this quantity as the geometric measure
of entanglement. It turns out that the neural networks we train have very good
performance in quantifying unknown quantum states, and can beat previous
approaches like semi-device-independent protocols for this problem easily in
both precision and application range. We also observe a surprising phenomenon

deep learning methods since they perform event-driven information processing.
However, a major drawback of SNNs is high inference latency. The efficiency of
SNNs could be enhanced using compression methods such as pruning and
quantization. Notably, SNNs, unlike their non-spiking counterparts, consist of
a temporal dimension, the compression of which can lead to latency reduction.
In this paper, we propose spatial and temporal pruning of SNNs. First,
structured spatial pruning is performed by determining the layer-wise
significant dimensions using principal component analysis of the average
accumulated membrane potential of the neurons. This step leads to 10-14X model
compression. Additionally, it enables inference with lower latency and
decreases the spike count per inference. To further reduce latency, temporal
pruning is performed by gradually reducing the timesteps while training. The
networks are trained using surrogate gradient descent based backpropagation and
we validate the results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, using VGG architectures. The
spatiotemporally pruned SNNs achieve 89.04% and 66.4% accuracy on CIFAR10 and
CIFAR100, respectively, while performing inference with 3-30X reduced latency
compared to state-of-the-art SNNs. Moreover, they require 8-14X lesser compute
energy compared to their unpruned standard deep learning counterparts. The
energy numbers are obtained by multiplying the number of operations with energy
per operation. These SNNs also provide 1-4% higher robustness against Gaussian
noise corrupted inputs. Furthermore, we perform weight quantization and find
that performance remains reasonably stable up to 5-bit quantization.

module to vision problems. While some researchers have demonstrated that
Transformer-based models enjoy a favorable ability of fitting data, there are
still growing number of evidences showing that these models suffer over-fitting
especially when the training data is limited. This paper offers an empirical
study by performing step-by-step operations to gradually transit a
Transformer-based model to a convolution-based model. The results we obtain
during the transition process deliver useful messages for improving visual
recognition. Based on these observations, we propose a new architecture named
Visformer, which is abbreviated from the `Vision-friendly Transformer'. With
the same computational complexity, Visformer outperforms both the
Transformer-based and convolution-based models in terms of ImageNet
classification accuracy, and the advantage becomes more significant when the
model complexity is lower or the training set is smaller. The code is available

may allow seamlessly powering future massive low-energy Internet of Things
(IoT) networks. To enable efficient massive WET, channel state information
(CSI)-limited/free multi-antenna transmit schemes have been recently proposed
in the literature. The idea is to reduce/null the energy costs to be paid by
energy harvesting (EH) IoT nodes from participating in large-scale
time/power-consuming CSI training, but still enable some transmit spatial
gains. In this paper, we take another step forward by proposing a novel
CSI-free rotary antenna beamforming (RAB) WET scheme that outperforms all
state-of-the-art CSI-free schemes in a scenario where a power beacon (PB)
equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) powers a large set of surrounding EH
IoT devices. RAB uses a properly designed CSI-free beamformer combined with a
continuous or periodic rotation of the ULA at the PB to provide average EH
gains that scale as $0.85\sqrt{M}$, where $M$ is the number of PB's antenna
elements. Moreover, a rotation-specific power control mechanism was proposed to
i) fairly optimize the WET process if devices' positioning information is
available, and/or ii) to avoid hazards to human health in terms of specific
absorption rate (SAR). We show that RAB performance even approaches quickly (or
surpasses, for scenarios with sufficiently large number of EH devices, or when
using the proposed power control) the performance of a traditional full-CSI
based transmit scheme, and it is also less sensitive to SAR constraints.
Finally, we discuss important practicalities related to RAB such as its
robustness against non line-of-sight conditions compared to other CSI-free WET
schemes, and its generalizability to scenarios where the PB uses other than a
ULA topology.

contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of
face masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures in many
countries. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the
filtration of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In
particular, in most end-to-end models for airborne virus transmission, it is
neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face
masks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we
consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic person
to a healthy person, both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor
environment. By framing the end-to-end virus transmission as a Molecular
Communications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description of the number
of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations
of the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and
inhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on the stochastic
filtering of IAs by the face masks. Furthermore, we show that the fit of the
face mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability.
We conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment
tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as it encompasses the randomness of the
transmission process and enables comprehensive risk analysis beyond statistical
averages.

notoriously difficult and quickly undecidable, even when restricted to
non-negative weights. For non-negative weights, the largest class that can be
analysed has been introduced by Bouyer, Jaziri and Markey in 2015. Though the
value problem is undecidable, the authors show how to approximate the value by
considering regions with a refined granularity. In this work, we extend this
class to incorporate negative weights, allowing one to model energy for

complexity. A small restriction also allows us to obtain a class of decidable
weighted timed games with negative weights and an arbitrary number of clocks.
In addition, we show that a symbolic algorithm, relying on the paradigm of
value iteration, can be used as an approximation/computation schema over these

same fragments are solvable in polynomial time: this contrasts with the
pseudo-polynomial complexity, known so far, for weighted games without

However, their implementation on conventional hardware (CPU/GPU) results in
high power consumption, making their integration on embedded systems difficult.
In a car for example, embedded algorithms have very high constraints in term of
energy, latency and accuracy. To design more efficient computer vision
algorithms, we propose to follow an end-to-end biologically inspired approach
using event cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Event cameras output
asynchronous and sparse events, providing an incredibly efficient data source,
but processing these events with synchronous and dense algorithms such as CNNs
does not yield any significant benefits. To address this limitation, we use
spiking neural networks (SNNs), which are more biologically realistic neural
networks where units communicate using discrete spikes. Due to the nature of
their operations, they are hardware friendly and energy-efficient, but training
them still remains a challenge. Our method enables the training of sparse
spiking convolutional neural networks directly on event data, using the popular
deep learning framework PyTorch. The performances in terms of accuracy,
sparsity and training time on the popular DVS128 Gesture Dataset make it
possible to use this bio-inspired approach for the future embedding of
real-time applications on low-power neuromorphic hardware.

Temperature Gradient (ITG) eigenmodes, leading in particular to fine-structures

themselves to drive zonal flows via the so-called self-interaction mechanism.
In this paper, the effect of collisions on these processes are studied. In
presence of non-adiabatic electrons, the linear growth rate of ITG eigenmodes
decreases with increasing collisionality. Detailed velocity space analysis of
the distribution function shows that this results from collisions leading to a
more adiabatic-like response of electrons away from MRSs. In linear
simulations, collisions are furthermore found to broaden the radial width of
the fine-structures, which translates to narrower tails of the eigenmode in
extended ballooning space. The characteristic parallel scale length associated
to these tails is shown to scale with the mean free path of electrons. In
nonlinear turbulence simulations accounting for physically relevant values of
collisionality, the fine structures located at MRSs, together with the
associated drive of zonal flows via self-interaction, are shown to persist and

the issue of consistency of all steps of a reduction algorithm with the chosen

produce reduced GMs far from optimality. In particular, the use of the KLD, of

continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental
ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and elegant
mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies
require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian
elements. In this Tutorial, we provide a roadmap for the physics of
non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a
framework to describe the different properties of quantum states in
continuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to
explore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states
can be characterised not only through the negative values of their Wigner
function, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the
related stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with
the question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum
correlations. To answer this question, we first show how non-Gaussian states
can be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian
state. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via
specific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum
non-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand, non-Gaussian
operations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations.
Finally, we will demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate
Bell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end
of the Tutorial, we also provide an overview of several experimental
realisations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond.

preventing malicious activities. However, reliable detection is still a
challenging task, due to a wide variety of botnets involving ever-increasing
types of devices and attack vectors. Recent approaches employing machine
learning (ML) showed improved performance than earlier ones, but these ML-
based approaches still have significant limitations. For example, most ML
approaches can not incorporate sequential pattern analysis techniques key to
detect some classes of botnets. Another common shortcoming of ML-based
approaches is the need to retrain neural networks in order to detect the
evolving botnets; however, the training process is time-consuming and requires
significant efforts to label the training data. For fast-evolving botnets, it
might take too long to create sufficient training samples before the botnets
have changed again. To address these challenges, we propose a novel botnet
detection method, built upon Recurrent Variational Autoencoder (RVAE) that
effectively captures sequential characteristics of botnet activities. In the
experiment, this semi-supervised learning method achieves better detection
accuracy than similar learning methods, especially on hard to detect classes.
Additionally, we devise a transfer learning framework to learn from a
well-curated source data set and transfer the knowledge to a target problem
domain not seen before. Tests show that the true-positive rate (TPR) with
transfer learning is higher than the RVAE semi-supervised learning method
trained using the target data set (91.8% vs. 68.3%).

machine learning problems in distributed manners. The Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) through the concept of consensus variables is a
practical algorithm in this context where its diverse variations and its
performance have been studied in different application areas. In this paper, we
study the effect of the local data sets of users in the distributed learning of
ADMM. Our aim is to deploy variational inequality (VI) to attain an unified

restricted region to induce model misclassification. The threat of this
localized attack has gained significant attention because the adversary can
mount a physically-realizable attack by attaching patches to the victim object.
Recent provably robust defenses generally follow the PatchGuard framework by
using CNNs with small receptive fields and secure feature aggregation for
robust model predictions. In this paper, we extend PatchGuard to PatchGuard++
for provably detecting the adversarial patch attack to boost both provable
robust accuracy and clean accuracy. In PatchGuard++, we first use a CNN with
small receptive fields for feature extraction so that the number of features
corrupted by the adversarial patch is bounded. Next, we apply masks in the
feature space and evaluate predictions on all possible masked feature maps.
Finally, we extract a pattern from all masked predictions to catch the
adversarial patch attack. We evaluate PatchGuard++ on ImageNette (a 10-class
subset of ImageNet), ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 and demonstrate that PatchGuard++
significantly improves the provable robustness and clean performance.

several observational and theoretical motivations to investigate the modified

modified by a phenomenological approach dealing with fractional calculus. At

rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the

visited by the Dawn spacecraft that revealed several areas bearing H$_2$O-ice
features. Independent telescopic observations showed a water exosphere of
currently unknown origin. We explore the effects of meteoroid impacts on Ceres
considering the topography obtained from the Dawn mission using a widely-used
micro-meteoroid model and ray-tracing techniques. Meteoroid populations with
$0.01-2$ mm diameters are considered. We analyze the short-term effects Ceres
experiences during its current orbit as well as long-term effects over the
entire precession cycle. We find the entire surface is subject to meteoroid
bombardment leaving no areas in permanent shadow with respect to meteoroid
influx. The equatorial parts of Ceres produce $80\%$ more ejecta than the polar
regions due to the large impact velocity of long-period comets. Mass flux,
energy flux, and ejecta production vary seasonally by a factor of $3-7$ due to
the inclined eccentric orbit. Compared to Mercury and the Moon, Ceres
experiences significantly smaller effects of micro-meteoroid bombardment, with
a total mass flux of $4.5\pm1.2\times10^{-17}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. On average
Mercury is subjected to a $50\times$ larger mass flux and generates $700\times$
more ejecta than Ceres, while the lunar mass flux is $10\times$ larger, and the
ejecta generation is $30\times$ larger than on Ceres. For these reasons, we
find that meteoroid impacts are an unlikely candidate for the production of a
water exosphere or significant excavation of surface features. The surface
turnover rate from the micro-meteoroid populations considered is estimated to
be $1.25$ Myr on Ceres.

under currently realised experimental performances and with feasible technical
overhead. Realistic gate improvements put 100-photon cluster states within

users via inference APIs. Model extraction attacks occur when a malicious
client uses information gleaned from queries to the inference API of a victim
model $F_V$ to build a surrogate model $F_A$ with comparable functionality.
Recent research has shown successful model extraction of image classification,
and natural language processing models. In this paper, we show the first model
extraction attack against real-world generative adversarial network (GAN) image
translation models. We present a framework for conducting such attacks, and
show that an adversary can successfully extract functional surrogate models by
querying $F_V$ using data from the same domain as the training data for $F_V$.
The adversary need not know $F_V$'s architecture or any other information about
it beyond its intended task. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attacks using
three different instances of two popular categories of image translation: (1)
Selfie-to-Anime and (2) Monet-to-Photo (image style transfer), and (3)
Super-Resolution (super resolution). Using standard performance metrics for
GANs, we show that our attacks are effective. Furthermore, we conducted a large
scale (125 participants) user study on Selfie-to-Anime and Monet-to-Photo to
show that human perception of the images produced by $F_V$ and $F_A$ can be
considered equivalent, within an equivalence bound of Cohen's d = 0.3. Finally,
we show that existing defenses against model extraction attacks (watermarking,
adversarial examples, poisoning) do not extend to image translation models.

extensively studied due to the increasing demand for streaming applications.
Recently proposed Decoder-end Adaptive Computation Steps (DACS) algorithm for
online Transformer ASR was shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance and
outperform other existing methods. However, like any other online approach, the
DACS-based attention heads in each of the Transformer decoder layers operate
independently (or asynchronously) and lead to diverged attending positions.
Since DACS employs a truncation threshold to determine the halting position,
some of the attention weights are cut off untimely and might impact the
stability and precision of decoding. To overcome these issues, here we propose
a head-synchronous (HS) version of the DACS algorithm, where the boundary of
attention is jointly detected by all the DACS heads in each decoder layer. ASR

the proposed method consistently outperforms vanilla DACS and achieves

expresses the pmf $p(x)$ by a single Racah polynomial. We also derive a formula
expressing the cumulative distribution function in terms of a terminating ${}_4

behavior of $P_{n,m,k,l}$ in two types of limit $n \to \infty$. In the first
limit, we fix $k$, $l$ and $m/n$, and show that the asymptotic discrete
distribution is the convolution of two binomial distributions. In the second

three-term recurrence relation of $p(x)$ coming from that of Racah polynomial.
We also describe the asymptotic behavior of the expectation and the variance
beyond the central limit theorem. Based on these asymptotic analysis, we
discuss the degree of asymmetry of the tensor product state $\Xi_{n,m|k,l}$. In

self-generates a variational ansatz for arbitrary eigenstates of a many-body

including long-range two-body gates accelerates the convergence of both
algorithms in the nonintegrable regime. We also study the scaling of the number

probability of lifetime ruin. Moreover, when wealth is negative, the optimal
amount invested in the risky asset increases as the hazard rate of the

an asymptotic expansion of the minimum probability of lifetime exponential

interesting to find that, for small values of this hazard rate, the minimum
probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin is proportional to the
minimum occupation time studied in Bayraktar and Young, and the proportion

covariates from observational data. Available methods such as inverse
propensity sampling weighting are not designed to handle missing values, which
are however common in both data sources. In addition to coupling the
assumptions for causal effect identifiability and for the missing values
mechanism and to defining appropriate estimation strategies, one difficulty is
to consider the specific structure of the data with two sources and treatment
and outcome only available in the RCT. We propose three multiple imputation
strategies to handle missing values when generalizing treatment effects, each
handling the multi-source structure of the problem differently (separate
imputation, joint imputation with fixed effect, joint imputation ignoring
source information). As an alternative to multiple imputation, we also propose
a direct estimation approach that treats incomplete covariates as semi-discrete
variables. The multiple imputation strategies and the latter alternative rely
on different sets of assumptions concerning the impact of missing values on
identifiability. We discuss these assumptions and assess the methods through an
extensive simulation study. This work is motivated by the analysis of a large
registry of over 20,000 major trauma patients and an RCT studying the effect of
tranexamic acid administration on mortality in major trauma patients admitted
to ICU. The analysis illustrates how the missing values handling can impact the
conclusion about the effect generalized from the RCT to the target population.

a promising lever to overcome the decline in ES and generate win-win solutions

such an approach by focusing on incentives for managed pollination targeting
either beekeepers or farmers who were either in communication with each other
or not. We used a stylized bioeconomic model to simulate (i) the mutual
interdependency through pollination in intensive agricultural landscapes and
(ii) the economic and ecological impacts of introducing two beekeeping
subsidies and one pesticide tax. The findings showed that incentives generated
a spillover effect, affecting not only targeted stakeholders but non-targeted
stakeholders as well as the landscape, and that this effect was amplified by
communication. However, none of the simulated types of polycentric ES
governance proved sustainable overall: subsidies showed excellent economic but
low environmental performance, while the tax led to economic losses but was
beneficial for the landscape. Based on these results, we identified three
conditions for sustainable ES governance based on communication between
stakeholders and incentives: (i) strong mutual interdependency (i.e. few
alternatives exist for stakeholders), (ii) the benefits of communication
outweigh the costs, and (iii) the incentivized ES drivers are not detrimental
to other ES. Further research is needed to systematize which combination of
individual payments and collaboration are sustainable in which conditions.

mobile autonomous systems must be able to efficiently deal with obstacles in
the area of operation. In the context of optimization based trajectory planning
and control a number of different approaches to formulate collision avoidance
constraints can be found in the literature. Here the contribution of the
present work is twofold. First, the most popular methods to represent obstacles
are summarized, namely the simple ellipsoidal representation, the constructive
solid geometry (CSG) method as well as a direct and an indirect implementation
of a signed distance based approach. The formulations are characterized with
respect to the impact on the complexity of the optimization problem, as well as
the ability to meet different problem requirements. Second, this work presents
a novel variant of the CSG method to describe collision avoidance constraints.
It is highly efficient due to a very low number of nonlinear inequality
constraints required for a given number of obstacles and sample points and in
contrast to the original CSG formulation allows to consider the controlled
system's shape. The good performance of the proposed formulation is
demonstrated by a comparison to the previously mentioned alternatives. To this
end optimal trajectory planning for marine surface vessels formulated as a
nonlinear programming problem is used as a benchmark example where the scenario
is designed based on the maritime test field in Kiel, Germany.

  Deployment","Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emergence of CNNs in mainstream deployment has necessitated methods to
design and train efficient architectures tailored to maximize the accuracy
under diverse hardware & latency constraints. To scale these resource-intensive
tasks with an increasing number of deployment targets, Once-For-All (OFA)
proposed an approach to jointly train several models at once with a constant
training cost. However, this cost remains as high as 40-50 GPU days and also
suffers from a combinatorial explosion of sub-optimal model configurations. We
seek to reduce this search space -- and hence the training budget -- by
constraining search to models close to the accuracy-latency Pareto frontier. We
incorporate insights of compound relationships between model dimensions to
build CompOFA, a design space smaller by several orders of magnitude. Through
experiments on ImageNet, we demonstrate that even with simple heuristics we can
achieve a 2x reduction in training time and 216x speedup in model
search/extraction time compared to the state of the art, without loss of Pareto
optimality! We also show that this smaller design space is dense enough to
support equally accurate models for a similar diversity of hardware and latency
targets, while also reducing the complexity of the training and subsequent
extraction algorithms.

e-learning thanks to their great flexibility. However, due to large numbers of
learners and their diverse backgrounds, it is taxing to offer real-time
support. Learners may post their feelings of confusion and struggle in the
respective MOOC forums, but with the large volume of posts and high workloads
for MOOC instructors, it is unlikely that the instructors can identify all
learners requiring intervention. This problem has been studied as a Natural
Language Processing (NLP) problem recently, and is known to be challenging, due
to the imbalance of the data and the complex nature of the task. In this paper,
we explore for the first time Bayesian deep learning on learner-based text
posts with two methods: Monte Carlo Dropout and Variational Inference, as a new
solution to assessing the need of instructor interventions for a learner's
post. We compare models based on our proposed methods with probabilistic
modelling to its baseline non-Bayesian models under similar circumstances, for
different cases of applying prediction. The results suggest that Bayesian deep
learning offers a critical uncertainty measure that is not supplied by
traditional neural networks. This adds more explainability, trust and
robustness to AI, which is crucial in education-based applications.
Additionally, it can achieve similar or better performance compared to
non-probabilistic neural networks, as well as grant lower variance.

the explicit dynamical equations derived from the periodically forced Kuramoto
model, we found that the heterogeneous field can disrupt entrainment at
different field frequencies when compared to the homogeneous field. This
transition occurs when the phase- and frequency-locked synchronization between

group to enter a new dynamical state (disrupted state). Strikingly, it is shown
that disrupted dynamics can differ between groups.

two main steps: firstly, a local reduction of the computation of the $p$-adic
\'etale cohomology of a smooth variety over a $p$-adic local field to a Galois
cohomology computation and then, the establishment of a link between the latter
and differential forms. These relations are organized through Faltings ringed
topos whose definition relies on the choice of an integral model of the
variety, and whose good properties depend on the (logarithmic) smoothness of
this model. Scholze's generalization for rigid analytic varieties has the
advantage of depending only on the variety (i.e. the generic fibre). Inspired
by Deligne's approach to classical Hodge theory for singular varieties, we
establish a cohomological descent result for the structural sheaf of Faltings
topos, which makes it possible to extend Faltings' approach to any integral
model, i.e. without any smoothness assumption. An essential ingredient of our
proof is a descent result of perfectoid algebras in the arc-topology due to
Bhatt and Scholze. As an application of our cohomological descent, using a
variant of de Jong's alteration theorem for morphisms of schemes due to
Gabber-Illusie-Temkin, we generalize Faltings' main $p$-adic comparison theorem
to any proper and finitely presented morphism of coherent schemes over an
absolute integral closure of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (without any assumption of
smoothness) for torsion \'etale sheaves (not necessarily finite locally
constant). As a second application, we prove a local version of the relative

expression, obtained on the basis of second-order phase perturbation theory,
for the contribution to the mean differential reflection coefficient from the
light scattered diffusely by the rough surface. The inversion scheme is
validated by using several sets of computer generated scattering data for rough
silver surfaces defined by Gaussian surface height correlation functions. The
reconstructions obtained by this approach are found to be rather accurate for
weakly rough surfaces illuminated by p- and s-polarized incident light; this is
also true in cases where the contributions to the input data from multiple
scattering of surface plasmon polaritons is not insignificant. Finally, the
inversion scheme is applied to experimental scattering data obtained for
characterized two-dimensional randomly rough gold surfaces, and the results
obtained in this way, compare favorably to what is obtained by directly
analyzing the surface morphology. Such results testify to the attractiveness of
the computationally efficient inversion scheme that we propose.

an energy gap and is located below the hole branch in the excitation spectrum.
The anomaly temperature is found to be of the same order of the energy of the

The dynamic structure factor is computed with the Path Integral Monte Carlo

to significantly affect the dynamics of slow magnetoacoustic (MA) waves,
causing amplification or attenuation, and also dispersion. However, the entropy
mode is also excited in such a thermodynamically active plasma and is affected
by the heating/cooling misbalance too. This mode is usually associated with the
phenomenon of coronal rain and formation of prominences. Unlike the adiabatic
plasmas, the properties and evolution of slow MA and entropy waves in
continuously heated and cooling plasmas get mixed. Different regimes of the
misbalance lead to a variety of scenarios for the initial perturbation to
evolve. In order to describe properties and evolution of slow MA and entropy
waves in various regimes of the misbalance, we obtained an exact analytical
solution of the linear evolutionary equation. Using the characteristic
timescales and the obtained exact solution, we identified regimes with
qualitatively different behaviour of slow MA and entropy modes. For some of
those regimes, the spatio-temporal evolution of the initial Gaussian pulse is
shown. In particular, it is shown that slow MA modes may have a range of
non-propagating harmonics. In this regime, perturbations caused by slow MA and
entropy modes in a low-$\beta$ plasma would look identically in observations,
as non-propagating disturbances of the plasma density (and temperature) either
growing or decaying with time. We also showed that the partition of the initial
energy between slow MA and entropy modes depends on the properties of the
heating and cooling processes involved. The obtained exact analytical solution
could be further applied to the interpretation of observations and results of
numerical modelling of slow MA waves in the corona and the formation and
evolution of coronal rain.

London riots of 2011. This addition allows us to consider long travel distances
in a city for potential rioting population. This is achieved by introducing
public transport networks, which modifies the perceived travel distance between
the population and likely targets. Using this more general formulation, we
applied the model to the typical Griffin and Ford pattern for population
distribution to describe the general features of most large Latin American
cities. The possibility of long-range traveling by part of the general
population has, for an immediate consequence, the existence of isolated spots
more prone to suffer from rioting activity, as they are easier to reach than
the rest of the city. These areas finally made it easier to control the
eventual disorder by part of police forces. The reason for this outcome is that
transport networks turn riots into highly localized and intense events. They
are attracting a large police contingent, which will later extinguish the
remaining disorder activity on the rest of the city. Therefore, working
transport networks in a city effectively reduces the number of police force
contingent required to control public disorder. This result, we must remark, is
valid only if the model requisites for order forces are satisfied: extra police
contingent can be added swiftly as required, and these forces can move around
the city with total freedom.

$\omega$-category (defined as the homology of its Street nerve) with its
polygraphic homology. More precisely, we prove that both homologies generally
do not coincide and call homologically coherent the particular strict
$\omega$-categories for which polygraphic homology and homology of the nerve do
coincide. The goal pursued is to find abstract and concrete criteria to detect
homologically coherent $\omega$-categories. For example, we prove that all
(small) categories, considered as strict $\omega$-categories with unit cells
above dimension 1, are homologically coherent. We also introduce the notion of
bubble-free 2-category and conjecture that a cofibrant 2-category is
homologically coherent if and only if it is bubble-free. We also prove
important results concerning free strict $\omega$-categories on polygraphs
(also known as computads), such as the fact that if F is a discrete Conduch\'e
$\omega$-functor from C to D and if D is a free strict $\omega$-category on a
polygraph, then so is C. Overall, this thesis achieves to build a general
framework in which to study the homology of strict $\omega$-categories using
tools of abstract homotopical algebra such as Quillen's theory of model
categories or Grothendieck's theory of derivators.

training, our proposed CAGAN improves the state of the art on the IS and FID on
the CUB dataset and the FID on the more challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that judging a model by a single evaluation metric can be

image. Typical learning-based approaches implement their solutions by
minimizing the L1 or L2 distance between the output and the reference sharp
image. Recent attempts adopt visual recognition features in training to improve
the perceptual quality. However, those features are primarily designed to
capture high-level contexts rather than low-level structures such as
blurriness. Instead, we propose a more direct way to make images sharper by
exploiting the inverse task of deblurring, namely, reblurring. Reblurring
amplifies the remaining blur to rebuild the original blur, however, a
well-deblurred clean image with zero-magnitude blur is hard to reblur. Thus, we
design two types of reblurring loss functions for better deblurring. The
supervised reblurring loss at training stage compares the amplified blur
between the deblurred and the sharp images. The self-supervised reblurring loss
at inference stage inspects if there noticeable blur remains in the deblurred.
Our experimental results on large-scale benchmarks and real images demonstrate
the effectiveness of the reblurring losses in improving the perceptual quality
of the deblurred images in terms of NIQE and LPIPS scores as well as visual
sharpness.

distinguishes them from chance-alignment micro-lensing events. Through
self-lensing we can investigate long - but previously hidden - stages of binary
evolution and consequently provide new constraints on evolutionary models which

from healthcare to hiring requires their responsible use, particularly in model

more information to help users to understand model decisions, yet this
additional knowledge exposes additional risks for privacy attacks. Hence,
providing explanation harms privacy. We study this risk for image-based model
inversion attacks and identified several attack architectures with increasing
performance to reconstruct private image data from model explanations. We have
developed several multi-modal transposed CNN architectures that achieve
significantly higher inversion performance than using the target model
prediction only. These XAI-aware inversion models were designed to exploit the
spatial knowledge in image explanations. To understand which explanations have
higher privacy risk, we analyzed how various explanation types and factors
influence inversion performance. In spite of some models not providing
explanations, we further demonstrate increased inversion performance even for
non-explainable target models by exploiting explanations of surrogate models
through attention transfer. This method first inverts an explanation from the
target prediction, then reconstructs the target image. These threats highlight
the urgent and significant privacy risks of explanations and calls attention
for new privacy preservation techniques that balance the dual-requirement for
AI explainability and privacy.

  AI-Enabled Networks","Accepted in IEEE Network Magazine",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The COVID-19 pandemic, which spread rapidly in late 2019, has revealed that
the use of computing and communication technologies provides significant aid in
preventing, controlling, and combating infectious diseases. With the ongoing
research in next-generation networking (NGN), the use of secure and reliable
communication and networking is of utmost importance when dealing with users'
health records and other sensitive information. Through the adaptation of
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled NGN, the shape of healthcare systems can
be altered to achieve smart and secure healthcare capable of coping with
epidemics that may emerge at any given moment. In this article, we envision a
cooperative and distributed healthcare framework that relies on
state-of-the-art computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities,
namely, Federated Learning (FL), mobile edge computing (MEC), and Blockchain,
to enable epidemic (or suspicious infectious disease) discovery, remote
monitoring, and fast health-authority response. The introduced framework can
also enable secure medical data exchange at the edge and between different
health entities. Such a technique, coupled with the low latency and high
bandwidth functionality of 5G and beyond networks, would enable mass
surveillance, monitoring and analysis to occur at the edge. Challenges, issues,
and design guidelines are also discussed in this article with highlights on
some trending solutions.

bio-mimicry, discussed from the perspectives of information asymmetry,
individual utility and its optimization via strategic interactions involving
co-evolving preys (e.g., insects) and predators (e.g., reptiles) who learn.
Formally, we consider a panmictic ecosystem, occupied by species of prey with
relatively short lifespan, which evolve mimicry signals over generations as
they interact with predators with relatively longer lifespans, thus endowing
predators with the ability to learn prey signals. Every prey sends a signal and
provides utility to the predator. The prey can be either nutritious or toxic to
the predator, but the prey may signal (possibly) deceptively without revealing
its true ""type."" The model is used to study the situation where multi-armed
bandit predators with zero prior information are introduced into the ecosystem.
As a result of exploration and exploitation the predators naturally select the
prey that result in the evolution of those signals. This co-evolution of
strategies produces a variety of interesting phenomena which are subjects of
this paper.

centrifugal HVAC fan at an off-design operation point where tonal noise
increases. The simulations are performed by coupling IDDES with the FW-H
acoustic analogy, and the experiments are conducted in a rig consisting of a
plenum chamber and a reverberation room. In contrast to typical tonal noise
sources induced by the fan blades, we find out that another predominant source
is the turbulence stemming from the gap between the fan shroud and the inlet
duct. The turbulence evolves along with the shroud and is swept downstream to
interact with the top side of the blade leading edge. The interaction accounts
for uneven surface pressure distribution on the blades. Moreover, the pressure
is significantly unsteady near the shroud. The power spectral density (PSD) of
the noise shows obvious tones at 273Hz that is approximately equal to the
difference of the blade passing frequency (BPF0) and the fan rotation
frequency. By coarsening the mesh resolution near the inlet gap and shroud, we
artificially deactivate the gap turbulence in the numerical simulations and,
consequently, detect that the tone at 273Hz disappears completely. At this
frequency, the PSD contours of surface pressure fluctuations are found potent
at the inlet gap and the blade top side only if the gap turbulence is resolved.
These findings indicate that the tonal noise source at 273Hz is the interaction
between the gap turbulence and blades. As the gap turbulence exists near the
shroud wall upstream of the blades, the rotating wall introduces rotational
momentum into the turbulence due to the wall friction. Hence the tonal
frequency of the interaction is smaller than BPF0 with a decrement of the fan
rotation frequency. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that
voluteless centrifugal fans are studied for the noise generation from the gap
turbulence.

  Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (kPOD)",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reduced-order models are essential tools to deal with parametric problems in
the context of optimization, uncertainty quantification, or control and inverse
problems. The set of parametric solutions lies in a low-dimensional manifold
(with dimension equal to the number of independent parameters) embedded in a
large-dimensional space (dimension equal to the number of degrees of freedom of
the full-order discrete model). A posteriori model reduction is based on
constructing a basis from a family of snapshots (solutions of the full-order
model computed offline), and then use this new basis to solve the subsequent
instances online. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) reduces the problem
into a linear subspace of lower dimension, eliminating redundancies in the
family of snapshots. The strategy proposed here is to use a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique, namely the kernel Principal Component
Analysis (kPCA), in order to find a nonlinear manifold, with an expected much
lower dimension, and to solve the problem in this low-dimensional manifold.
Guided by this paradigm, the methodology devised here introduces different
novel ideas, namely: 1) characterizing the nonlinear manifold using local
tangent spaces, where the reduced-order problem is linear and based on the
neighbouring snapshots, 2) the approximation space is enriched with the
cross-products of the snapshots, introducing a quadratic description, 3) the
kernel for kPCA is defined ad-hoc, based on physical considerations, and 4) the
iterations in the reduced-dimensional space are performed using an algorithm
based on a Delaunay tessellation of the cloud of snapshots in the reduced
space. The resulting computational strategy is performing outstandingly in the
numerical tests, alleviating many of the problems associated with POD and
improving the numerical accuracy.

used in everyday applications that require transcribing speech to text in
real-time. Their minimal latency makes them suitable for such tasks. Unlike
their non-streaming counterparts, streaming models are constrained to be causal
with no future context and suffer from higher word error rates (WER). To
improve streaming models, a recent study [1] proposed to distill a
non-streaming teacher model on unsupervised utterances, and then train a
streaming student using the teachers' predictions. However, the performance gap
between teacher and student WERs remains high. In this paper, we aim to close
this gap by using a diversified set of non-streaming teacher models and
combining them using Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER). In
particular, we show that, despite being weaker than RNN-T models, CTC models
are remarkable teachers. Further, by fusing RNN-T and CTC models together, we
build the strongest teachers. The resulting student models drastically improve
upon streaming models of previous work [1]: the WER decreases by 41% on
Spanish, 27% on Portuguese, and 13% on French.

the classes they have been trained for. Runtime monitoring techniques on the

approach for monitoring classification systems via data abstraction. Data
abstraction relies on the notion of box with a resolution. Box-based
abstraction consists in representing a set of values by its minimal and maximal
values in each dimension. We augment boxes with a notion of resolution and
define their clustering coverage, which is intuitively a quantitative metric
that indicates the abstraction quality. This allows studying the effect of
different clustering parameters on the constructed boxes and estimating an
interval of sub-optimal parameters. Moreover, we automatically construct
monitors that leverage both the correct and incorrect behaviors of a system.
This allows checking the size of the monitor abstractions and analyzing the
separability of the network. Monitors are obtained by combining the
sub-monitors of each class of the system placed at some selected layers. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our clustering coverage estimation
and show how to assess the effectiveness and precision of monitors according to
the selected clustering parameter and monitored layers.

Explainable AI (XAI) is the key to unlocking AI and the black-box for deep

differentiate COVID-19 findings from other lung diseases. However, how these AI

divergence-free (equilibrated) part of a general (non-equilibrated) field is

the generalization of the Helmholtz decomposition of a vector field into the
sum of an irrotational field and a solenoidal field. The combination of: a) the
