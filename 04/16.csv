at generating a high-resolution (HR) slow-motion video from a low-resolution
(LR) and low frame rate (LFR) video sequence. A na\""ive method is to decompose
it into two sub-tasks: video frame interpolation (VFI) and video
super-resolution (VSR). Nevertheless, temporal interpolation and spatial
upscaling are intra-related in this problem. Two-stage approaches cannot fully
make use of this natural property. Besides, state-of-the-art VFI or VSR deep
networks usually have a large frame reconstruction module in order to obtain
high-quality photo-realistic video frames, which makes the two-stage approaches
have large models and thus be relatively time-consuming. To overcome the
issues, we present a one-stage space-time video super-resolution framework,
which can directly reconstruct an HR slow-motion video sequence from an input
LR and LFR video. Instead of reconstructing missing LR intermediate frames as
VFI models do, we temporally interpolate LR frame features of the missing LR
frames capturing local temporal contexts by a feature temporal interpolation
module. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed framework not only achieves better qualitative and quantitative
performance on both clean and noisy LR frames but also is several times faster
than recent state-of-the-art two-stage networks. The source code is released in

the Fisher-Snedecor and studentized probabilistic distributions and is proven
without any additional assumptions; in particular, the standard ANOVA
assumptions (independence, normality, and homoscedasticity (INAH)) are not
needed. In contrast, it is known that for a sample with k > 2 groups of
observations, even under the INAH assumptions, with the same significance level
$\alpha$, the above two tests may give opposite results: (i) ANOVA rejects its
null hypothesis $H_0^{A}: \mu_1 = \ldots = \mu_k$, while the TK one,
$H_0^{TK}(i,j): \mu_i = \mu_j$, is not rejected for any pair $i, j \in \{1,

infinite pseudo-random families of samples of both types satisfying INAH: in

in case (ii) ANOVA, being restricted to the pair of groups $(i,j)$, may reject
equality $\mu_i = \mu_j$ with the same $\alpha$. This is an obvious
contradiction, since $\mu_1 = \ldots = \mu_k$ implies $\mu_i = \mu_j$ for all

Generation. In the context of Sentence Simplification, this is particularly
challenging: the task requires by nature to replace complex words with simpler
ones that shares the same meaning. This limits the effectiveness of n-gram
based metrics like BLEU. Going hand in hand with the recent advances in NLG,
new metrics have been proposed, such as BERTScore for Machine Translation. In
summarization, the QuestEval metric proposes to automatically compare two texts
by questioning them.

it to tackle Sentence Simplification. We then extensively evaluate the
correlations w.r.t. human judgement for several metrics including the recent
BERTScore and QuestEval, and show that the latter obtain state-of-the-art
correlations, outperforming standard metrics like BLEU and SARI. More
importantly, we also show that a large part of the correlations are actually
spurious for all the metrics. To investigate this phenomenon further, we
release a new corpus of evaluated simplifications, this time not generated by
systems but instead, written by humans. This allows us to remove the spurious
correlations and draw very different conclusions from the original ones,
resulting in a better understanding of these metrics. In particular, we raise
concerns about very low correlations for most of traditional metrics. Our
results show that the only significant measure of the Meaning Preservation is
our adaptation of QuestEval.

and for many applications it is desirable to have a universally programmable
circuit, able to implement an arbitrary unitary transformation on a number of
modes. This has been achieved using the Reck scheme, consisting of a network of
Mach Zehnder interferometers containing a variable phase shifter in one path,
as well as an external phase shifter after each Mach Zehnder. It subsequently
became apparent that with symmetric Mach Zehnders containing a phase shift in
both paths, the external phase shifts are redundant, resulting in a more
compact circuit. The rectangular Clements scheme improves on the Reck scheme in
terms of circuit depth, but it has been thought that an external phase-shifter
was necessary after each Mach Zehnder. Here, we show that the Clements scheme
can be realised using symmetric Mach Zehnders, requiring only a small number of
external phase-shifters that do not contribute to the depth of the circuit.
This will result in a significant saving in the length of these devices,
allowing more complex circuits to fit onto a photonic chip, and reducing the
propagation losses associated with these circuits. We also discuss how similar
savings can be made to alternative schemes which have robustness to imbalanced
beam-splitters.

major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions
are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while
suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention
Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and
Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to
suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves
high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two
modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to
obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration
during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the
inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied
it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently
improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention
mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters
and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich
texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that
BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.

both Byzantine and rational behavior without the need for agents to reach
consensus on executed transactions. Recent work [5, 10, 15] has shown that
distributed monetary systems do not require consensus and can operate using a
broadcast primitive with weaker guarantees, such as reliable broadcast.
However, these protocols assume that some number of agents may be Byzantine and
the remaining agents are perfectly correct. For the application of a monetary
system in which the agents are real people with economic interests, the
assumption that agents are perfectly correct may be too strong. We expand upon
this line of thought by weakening the assumption of correctness and instead
adopting a fault tolerance model which allows up to $t < \frac{N}{3}$ agents to
be Byzantine and the remaining agents to be rational. A rational agent is one
which will deviate from the protocol if it is in their own best interest. Under
this fault tolerance model, Hearsay implements a monetary system in which all
rational agents achieve agreement on executed transactions. Moreover, Hearsay
requires only a single broadcast per transaction. In order to incentivize
rational agents to behave correctly in Hearsay, agents are rewarded with
transaction fees for participation in the protocol and punished for noticeable
deviations from the protocol. Additionally, Hearsay uses a novel broadcast
primitive called Rational Reliable Broadcast to ensure that agents can
broadcast messages under Hearsay's fault tolerance model. Rational Reliable
Broadcast achieves equivalent guarantees to Byzantine Reliable Broadcast [7]
but can tolerate the presence of rational agents. To show this, we prove that
following the Rational Reliable Broadcast protocol constitutes a Nash
equilibrium between rational agents and may therefore be of independent
interest.

prebiotic chemistry to young planetary surfaces. However, the assumption that
some of the molecules observed in cometary comae at millimetre wavelengths
originate from ices stored inside the nucleus has not yet been proven. In fact,
the comae of moderately-active comets reach sufficient densities within a few
thousand kilometers of the nucleus for an active (solar radiation-driven)
photochemistry to ensue. Here we present results from our latest
chemical-hydrodynamic models incorporating an updated reaction network, and
show that the commonly-observed HC3N (cyanoacetylene) and NH2CHO (formamide)
molecules can be efficiently produced in cometary comae as a result of
two-body, neutral-neutral, gas-phase reactions involving well-known coma gases.
In the presence of a near-nucleus distributed source of CN (similar to that
observed by the Rosetta spacecraft at comet 67P), we find that sufficient
HC$_3$N and NH2CHO can be synthesized to match the abundances of these

through interferometric mapping observations, for example, using the Atacama

have set a new standard for many NLP tasks, there is not yet a complete
accounting of their inner workings. In particular, it is not entirely clear
what aspects of sentence-level syntax are captured by these representations,
nor how (if at all) they are built along the stacked layers of the network. In
this paper, we aim to address such questions with a general class of
interventional, input perturbation-based analyses of representations from
pretrained language models. Importing from computational and cognitive
neuroscience the notion of representational invariance, we perform a series of
probes designed to test the sensitivity of these representations to several
kinds of structure in sentences. Each probe involves swapping words in a
sentence and comparing the representations from perturbed sentences against the
original. We experiment with three different perturbations: (1) random
permutations of n-grams of varying width, to test the scale at which a
representation is sensitive to word position; (2) swapping of two spans which
do or do not form a syntactic phrase, to test sensitivity to global phrase
structure; and (3) swapping of two adjacent words which do or do not break
apart a syntactic phrase, to test sensitivity to local phrase structure.
  Results from these probes collectively suggest that Transformers build
sensitivity to larger parts of the sentence along their layers, and that
hierarchical phrase structure plays a role in this process. More broadly, our
results also indicate that structured input perturbations widens the scope of
analyses that can be performed on often-opaque deep learning systems, and can
serve as a complement to existing tools (such as supervised linear probes) for
interpreting complex black-box models.

three `longitudinal' and eight `transverse' directions, related only by
Galilean rather than Lorentzian symmetries. This generalises the
ten-dimensional stringy Newton-Cartan (SNC) theory. In order to obtain a finite
limit, the field strength of the eleven-dimensional four-form is required to
obey a transverse self-duality constraint, ultimately due to the presence of
the Chern-Simons term in eleven dimensions. The finite action then gives a set
of equations that is invariant under longitudinal and transverse rotations,
Galilean boosts and local dilatations. We supplement these equations with an
extra Poisson equation, coming from the subleading action. Reduction along a
longitudinal direction gives the known SNC theory with the addition of RR gauge
fields, while reducing along a transverse direction yields a new
non-relativistic theory associated to D2 branes. We further show that the MNC
theory can be embedded in the U-duality symmetric formulation of exceptional
field theory, demonstrating that it shares the same exceptional Lie algebraic
symmetries as the relativistic supergravity, and providing an alternative

quantum dot spin qubits will be necessary for their scalability. One way of
achieving it is to simply move the electron between two quantum registers.
Precise control over the electron shuttling through a chain of tunnel-coupled
quantum dots is possible when interdot energy detunings are changed
adiabatically. Deterministic character of shuttling is however endangered by
coupling of the transferred electron to thermal reservoirs: sources of
fluctuations of electric fields, and lattice vibrations. We theoretically
analyse how the electron transfer between two quantum dots is affected by
electron-phonon scattering, and interaction with sources of $1/f$ and Johnson
charge noise in both detuning and tunnel coupling. The electron-phonon
scattering turns out to be irrelevant in Si quantum dots, while a competition
between the effects of charge noise and Landau-Zener effect leads to an
existence of optimal detuning sweep rate, at which probability of leaving the
electron behind is minimal. In GaAs quantum dots, on the other hand, coupling
to phonons is strong enough to make the phonon-assisted processes of interdot
transfer dominate over influence of charge noise. The probability of leaving
the electron behind depends then monotonically on detuning sweep rate, and
values much smaller than in silicon can be obtained for slow sweeps. However,
after taking into account limitations on transfer time imposed by need for
preservation of electron's spin coherence, minimal probabilities of leaving the
electron behind in both GaAs- and Si-based double quantum dots turn out to be
of the same order of magnitude. Bringing them down below $10^{-3}$ requires
temperatures $\leq \! 100$ mK and tunnel couplings above $20$ $\mu$eV.

techniques such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM). However, they also come with
nonstraightforward parallelism and complicated memory access patterns. In this
work, we address this problem with a simple yet surprisingly powerful
observation: operations on sets of vertices, such as intersection or union,
form a large part of many complex graph mining algorithms, and can offer rich
and simple parallelism at multiple levels. This observation drives our
cross-layer design, in which we (1) expose set operations using a novel
programming paradigm, (2) express and execute these operations efficiently with
carefully designed set-centric ISA extensions called SISA, and (3) use PIM to
accelerate SISA instructions. The key design idea is to alleviate the bandwidth
needs of SISA instructions by mapping set operations to two types of PIM:
in-DRAM bulk bitwise computing for bitvectors representing high-degree
vertices, and near-memory logic layers for integer arrays representing
low-degree vertices. Set-centric SISA-enhanced algorithms are efficient and
outperform hand-tuned baselines, offering more than 10x speedup over the
established Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for listing maximal cliques. We deliver
more than 10 SISA set-centric algorithm formulations, illustrating SISA's wide
applicability.

to update parameters. Gradients per parameter are averaged over a set of data
and this has been presumed to be safe for privacy-preserving training in joint,
collaborative, and federated learning applications. Prior work only showed the
possibility of recovering input data given gradients under very restrictive
conditions - a single input point, or a network with no non-linearities, or a
small 32x32 px input batch. Therefore, averaging gradients over larger batches
was thought to be safe. In this work, we introduce GradInversion, using which
input images from a larger batch (8 - 48 images) can also be recovered for
large networks such as ResNets (50 layers), on complex datasets such as
ImageNet (1000 classes, 224x224 px). We formulate an optimization task that
converts random noise into natural images, matching gradients while
regularizing image fidelity. We also propose an algorithm for target class
label recovery given gradients. We further propose a group consistency
regularization framework, where multiple agents starting from different random
seeds work together to find an enhanced reconstruction of original data batch.
We show that gradients encode a surprisingly large amount of information, such
that all the individual images can be recovered with high fidelity via
GradInversion, even for complex datasets, deep networks, and large batch sizes.

solar dynamo is a difficult, yet crucial, task. Without such knowledge, the
full picture of the operation mechanism of the solar dynamo cannot be formed.
The magnetic helicity spectrum provides important information about the
$\alpha$ effect. Here we demonstrate a formalism in spherical geometry to infer
magnetic helicity spectra directly from observations of the magnetic field,
taking into account the sign change of magnetic helicity across the Sun's
equator. Using an angular correlation function of the magnetic field, we
develop a method to infer spectra for magnetic energy and helicity. The
retrieval of the latter relies on a fundamental definition of helicity in terms
of linkage of magnetic flux. We apply the two-scale approach, previously used
in Cartesian geometry, to spherical geometry for systems where a sign reversal
of helicity is expected across the equator at both small and large scales. We
test the method by applying it to an analytical model of a fully helical field,
and to magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a turbulent dynamo. The helicity
spectra computed from the vector potential available in the models are in
excellent agreement to the spectra computed solely from the magnetic field
using our method. In a next test, we use our method to obtain the helicity
spectrum from a synoptic magnetic field map corresponding to a Carrington
rotation. We observe clear signs of a bihelical spectrum of magnetic helicity.
Our formalism makes it possible to infer magnetic helicity in spherical
geometry, without the necessity of computing the magnetic vector potential.
This has the advantage of being gauge invariant. It has many applications in
solar and stellar observations, but can also be used to analyze global
magnetoconvection models of stars and compare them with observations.

effect of viscosity on the phase shifts was found negligible. The role of
radiative losses along with h/c imbalance for chosen specific heating function
($H(\rho, T) \propto \rho^{-0.5} T^{-3}$) in determining phase shifts, is found
to be significant for the high density and low temperature loops. The h/c
imbalance can increase the phase difference ($\Delta \phi \approx 140^\circ$)
for low temperature loops compared to the constant heating case ($\Delta \phi
\approx 30^\circ$). We derive a general expression for the polytropic index. We
find that in the presence of thermal conduction alone, the polytropic index
remains close to its classical value for all the considered $\rho_0$ and $T_0$.
However, it reduces to a value $1.2$ when loop density is decreased by an order
of magnitude compared to its normal coronal value. We find that the inclusion
of radiative losses, with or without h/c imbalance, cannot explain the observed
polytropic index. The thermal ratio ($d$) needs to be enhanced by an order of
magnitude, in order to explain its observed value $1.1 \pm 0.02$ in the solar
loops. We also explore the role of different heating functions for typical
coronal parameters and found that although the polytropic index remains close
to its classical value, the phase difference is highly dependent on the form of
heating function (The abstract is restructured for arxiv).

largely unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce SummVis, an
open-source tool for visualizing abstractive summaries that enables
fine-grained analysis of the models, data, and evaluation metrics associated
with text summarization. Through its lexical and semantic visualizations, the
tools offers an easy entry point for in-depth model prediction exploration

due to rapid generation of quantum entanglement between remote degrees of
freedom. A promising approach to tackle this challenge, which has been proposed
recently, is to characterize the quantum dynamics of a many-body system and its
properties as a bath via the Feynman-Vernon influence matrix (IM), which is an
operator in the space of time trajectories of local degrees of freedom.
Physical understanding of the general scaling of the IM's temporal entanglement
and its relation to basic dynamical properties is highly incomplete to present
day. In this Article, we analytically compute the exact IM for a family of
integrable Floquet models - the transverse-field kicked Ising chain - finding a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like ""wavefunction"" on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour
with algebraically decaying correlations. We demonstrate that the IM exhibits
area-law temporal entanglement scaling for all parameter values. Furthermore,
the entanglement pattern of the IM reveals the system's phase diagram,
exhibiting jumps across transitions between distinct Floquet phases. Near
criticality, a non-trivial scaling behavior of temporal entanglement is found.
The area-law temporal entanglement allows us to efficiently describe the
effects of sizeable integrability-breaking perturbations for long evolution
times by using matrix product state methods. This work shows that tensor
network methods are efficient in describing the effect of non-interacting baths
on open quantum systems, and provides a new approach to studying quantum
many-body systems with weakly broken integrability.

resolvable with the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). Long-baseline
detections to the phased Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in

investigate the effect of aspect ratio - the ratio of the blade span to rotor
diameter - on the performance of a straight-bladed cross-flow turbine in a

parameters are held constant, including the relative confinement, Froude
number, and Reynolds number. The coefficient of performance is found to be
invariant for the range of aspect ratios tested (0.95 - 1.63), which we ascribe
to minimal blade-support interactions for this turbine design. Finally, a
subset of experiments is repeated without controlling for the Froude number and
the coefficient of performance is found to increase, a consequence of Froude
number variation that could mistakenly be ascribed to aspect ratio. This
highlights the importance of rigorous experimental design when exploring the
effect of geometric parameters on cross-flow turbine performance.

spectroscopically analyzing a sample of three massive overcontact binaries at

perform an atmosphere analysis using more traditional 1D techniques and using
state-of-the-art 3D techniques. We compare and contrast the assumptions and

derived atmospheric parameters. We find that in all three cases, both
components of system are highly overluminous indicating either efficient
internal mixing of helium or previous non-conservative mass transfer. However,
we do not find strong evidence of helium or CNO surface abundance changes
usually associated with mixing. Additionally, we find that in unequal mass
systems, the measured effective temperature and luminosity of the less massive
component places it very close to the more massive component on the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These results were obtained independently using
both of the techniques mentioned above, which suggests that these measurements

decade, and little is known about how spatial training skills in a simulated
environment using up-to-date VR HMDs compares to training in the real world. In
this paper, we aim to investigate how people trained in a VR maze compare
against those trained in a physical maze in terms of recall of the position of
items inside the environment. While our results did not find significant
differences in time performance for people who experienced the physical and
those who trained in VR, other behavioural factors were different.

allow the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters and important

peculiarities. Here we present an investigation of the known eclipsing binary
system BD+09 1467 = V680 Mon. Using spectra from the Large Sky Area
Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and own observations, we
identify the primary component of the system as a mercury-manganese (HgMn/CP3)
star (spectral type kB9 hB8 HeB9 V HgMn). Furthermore, photometric time series
data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) indicate that the
system is a ""heartbeat star"", a rare class of eccentric binary stars with
short-period orbits that exhibit a characteristic signature near the time of
periastron in their light curves due to the tidal distortion of the components.
Using all available photometric observations, we present an updated ephemeris
and binary system parameters as derived from modelling of the system with the
ELISa code, which indicates that the secondary star has an effective
temperature of Teff = 8300+-200 K (spectral type of about A4). V680 Mon is only
the fifth known eclipsing CP3 star and the first one in a heartbeat binary.
Furthermore, our results indicate that the star is located on the zero-age main
sequence and a possible member of the open cluster NGC 2264. As such, it lends
itself perfectly for detailed studies and may turn out to be a keystone in the
understanding of the development of CP3 star peculiarities.

monotonically with time for electric fields perpendicular to the nodal loop
plane however it exhibits non-monotonical behavior for field orientations
aligned within the plane. After an initial non-universal growth $\sim Et$, the
current first reaches a plateau $\sim E$. Then, for perpendicular directions,
it increases while for in-plane directions it decreases with time to another
plateau, still $\sim E$. These features arise from interband processes. For
long times or strong electric fields, the current grows as $\sim E^{3/2}t$ or
$\sim E^3t^2$ for perpendicular or parallel electric fields, respectively. This
non-linear response represents an intraband effect where the large number of
excited quasiparticles responds to the electric field. Our analytical results
are benchmarked by the numerical evaluation of the current from continuum and

that various classical formulations of gravity dynamics display different

important consequences to further elucidate the quantization of gravity. After
establishing an algebraic off-shell derivation of the maximal closed subalgebra

how to geometrically describe the latter and its embedding in spacetime,
without constraining the geometry away from the corner, such as by assuming a

where a model answers a multiple-choice question for a certain context.
Discriminative tasks are limiting because they fail to adequately evaluate the
model's ability to reason and explain predictions with underlying commonsense
knowledge. They also allow such models to use reasoning shortcuts and not be
""right for the right reasons"". In this work, we present ExplaGraphs, a new
generative and structured commonsense-reasoning task (and an associated
dataset) of explanation graph generation for stance prediction. Specifically,
given a belief and an argument, a model has to predict if the argument supports
or counters the belief and also generate a commonsense-augmented graph that
serves as non-trivial, complete, and unambiguous explanation for the predicted
stance. We collect explanation graphs through a novel Create-Verify-And-Refine
graph collection framework that improves the graph quality (up to 90%) via
multiple rounds of verification and refinement. A significant 79% of our graphs
contain external commonsense nodes with diverse structures and reasoning
depths. Next, we propose a multi-level evaluation framework, consisting of
automatic metrics and human evaluation, that check for the structural and
semantic correctness of the generated graphs and their degree of match with
ground-truth graphs. Finally, we present several structured,
commonsense-augmented, and text generation models as strong starting points for
this explanation graph generation task, and observe that there is a large gap
with human performance, thereby encouraging future work for this new
challenging task. ExplaGraphs will be publicly available at

To enable learning, the choice of representation is the key. Recent work uses
neural networks to parameterize local surface elements. This approach captures
locally coherent geometry and non-planar details, can deal with varying
topology, and does not require registered training data. However, naively using
such methods to model 3D clothed humans fails to capture fine-grained local
deformations and generalizes poorly. To address this, we present three key
innovations: First, we deform surface elements based on a human body model such
that large-scale deformations caused by articulation are explicitly separated
from topological changes and local clothing deformations. Second, we address
the limitations of existing neural surface elements by regressing local
geometry from local features, significantly improving the expressiveness.
Third, we learn a pose embedding on a 2D parameterization space that encodes
posed body geometry, improving generalization to unseen poses by reducing

the contrary, forward-based methods are usually faster but the quality of their

""E2Style"" for StyleGAN inversion, with significant improvement in terms of
efficiency and effectiveness. In our inversion network, we introduce: 1) a
shallower backbone with multiple efficient heads across scales; 2) multi-layer

multi-stage refinement. Combining these designs together forms an effective and

models whose stellar and neutral gas photometry and kinematics are in good

with a nearby galaxy. Thanks to the tails, we can identify the requirements for
a galaxy to expose such a structure and assess the possible position and
velocity of the galaxy in the cluster. This puts constraints on the orbit of
the galaxy, its position in the cluster and the time since its pericentre
passage. From the statistics of identified snapshots following our modelling,
we found that the most likely position of the galaxy is around 200 kpc in front
of the cluster centre, travelling towards the cluster with a velocity angle
with respect to the line-of-sight direction of around 50 deg. This analysis can
be useful in future observations of similar galaxies in clusters to

is best able to reproduce the proper Kolmogorov inertial range scaling in

calibrate the metal mixing rate that ensures numerical convergence. In our
first application to cosmological simulations, we find that all models strongly
impact the early evolution of galaxies leading to differences in enrichment and
thermodynamic histories. The anisotropic model has the strongest impact, with
little difference between the dynamic and the constant-coefficient variant. We
also find that the metal distribution functions in the circumgalactic gas are
significantly tighter at all redshifts, with the anisotropic model providing
the tightest distributions. This is contrary to a recent study that found metal
mixing to be relatively unimportant on cosmological scales. In all of our
experiments the constant-coefficient Smagorinsky and anisotropic models rivaled
their dynamic counterparts, suggesting that the computationally inexpensive
constant-coefficient models are viable alternatives in cosmological contexts.

redshifts, a moderate amount of DM particle decay remains a valid possibility.
This includes both models with very long-lived yet unstable particles or mixed
scenarios where only a small fraction of dark matter is allowed to decay. In
this paper, we investigate how DM particles decaying into radiation affect
non-linear structure formation. We look at the power spectrum and its redshift
evolution, varying both the decay lifetime ($\tau$) and the fraction of
decaying-to-total dark matter ($f$), and we propose a fitting function that
reaches sub-percent precision below $k\sim10$ h/Mpc. Based on this fit, we
perform a forecast analysis for a Euclid-like weak lensing (WL) survey,
including both massive neutrino and baryonic feedback parameters. We find that
with WL observations alone, it is possible to rule out decay lifetimes smaller
than $\tau=75$ Gyr (at 95 percent CL) for the case that all DM is unstable.
This constraint improves to $\tau=182$ Gyr if the WL data is combined with CMB
priors from the Planck satellite and to $\tau=275$ Gyr if we further assume
baryonic feedback to be fully constrained by upcoming Sunyaev-Zeldovich or
X-ray data. The latter shows a factor of 3.2 improvement compared to
constraints from CMB data alone. Regarding the scenario of a strongly decaying
sub-component of dark matter with $\tau\sim 30$ Gyr or lower, it will be
possible to rule out a decaying-to-total fraction of $f>0.49$, $f>0.21$, and
$f>0.13$ (at the 95 percent CL) for the same three scenarios. We conclude that
the upcoming stage-IV WL surveys will allow us to significantly improve current

(PSB) galaxies in the high redshift Universe ($0.5<z<3.0$). We select
$\sim4000$ PSB galaxies photometrically, the largest high-redshift sample of
this kind, from two deep large-scale near-infrared surveys: the UKIDSS Ultra
Deep Survey (UDS) DR11 and the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). Using angular
cross-correlation techniques, we estimate the halo masses for this large sample
of PSB galaxies and compare them with quiescent and star-forming galaxies
selected in the same fields. We find that low-mass, low-redshift ($0.5<z<1.0$)
PSB galaxies preferentially reside in very high-mass dark matter halos
(M$_{\text{halo}}>10^{14}$M$_{\odot}$), suggesting they are likely to be
infalling satellite galaxies in cluster-like environments. High-mass PSB
galaxies are more weakly clustered at low redshifts, but they reside in higher
mass haloes with increasing look-back time, suggesting strong
redshift-dependent halo downsizing. These key results are consistent with
previous results suggesting that two main channels are responsible for the
rapid quenching of galaxies. While high-redshift ($z>1$) galaxies appear to be
quenched by secular feedback mechanisms, processes associated with dense
environments are likely to be the key driver of rapid quenching in the
low-redshift Universe ($z<1$). Finally, we show that the clustering of
photometrically selected PSBs are consistent with them being direct descendants
of highly dust-enshrouded sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs), providing tantalising
evidence for the oft-speculated evolutionary pathway from starburst to

complemented the optical VLT/MUSE observations, tracing the colder gas phase,

phase. Using the MUSE observations, we studied the emission line intensity
ratios along the filaments to constrain the physical processes driving the

spectral analysis of the gas along these filaments. We found a spatial
association between the X-ray and optical morphology of these filaments, which
are colder and have lower metal abundance than the surrounding intra-cluster
medium (ICM), as already seen in other BCGs. Comparing with previous results
from the literature for other BCGs, we propose that the excitation process that
is most likely responsible for these filaments emission is a combination of
star formation and shocks, with a likely contribution from self-ionizing,

showing asteroseismic oscillations. We investigate how well they can be
characterized using classical constraints (photometry, astrometry), and
validate our results using spectroscopic values. We derive luminosities,
effective temperatures, and radii with mean 1$\sigma$ random (systematic)
uncertainties of 4.5% (2%), 33 K (60 K), and 2.2% (2%), as well as more
model-dependent quantities such as surface gravities, masses, and ages. We use
our sample to demonstrate that subgiants are ideal targets for mass and age
determination based on HR diagram location alone, discuss the advantages of
stellar parameters derived from a detailed characterization over widely
available catalogs, show that the generally used 3D extinction maps tend to
overestimate the extinction for nearby stars (distance $\lesssim$ 500 pc), and
find a correlation that supports the rotation-activity connection in post main
sequence stars. The complementary roles played by classical and asteroseismic
data sets will open a window to unprecedented astrophysical studies using
subgiant stars.

$\ell\to\ell^\prime\nu\bar\nu$ decays, anomalous magnetic moments of charged

stringent limits on leptophilic $Z^\prime$ bosons. Furthermore, in case of

Boco et al. 2020. Specifically, the latter envisages the migration of stellar
compact remnants (neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes) via gaseous
dynamical friction towards the galaxy nuclear region, and their subsequent
merging to grow a massive central BH seed. In this paper we add two relevant
ingredients: (i) we include primordial BHs, that could constitute a fraction
$f_{\rm pBH}$ of the dark matter, as an additional component participating in
the seed growth; (ii) we predict the stochastic gravitational wave background
originated during the seed growth, both from stellar compact remnant and from
primordial BH mergers. We find that the latter events contribute most to the
initial growth of the central seed during a timescale of $10^6-10^7\,\rm yr$,
before stellar compact remnant mergers and gas accretion take over. In
addition, if the fraction of primordial BHs $f_{\rm pBH}$ is large enough,
gravitational waves emitted by their mergers in the nuclear galactic regions
could be detected by future interferometers like Einsten Telescope, DECIGO and
LISA. As for the associated stochastic gravitational wave background, we
predict that it extends over the wide frequency band $10^{-6}\lesssim f [{\rm
Hz}]\lesssim 10$, which is very different from the typical range originated by
mergers of isolated binary compact objects. On the one hand, the detection of
such a background could be a smoking gun to test the proposed seed growth
mechanism; on the other hand, it constitutes a relevant contaminant from
astrophysical sources to be characterized and subtracted, in the challenging
search for a primordial background of cosmological origin.

Eight transitions of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) were also detected, five of which
(A states) were used to determine an excitation temperature to then calculate
column densities for the other oxygen-bearing COMs. If source size was not
taken into account (i.e., if filling fraction was assumed to be one), column
density was underestimated, and thus we stress the need for higher resolution
mapping data. We calculated L1521E COM abundances and compared them to other

starless/prestellar cores, suggesting related chemical evolution. The scenario
that assumes formation of COMs in gas-phase reactions between precursors formed

interstellar grains. Our observations present a new, unique challenge for
existing theoretical astrochemical models.

Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo detectors are multiple
times more massive than those in X-ray binaries. One possibility is that some
BBHs merge within a few Schwarzschild radii of a supermassive black hole
(SMBH), such that the gravitational waves (GWs) are highly redshifted, causing
the mass inferred from GW signals to appear higher than the real mass. The
difficulty of this scenario lies in the delivery of BBH to such a small
distance to a SMBH. Here we revisit the theoretical models for the migration of
compact objects (COs) in the accretion discs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
We find that when the accretion rate is high so that the disc is best described
by the slim disc model, the COs in the disc could migrate to a radius close to
the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and be trapped there for the
remaining lifetime of the AGN. The exact trapping radius coincides with the
transition region between the sub- and super-Keplerian rotation of the slim
disc. We call this region ""the last migration trap"" because inside it COs can
no longer be trapped for a long time. We pinpoint the parameter space which
could induce such a trap and we estimate that the last migration trap
contributes a few per cent of the LIGO/Virgo events. Our result implies that a
couple of BBHs discovered by LIGO/Virgo could have smaller intrinsic masses.

critical measurement rate. The transition is mean-field-like and we
characterize the critical properties near the transition in terms of a simple
Ising field theory in 0+1 dimensions. In addition to studying the purity of the

the bubble radius scales differently (R ~ t^1/2) from the classical Weaver77

Markov chains through complex target distributions. In this article, we uncover
a remarkable connection between the zigzag sampler and a variant of Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo based on Laplace-distributed momentum. The position and velocity
component of the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics travels along a zigzag path
paralleling the Markovian zigzag process; however, the dynamics is
non-Markovian in the position-velocity space as the momentum component encodes
non-immediate pasts. This information is partially lost during a momentum
refreshment step, in which we preserve its direction but re-sample magnitude.
In the limit of increasingly frequent momentum refreshments, we prove that
Hamiltonian zigzag converges strongly to its Markovian counterpart. This
theoretical insight suggests that, when retaining full momentum information,
Hamiltonian zigzag can better explore target distributions with highly
correlated parameters by suppressing the diffusive behavior of Markovian
zigzag. We corroborate this intuition by comparing performance of the two

estimator. This also opens up the inclusion of time-delays and uncertainties.
First, we demonstrate that the I&I wind speed estimator is equivalent to a
torque balance estimator with a proportional correction term. As the
nonlinearity in the estimator is sector bounded, the well-known circle
criterion is applied to the estimator to guarantee its global convergence for
time-delayed systems. By looking at the theoretical framework from this new
perspective, this letter further proposes the addition of an integrator to the
correction term to improve the estimator performance. Case studies show that
the proposed estimator with an additional integral correction term is effective
at wind speed estimation. Furthermore, its global convergence can be guaranteed
by the circle criterion for time-delayed systems.

energy density functionals (EDFs) of the Skyrme type through extensions of its
traditional form. One direction for such activities is the inclusion of terms
of higher order in gradients in the EDF. We report on exploratory
symmetry-breaking calculations performed for an extension of the Skyrme EDF
that includes central terms with four gradients at next-to-next-to-leading
order (N2LO) and for which the high-quality parametrization SN2LO1 has been
constructed recently [P. Becker et al, Phys. Rev. C 96, 044330 (2017)]. Up to
now, the investigation of such functionals with higher-order terms was limited
to infinite matter and spherically symmetric configurations of singly- and
doubly-magic nuclei. We address here nuclei and phenomena that require us to
consider axial and non-axial deformation, both for reflection-symmetric and
also reflection-asymmetric shapes, as well as the breaking of time-reversal
invariance. Achieving these calculations demanded a number of formal
developments. These all resulted from the formulation of the N2LO EDF requiring
the introduction of new local densities with additional gradients that are not
present in the EDF at NLO. Their choice is not unique, but can differ in the
way the gradients are coupled. While designing a numerical implementation of
N2LO EDFs in Cartesian 3d coordinate-space representation, we have developed a
novel definition and a new unifying notation for normal and pair densities that
contain gradients at arbitrary order. The resulting scheme resolves several
issues with some of the choices that have been made for local densities in the
past, in particular when breaking time-reversal symmetry. Guided by general
practical considerations, we propose an alternative form of the N2LO
contribution to the Skyrme EDF that is built from a different set of densities.

to execution time and energy consumption in memory-intensive applications. This
data movement bottleneck can be alleviated using Processing-in-Memory (PiM).
One category of PiM is Processing-using-Memory (PuM), in which computation
takes place inside the memory array by exploiting intrinsic analog properties
of the memory device. PuM yields high performance and energy efficiency, but
existing PuM techniques support a limited range of operations. As a result,
current PuM architectures cannot efficiently perform some complex operations
(e.g., multiplication, division, exponentiation) without large increases in
chip area and design complexity.
  To overcome these limitations of existing PuM architectures, we introduce
pLUTo (processing-using-memory with lookup table (LUT) operations), a
DRAM-based PuM architecture that leverages the high storage density of DRAM to
enable the massively parallel storing and querying of lookup tables (LUTs). The
key idea of pLUTo is to replace complex operations with low-cost, bulk memory
reads (i.e., LUT queries) instead of relying on complex extra logic.
  We evaluate pLUTo across 11 real-world workloads that showcase the
limitations of prior PuM approaches and show that our solution outperforms
optimized CPU and GPU baselines by an average of 713$\times$ and 1.2$\times$,
respectively, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by an average of
1855$\times$ and 39.5$\times$. Across these workloads, pLUTo outperforms
state-of-the-art PiM architectures by an average of 18.3$\times$. We also show
that different versions of pLUTo provide different levels of flexibility and
performance at different additional DRAM area overheads (between 10.2% and
23.1%). pLUTo's source code is openly and fully available at

essentially a multiset of points in the plane, and one popular distance is the

we present two algorithms to approximate the 1-Wasserstein distance for

attention due to their potential role in devising novel photovoltaic materials.
In particular, energy transport in light-harvesting complexes is considered
quite efficient due to the balance between coherent quantum evolution and
decoherence, a phenomenon coined Environment-Assisted Quantum Transport
(ENAQT). Although this effect has been extensively studied, its behavior is
typically described in terms of the decoherence's strength, namely weak,
moderate or strong. Here, we study the ENAQT in terms of quantum correlations
that go beyond entanglement. Using a subsystem of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
complex, we find that discord-like correlations maximize when the subsystem's
transport efficiency increases, while the entanglement between sites vanishes.
Our results suggest that quantum discord is a manifestation of the ENAQT and

we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method to address the spatial
misalignment between the noisy proposals and few-shot classes, thus improving
the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we learn a separate
Faster R-CNN detection head for many-shot base classes and show strong

driven bubbles in dense, turbulent clouds. This theory proposes that turbulent
mixing at a fractal bubble-shell interface leads to highly efficient cooling,
in which the vast majority of the input wind energy is radiated away. This
energy loss renders the majority of the bubble evolution momentum-driven rather
than energy-driven, with expansion velocities and pressures orders of magnitude
lower than in the classical Weaver77 solution. In this paper, we validate our
theory with three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations. We show that extreme
cooling is not only possible, but is generic to star formation in turbulent
clouds over more than three orders of magnitude in density. We quantify the few
free parameters in our theory, and show that the momentum exceeds the wind
input rate by only a factor ~ 1.2-4. We verify that the bubble/cloud interface
is a fractal with dimension ~ 2.5-2.7. The measured turbulent amplitude (v_t ~
200-400 km/s) in the hot gas near the interface is shown to be consistent with
theoretical requirements for turbulent diffusion to efficiently mix and radiate
away most of the wind energy. The fraction of energy remaining after cooling is
only 1-\Theta ~ 0.1-0.01, decreasing with time, explaining observations that
indicate low hot-gas content and weak dynamical effects of stellar winds.

critically on the coupling of laser energy to the target plasma. Cross-beam
energy transfer (CBET), the resonant exchange of energy between intersecting
laser beams mediated by ponderomotively driven ion-acoustic waves (IAW),
inhibits this coupling by scattering light into unwanted directions. The
variety of beam intersection angles and varying plasma conditions in an
implosion results in IAWs with a range of phase velocities. Here we show that
CBET saturates through a resonance detuning that depends on the IAW phase
velocity and that results from trapping-induced modifications to the ion
distribution functions. For smaller phase velocities, the modifications to the
distribution functions can rapidly thermalize in the presence of mid-Z ions,
leading to a blueshift in the resonant frequency. For larger phase velocities,
the modifications can persist, leading to a redshift in the resonant frequency.
Ultimately, these results may reveal pathways towards CBET mitigation and
inform reduced models for radiation hydrodynamics codes to improve their
predictive capability.

known from oceanography as a driver of Langmuir circulation. CL1 is strongest
when the `wall wave' vectors make an accute angle with the axis,
$\varphi=10^\circ$ - $20^\circ$ (a `contracted eggcarton'), changes sign near
$45^\circ$ and is weak and opposite beyond this angle. A competing, dynamic
mechanism driving secondary flow in the opposite sense is also observed created
by the azimuthally varying friction. Whereas at smaller angles `CL1' prevails,
the dynamic effect dominates when $\varphi\gtrsim 45^\circ$ reversing the flow.
Curiously, circulation strength is a faster-than-linearly increasing function
of Reynolds number for the contracted case.
  We explore an analogy with Prandtl's secondary motion of the second kind in
turbulence. A transport equation for average streamwise vorticity is derived,
and we analyse it for three different crossing angles, $\varphi=18.6^\circ,
45^\circ$ and $60^\circ$. Mean-vorticity production is organised in a ring-like
structure with the two rings contributing to rotating flow in opposite senses.
For the larger $\varphi$ the inner ring decides the main swirling motion,
whereas for $\varphi=18.6^\circ$ outer-ring production dominates. For the
larger angles the outer ring is mainly driven by advection of vorticity and the
inner by deformation (stretching) whereas for $\varphi=18.6^\circ$ both
contribute approximately equally to production in the outer ring.

informational yet essential aspects of software features -- is pervasive. Given
the high transactionality of today's software, logging effectiveness can be
reduced by information overload. Log levels help alleviate this problem by
correlating a priority to logs that can be later filtered. As software evolves,
however, levels of logs documenting surrounding feature implementations may
also require modification as features once deemed important may have decreased
in urgency and vice-versa. We present an automated approach that assists
developers in evolving levels of such (feature) logs. The approach, based on
mining Git histories and manipulating a degree of interest (DOI) model,
transforms source code to revitalize feature log levels based on the
""interestingness"" of the surrounding code. Built upon JGit and Mylyn, the
approach is implemented as an Eclipse IDE plug-in and evaluated on 18 Java
projects with $\sim$3 million lines of code and $\sim$4K log statements. Our
tool successfully analyzes 99.22% of logging statements, increases log level
distributions by $\sim$20%, and increases the focus of logs in bug fix contexts
$\sim$83% of the time. Moreover, pull (patch) requests were integrated into
large and popular open-source projects. The results indicate that the approach
is promising in assisting developers in evolving feature log levels.

functions constructed via a moving least squares (MLS) method. The resulting
kernels effectively couple structural degrees of freedom to fluid variables on
only one side of the fluid-structure interface. This reduces spurious feedback
forcing and internal flows that are typically observed in IB models that use
isotropic kernel functions to couple the structure to fluid degrees of freedom
on both sides of the interface. The method developed here extends the original
MLS methodology introduced by Vanella and Balaras (J Comput Phys, 2009). Prior
IB/MLS methods have used isotropic kernel functions that coupled fluid
variables on both sides of the boundary to the interfacial degrees of freedom.
The original IB/MLS approach converts the cubic spline weights typically
employed in MLS reconstruction into an IB kernel function that satisfies
particular discrete moment conditions. This paper shows that the same approach
can be used to construct one-sided kernel functions (kernel functions are
referred to as generating functions in the MLS literature). We also examine the
performance of the new approach for a family of kernel functions introduced by
Peskin. It is demonstrated that the one-sided MLS construction tends to
generate non-monotone interpolation kernels with large over- and undershoots.
We present two simple weight shifting strategies to construct generating
functions that are positive and monotone, which enhances the stability of the
resulting IB methodology. Benchmark cases are used to test the order of
accuracy and verify the one-sided IB/MLS simulations in both two and three
spatial dimensions. This new IB/MLS method is also used to simulate flow over
the Ahmed car model, which highlights the applicability of this methodology for
modeling complex engineering flows.

perform a variety of cooperative tasks including information collection,
inspection mapping, disinfection, and firefighting. The MQS affine
transformation is an approach to a decentralized leader-follower coordination
guided by n +1 leaders, where leaders are located at vertices of an n-D
simplex, called leading simplex, at any time t. The remaining agents are
followers acquiring the desired affine transformation via local communication.
Followers are contained in a rigid-size ball at any time t but they can be
distributed either inside or outside the leading simplex. By
eigen-decomposition of the affine transformation coordination, safety in a
large-scale MQS coordination can be ensured by constraining eigenvalues of the
affine transformation. Given the initial and final configurations of the MQS,
A-star search is applied to optimally plan safe coordination of a large-scale
MQS minimizing the travel distance between the the initial and final
configuration. The paper also proposes a proximity-based communication topology
for followers to assign communication weights with their in-neighbors and
acquire the desired coordination with minimal computation cost.

statistically representative sample of galaxies from the CALIFA survey. Then,
we study their stellar population properties analising the
structure-independent datacubes with the Pipe3D algorithm. We find a
correlation between the bulge-to-total ($B/T$) luminosity (and mass) ratio and
galaxy stellar mass. The $B/T$ mass ratio has only a mild evolution with
redshift, but the bulge-to-disc ($B/D$) mass ratio shows a clear increase of
the disc component since redshift $z < 1$ for massive galaxies. The mass-size
relation for both bulges and discs describes an upturn at high galaxy stellar
masses (log{(M_{\star}/M_{\sun})} > 10.5). The relation holds for bulges but
not for discs when using their individual stellar masses. We find a negligible
evolution of the mass-size relation for both the most massive (log{(M_{\star
\rm ,b,d}/M_{\sun})} > 10) bulges and discs. For lower masses, discs show a
larger variation than bulges. We also find a correlation between the S\'ersic
index of bulges and both galaxy and bulge stellar mass, which does not hold for
the disc mass. Our results support an inside-out formation of nearby non-barred
galaxies, and they suggest that i) bulges formed early-on and ii) they have not
evolved much through cosmic time. However, we find that the early properties of
bulges drive the future evolution of the galaxy as a whole, and particularly
the properties of the discs that eventually form around them.

have long seen research interest from experimentalists and theoreticians alike.
From a theoretical standpoint, modeling these systems using electronic
structure theory can be difficult due to the importance of electron correlation
in the determination of molecular properties, and this electron correlation can
be computationally expensive to consider, particularly multiconfigurational
correlation energy. In this work, we develop a new approach for the study of
single-molecule electronic systems, denoted NEGF-MCPDFT, which combines
multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) with the
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF). The use of MC-PDFT with NEGF
allows for the efficient inclusion of both static and dynamic electron
correlation in the description of the junction's electronic structure. CASSCF
wave functions are used as references in the MC-PDFT calculation, and like with
any active space method, effort must be made to determine the proper orbital
character to include in the active space. We perform conductance and
transmission calculations on a series of alkanes (predominantly
single-configurational character) and benzyne (multiconfigurational character),
exploring the role that active space selection has on the computed results. For
the alkane junctions explored (where dynamic electron correlation dominates),
the MCPDFT-NEGF results agree well with DFT-NEGF results. For the benzyne
junction (which has significant static correlation), we see clear differences
in the MCPDFT-NEGF and DFT-NEGF results, and evidence that NEGF-MCPDFT is
capturing additional electron correlation effects beyond those provided by the
PBE functional.

chromosphere ($\le 10^4$K) and hot corona ($\ge 10^6$K) has been subjected to
many different interpretations. Here we look at the magnetic structure of this
transition region (TR) plasma, based upon the implications of CLASP2 data of an
active region recently published by Ishikawa et al., and earlier IRIS and SDO
data of quiet regions. Ishikawa et al. found that large areas of sunspot plages
are magnetically unipolar as measured in the cores of \ion{Mg}{2} resonance
lines, formed in the lower transition region under low plasma-$\beta$
conditions. Here we show that IRIS images in the line cores have fibrils which
well aligned with the overlying coronal loop segments seen in the 171 \AA{}
channel of SDO. When the TR emission in active regions arise from plasma
magnetically and thermally connected to the corona, then the line cores can
provide the first credible magnetic boundary conditions for force-free
calculations extended to the corona. We also re-examine IRIS images of dynamic
TR cool loops previously reported as a major contributor to transition region
emission from the quiet Sun. Dynamic cool loops contribute only a small
fraction of the total TR emission from the quiet Sun.

regime that involves both linear oscillations and collisions under periodic,
impulsive, or stochastic excitation. This regime arises in various engineering
systems, such as mechanical components under tight rigid constraints,
seismic-induced sloshing in partially-filled liquid storage tanks, and more.
The adaptive nonlinearity of the HVI oscillator is used by the HVI-nonlinear
energy sink as an effective vibration mitigation solution for broad energy and
frequency range. Due to the extreme nonlinearity of this regime, traditional
analytical methods are inapplicable for the description of its transient
dynamics. In the current work, we model the HVI oscillator by a forced particle
in a truncated quadratic potential well with infinite depth. The slow flow
dynamics of the system in the vicinity of primary resonance is described by
canonical transformation to action-angle (AA) variables and the corresponding
reduced resonance manifold (RM). Two types of bifurcation are examined. The
former is associated with the transition between linear oscillations and the
HVI-regime and vice versa, and the latter with reaching a chosen maximal
transient energy level. The transition boundaries and frequency response curves
are obtained analytically. Two underlying dynamical mechanisms that govern the
occurrence of bifurcations are identified: the ""maximum"" and the ""saddle""
mechanisms. The latter, a potentially more dangerous scenario, involves abrupt
transitions of the system's energy response from a relatively small value to
the threshold energy level. Both mechanisms are universal for systems that
undergo escape from a potential well. All theoretical results are in complete
agreement with full-scale numerical simulations.

Magnetohydrodynamics is developed in a complete basis provided by the

Nonlinear HMHD is, then, reduced to a rather simple looking set of scalar
equations from which a model problem of three interacting Beltrami modes is
formulated and analytically solved. The triplet interactions span a variety of
familiar nonlinear processes leading to a redistribution as well as periodic
exchange of energy. The energy exchange processes (whose strength is measured
by an energy exchange /depletion time) will, perhaps, play a dominant role in
determining the spectral content of an eventual Alfv\'enic state. All
nonlinearities (sensitive functions of the interacting wave vectors) operate at
par, and none is dominant over any substantial region of k-space; their
intricate interplay prevents a ""universal"" picture from emerging; few
generalizations on the processes that may, for instance, lead to a turbulent
state, are possible. However, the theory can definitely claim: 1) the energy
tends to flow from lower to higher $k$, and 2) the higher $k_z$ (in the
direction of the ambient magnetic field) components of a mode with a given $k$
are depleted/oscillate faster -in some cases much faster. It is noteworthy that
the mode coupling is the strongest (with the shortest depletion time) when the
participating wave vectors are nearly perpendicular; perhaps, an expected
consequence of the curl (cross product) nonlinearities. Numerical simulations
will be necessary to help create a fully reliable picture.

step, MP extracts insights from the data and sends them to MA. Using the
commitment and zero-knowledge proofs, MA can certify that the information
received from MP is accurate, without needing to directly inspect the mobility

a large variety of applications. However, using these models on mobile or

solution for the architecture design of compact CNNs. In this work, we
comprehensively investigated the existing design concepts, rethink the
functional characteristics of two pointwise convolutions in the inverted
residuals. We propose a novel design, called asymmetrical bottlenecks.
Precisely, we adjust the first pointwise convolution dimension, enrich the
information flow by feature reuse, and migrate saved computations to the second
pointwise convolution. By doing so we can further improve the accuracy without
increasing the computation overhead. The asymmetrical bottlenecks can be
adopted as a drop-in replacement for the existing CNN blocks. We can thus
create AsymmNet by easily stack those blocks according to proper depth and
width conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed block
design is more beneficial than the original inverted residual bottlenecks for
mobile networks, especially useful for those ultralight CNNs within the regime

elucidate several trends in $t_{sp\sigma}$ and $\Delta$ as one moves across the
periodic table, such as the relativistic energy lowering of the $B-s$ orbital
in heavy $B$ cations leading to strongly negative $\Delta$ values. Our results
are discussed in connection with the general phase diagram for $s - p$ cubic
perovskites proposed in Ref. 26, where the parent superconductors SrBiO$_{3}$
and BaBiO$_{3}$ are found to be in the regime of negative $\Delta$ and large
$t_{sp\sigma}$. Here, we explore this further and search for new materials with
similar parameters, which could lead to the discovery of new superconductors.
Also, some considerations are offered regarding a possible relation between the
physical properties of a given $s - p$ compound (such as its tendency to bond
disproportionate and the maximal achievable superconducting transition
temperature) and its electronic structure.

modulating the plasmon resonance condition with magnetic field can boost the

Nevertheless, real life applications are hampered by the magnetoplasmonic
trilemma: 1) a good plasmonic metal has sharp optical resonances but low
magneto-optical response; 2) a magnetic metal has strong magneto-optical
response but a very broad plasmonic resonance; 3) mixing the two components
degrades the quality of both features. To overcome the trilemma, we use a
different class of materials, transparent conductive oxide nanocrystals (NCs)
with plasmonic response in the near infrared. Although non-magnetic, they
combine a large cyclotron frequency (due to small electron effective mass) with
sharp plasmonic resonances. We benchmark the concept with F- and In- doped CdO
(FICO) and Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) NCs to boost the magneto-optical Faraday
rotation and ellipticity, reaching the highest magneto-optical response for a
non-magnetic plasmonic material, and exceeding the performance of
state-of-the-art ferromagnetic nanostructures. The magnetoplasmonic response of
these NCs was rationalized with analytical model based on the excitation of
circular magnetoplasmonic modes. Finally, proof of concept experiments
demonstrated the superior performance of FICO NCs with respect to current state
of the art in magnetoplasmonic refractometric sensing, approaching the
sensitivity of leading localized plasmon refractometric methods with the
advantage of not requiring complex curve fitting.

exploit the intrinsic structures of tensors such as low-rankness in the mean

high-dimensional expectation-conditional-maximization (HECM) algorithm that
breaks the intractable optimization in the M-step into a sequence of much
simpler conditional optimization problems, each of which is convex, admits
regularization and has closed-form updating formulas. Our theoretical analysis
is challenged by both the non-convexity in the EM-type estimation and having
access to only the solutions of conditional maximizations in the M-step,
leading to the notion of dual non-convexity. We demonstrate that the proposed
HECM algorithm, with an appropriate initialization, converges geometrically to
a neighborhood that is within statistical precision of the true parameter. The
efficacy of our proposed method is demonstrated through comparative numerical
experiments and an application to a medical study, where our proposal achieves
an improved clustering accuracy over existing benchmarking methods.

over large geographical areas or at short time intervals strongly depends on
the representativity of the samples used to train the classification algorithm
and to define the model. When training samples are collected from an image (or
a spatial region) different from the one used for mapping, spectral shifts
between the two distributions are likely to make the model fail. Such shifts
are generally due to differences in acquisition and atmospheric conditions or
to changes in the nature of the object observed. In order to design
classification methods that are robust to data-set shifts, recent remote
sensing literature has considered solutions based on domain adaptation (DA)
approaches. Inspired by machine learning literature, several DA methods have
been proposed to solve specific problems in remote sensing data classification.
This paper provides a critical review of the recent advances in DA for remote

invariant feature selection; ii) representation matching; iii) adaptation of

methodologies, as well as examples of application of the considered techniques

dispersion ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}-\sigma_\star$) relation but over-massive relative
to the BH mass$-$bulge luminosity ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}-L_{\mathrm{bul}}$)
correlation, suggesting that BHs may gain the majority of their mass before
their host galaxies. However, UGC 2698 is consistent with both
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}-\sigma_\star$ and $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-L_{\mathrm{bul}}$. As UGC
2698 has the largest stellar mass and effective radius in the local compact
galaxy sample, it may have undergone more recent mergers that brought it in
line with the BH scaling relations. Alternatively, given that the three
previously-measured compact galaxies are outliers from
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}-L_{\mathrm{bul}}$, while UGC 2698 is not, there may be
significant scatter at the poorly sampled high-mass end of the relation.
Additional gas-dynamical $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements for the compact galaxy

disproportionate number of women leave academic research before obtaining an
independent position. To understand factors underlying this trend, we analyzed
a multidisciplinary database of Ph.D. and postdoctoral mentoring relationships
covering the years 2000-2020, focusing on data from the life sciences. Student
and mentor gender are both associated with differences in rates of student's
continuation to independent mentor positions of their own. Although trainees of
women mentors are less likely to take on independent positions than trainees of
men mentors, this effect is reduced substantially after controlling for several
measurements of mentor status. Thus the effect of mentor gender can be
explained at least partially by gender disparities in social and financial
resources available to mentors. Because trainees and mentors tend to be of the
same gender, this association between mentor gender and academic continuation
disproportionately impacts women trainees. On average, gender homophily in
graduate training is unrelated to mentor status. A notable exception to this
trend is the special case of scientists having been granted an outstanding
distinction, evidenced by membership in the National Academy of Sciences, being
a grantee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or having been awarded the
Nobel Prize. This group of mentors trains men graduate students at higher rates
than their most successful colleagues. These results suggest that, in addition
to other factors that limit career choices for women trainees, gender
inequities in mentors' access to resources and prestige contribute to women's
attrition from independent research positions.

where the internal nodes within each cluster reach consensus quickly relative

Our main result shows that this rate converges exponentially and only scales

  The key technique in our analysis is to consider a Lyapunov function which
captures the impacts of different time-scale dynamics on the convergence of the
method. Our approach avoids using model reduction, which is the typical way
according to singular perturbation theory and relies on relatively simple
definitions of the slow and fast variables. In addition, Lyapunov analysis
allows us to derive the rate of distributed consensus methods over cluster

hierarchically modeling the astrophysical distribution of black hole masses. We
extend the Truncated and Powerlaw+Peak mass distribution families to allow for
an explicit gap in the mass distribution, and apply the extended models to
GWTC-2. We find that with the Truncated model there is mild evidence favoring
an upper mass gap with log Bayes Factor $\ln \mathcal{B} = 2.79$, inferring the
lower and upper bounds at $56.12_{-4.38}^{+7.54} M_\odot$, and
$103.74_{-6.32}^{+17.01} M_\odot$ respectively. When using the Powerlaw+Peak
model, we find no preference for the gap. When imposing tighter priors on the
gap bounds centered on the expected PISN gap bounds, the log Bayes factors in
favor of a gap mildly increase. These results are however contingent on the
parameter inference for the most massive binary, GW190521, for which follow up
analyses showed the source may be an intermediate mass ratio merger that has
component masses straddling the gap. Using the GW190521 posterior samples from
the analysis in Nitz & Capano (2021), we find an increase in Bayes factors in
favor of the gap. However, the overall conclusions are unchanged: There is no
preference for a gap when using the Powerlaw+Peak model. This work paves the
way for constraining the physics of pair-instability and pulsational

impact point of the MIP along the crystal bar. We tested LYSO:Ce bars of
different thickness (2, 3, 4 mm) with a geometry close to the reference design
and coupled to SiPMs manufactured by Hamamatsu and Fondazione Bruno Kessler.
The various aspects influencing the timing performance such as the crystal
thickness, properties of the SiPMs (e.g. photon detection efficiency), and
impact angle of the MIP are studied. A time resolution of about 28 ps is
measured for MIPs crossing a 3 mm thick crystal bar, corresponding to an MPV
energy deposition of 2.6 MeV, and of 22 ps for the 4.2 MeV MPV energy
deposition expected in the BTL, matching the detector performance target for
unirradiated devices.

CTC decoder, when compounded with an external language model and trained on
both public and internal data, outperforms all the others in accuracy and
computational complexity. Unlike the more common Transformer-based models, this
architecture can handle inputs of arbitrary length, a requirement for universal
line recognition. Using an internal dataset collected from multiple sources, we
also expose the limitations of current public datasets in evaluating the
accuracy of line recognizers, as the relatively narrow image width and sequence

assess the effect of a treatment. Automatic detection of health outcomes from
text would undoubtedly speed up access to evidence necessary in healthcare
decision making. Prior work on outcome detection has modelled this task as
either (a) a sequence labelling task, where the goal is to detect which text
spans describe health outcomes, or (b) a classification task, where the goal is
to classify a text into a pre-defined set of categories depending on an outcome
that is mentioned somewhere in that text. However, this decoupling of span
detection and classification is problematic from a modelling perspective and
ignores global structural correspondences between sentence-level and word-level
information present in a given text. To address this, we propose a method that
uses both word-level and sentence-level information to simultaneously perform
outcome span detection and outcome type classification. In addition to
injecting contextual information to hidden vectors, we use label attention to
appropriately weight both word and sentence level information. Experimental
results on several benchmark datasets for health outcome detection show that
our proposed method consistently outperforms decoupled methods, reporting
competitive results.

recently shown great success in directly detecting planetary signals and
enabling the characterization of their atmospheres. One such technique aims to
observe a system at multiple epochs and combine the measured planetary radial
velocities from each epoch into a measurement of the planetary Keplerian
orbital velocity $K_p$, constituting a direct detection of the planetary
signal. Recent work has shown that in few-epoch ($\sim$5) data sets, unintended
structure can arise at a high level, obscuring the planetary detection. In this
work, we look to simulations to examine whether there are ways to reduce this
structured noise in few-epoch data sets by careful planning of observations.
The choice of observation date allows observers to select the primary (stellar)
velocity - through a set systemic velocity and chosen barycentric velocity -
and the planetary orbital phase, and so we focus on the effects of these two
parameters. We find that epochs taken when the primary velocity is near zero,
and the stellar lines remain relatively fixed to the telluric rest-frame,
greatly reduce the level of structured noise and allow for much stronger
planetary detections, on average more than twice the significance of detections
made with epochs using randomly selected primary velocities. Following these
results, we recommend that observers looking to build up high-resolution
multi-epoch data sets target nights when their system has a near-zero primary
velocity.

electron diffraction and microscopy, ultra-high brightness photocathodes are
actively sought to improve electron beam quality. Beam dynamics codes often
approximate the Coulomb interaction with mean-field space charge, which is a
good approximation in traditional beams. However, point-to-point Coulomb
effects, such as disorder induced heating and the Boersch effect, can not be
neglected in cold, dense beams produced by such photocathodes. In this paper,
we introduce two new numerical methods to calculate the important effects of
the photocathode image charge when using a point-to-point interaction model.
Equipped with an accurate model of the image charge, we calculate the effects
of point-to-point interactions on two high brightness photoemission beamlines
for ultrafast diffraction. The first beamline uses a 200 keV gun, whereas the
second uses a 5 MeV gun, each operating in the single-shot diffraction regime
with $10^5$ electrons/pulse. Assuming a zero photoemission temperature, it is
shown that including stochastic Coulomb effects increases the final emittance
of these beamlines by over a factor of 2 and decreases the peak transverse
phase space density by over a factor of 3 as compared to mean-field
simulations. We then introduce a method to compute the energy released by
disorder induced heating using the pair correlation function. This disorder
induced heating energy was found to scale very near the theoretical result for
stationary ultracold plasmas, and it accounts for over half of the emittance
growth above mean-field simulations.

In these situations, images should ideally be spatially coregistred, corrected
and compensated for differences in the image domains. Such procedures require
the interaction of the user, involve tuning of many parameters and heuristics,
and are usually applied separately. Changes of sensors and acquisition
conditions translate into shifts, twists, warps and foldings of the image
distributions (or manifolds). The proposed semisupervised manifold alignment
(SS-MA) method aligns the images working directly on their manifolds, and is
thus not restricted to images of the same resolutions, either spectral or
spatial. SS-MA pulls close together samples of the same class while pushing
those of different classes apart. At the same time, it preserves the geometry
of each manifold along the transformation. The method builds a linear
invertible transformation to a latent space where all images are alike, and
reduces to solving a generalized eigenproblem of moderate size. We study the
performance of SS-MA in toy examples and in real multiangular, multitemporal,
and multisource image classification problems. The method performs well for
strong deformations and leads to accurate classification for all domains.

  $\rho(\phi,t) = \frac{a[\frac{\beta IS}{N}-\gamma I]}{ a[\frac{\beta

be impractical and recently such models have been trained with velocity and
pressure measurements. For gradient-based optimization, such as training deep
learning models, this requires evaluating the sensitivities of the RANS
equations. This paper explores the use of an ensemble approximation of the
sensitivities of the RANS equations in training data-driven turbulence models
with indirect observations. A deep neural network representing the turbulence
model is trained using the network's gradients obtained by backpropagation and
the ensemble approximation of the RANS sensitivities. Different ensemble
approximations are explored and a method based on explicit projection onto the
sample space is presented. As validation, the gradient approximations from the
different methods are compared to that from the continuous adjoint equations.
The ensemble approximation is then used to learn different turbulence models
from velocity observations. In all cases, the learned model predicts improved
velocities. However, it was observed that once the sensitivity of the velocity
to the underlying model becomes small, the approximate nature of the ensemble
gradient hinders further optimization of the underlying model. The benefits and
limitations of the ensemble gradient approximation are discussed, in particular
as compared to the adjoint equations.

of these factorisations can be associated with parameter values for which the
underlying manifold becomes singular. For the cases we consider here, the
singularities are all of conifold or hyperconifold type. In these cases the
numerator degenerates to a cubic and this factorises into the product of a
linear and a quadratic factor. The quadratic term contains a coefficient that
is the p'th coefficient of a modular form. Some of our examples have
singularities when the parameter satisfies a polynomial equation that does not
factorise over Q. When this happens, the corresponding forms are modular forms
with neben type or Hilbert modular forms. The numerator can also factorise into
two quadrics. This happens when the Hodge structure of the manifold splits,

knowledge graph completion via link prediction aims to overcome this challenge
by inferring missing facts represented as links between entities. Current
approaches to link prediction leverage tensor factorization and/or deep
learning. Factorization methods train and deploy rapidly thanks to their small
number of parameters but have limited expressiveness due to their underlying
linear methodology. Deep learning methods are more expressive but also
computationally expensive and prone to overfitting due to their large number of
trainable parameters. We propose Neural Powered Tucker Network (NePTuNe), a new
hybrid link prediction model that couples the expressiveness of deep models
with the speed and size of linear models. We demonstrate that NePTuNe provides
state-of-the-art performance on the FB15K-237 dataset and near state-of-the-art
performance on the WN18RR dataset.

an outer loop to converge the Eddington tensor and an inner loop to converge
the iteration between the temperature equation and the VEF system. By
converging the outer iteration, one obtains the fully implicit TRT solution for
the given time step with a relatively low number of transport sweeps. However,
one could choose to perform exactly one outer iteration (and therefore exactly
one sweep) per time step, resulting in a semi-implicit scheme that is both
highly efficient and robust. Our results indicate that the error between the

two-tone flux modulation can be used to create a continuum of dynamical sweet

first-order insensitive to slow flux noise. To illustrate some advantages of
this flexibility, we use bichromatic flux control to reduce the error rates and

ways that are contrary to developers' intent. Current methods to identify such
unanticipated feature interactions are costly and inadequate. To address this

product lines where constraints on feature combinations are specified and in
feature-rich configurable systems where such specifications often are not
available. The contribution of the paper is to use program analysis to extract
feature-relevant learning models from the source code in order to detect
unwanted feature interactions. Where specifications of feature constraints are
unavailable, our approach infers the constraints using feature-related
data-flow dependency information. Evaluation in experiments on three software
product line benchmarks and a highly configurable system shows that this
approach is fast and effective. The contribution is to support developers by
automatically detecting feature combinations in a new product or version that
can interact in unwanted or unrecognized ways. This enables better
understanding of latent interactions and identifies software components that
should be tested together because their features interact in some

trust as a relation among entities that participate in various protocols. Trust
relations are based on evidence created by the interactions of entities within
a protocol and may be a composite of multiple metrics such as availability,
reliability, resilience, etc. depending on application context. We first
elaborate on the importance of trust as a metric and then present a
mathematical framework for trust computation and aggregation within a network.
Then we show in practice, how trust can be integrated into network
decision-making processes by presenting two examples. In the first example, we
show how utilizing the trust evidence can improve the performance and the
security of Federated Learning. Second, we show how a 5G network resource
provisioning framework can be improved when augmented with a trust-aware
decision-making scheme. We verify the validity of our trust-based approach

and sufficient equilibrium conditions are given by a stochastic inclusion.
Under a monotonicity assumption on the operator, we develop a variance-reduced

inexact smoothed proximal best-response framework. We consider the smoothed
counterpart of this game where each player's problem is smoothed via randomized
smoothing. Notably, under suitable assumptions, we show that an $\eta$-smoothed
game admits an $\eta$-approximate Nash equilibrium of the original game. Our
proposed scheme produces a sequence that converges almost surely to an

developing a variance-reduced zeroth-order scheme for such problems that admits
a fast rate of convergence. Numerical studies on a class of multi-leader

this model to a sample of SDSS MaNGA galaxies. This model fits the velocity and
velocity dispersion fields of galaxies with regular kinematics. By introducing
two parameters $\zeta$ related to the comparison of the model's asymmetric
drift correction to the observed gas kinematics and $\eta$ related to the
dominant component of a galaxy, we classify the galaxies in the sample as
""disc-dominated"", ""non-disc-dominated"", or ""disc-free"" indicating galaxies with
a dominating thin disc, a non-dominating thin disc, or no thin disc detection
with our method, respectively. The dynamical mass resulting from our model
correlates with stellar mass, and we investigate discrepancies by including gas
mass and variation of the initial mass function. As expected, most spiral
galaxies in the sample are disc-dominated, while ellipticals are predominantly
disc-free. Lenticular galaxies show a dichotomy in their kinematic
classification, which is related to their different star formation rates and
gas fractions. We propose two possible scenarios to explain these results. In
the first scenario, disc-free lenticulars formed in more violent processes than
disc-dominated ones, while in the second scenario, the quenching processes in
lenticulars lead to a change in their kinematic structures as disc-dominated
lenticulars evolve to disc-free ones.

modeling the limb darkened WASP-121b transit from the TESS light curve. Our
method is motivated by the need to improve $R_{p}/R_{\ast}$ estimates for
exoplanet atmosphere modeling, and is particularly effective with the limb
darkening (LD) quadratic law requiring no prior central value from stellar
atmospheric models. With the non-linear LD law, the method has all the
advantages of not needing atmospheric models but does not converge. The
iterative method gives a different $R_{p}/R_{\ast}$ for WASP-121b at a
significance level of 1$\sigma$ when compared with existing non-iterative
methods. To assess the origins and implications of this difference, we generate
and analyze light curves with known values of the limb darkening coefficients
(LDCs). We find that non-iterative modeling with LDC priors from stellar
atmospheric models results in an inconsistent $R_{p}/R_{\ast}$ at 1.5$\sigma$
level when the known LDC values are as those previously found when modeling
real data by the iterative method. In contrast, the LDC values from the
iterative modeling yields the correct value of $R_{p}/R_{\ast}$ to within
0.25$\sigma$. For more general cases with different known inputs, Monte Carlo
simulations show that the iterative method obtains unbiased LDCs and correct
$R_{p}/R_{\ast}$ to within a significance level of 0.3$\sigma$. Biased LDC
priors can cause biased LDC posteriors and lead to bias in the $R_{p}/R_{\ast}$
of up to 0.82$\%$, 2.5$\sigma$ for the quadratic law and 0.32$\%$, 1.0$\sigma$
for the non-linear law. Our improvement in $R_{p}/R_{\ast}$ estimation is
important when analyzing exoplanet atmospheres.

is possibly discontinuous across the interface curve $\Gamma$ and contains a
delta function singularity along the curve $\Gamma$, both the solution $u$ of
the Poisson interface problem and its flux $\nabla u\cdot \vec{n}$ are often
discontinuous across the interface. To solve the Poisson interface problem with
singular sources, in this paper we propose a sixth order compact finite

difference scheme with explicitly given stencils extends the immersed interface

usually shows substantial discrepancies with experimental data within the
Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) regime, as the low-temperature chemistry
is more fuel-specific than high-temperature chemistry. This paper proposes a
machine learning approach to learn the HyChem models that can cover both
high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. Specifically, we develop a HyChem
model using the experimental datasets of ignition delay times covering a wide
range of temperatures and equivalence ratios. The chemical kinetic model is
treated as a neural network model, and we then employ stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), a technique that was developed for deep learning, for the
training. We demonstrate the approach in learning the HyChem model for F-24,
which is a Jet-A derived fuel, and compare the results with previous work
employing genetic algorithms. The results show that the SGD approach can
achieve comparable model performance with genetic algorithms but the
computational cost is reduced by 1000 times. In addition, with regularization
in SGD, the SGD approach changes the kinetic parameters from their original
values much less than genetic algorithm and is thus more likely to retrain
mechanistic meanings. Finally, our approach is built upon open-source packages
and can be applied to the development and optimization of chemical kinetic
models for internal combustion engine simulations.

Hash technique. Compared to the present CBHIR framework, the structural
information of WSI is preserved through graph embedding of GCNs, which makes
the retrieval framework more sensitive to regions that are similar in tissue

proposed framework has good scalability for both the size and shape variation

to process time dependent data streams. Higher reservoir dimensionality is
obtained through the time-multiplexing method, emulating ""virtual"" neurons as

In this note we present a new way of performing it, based on a novel two-block
dynamics with a probabilistic proof instead of the original spectral one. We
illustrate the method by very directly proving an upper bound on the relaxation
time of KCM like the one for the East model in a strikingly general setting.
Namely, we treat KCM on finite or infinite one-dimensional volumes, with any
boundary condition, conditioned on any of the irreducible components of the
state space, with arbitrary site-dependent state spaces and, most importantly,
arbitrary inhomogeneous rules.

the power grid can help assess a set of its values and parameters, in

Inertia constant of the power grid is one of the system stability related
parameters that is essential for planning of the system spinning reserve.
Estimates of the grid inertia constant require precise information of the
system frequency at the time of disturbance. In this paper, an improved method
for such estimate is presented, which is based on the derived data of frequency
variations obtained from PMUs. In addition, a way to obtain the appropriate
interval for the lowest error estimate is discussed. The method has been
applied to assess the inertia constant of the Iranian power grid, by obtaining
the rate of change of frequency after a disturbance in the defined interval,
and the rate of specified power imbalance between electrical power input and

using RoBERTa as a case study. Among our findings: linguistic knowledge is
acquired fast, stably, and robustly across domains. Facts and commonsense are
slower and more domain-sensitive. Reasoning abilities are, in general, not

learning of various structured graph data. While promising, most existing GNNs
oversimplified the complexity and diversity of the edges in the graph, and thus
inefficient to cope with ubiquitous heterogeneous graphs, which are typically
in the form of multi-relational graph representations. In this paper, we
propose RioGNN, a novel Reinforced, recursive and flexible neighborhood
selection guided multi-relational Graph Neural Network architecture, to
navigate complexity of neural network structures whilst maintaining
relation-dependent representations. We first construct a multi-relational
graph, according to the practical task, to reflect the heterogeneity of nodes,
edges, attributes and labels. To avoid the embedding over-assimilation among
different types of nodes, we employ a label-aware neural similarity measure to
ascertain the most similar neighbors based on node attributes. A reinforced
relation-aware neighbor selection mechanism is developed to choose the most
similar neighbors of a targeting node within a relation before aggregating all
neighborhood information from different relations to obtain the eventual node
embedding. Particularly, to improve the efficiency of neighbor selecting, we
propose a new recursive and scalable reinforcement learning framework with
estimable depth and width for different scales of multi-relational graphs.
RioGNN can learn more discriminative node embedding with enhanced
explainability due to the recognition of individual importance of each relation
via the filtering threshold mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on real-world
graph data and practical tasks demonstrate the advancements of effectiveness,
efficiency and the model explainability, as opposed to other comparative GNN
models.

interest for investors in financial markets. Such portfolios are
straightforwardly profitable because they include a small number of assets
whose prices not only oscillate predictably around a long-term mean but also
possess enough volatility. Roughly speaking, sparsity minimizes trading costs,
volatility provides arbitrage opportunities, and mean-reversion property equips
investors with ideal investment strategies. Finding such favorable portfolios
can be formulated as a nonconvex quadratic optimization problem with an
additional sparsity constraint. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
method for solving this problem and enjoying favorable theoretical properties
yet. In this paper, we develop an effective two-stage algorithm for this
problem. In the first stage, we apply a tailored penalty decomposition method
for finding a stationary point of this nonconvex problem. For a fixed penalty
parameter, the block coordinate descent method is utilized to find a stationary
point of the associated penalty subproblem. In the second stage, we improve the
result from the first stage via a greedy scheme that solves restricted
nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs). We show that
the optimal value of such a QCQP can be obtained by solving their semidefinite
relaxations. Numerical experiments on S\&P 500 are conducted to demonstrate the

as the functions of the source radius and the black hole spin. We study the

attention to the near-horizon (near-)extremal Kerr ((near-)NHEK) cases. We
reproduce the relevant numerical results using a more efficient method and get
new analytical results for (near-)extremal cases. The main non-trivial results
are: in the NHEK region of a (near-)extremal Kerr black hole, the escape
probability for a ZAMS tends to $\frac{7}{24}\approx 29.17\%$, independent of
the NHEK radius; at the innermost of the photon shell (IPS) in the near-NHEK

  \frac{5}{12} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} +
\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}\pi}\arctan\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\approx12.57\% .

relatively large nonzero value even though the ZAMS is in the deepest region of

graphs. Methods designed for heterogeneous graphs, on the other hand, fail to
learn complex semantic representations because they only use meta-paths instead
of meta-graphs. Furthermore, they cannot fully capture the content-based
correlations between nodes, as they either do not use the self-attention
mechanism or only use it to consider the immediate neighbors of each node,
ignoring the higher-order neighbors. We propose a novel Higher-order
Attribute-Enhancing (HAE) framework that enhances node embedding in a
layer-by-layer manner. Under the HAE framework, we propose a Higher-order
Attribute-Enhancing Graph Neural Network (HAEGNN) for heterogeneous network
representation learning. HAEGNN simultaneously incorporates meta-paths and
meta-graphs for rich, heterogeneous semantics, and leverages the self-attention
mechanism to explore content-based nodes interactions. The unique higher-order
architecture of HAEGNN allows examining the first-order as well as higher-order
neighborhoods. Moreover, HAEGNN shows good explainability as it learns the
importances of different meta-paths and meta-graphs. HAEGNN is also
memory-efficient, for it avoids per meta-path based matrix calculation.
Experimental results not only show HAEGNN superior performance against the
state-of-the-art methods in node classification, node clustering, and
visualization, but also demonstrate its superiorities in terms of memory
efficiency and explainability.

DeepDebug: a data-driven program repair approach which learns to detect and fix

bug-patching as a sequence-to-sequence learning task consisting of two steps:
(i) denoising pretraining, and (ii) supervised finetuning on the target
translation task. We show that pretraining on source code programs improves the
number of patches found by 33% as compared to supervised training from scratch,
while domain-adaptive pretraining from natural language to code further
improves the accuracy by another 32%. We refine the standard accuracy
evaluation metric into non-deletion and deletion-only fixes, and show that our
best model generates 75% more non-deletion fixes than the previous state of the

due to their potential to reveal non-equilibrium dynamics of crystal lattice

interpreting experimental data on the basis of one-phonon scattering,
understanding the role of individual phonons can be sometimes hindered by
multi-phonon excitations. In Ref. [{\it arXiv:2103.10108}] we have introduced a
rigorous approach for the calculation of the all-phonon inelastic scattering
intensity of solids from first-principles. In the present work, we describe our
implementation in detail and show that multi-phonon interactions are captured
efficiently by exploiting translational and time-reversal symmetries of the
crystal. We demonstrate its predictive power by calculating the scattering
patterns of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$), bulk MoS$_2$, and black
phosphorus (bP), and we obtain excellent agreement with our measurements of
thermal electron diffuse scattering. Remarkably, our results show that
multi-phonon excitations dominate in bP across multiple Brillouin zones, while
in MoS$_2$ they play a less pronounced role. We expand our analysis for each
system and examine the effect of individual atomic and interatomic vibrational
motion on the diffuse scattering signals. We further demonstrate the
high-throughput capability of our approach by reporting all-phonon scattering
maps of 2D MoSe2, WSe2, WS2, graphene, and CdI2, rationalizing in each case the
effect of multi-phonon processes. As a side point, we show that the special
displacement method reproduces the thermally distorted configuration that

to the optimal operation, management, and control of energy assets, for safe

nowadays than ever due to the large-scale adoption of distributed renewable
resources at the edge of the grid. The digital twins are leveraging
technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data analytics, machine
learning, and cloud computing, to analyze data from different energy sensors,
view and verify the status of physical energy assets and extract useful
information to predict and optimize the assets performance. In this paper, we
will provide an overview of the Digital Twins application domains in the smart
grid while analyzing existing the state of the art literature. We have focused
on the following application domains: energy asset modeling, fault and security
diagnosis, operational optimization, and business models. Most of the relevant
literature approaches found are published in the last three years showing that
the domain of Digital Twins application in smart grid is hot and gradually
developing. Anyway, there is no unified view on the Digital Twins
implementation and integration with energy management processes, thus, much
work still needs to be done to understand and automatize the smart grid

lens-source relative proper motions $\mu_\rel\simeq 9.5\pm 2.5\,\masyr$. For
the seventh, these two quantities could not be measured. These distributions
are consistent with a Galactic-bulge population of very low-mass (VLM) hosts

Electric-Double-Layer-Modulation microscopy. We numerically compute the change
in the local ion concentration that is the origin of this optical contrast for
three experimentally relevant geometries: nanosphere, nanowire, and nanohole.
In absence of plasmonic effects and physical absorption, the observable optical
contrast is proportional to the derivative of the ion concentration with
respect to the modulated potential. We demonstrate that this derivative depends
on the size of the object and, less intuitively, also on its surface charge.
This dependence is key to measuring the surface charge, in an absolute way,
using this method. Our results help to identify the experimental conditions
such as dynamic range and sensitivity that will be necessary for detecting the
elementary charge jumps. We conclude that the nanohole is the most suitable
geometry among these three for achieving elementary charge sensitivity.

Glacier along the margin of the northwestern Greenland Ice Sheet has
reinvigorated interest into the nature of large impacts into thick ice masses.
This circular structure is relatively shallow and exhibits a small central
uplift, whereas a peak-ring morphology is expected. This discrepancy may be due
to long-term and ongoing subglacial erosion but may also be explained by a
relatively recent impact through the Greenland Ice Sheet, which is expected to
alter the final crater morphology. Here we model crater formation using
hydrocode simulations, varying pre-impact ice thickness and impactor
composition over crystalline target rock. We find that an ice-sheet thickness
of 1.5 or 2 km results in a crater morphology that is consistent with the
present morphology of this structure. Further, an ice sheet that thick
substantially inhibits ejection of rocky material, which might explain the
absence of rocky ejecta in most existing Greenland deep ice cores if the impact
occurred during the late Pleistocene. From the present morphology of the
putative Hiawatha impact crater alone, we cannot distinguish between an older
crater formed by a pre-Pleistocene impact into ice-free bedrock or a younger,
Pleistocene impact into locally thick ice, but based on our modeling we
conclude that latter scenario is possible.

we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual

stress identification case in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have
considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under

captured over five months. We have employed a variant of Convolutional Neural

CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than

theories have been proposed to explain the observed behavior, but none of them
successfully explains the [E]/[Z] ratios. In this work we present a detailed
study of the kinetics of the one-step E-Z isomerization reactions of
cyanomethanimine, ethanimine and 2-propyn-1-imine under interstellar conditions
(in the 10-400 K temperature range). This reaction was previously thought to be
non-viable in the ISM due to its associated high-energy barrier (about 13,000
K). In this Letter, we show that considering the multidimensional small
curvature tunneling approximation, the tunneling effect enables the
isomerization even at low temperatures. This is due to the fact that the
representative tunneling energy lies in the vibrational ground state of the
least stable isomer up to approximately 150 K, making the reaction constants of
the isomerization from the least stable to the most stable isomer basically
constant. The predicted [E]/[Z] ratios are almost the same as those reported
from the astronomical observations for all imines observed. This study
demonstrates that the [E]/[Z] ratio of imines in the ISM strongly depends on

detection on attributed networks due to its importance in both research and
practice. Although various approaches have been proposed to solve this problem,
two major limitations exist: (1) unsupervised approaches usually work much less
efficiently due to the lack of supervisory signal, and (2) existing anomaly
detection methods only use local contextual information to detect anomalous
nodes, e.g., one- or two-hop information, but ignore the global contextual
information. Since anomalous nodes differ from normal nodes in structures and
attributes, it is intuitive that the distance between anomalous nodes and their
neighbors should be larger than that between normal nodes and their neighbors
if we remove the edges connecting anomalous and normal nodes. Thus, hop counts
based on both global and local contextual information can be served as the
indicators of anomaly. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a hop-count
based model (HCM) to detect anomalies by modeling both local and global
contextual information. To make better use of hop counts for anomaly
identification, we propose to use hop counts prediction as a self-supervised
task. We design two anomaly scores based on the hop counts prediction via HCM
model to identify anomalies. Besides, we employ Bayesian learning to train HCM
model for capturing uncertainty in learned parameters and avoiding overfitting.
Extensive experiments on real-world attributed networks demonstrate that our
proposed model is effective in anomaly detection.

first decomposes all language components in dialogues to explicitly resolve any
entity references and detect corresponding action-based inputs from the

instantiate neural module networks and extract visual cues from the video. Our

testing and evaluation. Analytical models can represent an attractive and
cost-effective approach for such evaluation if they can adequately model all
underlying effects that impact the performance of vehicular communications.
Several analytical models have been proposed to date to model vehicular
communications based on the IEEE 802.11p (or DSRC) standard. However, existing
models normally model in detail the MAC (Medium Access Control), and generally
simplify the propagation and interference effects. This reduces their value as
an alternative to evaluate the performance of vehicular communications. This
paper addresses this gap, and presents new analytical models that accurately
model the performance of vehicle-to-vehicle communications based on the IEEE
802.11p standard. The models jointly account for a detailed modeling of the
propagation and interference effects, as well as the impact of the hidden
terminal problem. The model quantifies the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) as a
function of the distance between transmitter and receiver. The paper also
presents new analytical models to quantify the probability of the four
different types of packet errors in IEEE 802.11p. In addition, the paper
presents the first analytical model capable to accurately estimate the Channel
Busy Ratio (CBR) metric even under high channel load levels. All the analytical
models are validated by means of simulation for a wide range of parameters,
including traffic densities, packet transmission frequencies, transmission
power levels, data rates and packet sizes. An implementation of the models is
provided openly to facilitate their use by the community.

optical parametric amplification that enables extremely large parametric gains

femtosecond pulses, multiple dispersion orders limit the effective interaction
length available for parametric amplification. Here, we use the dispersion
engineering available in periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate
nanowaveguides to eliminate several dispersion orders at once. The result is a
quasi-static process; the large peak intensity associated with a short pump
pulse can provide gain to signal photons without undergoing pulse distortion or
temporal walk-off. We characterize the parametric gain available in these
waveguides using optical parametric generation, where vacuum fluctuations are
amplified to macroscopic intensities. When driven with pulse energies in excess
of 10 pJ, we observe saturated parametric gains as large as 88 dB (146 dB/cm).
The devices shown here achieve saturated optical parametric generation with
orders of magnitude less pulse energy than previous techniques.

specific time intervals - such as the number of patients admitted to the
hospital or the volume of vehicles passing traffic loop detectors - and not the
exact occurrence time of the events. It is currently not understood how to fit
the Hawkes point processes to this kind of data. Its typical loss function (the
point process log-likelihood) cannot be computed without exact event times.
Furthermore, it does not have the independent increments property to use the
Poisson likelihood. This work builds a novel point process, a set of tools, and
approximations for fitting Hawkes processes within interval-censored data
scenarios. First, we define the Mean Behavior Poisson process (MBPP), a novel
Poisson process with a direct parameter correspondence to the popular
self-exciting Hawkes process. We fit MBPP in the interval-censored setting
using an interval-censored Poisson log-likelihood (IC-LL). We use the parameter
equivalence to uncover the parameters of the associated Hawkes process. Second,
we introduce two novel exogenous functions to distinguish the exogenous from
the endogenous events. We propose the multi-impulse exogenous function - for
when the exogenous events are observed as event time - and the latent
homogeneous Poisson process exogenous function - for when the exogenous events
are presented as interval-censored volumes. Third, we provide several
approximation methods to estimate the intensity and compensator function of
MBPP when no analytical solution exists. Fourth and finally, we connect the
interval-censored loss of MBPP to a broader class of Bregman divergence-based
functions. Using the connection, we show that the popularity estimation
algorithm Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP) is a particular case of the MBPP. We
verify our models through empirical testing on synthetic data and real-world
data.

PNe. Our primary effort, though, was focused on Campaign 11 which targeted a
Galactic bulge field containing approximately 183 PNe, in which we identified
30 candidate variable CSs. The periods of these variables range from 2.3~h to
30~d, and based on our analysis, most are likely to be close binary star
systems. We present periods and preliminary classifications (eclipsing, double
degenerate, or irradiated systems) for the likely binaries based on light curve
shape. From our total sample of 204 target PNe, with a correction for
incompleteness due to magnitude limits, we calculate a binary fraction of PN
central stars to be 20.7 percent for all the observed PNe, or 23.5 percent if
we limit our sample only to `true' PNe. However these fractions are almost
certainly lower limits due to the large angular size of the \emph{Kepler}
pixels, which leads to reduced sensitivity in detecting variability, primarily
as a result of dilution and noise from the nebula and neighbouring stars. We
discuss the binary population of CSs based on these results as part of the

Bragg peaks described by an ordering vector $q_{\rm CDW}$=(0 0 ${\delta}_c$)

different electronic structures with the CDW transition between two compounds.

suggested that topological features observed in brain networks give rise to a
Griffiths phase, leading to power-laws in brain activity dynamics and the
operational benefits of criticality in an extended parameter region. Motivated
by growing evidence of neural correlates of different states of consciousness,
we investigate how topological changes affect the expression of a Griffiths

Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible propagation model and find that we can control
the extension of the Griffiths phase by altering intra- and intermodular
connectivity. We find that by adjusting system parameters, we can counteract
changes in critical behavior and maintain a stable critical region despite
changes in network topology. Our results give insight into how structural

target language. Thus, by seeing words in context, the user can assimilate new
vocabulary without much conscious effort. We validate our approach in a careful
user study, finding that the efficacy of the lightweight Broccoli approach is
competitive with traditional, memorization-based vocabulary learning. The low
cognitive overhead is manifested in a pronounced decrease in learners' usage of
mnemonic learning strategies, as compared to traditional learning. Finally, we
establish that language patterns in typical information diets are compatible
with spaced-repetition strategies, thus enabling an efficient use of the
Broccoli paradigm. Overall, our work establishes the feasibility of a novel and
powerful ""install-and-forget"" approach for embedded language acquisition.

can be verified by carefully analyzing the frequency, amplitude, and phase of
MQOs. In particular, phase analysis, from which we can obtain the Berry phase,
has received much attention with the growing interest in the topology of

that MQOs can be used to determine the Fermi surface magnetization. We doped
dilute magnetic element Fe into the Dirac semimetal NbSb$_2$ to only introduce
magnetism without changing the shape of the Fermi surface. We observed a phase
shift in magnetically doped Fe-NbSb$_2$, which is in contrast to the lack of a
phase shift in pristine NbSb$_2$ and nonmagnetic Bi-doped NbSb$_2$, indicating
the strong exchange interaction between doped magnetic impurities and Fermi

magnetic Fe doping from the phase shift. This work demonstrates not only how
tiny magnetic impurities can significantly change the Fermi surface

and to achieve cost reductions. The fine-grained meter data also enable pricing
schemes that simultaneously benefit electricity retailers and users. Our goal
is to design a practical dynamic pricing protocol for smart grids in which the
rate charged by a retailer depends on the total demand among its users.
Realizing this goal is challenging because neither the retailer nor the users
are trusted. The first challenge is to design a pricing scheme that
incentivizes consumption behavior that leads to lower costs for both the users
and the retailer. The second challenge is to prevent the retailer from
tampering with the data, for example, by claiming that the total consumption is
much higher than its real value. The third challenge is data privacy, that is,
how to hide the meter data from adversarial users. To address these challenges,
we propose a scheme in which peak rates are charged if either the total or the
individual consumptions exceed some thresholds. We formally define a
privacy-preserving transparent pricing scheme (PPTP) that allows honest users
to detect tampering at the retailer while ensuring data privacy. We present two
instantiations of PPTP, and prove their security. Both protocols use secure
commitments and zero-knowledge proofs. We implement and evaluate the protocols
on server and edge hardware, demonstrating that PPTP has practical performance
at scale.

also depends on the perceptibility of these features to humans. To make sure an

proposed principle, a neural network with human-understandable explanations is
trained which, in a user study, is shown to better align with human intuition.

anomalies and regularities in data sets, in particular, in election results and
financial statements. Yet, basic financial market indices have not been much
studied, if studied at all, within such a perspective. This paper presents
features in the distributions of S\&P500 daily closing values and the
corresponding daily log returns over a long time interval, [03/01/1950 -
22/08/2014], amounting to 16265 data points. We address the frequencies of the
first, second, and first two significant digits counts and explore the
conformance to Benford's laws of these distributions at five different (equal
size) levels of disaggregation. The log returns are studied for either positive
or negative cases. The results for the S&P500 daily closing values are showing
a huge lack of non-conformity, whatever the different levels of disaggregation.
Some ""first digits"" and ""first two digits"" values are even missing. The causes
of this non-conformity are discussed, pointing to the danger in taking
Benford's laws for granted in huge databases, whence drawing ""definite
conclusions"". The agreements with Benford's laws are much better for the log
returns. Such a disparity in agreements finds an explanation in the data set
itself: the inherent trend in the index. To further validate this, daily
returns have been simulated calibrating the simulations with the observed data
averages and tested against Benford's laws. One finds that not only the trend
but also the standard deviation of the distributions are relevant parameters in
concluding about conformity with Benford's laws.

behavior of the AHE in the orthorhombic lattice system, where the AHE is
largely enhanced by the large coupling between the AMD and the spin-orbit

regime, described by a non-normalisable Wheeler-DeWitt wave functional $\Psi$,
must be in quantum nonequilibrium with a probability distribution
$P\neq\left\vert \Psi\right\vert ^{2}$ (initially and always). A Born rule can
emerge only in the semiclassical regime of quantum systems on a classical
spacetime background, with normalisable Schr\""{o}dinger wave functions $\psi$.
Conditioning on the underlying quantum-gravitational ensemble yields a
nonequilibrium distribution $\rho\neq\left\vert \psi\right\vert ^{2}$ at the
beginning of the semiclassical regime, with quantum relaxation
$\rho\rightarrow\left\vert \psi\right\vert ^{2}$ taking place only afterwards.
Quantum gravity naturally creates an early nonequilibrium universe. We also
show how small corrections to the Schr\""{o}dinger equation yield an
intermediate regime in which the Born rule is unstable: an initial distribution
$\rho=\left\vert \psi\right\vert ^{2}$ can evolve to a final distribution
$\rho\neq\left\vert \psi\right\vert ^{2}$. These results arise naturally in the
de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum gravity. We show that quantum
instability during inflation generates a large-scale deficit $\sim1/k^{3}$ in
the primordial power spectrum at wavenumber $k$, though the effect is too small
to observe. Similarly we find an unobservably large timescale for quantum
instability in a radiation-dominated universe. Quantum instability may be
important in black-hole evaporation, with a final burst of Hawking radiation
that violates the Born rule. Deviations from the Born rule can also be
generated for atomic systems in the gravitational field of the earth, though
the effects are unlikely to be observable. The most promising scenario for the
detection of Born-rule violations appears to be in radiation from exploding
primordial black holes.

fault-tolerant optical continuous-variable quantum computing and communication.
However, their realization in the optical domain remains to be demonstrated.
Here we propose a method for preparing GKP states using a cavity QED system as
the only non-Gaussian element. This system can be realized in several platforms
such as trapped atoms, quantum dots or diamond color centers. We simulate the
protocol with finite-cooperativity systems to evaluate the achievable quality
of the produced GKP states in realistic noisy systems. We further combine the
protocol with the previously proposed breeding protocol by Vasconcelos et al.
to relax the demands on the quality of the QED system. We find that GKP states
with more than 10 dB squeezing could be achieved in near-future experiments.
Additionally, the approach can be made fully deterministic, thus providing a
more scalable and hardware-efficient approach compared to probabilistic
approaches based on photon counting.

principles study on the prototypical Chevrel compound PbMo$_{6}$S$_{8}$,
including electronic, structural and vibrational properties at zero and high
pressure. We confirm the presence of an extremely strong electron-phonon
coupling, linked to the proximity to a R$\overline{3}$-P$\overline{1}$
structural phase transition, which weakens as the system, upon applied
pressures, is driven away from the phase boundary. A detailed description of
the superconducting state is obtained by means of fully \textit{ab initio}
superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). SCDFT accounts for the role
of phase instability, electron-phonon coupling with different intra- and
inter-molecular phonon modes, and without any empirical parameter, and
accurately reproduces the experimental critical temperature and gap. This study
provides the conclusive confirmation that Chevrel phases are phonon driven
superconductors mitigated, however, by an uncommonly strong Coulomb repulsion.
The latter is generated by the combined effect of repulsive Mo states at the
Fermi energy and a band gap in close proximity to the Fermi level. This is
crucial to rationalize why Chevrel phases, in spite of their extreme
electron-phonon coupling, have critical temperatures below 15~K. In addition,
we predict the evolution of the superconducting critical temperature as a
function of the external pressure, showing an excellent agreement with
available experimental data.

five individual algorithms (i.e., the quantile regression, linear boosting,
generalized random forest, gradient boosting machine and quantile regression

comparison is conducted by exploiting a large urban water flow dataset, as well

favour the practical systems designed using the linear boosting algorithm,
probably due to the presence of trends in the urban water flow time series. The
forecasts of the mean and median combiners are also found to be skilful in

thermalized EP), n = 2 EAEs and n = 3 NAEs are unstable. On the other hand, EPs
with an energy below 17 keV (late thermalization stage) lead to the
destabilization of n = 3 and n = 4 TAEs. The simulations for an off-axis NBI

the influence of the inhomogeneous forces the particle carries out a
time-dependent smooth, but complicated motion described by a set of affine
transformations. The rotation of the particle enables one to record optical
images from a wide range of angles, which largely eliminates the ""missing cone
problem"" in optics. This advantage, however, comes at the price that the
rotation axis in this scenario is not fixed, but continuously undergoes some
variations, and that the rotation angles are not equally spaced, which is in
contrast to standard tomographic reconstruction assumptions. In the present
work, we assume that the time-dependent motion parameters are known, and that
the particle's scattering potential is compatible with making the first order
Born or Rytov approximation. We prove a Fourier diffraction theorem and derive
novel backprojection formulae for the reconstruction of the scattering
potential, which depends on the refractive index distribution inside the
object, taking its complicated motion into account. This provides the basis for
solving the ODT problem with an efficient non-uniform discrete Fourier

following important aspects no consensus has been reached: (i) a possible
deviation of the easy axis from the normal to the VI$_3$ layers, (ii) a
possible inequivalence of the V atoms, (iii) the value of the V magnetic
moments. The theoretical works differ in the conclusions on the conduction
nature of the system,the value and the role of the V orbital moments. To the
best of our knowledge there is no theoretical works addressing issues (i) and
(ii) and only one work dealing with the reduced value of the V moment. By
combining the symmetry arguments with density functional theory (DFT) and
DFT+$U$ calculations we have shown that the antidimerization distortion of the
crystal structure reported in Phys. Rev. B {\bf 99}, 041402(R) (2019) must lead
to the deviation of the easy axis from the normal to the VI$_3$ layers in close
correlation with the experimental results. The antidimerization accompanied by
the breaking the inversion symmetry leads to the inequivalence of the V atoms.
Our DFT+U calculations result in large value 0.8\mu_B$ of the V orbital moments
of the V atoms leading to reduced total V moment in agreement with a number of
experimental results and with the physical picture suggested in Phys. Rev. B bf

spin and orbital moments revealing strong competition between effects coursed
by the on-site electron correlation, spin-orbit coupling, and interatomic
hybridization since pure intraatomic effects lead to collinear spin and orbital

magnetoelastic coupling revealing itself in the strong dependence of the

next-generation, cutting-edge detectors for low-background experiments in
particle physics. This work presents systematic reflectivity studies of Silicon
Photomultipliers (SiPM) and other samples in liquid xenon at vacuum ultraviolet
(VUV) wavelengths. A dedicated setup at the University of M\""unster has been
used that allows to acquire angle-resolved reflection measurements of various
samples immersed in liquid xenon with 0.45{\deg} angular resolution. Four
samples are investigated in this work: one Hamamatsu VUV4 SiPM, one FBK VUV-HD
SiPM, one FBK wafer sample and one Large-Area Avalanche Photodiode (LA-APD)
from EXO-200. The reflectivity is determined to be 25-36% at an angle of
incidence of 20{\deg} for the four samples and increases to up to 65% at
70{\deg} for the LA-APD and the FBK samples. The Hamamatsu VUV4 SiPM shows a
decline with increasing angle of incidence. The reflectivity results will be
incorporated in upcoming light response simulations of the nEXO detector.

Laguerre plane of order $q^n$ (for some $n$). In setting out a programme to
construct new generalised quadrangles, Shult and Thas asked whether there are
pseudo-ovals consisting only of lines of an elliptic quadric ${Q}^-(5,q)$,
non-equivalent to the $classical$ $example$, a so-called $pseudo$-$conic$. To
date, every known pseudo-oval of lines of ${Q}^-(5,q)$ is projectively
equivalent to a pseudo-conic. Thas characterised pseudo-conics as pseudo-ovals
satisfying the $perspective$ property, and this paper is on characterisations
of pseudo-conics from an algebraic combinatorial point of view. In particular,
we show that pseudo-ovals in $Q^-(5,q)$ and pseudo-conics can be characterised
as certain Delsarte designs of an interesting five-class association scheme.
These association schemes are introduced and explored, and we provide a

the local calculation of realistic microphysics coefficients. Here we present
the latest extension of the magneto-thermal 2D code in which we have coupled
the crustal evolution to the core evolution, including ambipolar diffusion. It
has also gained in modularity, accuracy, and efficiency. We revise the most
suitable numerical methods to accurately simulate magnetar-like magnetic

also computationally expensive because it requires large matrix inversions due
to the use of an implicit method. We show two representative case studies: (i)
a non-trivial multipolar configuration confined to the crust, displaying
long-lived small-scale structures and discontinuities; and (ii) a preliminary
study of ambipolar diffusion in normal matter. The latter acts on timescales
that are too long to have relevant effects on the timescales of interest but

value that is used to explain the result of a learned model on a specific
entity by assigning a score to every feature. While in general computing
Shapley values is an intractable problem, we prove a strong positive result
stating that the $\mathsf{SHAP}$-score can be computed in polynomial time over
deterministic and decomposable Boolean circuits. Such circuits are studied in
the field of Knowledge Compilation and generalize a wide range of Boolean
circuits and binary decision diagrams classes, including binary decision trees
and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs).
  We also establish the computational limits of the SHAP-score by observing
that computing it over a class of Boolean models is always polynomially as hard
as the model counting problem for that class. This implies that both
determinism and decomposability are essential properties for the circuits that
we consider. It also implies that computing $\mathsf{SHAP}$-scores is
intractable as well over the class of propositional formulas in DNF. Based on
this negative result, we look for the existence of fully-polynomial randomized
approximation schemes (FPRAS) for computing $\mathsf{SHAP}$-scores over such

an FPRAS, we prove that no such FPRAS exists for the computation of
$\mathsf{SHAP}$-scores. Surprisingly, this negative result holds even for the
class of monotone formulas in DNF. These techniques can be further extended to
prove another strong negative result: Under widely believed complexity
assumptions, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that checks, given a
monotone DNF formula $\varphi$ and features $x,y$, whether the
$\mathsf{SHAP}$-score of $x$ in $\varphi$ is smaller than the

learning methodology that allows multiple clients (i.e., workers) to
collaboratively train statistical models without disclosing private training
data. Due to the characteristics of data remaining localized and the
uninspected on-device training process, there may exist Byzantine workers
launching data poisoning and model poisoning attacks, which would seriously
deteriorate model performance or prevent the model from convergence. Most of
the existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes are either ineffective against several
advanced poisoning attacks or need to centralize a public validation dataset,
which is intractable in FL. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of the
existing Byzantine-robust distributed learning methods could well exert its
power in Non-Independent and Identically distributed (Non-IID) data among
clients. To address these issues, we propose FedCom, a novel Byzantine-robust
federated learning framework by incorporating the idea of commitment from
cryptography, which could achieve both data poisoning and model poisoning
tolerant FL under practical Non-IID data partitions. Specifically, in FedCom,
each client is first required to make a commitment to its local training data
distribution. Then, we identify poisoned datasets by comparing the Wasserstein
distance among commitments submitted by different clients. Furthermore, we
distinguish abnormal local model updates from benign ones by testing each local
model's behavior on its corresponding data commitment. We conduct an extensive
performance evaluation of FedCom. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust schemes
in defending against typical data poisoning and model poisoning attacks under
practical Non-IID data distributions.

hand multiple modes of observation with differing noise-vs-cost trade-offs.
This paper considers matrix completion subject to such constraints: a budget is
imposed and the experimentalist's goal is to allocate this budget between two
sampling modalities in order to recover an accurate low-rank approximation.
Specifically, we consider that it is possible to obtain low noise, high cost
observations of individual entries or high noise, low cost observations of
entire columns. We introduce a regression-based completion algorithm for this

monitoring of cows is gaining in interest. Lameness, a prevalent health
disorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing the gait of cows. A
cow's gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models
learn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most
animal pose estimation models are static, that is, videos are processed frame
by frame and do not use any temporal information. In this work, a static
deep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal model
that includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the
static and temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples
of 4 consecutive frames extracted from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy
cows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments are prone to
occlusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by
adding artificial occlusions to the videos.The experiments showed that, on
non-occluded data, both static and temporal approaches achieved a Percentage of
Correct Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our temporal approach
outperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data
was beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as
dairy farms. The generalization capabilities of the temporal model was
evaluated by testing it on data containing unknown cows (cows not present in
the training set). The results showed that the average PCKh@0.2 was of 93.8% on
known cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model was capable of
generalizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new
herds. Finally, we showed that with harder tasks, such as occlusions and
unknown cows, a deeper architecture was more beneficial.

Mstar=9.1x10^6 Msun and a very low mass-to-light ratio Mstar/Lg~0.0166 (in
solar units), J2229+2725 deviates strongly from the luminosity-metallicity
relation defined by the bulk of the SFGs in the SDSS. J2229$+$2725 has a very
high specific star-formation rate sSFR~75 Gyr^-1, indicating very active
ongoing star formation. Three other features of J2229+2725 are most striking,
being the most extreme among lowest-metallicity SFGs: 1) a ratio
O32=I([OIII]5007)/I([OII]3727)~53, 2) an equivalent width of the Hbeta emission
line EW(Hbeta) of 577A, and 3) an electron number density of ~1000 cm^-3. These
properties imply that the starburst in J2229+2725 is very young. Using the
extremely high O32 in J2229+2725, we have improved the strong-line calibration
for the determination of oxygen abundances in the most metal-deficient
galaxies, in the range 12 + logO/H<7.3.

streams of jobs, namely a \textit{smart}, and two \textit{dedicated} streams,
flow into a single server system, which can hold at most one job. Arriving jobs
that find the server occupied are routed to the orbits as follows: Blocked jobs
from the \textit{smart} stream are routed to the shortest orbit queue, and in
case of a tie, they choose an orbit randomly. Blocked jobs from the
\textit{dedicated} streams are routed directly to their orbits. Orbiting jobs
retry to connect with the server at different retrial rates, i.e.,
heterogeneous orbit queues. Applications of such a system are found in the
modelling of wireless cooperative networks. We are interested in the asymptotic
behaviour of the stationary distribution of this model, provided that the
system is stable. More precisely, we investigate the conditions under which the
tail asymptotic of the minimum orbit queue length is exactly geometric.
Moreover, we apply a heuristic asymptotic approach to obtain approximations of
the steady-state joint orbit queue-length distribution. Useful numerical
examples are presented, and shown that the results obtained through the

researches. For decades, the lexical matching signal has dominated the ad-hoc
retrieval process, but solely using this signal in retrieval may cause the
vocabulary mismatch problem. In recent years, with the development of
representation learning techniques, many researchers turn to Dense Retrieval
(DR) models for better ranking performance. Although several existing DR models
have already obtained promising results, their performance improvement heavily
relies on the sampling of training examples. Many effective sampling strategies
are not efficient enough for practical usage, and for most of them, there still
lacks theoretical analysis in how and why performance improvement happens. To
shed light on these research questions, we theoretically investigate different
training strategies for DR models and try to explain why hard negative sampling
performs better than random sampling. Through the analysis, we also find that
there are many potential risks in static hard negative sampling, which is
employed by many existing training methods. Therefore, we propose two training
strategies named a Stable Training Algorithm for dense Retrieval (STAR) and a
query-side training Algorithm for Directly Optimizing Ranking pErformance
(ADORE), respectively. STAR improves the stability of DR training process by
introducing random negatives. ADORE replaces the widely-adopted static hard
negative sampling method with a dynamic one to directly optimize the ranking
performance. Experimental results on two publicly available retrieval benchmark
datasets show that either strategy gains significant improvements over existing
competitive baselines and a combination of them leads to the best performance.

the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. These data provide
the highest spatial resolution and deepest images of IC4329A in the far and

data has allowed us to accurately separate the extended emission from the host
galaxy and the AGN emission in the far and near UV bands. We derive the
intrinsic AGN flux after correcting for the Galactic and internal reddening, as
well as for the contribution of emission lines from the broad and narrow-line
regions. The intrinsic UV continuum emission shows a marked deficit compared to
that expected from the ""standard"" models of the accretion disk around an
estimated black hole mass of 1-2x10^8Msun when the disk extends to the
innermost stable circular orbit. We find that the intrinsic UV continuum is
fully consistent with the standard disk models, but only if the disk emits from
distances larger than 80-150 gravitational radii.

density profile (core) whose physical origin is hotly debated. Cores are
theoretically expected in N-body systems of maximum entropy, however, they are
not present in the canonical N-body numerical simulations of cold dark matter
(CDM). Our work shows that despite this apparent contradiction between theory
and numerical simulations, they are fully consistent. Simply put, cores are
characteristic of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, but thermalizing
collisions are purposely suppressed in CDM simulations. When collisions are
allowed, N-body numerical simulations develop cored density profiles, in
perfect agreement with the theoretical expectation. We compare theory and two
types of numerical simulations: (1) when DM particles are self-interacting
(SIDM) with enough cross-section, then the effective two-body relaxation
timescale becomes shorter than the Hubble time resulting in cored DM haloes.
The haloes thus obtained, with masses from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters,
collapse to a single shape after normalization, and this shape agrees with the
polytropic density profile theoretically expected. (2) The inner radii in
canonical N-body numerical simulations are always discarded because the use of
finite-mass DM particles artificially increases the two-body collision rate. We
show that the discarded radii develop cores that are larger than the employed
numerical softening and have polytropic shapes independently of halo mass. Our
work suggests that the presence of cores in simulated (or observed) density
profiles can used as evidence for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.

the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray spectra of luminous active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). This implies that high-velocity winds/outflows are common in AGNs. In
order to study the formation of high-velocity winds, especially ultrafast
outflows (UFOs), we perform two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations. Initially, a magnetic field is set to be weaker than the gas
pressure at the disk surface. In our simulations, line force operates on the
region like filaments because the X-ray radiation from corona is shielded by
dense gas in the inner region at some angle. The location of filaments changes
with time and then the line-driven winds are exposed to X-ray and become highly
ionized. The line force at the UV bands does not directly drive the highly
ionized winds. In the sense of time average, the properties of high-velocity
winds meet the formation condition of UFOs. Compared with line force, the
function of magnetic field is negligible in directly driving winds. In the MHD
model, the region around the rotational axis becomes magnetic-pressure
dominated, which prevents gases from spreading to higher latitudes and then
enhances the gas column density at middle and low latitudes (20$^{\rm
o}$--70$^{\rm o}$). Higher column density is helpful to shield X-ray photons,
which causes the line force to be more effective in the MHD model than in the
hydrodynamic model. Higher-velocity winds with a broader opening angle are
produced in the MHD model.

finding is that the dual-stream scores are not much different than the

pre-training causes the performance drop in NLU tasks with few exceptions.

results of 2D and 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of convection to
specify the value of the adiabatic specific entropy at the bottom of the
convective envelope in stars as a function of their effective temperature,
surface gravity and metallicity. For the first time, this calibration is fully
integrated within the flow of a stellar evolution code, with the mixing-length
parameter being continuously updated at run-time. This approach replaces the
more common, but questionable, procedure of calibrating the length scale
parameter on the Sun, and then applying the solar-calibrated value in modeling
other stars, regardless of their mass, composition and evolutionary status. The
internal consistency of our current implementation makes it suitable for
application to evolved stars, in particular to red giants. We show that the
entropy calibrated models yield a revised position of the red giant branch that
is in better agreement with observational constraints than that of standard

sources is a challenging problem, as even the most similar sources might lead
to unexpected negative transfer results. Thus, ranking methods based on task
and text similarity -- as suggested in prior work -- may not be sufficient to
identify promising sources. To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach
to automatically determine which and how many sources should be exploited. For
this, we study the effects of model transfer on sequence labeling across
various domains and tasks and show that our methods based on model similarity
and support vector machines are able to predict promising sources, resulting in
performance increases of up to 24 F1 points.

branching fractions of the decays $D^0\to K^-e^+\nu_e$ and $D^+\to \bar K^0

$(8.68\pm0.14_{\rm stat}\pm 0.16_{\rm syst})\%$, respectively. Starting with
the process $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$, a new reconstruction method is employed to
select events that contain candidates for both $D\to \bar Ke^+\nu_e$ and $\bar
D\to Ke^-\bar \nu_e$ decays. The branching fractions reported in this work are
consistent within uncertainties with previous BESIII measurements that selected
events containing $D\to \bar Ke^+\nu_e$ and hadronic $\bar D$ decays. Combining
our results with the lifetimes of the $D^0$ and $D^+$ mesons and the previous
BESIII measurements leads to a ratio of the two decay partial widths of
$\frac{\bar \Gamma_{D^0\to K^{-}e^+\nu_{e}}}{\bar \Gamma_{D^{+}\to \bar

neural ranker architecture, which leverages multilingual transformer
representations of text to be easily applied to a multilingual setting. We then
explore how a neural ranker trained in one language (e.g. English) transfers to
an unseen language (e.g. Chinese), and find that while there is a consistent

alleviated? We explore adding an adversarial objective to force our model to

zero-shot transfer.

used during the making of a citation. A key issue in citation content analysis
is looking for linguistic structures that characterize distinct classes of
citations for the purposes of understanding the intent and function of a
citation. Previous works have focused on modeling linguistic features first and
drawn conclusions on the language structures unique to each class of citation
function based on the performance of a classification task or inter-annotator
agreement. In this study, we start with a large sample of a pre-classified
citation corpus, 2 million citations from each class of the scite Smart
Citation dataset (supporting, disputing, and mentioning citations), and analyze
its corpus linguistics in order to reveal the unique and statistically
significant language structures belonging to each type of citation. By
generating comparison tables for each citation type we present a number of
interesting linguistic features that uniquely characterize citation type. What
we find is that within citation collocates, there is very low correlation
between citation type and sentiment. Additionally, we find that the
subjectivity of citation collocates across classes is very low. These findings
suggest that the sentiment of collocates is not a predictor of citation
function and that due to their low subjectivity, an opinion-expressing mode of
understanding citations, implicit in previous citation sentiment analysis
literature, is inappropriate. Instead, we suggest that citations can be better
understood as claims-making devices where the citation type can be explained by
understanding how two claims are being compared. By presenting this approach,
we hope to inspire similar corpus linguistic studies on citations that derive a
more robust theory of citation from an empirical basis using citation corpora

with previous estimates. The abundance map is rich in substructures,
surrounding clusters and massive stars, although clear degeneracies with
photoionisation are present. We determine the observed total amount of ionising
photons, $Q(H^0)$, from the extinction corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity, and
compare it to the expected $Q(H^0)$ obtained by summing the contributions of
YSCs and massive stars, to obtain an escape fraction ($f_{esc}$). Overall, we
find $f_{esc, HII} = 0.67_{-0.12}^{+0.08}$ for the population of HII regions.
We also conclude that the sources of ionisation observed within the FoV are
more than sufficient to explain the amount of diffuse ionised gas observed in
this region of the galaxy. In general, we find that YSCs located in HII regions
have a higher probability to be younger, less massive, and to emit a higher
number of ionising photons than clusters in the rest of the field. Finally, we
study the optical depth of the regions traced by [SII]/[OIII], finding no
systematic trend between the resulting ionisation structure and $f_{esc}$.

They reach the regimes of ultrastrong and deep strong light-matter coupling,

supercrystals that starts from the dipole and quadrupole excitations of the
nanoparticle building blocks and their coupling to photons. Our model
excellently reproduces results of finite difference time domain simulations. It
provides detailed insight into the emergence of the polariton states. Using the
example of a face centered cubic crystals we show that the dipole and
quadrupole states mix in many high symmetry directions of the Brilouin zone. A
proper description of the plasmon and plasmon-polariton band structure is only
possible when including the quadrupole-derived states. Our model leads to an
expression of the reduced coupling strength in nanoparticle supercrystals that
we show to enter the deep strong coupling regime for metal fill fractions above
$0.8$. In addition to the plasmon-polariton energies we analyse the relative
contributions of the dipole, quadrupole, and photonic states to their
eigenfunctions and are able to demonstrate the decoupling of light in the deep
strong coupling regime. Our results pave the way for a better understanding of
the quantum properties of metallic nanoparticle supercrystals in the

observed stellar properties. Ap stars (magnetic A-type stars) are a prime
example of this. Access to precise and accurate determinations of their stellar
fundamental properties, such as masses and ages, is crucial to understand the
origin and evolution of fossil magnetic fields. We propose using the radii and
luminosities determined from interferometric measurements, in addition to
seismic constraints when available, to infer fundamental properties of 14 Ap
stars pr\'eviously characterised. We used a grid-based modelling approach,
employing stellar models computed with the \textsc{cestam} stellar evolution
code, and the parameter search performed with the \textsc{aims} optimisation
method. The stellar model grid was built using a wide range of initial helium
abundances and metallicities in order to avoid any bias originating from the
initial chemical composition. The large frequency separations ($\Delta\nu$) of
HR\,1217 (HD\,24712) and $\alpha$~Cir (HD\,128898), two rapidly oscillating Ap
stars of the sample, were used as seismic constraints. We inferred the
fundamental properties of the 14 stars in the sample. The overall results are
consistent within $1\sigma$ with previous studies, however, the stellar masses
inferred in this study are higher. This trend likely originates from the
broader range of chemical compositions considered in this work. We show that
the use of $\Delta\nu$ in the modelling significantly improves our inferences,
allowing us to set reasonable constraints on the initial metallicity which is,
otherwise, unconstrained. This gives an indication of the efficiency of atomic
diffusion in the atmospheres of roAp stars and opens the possibility of
characterising the transport of chemical elements in their interiors.

along with an increasing uncertainty in power supply. In the recent years,
distributionally robust optimization has gained significant interest due to its
ability to make informed decisions under uncertainty, which are robust to
misrepresentations of the distributional information (e.g., from probabilistic
forecasts). This is achieved by introducing an ambiguity set that describes the
potential deviations from an empirical distribution of all uncertain
parameters. However, this set typically overlooks the inherent dependencies of
uncertainty, e.g., spatial dependencies of weather-dependent energy sources.
This paper goes beyond the state-of-the-art models by embedding such
dependencies within the definition of ambiguity set. In particular, we propose
a new copula-based ambiguity set which is tailored to capture any type of
dependencies. The resulting problem is reformulated as a conic program which is
kept generic such that it can be applied to any decision-making problem under
uncertainty in power systems. Given the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem as one
of the main potential applications, we illustrate the performance of our
proposed distributionally robust model applied to i) a DC-OPF problem for a
meshed transmission system and ii) an AC-OPF problem using LinDistFlow
approximation for a radial distribution system.

autoencoder not only decreases the remote monitoring payload size by reducing
the state representation dimension, but also learns the system dynamics by
lifting it via a Koopman operator, thereby allowing the observer to locally

stellar tracers (208 RRLs: 169 fundamental, 38 first overtone, 1 mixed mode)
covering three dex in iron abundance (-3.00$\le$[Fe/H]$\le$0.24). We found that
field RRLs are $\sim$0.3 dex more $\alpha$-poor than typical Halo tracers in
the metal-rich regime, ([Fe/H]$\ge$-1.2) while in the metal-poor regime
([Fe/H]$\le$-2.2) they seem to be on average $\sim$0.1 dex more
$\alpha$-enhanced. This is the first time that the depletion in
$\alpha$-elements for solar iron abundances is detected on the basis of a
large, homogeneous and coeval sample of old stellar tracers. Interestingly, we
also detected a close similarity in the [$\alpha$/Fe] trend between
$\alpha$-poor, metal-rich RRLs and red giants (RGs) in the Sagittarius dwarf

faint dwarf galaxies. These results are supported by similar elemental
abundances for 46 field Horizontal Branch (HB) stars. These stars share with
RRLs the same evolutionary phase and the same progenitors. This evidence
further supports the key role that old stellar tracers play in constraining the
early chemical enrichment of the Halo and, in particular, in investigating the
impact that dwarf galaxies have had in the mass assembly of the Galaxy.

data is a major challenge to the geophysical, engineering and medical fields.
Here, we present a framework to constrain microstructure geometry and
properties from long-scale waves. To realistically quantify microstructures we
use two-point statistics, from which we derive scale-dependent effective wave
properties - wavespeed and attenuation - using strong-contrast expansions (SCE)
for (visco)elastic wavefields. By evaluating various two-point correlation
functions we observe that both effective wavespeeds and attenuation of
long-scale waves predominantly depend on volume fraction and phase properties,
and that especially attenuation at small scales is highly sensitive to the
geometry of microstructure heterogeneity (e.g. geometric hyperuniformity) due
to incoherent inference of sub-wavelength multiple scattering. Our goal is to
infer microstructure properties from observed effective wave parameters. To
this end, we use the supervised machine learning method of Random Forests (RF)
to construct a Bayesian inference approach. We can accurately resolve two-point
correlation functions sampled from various microstructural configurations,
including: a bead pack, Berea sandstone and Ketton limestone samples.
Importantly, we show that inversion of small scale-induced effective elastic
waves yields the best results, particularly compared to single-wave-mode (e.g.,
acoustic only) information. Additionally, we show that the retrieval of
microscale medium contrasts is more difficult - as it is highly ill-posed - and
can only be achieved with specific a priori knowledge. Our results are
promising for many applications, such as earthquake hazard
monitoring,non-destructive testing, imaging fluid flow in porous media,
quantifying tissue properties in medical ultrasound, or designing materials
with tailor-made wave properties.

topical words. However, adapting BERT to time and domain does not improve
performance on the downstream task over only adapting to domain. Token-level
analysis shows that temporal adaptation captures event-driven changes in
language use in the downstream task, but not those changes that are actually
relevant to task performance. Based on our findings, we discuss when temporal
adaptation may be more effective.

denoising methods make use of decomposition, thresholding and filtering
techniques. In the proposed approach, EEG signals are first transformed to
orthogonal domain using Tchebichef moments before feeding to the proposed
architecture. A new hyper-parameter ($\alpha$) is introduced which refers to
the fractional order with respect to which gradients are calculated during
back-propagation. It is observed that by tuning $\alpha$, the quality of the
restored signal improves significantly. Motivated by the high usage of portable
low energy devices which make use of compressed deep learning architectures,
the trainable parameters of the proposed architecture are compressed using
randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm. The experiments are
performed on the standard EEG datasets, namely, Mendeley and Bonn. The study
shows that the proposed fractional and compressed architecture performs better

years, a new paradigm is required to study pedestrian behaviour. Studying
pedestrian behaviour in futuristic scenarios requires modern data sources that
consider both the Automated Vehicle (AV) and pedestrian perspectives. Current
open datasets on AVs predominantly fail to account for the latter, as they do
not include an adequate number of events and associated details that involve
pedestrian and vehicle interactions. To address this issue, we propose using
Virtual Reality (VR) data as a complementary resource to current datasets,
which can be designed to measure pedestrian behaviour under specific

trajectory prediction framework for automated vehicles at mid-block
unsignalized crossings. For this purpose, we develop a novel multi-input

addition to past trajectories, the proposed framework incorporates pedestrian
head orientations and distance to the upcoming vehicles as sequential input
data. By merging the sequential data with contextual information of the
environment, we train a model to predict the future pedestrian trajectory. Our
results show that the prediction error and overfitting to the training data are
reduced by considering contextual information in the model. To analyze the
application of the methods to real AV data, the proposed framework is trained
and applied to pedestrian trajectory extracted from an open-access video
dataset. Finally, by implementing a game theory-based model interpretability
method, we provide detailed insights and propose recommendations to improve the
current automated vehicle sensing systems from a pedestrian-oriented point of

U-net-based architecture that incorporates our Spatial Channel Attention (SCA)
blocks, extracts global features that provide sufficient contextual information
needed to remove atmospheric distortions caused by rain and fog. The second
sub-net learns the additive residues information, which is useful in removing
rain streak artifacts via our proposed Residual Inception Modules (RIM). The
third sub-net, the multiplicative sub-net, adopts our Channel-attentive
Inception Modules (CIM) and learns the essential brighter local features which
are not effectively extracted in the SCA and additive sub-nets by modulating
the local pixel intensities in the derained images. Our three clean image

Visual QC by experts is time-consuming and does not scale to large datasets. In
this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic
QC of 3D T1-weighted brain MRI for a large heterogeneous clinical data
warehouse. To that purpose, we used the data warehouse of the hospitals of the
Greater Paris area (Assistance Publique-H\^opitaux de Paris [AP-HP]).
Specifically, the objectives were: 1) to identify images which are not proper
T1-weighted brain MRIs; 2) to identify acquisitions for which gadolinium was
injected; 3) to rate the overall image quality. We used 5000 images for
training and validation and a separate set of 500 images for testing. In order
to train/validate the CNN, the data were annotated by two trained raters
according to a visual QC protocol that we specifically designed for application
in the setting of a data warehouse. For objectives 1 and 2, our approach
achieved excellent accuracy (balanced accuracy and F1-score \textgreater 90\%),

substantially lower than that of human raters. Nevertheless, the automatic

approached by either purely mechanistic or purely data-driven methods.
Mechanistic models encode the domain knowledge and physical rules governing the
system. Such models, however, need the correct specification of all
interactions between variables in the problem and the appropriate
parameterization is a challenge in itself. On the other hand, machine learning
approaches are flexible data-driven tools, able to approximate arbitrarily
complex functions, but lack interpretability and struggle when data is scarce
or in extrapolation regimes. In this paper, we argue that hybrid learning
schemes that combine both approaches can address all these issues efficiently.
We introduce Gaussian process (GP) convolution models for hybrid modelling in
Earth observation (EO) problems. We specifically propose the use of a class of
GP convolution models called latent force models (LFMs) for EO time series
modelling, analysis and understanding. LFMs are hybrid models that incorporate
physical knowledge encoded in differential equations into a multioutput GP
model. LFMs can transfer information across time-series, cope with missing
observations, infer explicit latent functions forcing the system, and learn
parameterizations which are very helpful for system analysis and
interpretability. We consider time series of soil moisture from active (ASCAT)
and passive (SMOS, AMSR2) microwave satellites. We show how assuming a first
order differential equation as governing equation, the model automatically
estimates the e-folding time or decay rate related to soil moisture persistence
and discovers latent forces related to precipitation. The proposed hybrid
methodology reconciles the two main approaches in remote sensing parameter
estimation by blending statistical learning and mechanistic modeling.

however, it is non-trivial to conduct textual adversarial attacks on natural
language processing tasks due to the discreteness of data. Most previous
approaches conduct attacks with the atomic \textit{replacement} operation,
which usually leads to fixed-length adversarial examples and therefore limits
the exploration on the decision space. In this paper, we propose
variable-length textual adversarial attacks~(VL-Attack) and integrate three
atomic operations, namely \textit{insertion}, \textit{deletion} and
\textit{replacement}, into a unified framework, by introducing and manipulating
a special \textit{blank} token while attacking. In this way, our approach is
able to more comprehensively find adversarial examples around the decision
boundary and effectively conduct adversarial attacks. Specifically, our method
drops the accuracy of IMDB classification by $96\%$ with only editing $1.3\%$
tokens while attacking a pre-trained BERT model. In addition, fine-tuning the
victim model with generated adversarial samples can improve the robustness of
the model without hurting the performance, especially for length-sensitive
models. On the task of non-autoregressive machine translation, our method can
achieve $33.18$ BLEU score on IWSLT14 German-English translation, achieving an
improvement of $1.47$ over the baseline model.

From the spin polarised van der Waals interaction included calculation, we
found that TMABHs has antiferromagnetic ordering as ground state. Our nudged

required not only at the hardware level but also on theoretical research to
reduce the computational cost of a given protocol. Quantum computation has the
potential to significantly enhance existing classical machine learning methods,
and several quantum algorithms for binary classification based on the kernel
method have been proposed. These algorithms rely on estimating an expectation
value, which in turn requires an expensive quantum data encoding procedure to
be repeated many times. In this work, we calculate explicitly the number of
repetition necessary for acquiring a fixed success probability and show that
the Hadamard-test and the swap-test circuits achieve the optimal variance in
terms of the quantum circuit parameters. The variance, and hence the number of
repetition, can be further reduced only via optimization over data-related
parameters. We also show that the kernel-based binary classification can be
performed with a single-qubit measurement regardless of the number and the
dimension of the data. Finally, we show that for a number of relevant noise
models the classification can be performed reliably without quantum error
correction. Our findings are useful for designing quantum classification
experiments under limited resources, which is the common challenge in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era.

constant and the plasma current exhibits an arbitrary number of current sheets.
We also establish the existence of free boundary steady states surrounded by

equilibria are shown to exist do not need to be small perturbations of an
axisymmetric domain, and in fact they can have any knotted topology. The
building blocks we use in our construction are analytic toroidal domains
satisfying a certain nondegeneracy condition, which roughly states that there
exists a force-free field that is ergodic on the surface of the domain. The
proof involves three main ingredients: a gluing construction of piecewise
smooth MHD equilibria, a Hamilton-Jacobi equation on the two-dimensional torus
that can be understood as a nonlinear deformation of the cohomological equation
(so the nondegeneracy assumption plays a major role in the corresponding
analysis), and a new KAM theorem tailored for the study of divergence-free

initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail
to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, regressing
joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very
challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields
(PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query
point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine
PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based
framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point
correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed
human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can
be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently,
rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently
via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences,
circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from
neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized
occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and
results in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the
parameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative and
quantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initialized
by our network results in much better registration quality, especially for
extreme poses.

this claim, we first show that the current evaluation method of WS is
sub-optimal and propose a modification that uses twin sentences for evaluation.
We also propose two new baselines that indicate the existence of artifacts in
WS benchmarks. We then develop a method for evaluating WS-like sentences in a
zero-shot setting to account for the commonsense reasoning abilities acquired
during the pretraining and observe that popular language models perform
randomly in this setting when using our more strict evaluation. We conclude
that the observed progress is mostly due to the use of supervision in training

hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in machine learning. At its core, BO
iteratively evaluates promising configurations until a user-defined budget,

performance after tuning heavily depends on the provided budget, it is hard to
pre-specify an optimal value in advance. In this work, we propose an effective

that the discrepancy between the true objective (predictive performance on test

the suboptimality in optimizing the target is dominated by the statistical
estimation error. Across an extensive range of real-world HPO problems and
baselines, we show that our termination criterion achieves a better trade-off

overfitting may occur in the context of HPO, which is arguably an overlooked

devices based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors still suffer from a
limited electrical stability. This limited stability has been shown to result
from the interaction of charge carriers originating from the 2D semiconductors
with defects in the surrounding insulating materials. The resulting dynamically
trapped charges are particularly relevant in field effect transistors (FETs)
and can lead to a large hysteresis, which endangers stable circuit operation.
Based on the notion that charge trapping is highly sensitive to the energetic
alignment of the channel Fermi-level with the defect band in the insulator, we
propose to optimize device stability by deliberately tuning the channel
Fermi-level. Our approach aims to minimize the amount of electrically active
border traps without modifying the total number of traps in the insulator. We
demonstrate the applicability of this idea by using two differently doped
graphene layers in otherwise identical FETs with Al$_2$O$_3$ as a gate oxide
mounted on a flexible substrate. Our results clearly show that by increasing
the distance of the Fermi-level to the defect band, the hysteresis is
significantly reduced. Furthermore, since long-term reliability is also very
sensitive to trapped charges, a corresponding improvement in reliability is
both expected theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. Our study paves
the way for the construction of more stable and reliable 2D FETs in which the
channel material is carefully chosen and tuned to maximize the energetic
distance between charge carriers in the channel and the defect bands in the
insulator employed.

adopt in the entire city, that includes cleaner and better transport mode.
Electric tricycle is an after sought alternative that offers better choice in
terms of identified factors of sustainable transport: reliability, safety,

conducted to provide a comparison of cost and emission between a motorized
tricycle and an e-tricycle. The study identified the existing tricycle industry

survey revealed a number of hazards were with the current motorized tricycle

structures underling a set of observations. Unfortunately, causal discovery
methods which are based on correlation or mutual information can often fail to
identify causal links in systems which exhibit dynamic relationships. Such
dynamic systems (including the famous coupled logistic map) exhibit `mirage'
correlations which appear and disappear depending on the observation window.
This means not only that correlation is not causation but, perhaps
counter-intuitively, that causation may occur without correlation. In this
paper we describe Neural Shadow-Mapping, a neural network based method which
embeds high-dimensional video data into a low-dimensional shadow
representation, for subsequent estimation of causal links. We demonstrate its
performance at discovering causal links from video-representations of dynamic
systems.

that protects privacy and tackles the problem of isolated data islands. At
present, there are two main communication strategies of FL: synchronous FL and
asynchronous FL. The advantages of synchronous FL are that the model has high
precision and fast convergence speed. However, this synchronous communication
strategy has the risk that the central server waits too long for the devices,
namely, the straggler effect which has a negative impact on some time-critical
applications. Asynchronous FL has a natural advantage in mitigating the
straggler effect, but there are threats of model quality degradation and server
crash. Therefore, we combine the advantages of these two strategies to propose
a clustered semi-asynchronous federated learning (CSAFL) framework. We evaluate
CSAFL based on four imbalanced federated datasets in a non-IID setting and
compare CSAFL to the baseline methods. The experimental results show that CSAFL
significantly improves test accuracy by more than +5% on the four datasets
compared to TA-FedAvg. In particular, CSAFL improves absolute test accuracy by
+34.4% on non-IID FEMNIST compared to TA-FedAvg.

through the accretion of numerous satellite galaxies. Since the satellites are
much less massive than the host halo, they occupy a small fraction of the
volume in action space defined by the potential of the host halo. Since actions
are conserved when the potential of the host halo changes adiabatically, stars
from an accreted satellite are expected to remain clustered in action space as
the host halo evolves. In this paper, we identify accreted satellites in three
Milky Way like disk galaxies from the cosmological baryonic FIRE-2 simulations
by tracking satellite galaxies through simulation snapshots. We then try to
recover these satellites by applying the cluster analysis algorithm Enlink to
the orbital actions of accreted star particles in the present-day snapshot. We
define several metrics to quantify the success of the clustering algorithm and
use these metrics to identify well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites.
We plot these satellites in the infall time-progenitor mass (or stellar mass)
space, and determine the boundaries between the well-recovered and
poorly-recovered satellites in these two spaces with classification tree
method. The groups found by Enlink are more likely to correspond to a real
satellite if they have high significance, a quantity assigned by Enlink. Since
cosmological simulations predict that most stellar halos have a population of
insitu stars, we test the ability of Enlink to recover satellites when the
sample is contaminated by 10-50% of insitu star particles, and show that most
of the satellites well-recovered by Enlink in the absence of insitu stars, stay
well-recovered even with 50% contamination. We thus expect that, in the future,
cluster analysis in action space will be useful in upcoming data sets (e.g.
Gaia) for identifying accreted satellites in the Milky Way.

The
time evolution of the discharge rate as well as the normal force (apparent

stiffness has a strong effect on the qualitative features of silo discharge.
For deformable grains with a Young's modulus of about $Y_m\approx 40$ kPa in a
silo with basal pressure of the order of 4 kPa lowering the friction
coefficient leads to a gradual change in the discharge curve: the flow rate
becomes filling height dependent, it decreases during the discharge process.
For hard grains with a Young's modulus of about $Y_m\approx 500$ MPa the flow
rate is much less sensitive to the value of the friction coefficient. Using DEM
data combined with a coarse-graining methodology allows us to compute all the
relevant macroscopic fields, namely, linear momentum, density and stress
tensors. The observed difference in the discharge in the low friction limit is
connected to a strong difference in the pressure field: while for hard grains
Janssen-screening is effective, leading to high vertical stress near the silo
wall and small pressure above the orifice region, for deformable grains the
pressure above the orifice is larger and gradually decreases during the
discharge process. We have analyzed the momentum balance in the region of the
orifice (near the location of the outlet) for the case of soft particles with
low friction coefficient, and proposed a phenomenological formulation that
predicts the linear decrease of the flow rate with decreasing filling height.

in empty space. The presence of charge or currents in electromagnetism or the
presence of matter in cosmology are preventing scale invariance. The question
arises on how much matter within the horizon is necessary to kill scale
invariance. The scale invariant field equation, first written by Dirac in 1973
and then revisited by Canuto et al. in 1977, provides the starting point to
address this question. The resulting cosmological models show that, as soon as
matter is present, the effects of scale invariance rapidly decline from \rho=0
to \rho_c and are forbidden for densities above \rho_c. The absence of scale
invariance in this case is consistent with considerations about causal
connection. Below \rho_c, scale invariance appears as an open possibility,
which also depends on the occurrence of inflation in the scale invariant
context. In the present approach, we identify the scalar field of the empty
space in the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) context to the scalar field \phi in
the energy density expression of the vacuum at inflation. This leads to some
constraints on the potential. This identification also solves the so-called
``cosmological constant problem''. In the framework of scale invariance,an
inflation with a large number of e-foldings is also predicted. We conclude that
scale invariance for models with densities below \rho_c is an open possibility;
the final answer may come from high redshift observations, where differences
from the LCDM models appear.

However, observational data often yields biased estimates of treatment effects,
since treatment assignment can be confounded by unobserved variables. A remedy
is offered by deconfounding methods that adjust for such unobserved
confounders. In this paper, we develop the Sequential Deconfounder, a method
that enables estimating individualized treatment effects over time in presence
of unobserved confounders. This is the first deconfounding method that can be
used in a general sequential setting (i.e., with one or more treatments
assigned at each timestep). The Sequential Deconfounder uses a novel Gaussian
process latent variable model to infer substitutes for the unobserved
confounders, which are then used in conjunction with an outcome model to
estimate treatment effects over time. We prove that using our method yields
unbiased estimates of individualized treatment responses over time. Using
simulated and real medical data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in
deconfounding the estimation of treatment responses over time.

increased interest in deep neural networks as universal approximators of PDEs

been proposed. DEM is based on energy minimization principles, contrary to PINN
which is based on the residual of the PDEs. A significant advantage of DEM, is
that it requires the approximation of lower order derivatives compared to
formulations that are based on strong form residuals. However both DEM and
classical PINN formulations struggle to resolve fine features of the stress and
displacement fields, for example concentration features in solid mechanics
applications. We propose an extension to the Deep Energy Method (DEM) to
resolve these features for finite strain hyperelasticity. The developed
framework termed mixed Deep Energy Method (mDEM) introduces stress measures as
an additional output of the NN to the recently introduced pure displacement
formulation. Using this approach, Neumann boundary conditions are approximated
more accurately and the accuracy around spatial features which are typically
responsible for high concentrations is increased. In order to make the proposed
approach more versatile, we introduce a numerical integration scheme based on
Delaunay integration, which enables the mDEM framework to be used for random
training point position sets commonly needed for computational domains with
stress concentrations. We highlight the advantages of the proposed approach

method is offering comparable results to Finite-Element Method (FEM) on the

communication share the same frequency band and hardware, has emerged as a key
technology in future wireless systems. Early works on ISAC have been focused on
the design, analysis and optimization of practical ISAC technologies for
various ISAC systems. While this line of works are necessary, it is equally
important to study the fundamental limits of ISAC in order to understand the
gap between the current state-of-the-art technologies and the performance
limits, and provide useful insights and guidance for the development of better
ISAC technologies that can approach the performance limits. In this paper, we
aim to provide a comprehensive survey for the current research progress on the
fundamental limits of ISAC. Particularly, we first propose a systematic
classification method for both traditional radio sensing (such as radar sensing
and wireless localization) and ISAC so that they can be naturally incorporated
into a unified framework. Then we summarize the major performance metrics and
bounds used in sensing, communications and ISAC, respectively. After that, we
present the current research progresses on fundamental limits of each class of
the traditional sensing and ISAC systems. Finally, the open problems and future
research directions are discussed.

and Earth observation. Currently, different approximations exist: a direct, yet
costly, inversion of radiative transfer models (RTMs); the statistical
inversion with in situ data that often results in problems with extrapolation
outside the study area; and the most widely adopted hybrid modeling by which
statistical models, mostly nonlinear and non-parametric machine learning
algorithms, are applied to invert RTM simulations. We will focus on the latter.
Among the different existing algorithms, in the last decade kernel based
methods, and Gaussian Processes (GPs) in particular, have provided useful and
informative solutions to such RTM inversion problems. This is in large part due
to the confidence intervals they provide, and their predictive accuracy.
However, RTMs are very complex, highly nonlinear, and typically hierarchical
models, so that often a shallow GP model cannot capture complex feature
relations for inversion. This motivates the use of deeper hierarchical
architectures, while still preserving the desirable properties of GPs. This
paper introduces the use of deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) for bio-geo-physical
model inversion. Unlike shallow GP models, DGPs account for complicated
(modular, hierarchical) processes, provide an efficient solution that scales
well to big datasets, and improve prediction accuracy over their single layer
counterpart. In the experimental section, we provide empirical evidence of
performance for the estimation of surface temperature and dew point temperature
from infrared sounding data, as well as for the prediction of chlorophyll
content, inorganic suspended matter, and coloured dissolved matter from
multispectral data acquired by the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor. The presented
methodology allows for more expressive forms of GPs in remote sensing model
inversion problems.

the distributions of the ratio of consecutive level spacings for each symmetry

between Poisson and the Gaussian orthogonal random matrix ensemble. It is found
that the distribution of the ratio of consecutive level spacings agrees with

subjective so varies from person to person. While the subjectivity view is
commonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty
or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long
discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of
subsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion
of beauty - structural beauty - among people and even different peoples,
regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of
structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a
physical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based
on the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for
computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of
automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To
verify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight
pairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock's
Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally
beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more
structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies
that goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an
opinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on
structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or
aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision,
architecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and
psychology.

been predicted as a response to anthropogenic global climate change and have
recently been documented in most Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems of the
world. To identify how these processes are impacting nearshore oceanographic
habitats and, especially, long term trends of primary productivity in the
Humboldt Upwelling Ecosystem (HUE), we analysed time series of sea level
pressure, wind stress, sea surface and atmospheric surface temperatures, and
Chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for primary productivity, along 26{\deg} - 36{\deg}
S. We show that climate induced trends in primary productivity are highly
heterogeneous across the region. On the one hand, the well documented poleward
migration of the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) has led to decreased spring
upwelling winds in the region between ca. 30{\deg} and 34{\deg} S, and to their
intensification to the south. Decreased winds have produced slight increases in
sea surface temperature and a pronounced and meridionally extensive decrease in
surface Chlorophyll-a in this region of central Chile. To the north of 30{\deg}
S, significant increases in upwelling winds, decreased SST, and enhanced
Chlorophyll-a concentration are observed in the nearshore. We show that this
increased in upwelling driven coastal productivity is probably produced by the
increased land-sea pressure gradients (Bakun's effect) that have occurred over
the past two decades north of 30{\deg} S. Thus, climate drivers along the HUE
are inducing contrasting trends in oceanographic conditions and primary
productivity, which can have far-reaching consequences for coastal pelagic and
benthic ecosystems and lead to geographic displacements of the major fisheries.

grading mechanisms behind these course assignments is important for evaluating
MOOC credentials. A common approach to grading free-response assignments is
massive scale peer-review, especially used for assignments that are not easy to
grade programmatically. It is difficult to assess these approaches since the
responses typically require human evaluation. Here we link data from public
code repositories on GitHub and course grades for a large massive-online open
course to study the dynamics of massive scale peer review. This has important
implications for understanding the dynamics of difficult to grade assignments.
Since the research was not hypothesis-driven, we described the results in an
exploratory framework. We find three distinct clusters of repeated peer-review
submissions and use these clusters to study how grades change in response to
changes in code submissions. Our exploration also leads to an important
observation that massive scale peer-review scores are highly variable,
increase, on average, with repeated submissions, and changes in scores are not
closely tied to the code changes that form the basis for the re-submissions.

one of the leading approaches to solving large parity games in practice - with
the quasi-polynomial time guarantees offered by Parys' algorithm. Hybridising
these algorithms sounds both natural and difficult, as they both generalise the
classic recursive algorithm in different ways that appear to be irreconcilable:
while the promotion transcends the call structure, the guarantees change on
each level. We show that an interface that respects both is not only effective,
but also efficient.

  Graph Attention Network and Message Passing Neural Network from Pairwise
  Atomistic Interactions","14 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph cs.LG physics.comp-ph q-bio.BM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning based methods have been widely applied to predict various kinds
of molecular properties in the pharmaceutical industry with increasingly more
success. Solvation free energy is an important index in the field of organic
synthesis, medicinal chemistry, drug delivery, and biological processes.
However, accurate solvation free energy determination is a time-consuming
experimental process. Furthermore, it could be useful to assess solvation free
energy in the absence of a physical sample. In this study, we propose two novel
models for the problem of free solvation energy predictions, based on the Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures: Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) and
Graph Attention Network (GAT). GNNs are capable of summarizing the predictive
information of a molecule as low-dimensional features directly from its graph
structure without relying on an extensive amount of intra-molecular
descriptors. As a result, these models are capable of making accurate
predictions of the molecular properties without the time consuming process of
running an experiment on each molecule. We show that our proposed models
outperform all quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics methods in addition to
existing alternative machine learning based approaches in the task of solvation
free energy prediction. We believe such promising predictive models will be
applicable to enhancing the efficiency of the screening of drug molecules and
be a useful tool to promote the development of molecular pharmaceutics.

shifts trust from institutions to algorithms. Still, the potential of
blockchains remains elusive due to knowledge gaps between computer science
research and socio-economic research. Building on information technology
governance literature and the theory of coevolution, this study develops a
process model for blockchain configurations that captures blockchain capability
dimensions and application areas. We demonstrate the applicability of the
proposed blockchain configuration process model on four blockchain projects.
The proposed blockchain configuration process model assists with the selection
and configuration of blockchain systems based on a set of known requirements
for a blockchain project. Our findings contribute to research by bridging
knowledge gaps between computer science and socio-economic research on
blockchain. Specifically, we explore existing blockchain concepts and integrate
them in a process model for blockchain configurations.

  Regulator's Perspective",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the regulation thereof is a topic that is
increasingly being discussed within various fora. Various proposals have been
made in literature for defining regulatory bodies and/or related regulation. In
this paper, we present a pragmatic approach for providing a technology
assurance regulatory framework. To the best knowledge of the authors this work
presents the first national AI technology assurance legal and regulatory
framework that has been implemented by a national authority empowered through
law to do so. In aim of both providing assurances where required and not
stifling innovation yet supporting it, herein it is proposed that such
regulation should not be mandated for all AI-based systems and that rather it
should primarily provide a voluntary framework and only be mandated in sectors
and activities where required and as deemed necessary by other authorities for
regulated and critical areas.

  1(1), 2019",,,"physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The operation of a nuclear power station powering Deep Space transport is
presented in the paper. The power station consists of a Gas Core Reactor (GCR)
with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator. A new model of gas core reactor which
has advantages by comparison with known models is suggested. It is shown that
$200\ ton$ system would generate $200\ MW$ electricity. The gas core reactor
consists of a spherical cavity of $1\ m$ to $1.5\ m$ radius surrounded by a
$50\ cm$ thick liquid beryllium reflector within molybdenum--92 container. The
fuel consists of $^{235}$UF$_4$, KF, and K. It is demonstrated that such power
station will work for gaseous fuel pressures of $50\ atm$ to $100\ atm$. The
Monte-Carlo simulations describing paths of thousands of neutrons are
performed. These simulations yield neutronic results, i.e. the fractions of
neutrons causing fission, being absorbed by moderator, and escaping the
reactor. From this information one can calculate minimum needed pressure inside
the reactor, the reactor size, and moderator thickness. The conductivity of
superheated fuel depending on temperature and pressure is also calculated. It
is concluded that space propulsion is the best use of uranium resources.

system using a wireless body area network. The system is responsive to the
dynamic changes in the skin health, and remotely reports on the same. The
proposed algorithm detects the abnormal skin and creates an energy efficient
data aggregation tree covering the affected area while putting the unnecessary
sensors to sleep mode. The algorithm responds to the changing conditions of the
skin by dynamically adapting the size and shape of the monitoring trees to that
of the abnormal skin areas thus providing a comprehensive monitoring.
Simulation results demonstrate the application and utility of the proposed
algorithm for changing wound shapes and sizes.
