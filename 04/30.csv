achieve sufficient efficiency for practical deployment. In this work, we
propose several novel ideas for learned video compression which allow for
improved performance for the low-latency mode (I- and P-frames only) along with
a considerable increase in computational efficiency. In this setting, for
natural videos our approach compares favorably across the entire R-D curve
under metrics PSNR, MS-SSIM and VMAF against all mainstream video standards
(H.264, H.265, AV1) and all ML codecs. At the same time, our approach runs at
least 5x faster and has fewer parameters than all ML codecs which report these
figures.
  Our contributions include a flexible-rate framework allowing a single model
to cover a large and dense range of bitrates, at a negligible increase in
computation and parameter count; an efficient backbone optimized for ML-based
codecs; and a novel in-loop flow prediction scheme which leverages prior
information towards more efficient compression.
  We benchmark our method, which we call ELF-VC (Efficient, Learned and
Flexible Video Coding) on popular video test sets UVG and MCL-JCV under metrics
PSNR, MS-SSIM and VMAF. For example, on UVG under PSNR, it reduces the BD-rate
by 44% against H.264, 26% against H.265, 15% against AV1, and 35% against the
current best ML codec. At the same time, on an NVIDIA Titan V GPU our approach
encodes/decodes VGA at 49/91 FPS, HD 720 at 19/35 FPS, and HD 1080 at 10/18

constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the operators, and show how the
interplay of different operators can open new allowed windows in the parameter

properties of velocity and density distributions reminiscent of those
pertaining to exchange flows in stratified inclined ducts, such as the recent
experiment of Lefauve et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 848, 508-544, 2018). Using a
normal mode streamwise and temporal expansion for flows in ducts with various
aspect ratios $B$ and non-trivial transverse velocity profiles, we calculate
two-dimensional (2D) dispersion relations with associated eigenfunctions
varying in the 'crosswise' direction, in which the density varies, and the
spanwise direction, both normal to the duct walls and to the flow direction. We
also compare these 2D dispersion relations to the so-called one-dimensional
(1D) dispersion relation obtained for spanwise invariant perturbations, for
different aspect ratios $B$ and bulk Richardson numbers $Ri_b$. In this limited
parameter space, the presence of lateral walls has a stabilizing effect.
Furthermore, accounting for spanwise-varying perturbations results in a
plethora of unstable modes, the number of which increases as the aspect ratio
is increased. These modes present an odd-even regularity in their spatial
structures, which is rationalized by comparison to the so-called
one-dimensional oblique (1D-O) dispersion relation obtained for oblique waves.
Finally, we show that in most cases, the most unstable 2D mode is the one that
oscillates the least in the spanwise direction, as a consequence of viscous
damping. However, in a limited region of the parameter space and in the absence
of stratification, we show that a secondary mode with a more complex `twisted'
structure dominated by crosswise vorticity becomes more unstable than the least
oscillating Kelvin-Helmholtz mode associated with spanwise vorticity.

value of negative links, existing signed network embedding methods usually
design dedicated methods based on social theories such as balance theory and

characteristics of multiple facets of each node and mix them up in one single

Specifically, a joint intra- and inter-facet attention mechanism is introduced

includes low energy spread, which can be achieved by precise beam loading of
the plasma wakefield using longitudinally shaped bunches, resulting in
efficient and uniform acceleration. However, the plasma wavelength, which sets
the scale for the region of very large accelerating fields to be 100 {\mu}m or
smaller, requires bunches to be synchronized and shaped with extreme temporal
precision, typically on the femtosecond scale. Here, a self-correction
mechanism is introduced, greatly reducing the susceptibility to jitter. Using
multiple accelerating stages, each with a small bunch compression between them,
almost any initial bunch, regardless of current profile or injection phase,
will self-correct into the current profile that flattens the wakefield, damping
the relative energy spread and any energy offsets. As a consequence, staging
can be used not only to reach high energies, but also to produce the exquisite

Learning (DL) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR); that there are insights to be
gained by applying CBR ideas to problems in DL (what could be called DeepCBR).
In this paper, we report on a program of research that applies CBR solutions to
the problem of Explainable AI (XAI) in the DL. We describe a series of
twin-systems pairings of opaque DL models with transparent CBR models that
allow the latter to explain the former using factual, counterfactual and
semi-factual explanation strategies. This twinning shows that functional
abstractions of DL (e.g., feature weights, feature importance and decision
boundaries) can be used to drive these explanatory solutions. We also raise the
prospect that this research also applies to the problem of Data Augmentation in
DL, underscoring the fecundity of these DeepCBR ideas.

progression of infectious diseases. We treat the problem by adopting a partial
differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered,
Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by
replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent
work (Computational Mechanics, 66, 1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of
global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as
epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the
SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant
parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in
semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a
scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied
to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan
and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers
spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of
the pandemic with high accuracy. It also produces accurate predictions, when
compared against data, for a three week period into 2021. Of note is the
insight that is suggested on the spatio-temporal variation of infection,
recovery and death rates, as well as patterns of the population's mobility
revealed by diffusivities of the compartments.

  In the case of an ideal $I$, we have the classical bounds
$\mbox{ht}(I)\le\ell(I)\le \dim R$. The upper bound $\ell(\mathcal I)\le \dim
R$ is true for filtrations $\mathcal I$, but the lower bound is not true for
all filtrations. We show that for the filtration $\mathcal I$ of symbolic
powers of a height two prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ in a regular local ring of

end-to-end online speech translation approaches were recently proposed. They
consist in incrementally encoding a speech input (in a source language) and
decoding the corresponding text (in a target language) with the best possible
trade-off between latency and translation quality. This paper investigates two
key aspects of end-to-end simultaneous speech translation: (a) how to encode
efficiently the continuous speech flow, and (b) how to segment the speech flow
in order to alternate optimally between reading (R: encoding input) and writing
(W: decoding output) operations. We extend our previously proposed end-to-end
online decoding strategy and show that while replacing BLSTM by ULSTM encoding
degrades performance in offline mode, it actually improves both efficiency and
performance in online mode. We also measure the impact of different methods to
segment the speech signal (using fixed interval boundaries, oracle word
boundaries or randomly set boundaries) and show that our best end-to-end online
decoding strategy is surprisingly the one that alternates R/W operations on
fixed size blocks on our English-German speech translation setup.

  Polar Metamaterials",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The transformation method is a powerful tool for providing the constitutive
parameters of the transformed material in the new coordinates. In
transformation elasticity, a general curvilinear change of coordinates
transforms conventional Hooke's law into a different constitutive law in which
the transformed material is not only anisotropic but also polar and chiral and
no known elastic solid satisfies. However, this state-of-the-art description
provides no insight as to what the underlying microstructure of this
transformed material could be, the design of which is a major challenge in this
field. The study aims to theoretically justify the fundamental need for the
polar material by critically revisiting the discrete transformation method. The
key idea is to let transformation gradient operate not only on the elastic
properties but on the underlying architectures of the mechanical lattice. As an
outstanding application, we leverage the proposed design paradigm to physically
construct a polar lattice metamaterial for the observation of elastic carpet
cloaking. Numerical simulations are then implemented to show excellent cloaking
performance under different static and dynamic mechanical loads. The approach
presented herein could promote and accelerate new designs of lattice topologies
for transformation elasticity in particular and is able to be extended for
realizing other emerging elastic properties and unlocking peculiar functions
including statics and dynamics in general.

develop an analytical approach for multidimensional models of continuous

any generic reciprocal interactions between agents, the mean value of initial
opinion distribution is conserved. Moreover, for positive social influence
interaction mechanisms, the variance of opinion distributions decreases with

along a disease pathway. Such analyses are crucial to model complex patient

economic settings. Multi-state models often make the Markov assumption, whereby
an individual's future trajectory is dependent only upon their present state,
not their past. In reality, there may be transitional dependence upon either
previous events and/or more than one timescale, for example time since entry to
the current or previous state(s). The aim of this study was to develop an
illness-death Weibull model allowing for multiple timescales to impact the
future risk of death. Following this, we evaluated the performance of the
multiple timescale model against a Markov illness-death model in a set of
plausible simulation scenarios when the Markov assumption was violated. Guided
by a study in breast cancer, data were simulated from Weibull baseline
distributions, with hazard functions dependent on single and multiple
timescales. Markov and non-Markov models were fitted to account for/ignore the
underlying data structure. Ignoring the presence of multiple timescales led to
bias in underlying transition rates between states and associated covariate
effects, while transition probabilities and lengths of stay were fairly
robustly estimated. Further work may be needed to evaluate different estimands

contribute a broad overview on the issues bias, explainability and fairness
entail in data-driven analyses. Thus, we outline a set of discriminatory policy
consequences that could, based on such results, lead to unintended

(DM) in the presence of primordial black holes (PBH). For a common setup to
study both leptogenesis and DM we consider the minimal scotogenic model which
also explains light neutrino mass at radiative level. While PBH in the mass
range of $0.1-10^5$ g can, in principle, affect leptogenesis, the required
initial PBH fraction usually leads to overproduction of scalar doublet DM whose
thermal freeze-out occurs before PBH evaporation. PBH can lead to non-thermal
source of leptogenesis as well as dilution of thermally generated lepton
asymmetry via entropy injection, with the latter being dominant. The parameter
space of scotogenic model which leads to overproduction of baryon or lepton
asymmetry in standard cosmology can be made consistent in the presence of PBH
with appropriate initial mass and energy fraction. On the other hand, for such
PBH parameters, the scalar DM is constrained to be in light mass regime where
its freeze-out occurs after PBH evaporation. We then discuss the possibility of
fermion singlet DM with $N_2$ leptogenesis in the same model where due to
singlet nature of DM, its connection with PBH parameters and hence leptogenesis
becomes stronger compared to the previous case.

formulation of the reduced system dynamics. An expansion of the influence
functional in terms of the number of tunneling transitions, and integration of
the Grassmann variables between the tunneling times, allows us to obtain a
still exact generalized master equation (GME) for the populations of the
reduced density matrix (RDM) in the occupation number representation, as well
as a formally exact expression for the current. By borrowing the nomenclature
of the famous spin-boson problem, we characterize the two-state dynamics of
such degrees of freedom on the forward and backward branches in terms of single
four-state paths with alternating blips and sojourns. This allows a
diagrammatic representation of the GME kernel and its parametrization in terms
of sequences of blips and sojourns. We apply our formalism to the exactly
solvable resonant level model (RLM) and to the the single impurity Anderson
model (SIAM). We demonstrate a hierarchical diagrammatic structure of the exact
GME kernel. While the hierarchy closes at the second-tier level for the RLM,
this is not the case for the interacting SIAM. Upon inspection of the GME,
known results from various perturbative and nonperturbative approximation
schemes to quantum transport in the SIAM are recovered. Finally, a noncrossing
approximation for the hierarchical kernel is developed, which enables us to
systematically decrease temperature at each next level of the approximation.
Analytical results are presented, both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium,

a long-standing endeavor in many areas of chemistry and biology. Although
mean-field theories are widely used to model the dynamics of electrolytes, it
is also important to characterize the effects of fluctuations in these systems.
In a previous work, we showed that the dynamics of the ions in a strong
electrolyte that is driven by an external electric field can generate
long-ranged correlations manifestly different from the equilibrium screened
correlations; in the nonequilibrium steady state, these correlations give rise
to a novel long-range fluctuation-induced force (FIF). Here, we extend these
results by considering the dynamics of the strong electrolyte after it is
quenched from thermal equilibrium upon the application of a constant electric
field. We show that the asymptotic long-distance limit of both charge and
density correlations is generally diffusive in time. These correlations give
rise to long-ranged FIFs acting on the neutral confining plates with long-time
regimes that are governed by power-law temporal decays toward the steady-state
value of the force amplitude. These findings show that nonequilibrium
fluctuations have nontrivial implications on the dynamics of objects immersed
in a driven electrolyte, and they could be useful for exploring new ways of
controlling long-distance forces in charged solutions.

by proposing an equivalently axiomatically-justified alternative and studying
the resulting computational and statistical learning questions. Welfare metrics
quantify overall wellbeing across a population of one or more groups, and
welfare-based objectives and constraints have recently been proposed to
incentivize fair machine learning methods to produce satisfactory solutions
that consider the diverse needs of multiple groups. Unfortunately, many
machine-learning problems are more naturally cast as loss minimization tasks,
rather than utility maximization, which complicates direct application of
welfare-centric methods to fair machine learning. In this work, we define a
complementary measure, termed malfare, measuring overall societal harm (rather
than wellbeing), with axiomatic justification via the standard axioms of
cardinal welfare. We then cast fair machine learning as malfare minimization
over the risk values (expected losses) of each group. Surprisingly, the axioms
of cardinal welfare (malfare) dictate that this is not equivalent to simply
defining utility as negative loss. Building upon these concepts, we define
fair-PAC (FPAC) learning, where an FPAC learner is an algorithm that learns an
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ malfare-optimal model with bounded sample complexity,
for any data distribution, and for any (axiomatically justified) malfare
concept. Finally, we show broad conditions under which, with appropriate
modifications, standard PAC-learners may be converted to FPAC learners. This
places FPAC learning on firm theoretical ground, as it yields statistical and
computational efficiency guarantees for many well-studied machine-learning
models, and is also practically relevant, as it democratizes fair ML by
providing concrete training algorithms and rigorous generalization guarantees

events when there is a change in their input. Event-based sensing can present
significant improvements in power efficiency when compared to traditional
sampling, because (1) the output is a stream of events where the important
information lies in the timing of the events, and (2) the sensor can easily be
controlled to output information only when interesting activity occurs at the
input.
  Moreover, event-based sampling can often provide better resolution than
standard uniform sampling. Not only does this occur because individual
event-based sensors have higher temporal resolution, it also occurs because the
asynchrony of events allows for less redundant and more informative encoding.
We would like to explain how such curious results come about.
  To do so, we use ideal time encoding machines as a proxy for event-based
sensors. We explore time encoding of signals with low rank structure, and apply

the approach of Katsuno and Mendelzon (KM) for characterizing AGM base revision
from propositional logic to the setting of (multiple) base revision in

equations of motion (EOM) for nucleonic propagators in a superfluid system. The
resulting EOM is of the Dyson type formulated in the basis of Bogoliubov's
quasiparticles. As the leading contributions to the dynamical kernel of this
EOM in strongly-coupled regimes contain phonon degrees of freedom in various
channels, an efficient method of calculating phonon's characteristics is
required to successfully model these kernels. The traditional quasiparticle
random phase approximation (QRPA) solvers are typically used for this purpose
in nuclear structure calculations, however, they become very prohibitive in
non-spherical geometries. In this work, by linking the notion of the
quasiparticle-phonon vertex to the variation of the Bogoliubov's Hamiltonian,
we show that the recently developed finite-amplitude method (FAM) can be
efficiently employed to compute the vertices within the FAM-QRPA. To illustrate
the validity of the method, calculations based on the relativistic
density-dependent point-coupling Lagrangian are performed for the
single-nucleon states in heavy and medium-mass nuclei with axial deformations.
The cases of $^{38}$Si and $^{250}$Cf are presented and discussed.

lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and redshift-space
distortions (RSD) probed by the CMASS galaxy sample from the Baryonic
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In this paper, we demonstrate the
feasibility of adopting DMASS as the equivalent of BOSS CMASS for a joint
analysis of DES and BOSS in the framework of modified gravity. We utilize the
angular clustering of the DMASS galaxies, cosmic shear of the DES
METACALIBRATION sources, and cross-correlation of the two as data vectors. By
jointly fitting the combination of the data with the RSD measurements from the
BOSS CMASS sample and Planck data, we obtain the constraints on modified
gravity parameters $\mu_0 = -0.37^{+0.47}_{-0.45}$ and $\Sigma_0 =
0.078^{+0.078}_{-0.082}$. We do not detect any significant deviation from
General Relativity. Our constraints of modified gravity measured with DMASS are
tighter than those with the DES Year 1 redMaGiC galaxy sample with the same
external data sets by $29\%$ for $\mu_0$ and $21\%$ for $\Sigma_0$, and
comparable to the published results of the DES Year 1 modified gravity analysis
despite this work using fewer external data sets. This improvement is mainly
because the galaxy bias parameter is shared and more tightly constrained by
both CMASS and DMASS, effectively breaking the degeneracy between the galaxy
bias and other cosmological parameters. Such an approach to optimally combine
photometric and spectroscopic surveys using a photometric sample equivalent to
a spectroscopic sample can be applied to combining future surveys having a
limited overlap such as DESI and LSST.

Though the synthesis of the compounds was reported long ago, to our knowledge,
no attempt was made to investigate the properties of these compounds. The
present results of ac and dc magnetization, electrical resistivity and
heat-capacity measurements down to 1.8 K establish that these compounds undergo
antiferromagnetic order initially, followed by complex spin-glass features with
decreasing temperature. These characteristic temperatures are: For Gd case, TN
is about 46K and TG is about 21 K, and for Tb, about 32 and 28 K respectively.
Additionally, there are field induced magnetic effects, interestingly leading
to non-monotonic variations in MR. There is a significant MR over a wide
temperature range above TN, similar to the behavior of magnetocaloric effect
(MCE) as measured by isothermal entropy change (DeltaS). An intriguing finding
we made is that DeltaS at the onset of magnetic order is significantly larger
for the Tb compound than that observed for the Gd analogue near its TN. On the
basis of this observation in a cubic material, we raise a question whether
aspherical nature of the 4f orbital can play a role to enhance MCE under

pure initial states with extreme squeezing to achieve measurable effects of
non-classical interaction for reasonable experiment durations. In practice, the
systems that can be prepared in such nonclassical states are limited to small
masses, which in turn limits the strength of their interaction. Here we address
this key challenge--the weakness of gravitational interaction--by using a
massive body as an amplifying mediator of gravitational interaction between two
test systems. Our analysis shows that this results in an effective interaction
between the two test-systems that grows with the mass of the mediator, is
independent of its initial state and, therefore, its temperature. This greatly
reduces the requirement on the mass and degree of delocalization of the test
systems and, while still highly challenging, brings experiments on
gravitational source masses a step closer to reality.

multi-attribute data and multi-way interactions, play an indispensable role in
modern data science across various fields in science and engineering. A
fundamental task is to faithfully recover the tensor from highly incomplete
measurements in a statistically and computationally efficient manner.
Harnessing the low-rank structure of tensors in the Tucker decomposition, this
paper develops a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly
recover the tensor factors with tailored spectral initializations, and shows
that it provably converges at a linear rate independent of the condition number
of the ground truth tensor for two canonical problems -- tensor completion and
tensor regression -- as soon as the sample size is above the order of $n^{3/2}$
ignoring other parameter dependencies, where $n$ is the dimension of the

estimation compared with prior art, which suffers from at least one of the
following drawbacks: extreme sensitivity to ill-conditioning, high
per-iteration costs in terms of memory and computation, or poor sample
complexity guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first
algorithm that achieves near-optimal statistical and computational complexities
simultaneously for low-rank tensor completion with the Tucker decomposition.
Our algorithm highlights the power of appropriate preconditioning in
accelerating nonconvex statistical estimation, where the iteration-varying
preconditioners promote desirable invariance properties of the trajectory with
respect to the underlying symmetry in low-rank tensor factorization.

this signed reflection function $\phi_{q_+,q_-}$ is positive definite if and

a two-parameter analog of the classical construction of Schur--Weyl.
  We apply our classification to construct a cyclic Fock space of type B

extensive studies have exposed their disadvantage of inheriting latent
discrimination and societal bias from the training data. This phenomenon
hinders their adoption on high-stake applications. Thus, many efforts have been
taken for developing fair machine learning models. Most of them require that
sensitive attributes are available during training to learn fair models.
However, in many real-world applications, it is usually infeasible to obtain
the sensitive attributes due to privacy or legal issues, which challenges
existing fair-ensuring strategies. Though the sensitive attribute of each data
sample is unknown, we observe that there are usually some non-sensitive
features in the training data that are highly correlated with sensitive
attributes, which can be used to alleviate the bias. Therefore, in this paper,
we study a novel problem of exploring features that are highly correlated with
sensitive attributes for learning fair and accurate classifiers. We
theoretically show that by minimizing the correlation between these related
features and model prediction, we can learn a fair classifier. Based on this
motivation, we propose a novel framework which simultaneously uses these
related features for accurate prediction and enforces fairness. In addition,
the model can dynamically adjust the regularization weight of each related
feature to balance its contribution on model classification and fairness.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed model for learning fair models with high classification accuracy.

algorithmic complexities that are often not supported in wireless transceivers
of low-cost and low-energy IoT devices. In this framework, the access protocols
are first formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and then solved using
RL. A distributed and multi-Agent RL framework is used as the basis for
protocol synthesis. Distributed behavior makes the nodes independently learn
optimal transmission strategies without having to rely on full network level
information and direct knowledge of behavior of other nodes. The nodes learn to
minimize packet collisions such that optimal throughput can be attained and
maintained for loading conditions that are higher than what the known benchmark
protocols (such as ALOHA) for IoT devices without complex transceivers. In
addition, the nodes are observed to be able to learn to act optimally in the
presence of heterogeneous loading and network topological conditions. Finally,
the proposed learning approach allows the wireless bandwidth to be fairly
distributed among network nodes in a way that is not dependent on such
heterogeneities. Via simulation experiments, the paper demonstrates the
performance of the learning paradigm and its abilities to make nodes adapt
their optimal transmission strategies on the fly in response to various network
dynamics.

urgent and vital to identify biases in AI algorithms. However, the previous

  To solve this challenging problem, we use a hyperplane in the generative

We propose a novel total-variation loss within this framework as the objective

masses are one of the main targets for currently operating and forthcoming
space-borne gravitational wave observatories. In this paper, we explore the
effect of the stellar host rotation on the bound binary hardening efficiency,
driven by three-body stellar interactions. As seen in previous studies, we find
that the centre of mass (CoM) of a prograde MBHB embedded in a rotating
environment starts moving on a nearly circular orbit about the centre of the
system shortly after the MBHB binding. In our runs, the oscillation radius is
approximately 0.25 ( approximately 0.1) times the binary influence radius for
equal mass MBHBs (MBHBs with mass ratio 1:4). Conversely, retrograde binaries
remain anchored about the centre of the host. The binary shrinking rate is
twice as fast when the binary CoM exhibits a net orbital motion, owing to a
more efficient loss cone repopulation even in our spherical stellar systems. We
develop a model that captures the CoM oscillations of prograde binaries; we
argue that the CoM angular momentum gain per time unit scales with the internal
binary angular momentum, so that most of the displacement is induced by stellar
interactions occurring around the time of MBHB binding, while the subsequent
angular momentum enhancement gets eventually quashed by the effect of dynamical
friction. The effect of the background rotation on the MBHB evolution may be
relevant for LISA sources, that are expected to form in significantly rotating
stellar systems.

which are asymptotically AdS$_{4}$ and AdS$_{5}$ with a planar boundary, a
compact spacelike direction and with a Wilson line on that circle. There are
solitons where the $S^{1}$ shrinks smoothly to zero in the interior, with a
magnetic flux through the circle determined by the Wilson line, which are AdS
analogues of the Melvin fluxtube. There is also a solution with a constant
gauge field, which is pure AdS. Both solutions preserve half of the
supersymmetries at a special value of the Wilson line. There is a phase
transition between these two saddle-points as a function of the Wilson line
precisely at the supersymmetric point. Thus, the supersymmetric solutions are
degenerate, at least at the supergravity level. We extend this discussion to
one of the Romans solutions in four dimensions when the Euclidean boundary is
$S^{1}\times\Sigma_{g}$ where $\Sigma_{g}$ is a Riemann surface with genus $g >
0$. We speculate that the supersymmetric state of the CFT on the boundary is
dual to a superposition of the two degenerate geometries.

layers of automatically discovered object models. Contrary to recent approaches
that model image layers with autoencoder networks, we represent them as
explicit transformations of a small set of prototypical images. Our model has
three main components: (i) a set of object prototypes in the form of learnable
images with a transparency channel, which we refer to as sprites; (ii)
differentiable parametric functions predicting occlusions and transformation
parameters necessary to instantiate the sprites in a given image; (iii) a
layered image formation model with occlusion for compositing these instances
into complete images including background. By jointly learning the sprites and
occlusion/transformation predictors to reconstruct images, our approach not
only yields accurate layered image decompositions, but also identifies object
categories and instance parameters. We first validate our approach by providing
results on par with the state of the art on standard multi-object synthetic
benchmarks (Tetrominoes, Multi-dSprites, CLEVR6). We then demonstrate the
applicability of our model to real images in tasks that include clustering
(SVHN, GTSRB), cosegmentation (Weizmann Horse) and object discovery from
unfiltered social network images. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is
the first layered image decomposition algorithm that learns an explicit and
shared concept of object type, and is robust enough to be applied to real

overhead of iterative beam discovery procedures, contextual information from
light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors mounted on vehicles has been
leveraged by data-driven methods to produce useful side information. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight neural network (NN) architecture along with the
corresponding LIDAR preprocessing, which significantly outperforms previous

convergence speed and the final accuracy of the model. In particular, we define
a novel loss function inspired by the knowledge distillation idea, introduce a
curriculum training approach exploiting line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight

performance for the more challenging NLOS cases. Simulation results on

exhaustive beam sweeping approach without any beam search overhead and 95% by
searching among as few as 6 beams. In a typical mmWave V2I scenario, our

scales with the inferred central black hole mass as expected for the fallback

codes, following the line of work initiated by Friedman and Tillich. The new
argument is somewhat similar to previous proofs, but we believe it to be both
simpler and more intuitive. Moreover, it provides the following 'geometric'
explanation for the bound. A binary code with minimal distance $\delta n$ is
small because the projections of the characteristic functions of its elements
on the subspace spanned by the Walsh-Fourier characters of weight up to
$\left(\frac 12 - \sqrt{\delta(1-\delta)}\right) \cdot n$ are essentially
independent. Hence the cardinality of the code is bounded by the dimension of
the subspace.
  We present two conjectures, suggested by the new proof, one for linear and
one for general binary codes which, if true, would lead to an improvement of
the first linear programming bound. The conjecture for linear codes is related

distributed units (DUs) to serve users; the crucial difference from the
traditional cellular paradigm is that a specific serving cluster of DUs is
defined for each user. This framework provides macro diversity, power
efficiency, interference management, and robust connectivity. Most importantly,
the user-centric approach eliminates cell edges, thus contributing to uniform
coverage and performance for users across the network area. We present here a
guide to the key challenges facing the deployment of this network scheme and
contemplate the solutions being proposed for the main bottlenecks facing
cell-free communications. Specifically, we survey the literature targeting the
fronthaul, then we scan the details of the channel estimation required,
resource allocation, delay, and scalability issues. Furthermore, we highlight
some technologies that can provide a management platform for this scheme such
as distributed software-defined network (SDN). Our article serves as a check
point that delineates the current status and indicates future directions for
this area in a comprehensive manner.

  escape",,,,,"math.DS physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper presents an analytical approach for predicting the safe basins (SB)
in a plane of initial conditions (IC) for escape of classical particle from the
potential well under harmonic forcing. The solution is based on the
approximation of isolated resonance, which reduces the dynamics to conservative
flow on a two-dimensional resonance manifold (RM). Such a reduction allows easy
distinction between escaping and non-escaping ICs. As a benchmark potential, we
choose a common parabolic-quartic well with truncation at varying energy
levels. The method allows accurate predictions of the SB boundaries for
relatively low forcing amplitudes. The derived SBs demonstrate an unexpected
set of properties, including decomposition into two disjoint zones in the IC
plane for a certain range of parameters. The latter peculiarity stems from two
qualitatively different escape mechanisms on the RM. For higher forcing values,
the accuracy of the analytic predictions decreases to some extent due to the
inaccuracies of the basic isolated resonance approximation, but mainly due to
the erosion of the SB boundaries caused by the secondary resonances.
Nevertheless, even in this case the analytic approximation can serve as a
viable initial guess for subsequent numeric estimation of the SB boundaries.

background flows resulting from an imbalance between thermal conduction and
radiative cooling influence the jets' behavior. In this particular scenario, we
trigger the formation of the jets by launching a vertical velocity pulse
localized at the upper chromosphere for the following test cases: i) adiabatic
case; ii) thermal conduction case; iii) radiative cooling case; iv) thermal
conduction + radiative cooling case. According to the test results, the
addition of the thermal conduction results in smaller and hotter jets than in
the adiabatic case. On the other hand, the radiative cooling dissipates the jet
after reaching the maximum height ($\approx$ 5.5 Mm), making it shorter and
colder than in the adiabatic and thermal conduction cases. Besides, the flow
generated by the radiative cooling is more substantial than the caused by
thermal conduction. Despite the energy imbalance of the solar atmosphere
background, the simulated jet shows morphological features of macrospicules.
Furthermore, the velocity pulse steepens into a shock that propagates upward
into a solar corona that maintains its initial temperature. The shocks generate
the jets with a quasi-periodical behavior that follows a parabolic path on
time-distance plots consistent with macrospicule jets' observed dynamics.

any scenario suggested so far. Strongly magnetic white dwarfs are absent among
detached white dwarf binary stars that are younger than approximately 1 Gyr. In
contrast, in semi-detached cataclysmic variables in which the white dwarf
accretes from a low-mass star companion, more than one third host a strongly

that a crystallization- and rotation-driven dynamo similar to those working in

Diversity, at the scientific focal plane of a segmented mirror telescope with
an adaptive optics (AO) system. We specifically consider an optical system
imaging a point source in the context of (i) an artificial source within the
telescope structure and (ii) from AO-corrected images of a bright star. From
our simulations, we reliably disentangle segmented telescope phasing errors
from non-common path aberrations (NCPA) for both a theoretical source and
on-sky, AO-corrected images where we have simulated the Keck/NIRC2 system. This
quantification from on-sky images is appealing, as it's sensitive to the
cumulative wavefront perturbations of the entire optical train; disentanglement
of phasing errors and NCPA is therefore critical, where any potential
correction to the primary mirror from an estimate must contain minimal NCPA
contributions. Our estimates require a one-minute sequence of short-exposure,
AO-corrected images; by exploiting a slight modification to the AO-loop, we
find that 75 defocused images produces reliable estimates. We demonstrate a
correction from our estimates to the primary and deformable mirror results in a
wavefront error reduction of up to 67% and 65% for phasing errors and NCPA,
respectively. If the segment phasing errors on the Keck primary are on the
order of ~130 nm RMS, we show we can improve the H-band Strehl ratio by up to
10% by using our algorithm. We conclude our technique works well to estimate
NCPA alone from on-sky images, suggesting it is a promising method for any
AO-system.

By rhythmically
swiping their whiskers back and forth they can detect the existence of an
object, locate it, and identify its texture. Localization can be accomplished
by inferring the position of the whisker. Rhythmic neurons that track the phase
of the whisking cycle encode information about the azimuthal location of the
whisker. These neurons are characterized by preferred phases of firing that are
narrowly distributed. Consequently, pooling the rhythmic signal from several
upstream neurons is expected to result in a much narrower distribution of
preferred phases in the downstream population, which however has not been
observed empirically. Here, we show how spike-timing-dependent plasticity
(STDP) can provide a solution to this conundrum. We investigated the effect of
STDP on the utility of a neural population to transmit rhythmic information
downstream using the framework of a modeling study. We found that under a wide
range of parameters, STDP facilitated the transfer of rhythmic information
despite the fact that all the synaptic weights remained dynamic. As a result,
the preferred phase of the downstream neuron was not fixed, but rather drifted
in time at a drift velocity that depended on the preferred phase, thus inducing
a distribution of preferred phases. We further analyzed how the STDP rule
governs the distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population. This
link between the STDP rule and the distribution of preferred phases constitutes
a natural test for our theory.

approach that takes advantage of existing solutions and have support for
extending and including new platforms, and distributing functionality across

abstraction level in order to keep the software free from platform details.
Automatic transformations produce executable code that can be properly divided

evaluated in four ways. In the first evaluation, an existing cross-platform
system was recreated using the approach. The second and third evaluations was
conducted with expert and novice developers, who tested the approach in

Results have brought evidence supporting the following main contributions: use
of a single environment, the ability to reuse similar concepts between

investigation are: 1. The primary X-ray emission from the corona is constant in
these observations, both in terms of the power law slope ($\Gamma=1.80$) and
luminosity ($L_{2-10 \rm keV}= 2.55\times 10^{44} $ erg/s). 2. The soft excess
flux decreased by a factor of two in 2016, the Compton hump weakened/vanished
in 2016, and the narrow FeK$\alpha$ emission line became marginally broad
($\sigma=0.35\pm0.08$ keV) and its flux doubled in 2016. 3. From physical model
fits we find that the normalization of the narrow component of the FeK$\alpha$
line does not change in the two epochs, although the Compton hump vanishes in
the same time span. Since the primary X-ray continuum does not change, we
presume that any changes in the reprocessed emission must arise due to changes
in the reprocessing media. Our primary conclusions are: A. The vanishing of the
Compton hump in 2016 can probably be explained by a dynamic clumpy torus which
is infalling/outflowing, or by a polar torus wind. B. The torus in this AGN
possibly has two structures: an equatorial toroidal disk (producing the narrow
FeK$\alpha$ emission) and a polar component (producing the variable Compton
hump), C. The reduction of the soft-excess flux by half and increase in the
FeK$\alpha$ flux by a factor of two in the same period cannot be adequately
explained by ionized disk reflection model alone.

heterogeneity, while Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) enable sharing
knowledge across them. FedCG: i) identifies the domains via an FL-compliant
clustering and instantiates domain-specific modules (residual branches) for
each domain; ii) connects the domain-specific modules through a GCN at training
to learn the interactions among domains and share knowledge; and iii) learns to
cluster unsupervised via teacher-student classifier-training iterations and to
address novel unseen test domains via their domain soft-assignment scores.
Thanks to the unique interplay of GCN over clusters, FedCG achieves the
state-of-the-art on multiple FL benchmarks.

the limited-area Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, in a

assimilation of local ground stations and X- and S-band radar data into the

By providing more accurate descriptions of the low-level flow and a better

multifaceted in nature. Demand is a function of many complex and nonlinear
features such as neighborhood composition, real-time events, and seasonality.
Recent advances in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have had promising
results as they build a graphical representation of a system and harness the
potential of deep learning architectures. However, there has been limited work
using GCNs in a temporal setting to model dynamic dependencies of the network.
Further, within the context of urban environments, there has been no prior work
using dynamic GCNs to support venue demand analysis and prediction. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework which aims to better model
the popularity and growth of urban venues. Using a longitudinal dataset from
location technology platform Foursquare, we model individual venues and venue
types across London and Paris. First, representing cities as connected networks
of venues, we quantify their structure and note a strong community structure in
these retail networks, an observation that highlights the interplay of
cooperative and competitive forces that emerge in local ecosystems of retail
businesses. Next, we present our deep learning architecture which integrates
both spatial and topological features into a temporal model which predicts the
demand of a venue at the subsequent time-step. Our experiments demonstrate that
our model can learn spatio-temporal trends of venue demand and consistently
outperform baseline models. Relative to state-of-the-art deep learning models,
our model reduces the RSME by ~ 28% in London and ~ 13% in Paris. Our approach
highlights the power of complex network measures and GCNs in building
prediction models for urban environments. The model could have numerous
applications within the retail sector to better model venue demand and growth.

resources (DERs) penetration in the power grid. The stochastic and intermittent
features of variable DERs such as roof top photovoltaic (PV) bring substantial
uncertainties to the grid on the consumer end and weaken the grid reliability.
In addition, the fact that numerous DERs are widespread in the grid makes it
hard to monitor and manage DERs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
a novel real-time grid-supporting energy management (GSEM) strategy for
grid-supporting microgrid (MG). This strategy can not only properly manage DERs
in a MG but also enable DERs to provide grid services, which enables a MG to be
grid-supporting via flexible trading power. The proposed GSEM strategy is based
on a 2-step optimization which includes a routine economic dispatch (ED) step
and an acceptable trading power range determination step. Numerical simulations
demonstrate the performance of the proposed GSEM strategy which enables the
grid operator to have a dispatch choice of trading power with MG and enhance
the reliability and resilience of the main grid.

this approach ignores the coupling between strain and molecular tilt. We
examine the validity of this approximation using an elastomeric collagen fibril
model that includes both the D-band and a molecular tilt field. In the low
strain regime, we show that the D-band strain substantially underestimates
fibril strain for strongly twisted collagen fibrils -- such as fibrils from
skin or corneal tissue.

However, current single-cycle light sources are difficult to implement and
operate, hindering their application and accessibility in a wider range of

compact, turn-key, and reliable all-silica-fiber format. This is achieved by
amplifying 2 $\mu$m seed pulses in heavily-doped Tm:fiber, followed by cascaded
self-compression to yield 6.8 fs pulses with 215 kW peak power and 374 mW
average power. The corresponding spectrum covers more than two octaves, from
below 700 nm up to 3500 nm. Driven by this single-cycle pump, supercontinuum
with 180 mW of integrated power and a smooth spectral amplitude between 2100

applications,few-cycle pulses extending from 6 $\mu$m to beyond 22 $\mu$m with
long-term stable carrier-envelope phase are created using intra-pulse
difference frequency, and electro-optic sampling yields comb-tooth-resolved

single-cycle pulses, and provides a practical source to study nonlinear optics

critical behavior of the model in one dimension belongs to the universality

lung cancer computer aided diagnosis (CAD) can play a crucial role. However,
most published CAD methods treat lung cancer diagnosis as a lung nodule
classification problem, which does not reflect clinical practice, where
clinicians diagnose a patient based on a set of images of nodules, instead of
one specific nodule. Besides, the low interpretability of the output provided
by these methods presents an important barrier for their adoption. In this
article, we treat lung cancer diagnosis as a multiple instance learning (MIL)
problem in order to better reflect the diagnosis process in the clinical
setting and for the higher interpretability of the output. We chose radiomics
as the source of input features and deep attention-based MIL as the
classification algorithm.The attention mechanism provides higher
interpretability by estimating the importance of each instance in the set for
the final diagnosis.In order to improve the model's performance in a small
imbalanced dataset, we introduce a new bag simulation method for MIL.The
results show that our method can achieve a mean accuracy of 0.807 with a
standard error of the mean (SEM) of 0.069, a recall of 0.870 (SEM 0.061), a

oversampling strategy significantly improves the model's performance. In
addition, our experiments show that our method provides an indication of the
importance of each nodule in determining the diagnosis, which combined with the
well-defined radiomic features, make the results more interpretable and
acceptable for doctors and patients.

populations of anonymous agents. The behavior of agents in these games depends
on a time-homogeneous type and a time-varying state, which are private to each
agent and characterize their available actions and motifs. We consider finite
type, state, and action spaces. On the individual agent level, the state
evolves in discrete-time as the agent participates in interactions, in which
the state transitions are affected by the agent's individual action and the
distribution of other agents' states and actions. On the societal level, we
consider that the agents form a continuum of mass and that interactions occur
either synchronously or asynchronously, and derive models for the evolution of
the agents' state distribution. We characterize the stationary equilibrium as
the solution concept in our games, which is a condition where all agents are
playing their best response and the state distribution is stationary. At least
one stationary equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in every dynamic population
game. Our approach intersects with previous works on anonymous sequential
games, mean-field games, and Markov decision evolutionary games, but it is
novel in how we relate the dynamic setting to a classical, static population
game setting. In particular, stationary equilibria can be reduced to standard
Nash equilibria in classical population games. This simplifies the analysis of
these games and inspires the formulation of an evolutionary model for the
coupled dynamics of both the agents' actions and states.

filtering of state-space models, motivated by the idea that the inclusion of
only a small fraction of available highly precise measurements can still
extract most of the attainable efficiency gains for filtering latent states,
estimating model parameters, and producing out-of-sample forecasts. In our
general RMD framework we develop two alternative implementations: endogenous
(RMD-N) and exogenous (RMD-X) randomization of missing data. A degree of
robustness to outliers and model misspecification is achieved by purposely
randomizing over the utilized subset of data measurements in their original
time series order, while treating the rest as if missing. The arising
robustness-efficiency trade-off is controlled by varying the fraction of
randomly utilized measurements. Our RMD framework thus relates to but is
different from a wide range of machine learning methods trading off bias
against variance. It also provides a time-series extension of bootstrap
aggregation (bagging). As an empirical illustration, we show consistently
attractive performance of RMD filtering and forecasting in popular state space
models for extracting inflation trends known to be hindered by measurement
outliers.

periods librating at a near-integer ratio (2/1, 3/2, 4/3, etc.) and are a
natural outcome of standard planetary formation theories. Systems with multiple
adjacent resonant pairs are known as resonant chains and can exhibit three-body
resonances -- characterized by a critical three-body angle. Here we study
three-body angles as a diagnostic of resonant chains through tidally-damped
N-body integrations. For each combination of the 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 5:4 mean
motion resonances (the most common resonances in the known resonant chains), we
characterize the three-body angle equilibria for several mass schemes,
migration timescales, and initial separations. We find that under our
formulation of the three-body angle, which does not reduce coefficients, 180
deg is the preferred libration center, and libration centers shifted away from
180 deg are associated with non-adjacent resonances. We then relate these
angles to observables, by applying our general results to two transiting
systems: Kepler-60 and Kepler-223. For these systems, we compare N-body models
of the three-body angle to the zeroth order in e approximation accessible via
transit phases, used in previous publications. In both cases, we find the
three-body angle during the Kepler observing window is not necessarily
indicative of the long-term oscillations and stress the role of dynamical
models in investigating three-body angles. We anticipate our results will
provide a useful diagnostic in the analysis of resonant chains.

surfaces. Herein we develop the analytic Hessian for cNEO-DFT energy with
respect to the change of nuclear (expectation) positions, which can be used to
characterize stationary points on energy surfaces and compute molecular
vibrational frequencies. This is achieved by constructing and solving the
multicomponent cNEO coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham (cNEO-CPKS) equations, which
describe the response of electronic and nuclear orbitals to the displacement of
nuclear (expectation) positions. With the analytic Hessian, the vibrational
frequencies of a series of small molecules are calculated and compared to those
from conventional DFT Hessian calculations as well as those from the
vibrational second-order perturbation theory (VPT2). It is found that even with
a harmonic treatment, cNEO-DFT significantly outperforms DFT and is comparable
to DFT-VPT2 in the description of vibrational frequencies in regular polyatomic
molecules. Furthermore, cNEO-DFT can reasonably describe the proton transfer

task where target nodes are not explicitly aligned to sentence tokens. However,
since graph nodes are semantically based on one or more sentence tokens,
implicit alignments can be derived. Transition-based parsers operate over the
sentence from left to right, capturing this inductive bias via alignments at
the cost of limited expressiveness. In this work, we propose a transition-based
system that combines hard-attention over sentences with a target-side action
pointer mechanism to decouple source tokens from node representations and
address alignments. We model the transitions as well as the pointer mechanism
through straightforward modifications within a single Transformer architecture.
Parser state and graph structure information are efficiently encoded using
attention heads. We show that our action-pointer approach leads to increased
expressiveness and attains large gains (+1.6 points) against the best
transition-based AMR parser in very similar conditions. While using no graph
re-categorization, our single model yields the second best Smatch score on AMR
2.0 (81.8), which is further improved to 83.4 with silver data and ensemble
decoding.

distribution of the log likelihood is one of the fundamental tools of

splitting provides valid hypothesis tests and confidence sets in any setting
for which we can compute the split likelihood ratio statistic (or, more
generally, an upper bound on the null maximum likelihood). The universal LRT is
valid in finite samples and without regularity conditions. This test empowers
statisticians to construct tests in settings for which no valid hypothesis test

population mean of d-dimensional Gaussian data with identity covariance matrix,
the classical LRT itself applies. Thus, this setting serves as a perfect test
bed to compare the classical LRT against the universal LRT. This work presents
the first in-depth exploration of the size, power, and relationships between
several universal LRT variants. We show that a repeated subsampling approach is
the best choice in terms of size and power. For large numbers of subsamples,
the repeated subsampling set is approximately spherical. We observe reasonable
performance even in a high-dimensional setting, where the expected squared
radius of the best universal LRT's confidence set is approximately 3/2 times
the squared radius of the classical LRT's spherical confidence set. We
illustrate the benefits of the universal LRT through testing a non-convex
doughnut-shaped null hypothesis, where a universal inference procedure can have
higher power than a standard approach.

group of homeomorphisms on the real line, describe the structure of the other
possible actions of $G$ on the real line, and address under which conditions
such actions must be semi-conjugate to the natural defining action of $G$. The
main assumption is that $G$ should be locally moving, meaning that for every
open interval the subgroup of elements whose support is contained in such
interval acts on it without fixed points. One example (among many others) is
given by Thompson's group $F$. A first rigidity result implies that if $G$ is a
locally moving group, every faithful minimal action of $G$ on the real line by
$C^1$ diffeomorphisms is conjugate to its standard action. It turns out that
the situation is much wilder when considering actions by homeomorphisms: for a
large class of groups, including Thompson's group $F$, we describe uncountably
many conjugacy classes of minimal faithful actions by homeomorphisms on the
real line. To gain insight on such exotic actions, we introduce and develop the
notion of $\mathbb{R}$-focal action, a class of actions on the real line that
can be encoded by certain actions by homeomorphisms on planar real trees fixing
an end. Under a suitable finite generation condition on a locally moving group
$G$, we prove that every minimal faithful action of $G$ on the line is either
conjugate to the standard action, or it is $\mathbb{R}$-focal and the action on
the associated real tree factors via a horofunction onto the standard action of
$G$ on the line. Among applications of this result, we show that for a large

gives a semi-conjugate action. This is based on an analysis of the space of

consider a line-constrained version in which all disks are centered on a line
$L$ (while points of $P$ can be anywhere in the plane). We present an
$O((m+n)\log(m+n)+\kappa\log m)$ time algorithm for the problem, where $\kappa$
is the number of pairs of disks that intersect. Alternatively, we can also
solve the problem in $O(nm\log(m+n))$ time. For the unit-disk case where all
disks have the same radius, the running time can be reduced to
$O((n+m)\log(m+n))$. In addition, we solve in $O((m+n)\log(m+n))$ time the
$L_{\infty}$ and $L_1$ cases of the problem, in which the disks are squares and
diamonds, respectively. As a by-product, the 1D version of the problem where
all points of $P$ are on $L$ and the disks are line segments on $L$ is also
solved in $O((m+n)\log(m+n))$ time. We also show that the problem has an
$\Omega((m+n)\log (m+n))$ time lower bound even for the 1D case.
  We further demonstrate that our techniques can also be used to solve other
geometric coverage problems. For example, given in the plane a set $P$ of $n$
points and a set $S$ of $n$ weighted half-planes, we solve in $O(n^4\log n)$
time the problem of finding a subset of half-planes to cover $P$ so that their
total weight is minimized. This improves the previous best algorithm of
$O(n^5)$ time by almost a linear factor. If all half-planes are lower ones,
then our algorithm runs in $O(n^2\log n)$ time, which improves the previous
best algorithm of $O(n^4)$ time by almost a quadratic factor.

graphical syntax to reason about computational models across diverse fields,
including programming language semantics, circuit theory, quantum mechanics,

implement the equations appearing in SMTs as rewriting rules. This poses the
challenge of extending the traditional theory of term rewriting, which has been

for SMTs. Our approach exploits the correspondence between string diagram
rewriting and double pushout (DPO) rewriting of certain graphs, introduced in
the first paper of this series. Such a correspondence is only sound when the
SMT includes a Frobenius algebra structure. In the present work, we show how an
analogous correspondence may be established for arbitrary SMTs, once an

the covariance between two variables to vary against a continuous covariate.
For the bivariate case, the proposed score test statistic is computationally
simple and robust to model misspecification of the covariance term.
Subsequently, the method is expanded to test relationships between one highly
connected gene, such as a transcription factor, and several other genes for a
more global investigation of the dynamic of the coexpression network.
Simulations show that the proposed method has higher statistical power than
alternatives, can be used in more diverse scenarios, and is computationally
cheaper. We apply this method to African American subjects from GTEx to analyze
the dynamic behavior of their gene coexpression against genetic ancestry and to
identify transcription factors whose coexpression with their target genes
change with the genetic ancestry. The proposed method can be applied to a wide

In this paper we present a sound, complete, and terminating algorithm deciding
the satisfiability of SCI-formulas, based on labelled tableaux. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first implemented decision procedure for SCI which
runs in NP, i.e., is complexity-optimal. The obtained complexity bound is a

decomposition and equality rules, whose interplay yields derivation trees with
branches of polynomial length with respect to the size of the investigated

Transformers and the self-attention mechanism are recently proposed to
effectively learn long-range dependencies by modeling all pairs of word-to-word
attention regardless of their positions. The idea has also been extended to the
computer vision field by creating and treating image patches as embeddings.
Considering the computation complexity for whole image self-attention, current
transformer-based models settle for a rigid partitioning scheme that
potentially loses informative relations. Besides, current medical transformers
model global context on full resolution images, leading to unnecessary
computation costs. To address these issues, we developed a novel method to
integrate multi-scale attention and CNN feature extraction using a pyramidal
network architecture, namely Pyramid Medical Transformer (PMTrans). The PMTrans
captured multi-range relations by working on multi-resolution images. An
adaptive partitioning scheme was implemented to retain informative relations
and to access different receptive fields efficiently. Experimental results on
three medical image datasets (gland segmentation, MoNuSeg, and HECKTOR

simultaneously resum large logarithms of the jet radius $R$ and $1-z$, where
$z$ is the ratio of the jet energy to the initiating heavy quark energy. There
are numerically significant corrections to the leading order rate due to this
resummation. We also investigate the heavy quark fragmentation to a groomed

we introduce a collinear-ultrasoft mode sensitive to the grooming region
determined by the algorithm's $z_{\mathrm{cut}}$ parameter. This allows us to
resum large logarithms of $z_{\mathrm{cut}}/(1-z)$, again leading to large
numerical corrections near the endpoint. A nice feature of the analysis of the
heavy quark fragmenting to a groomed jet is the heavy quark mass $m$ renders
the algorithm infrared finite, allowing a perturbative calculation. We analyze
this for $E_JR \sim m$ and $E_JR\gg m$, where $E_J$ is the jet energy. To do
the latter case, we introduce an ultracollinear-soft mode, allowing us to resum
large logarithms of $E_JR/m$. Finally, as an application we calculate the rate
for $e^+e^-$ collisions to produce a heavy quark jet in the endpoint region,
where we show that grooming effects have a sizable contribution near the

behavior) serve to increase the SNR in the cleaned RF output and improve model
performance. To account for depth-dependent strong optical scattering, our
network was trained with simulated photoacoustic datasets of targets embedded
at different depths inside tissue media of different scattering levels. The
network trained on this novel dataset accurately locates targets in
experimental PA data that is clinically relevant with respect to the
localization of vessels, needles, or brachytherapy seeds. We verify the merits

solution intrinsic viscosity $[\eta]$ or the melt viscosity is linear in the
polymer molecular weight $M$ does not indicate that polymer dynamics are
Rouselike. Why? The other major polymer dynamic model, due to Kirkwood and
Riseman [\emph{J. Chem.\ Phys.\ } \textbf{16}, 565-573 (1948)], leads in its
free-draining form to a prediction $[\eta] \sim M$, even though the polymer
motions in this model are totally unlike the polymer motions in the Rouse
model. In the Rouse model, the chain motions are linear translation and
internal ('Rouse') modes. In the Kirkwood-Riseman model (and its free-draining
form, derived here), the chain motions are translation and whole-body rotation.
The difference arises because Rouse's calculation implicitly refers only to
chains subject to zero external shear force (And, as an aside, Rouse's
construction of $[\eta]$ is invalid, because it concludes that there is viscous
dissipation in a system that Rouse implicitly assumed to have no applied
shear).

developed and applied to investigate the bending behavior of functionally

parabolic variation of shear stress distribution along the thickness direction
thereby obviating the use of any shear correction factors. The material
properties of FG sandwich beam change continuously from one surface to another
according to a power-law function. Three common configurations of FG beams are
used for the study, namely: (a) single layer FG beam; (b) sandwich beam with FG
face sheets and homogeneous core and (c) sandwich beams with homogeneous face
sheets and FG core. The governing equations derived herein are solved by
employing the finite element method using a two-noded beam element, developed
for this purpose. The robustness and reliability of the developed finite
element model are demonstrated by comparing its results with those available by
other researchers in existing literature. The comparison studies show that the
proposed model is: (a) accurate and comparable with the literature; b) of fast
rate of convergence to the reference solution; c) excellent in terms of
numerical stability and d) valid for FG sandwich curved beams. Moreover,
comprehensive numerical results are presented and discussed in detail to
investigate the effects of volume fraction index, radius of curvature, material
distributions, length-to-thickness ratio, face-to-core-thickness ratio,
loadings and boundary conditions on the static response of FG curved sandwich

shows a cooling of the white dwarf from 21,020 K to 18,750 K (with a gravity

traditionally describe quantum computation in the circuit model. Open quantum
assembly language (OpenQASM 2) was proposed as an imperative programming
language for quantum circuits based on earlier QASM dialects. In principle, any
quantum computation could be described using OpenQASM 2, but there is a need to
describe a broader set of circuits beyond the language of qubits and gates. By
examining interactive use cases, we recognize two different timescales of
quantum-classical interactions: real-time classical computations that must be
performed within the coherence times of the qubits, and near-time computations
with less stringent timing. Since the near-time domain is adequately described
by existing programming frameworks, we choose in OpenQASM 3 to focus on the
real-time domain, which must be more tightly coupled to the execution of
quantum operations. We add support for arbitrary control flow as well as
calling external classical functions. In addition, we recognize the need to
describe circuits at multiple levels of specificity, and therefore we extend
the language to include timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers. These new
language features create a multi-level intermediate representation for circuit
development and optimization, as well as control sequence implementation for
calibration, characterization, and error mitigation.

open problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Hate speech is a
multidimensional issue, strongly dependant on language and cultural factors.
Despite its relevance, research on this topic has been almost exclusively
devoted to English. Most supervised learning resources, such as labeled
datasets and NLP tools, have been created for this same language. Considering
that a large portion of users worldwide speak in languages other than English,
there is an important need for creating efficient approaches for multilingual
hate speech detection. In this work we propose to address the problem of
multilingual hate speech detection from the perspective of transfer learning.
Our goal is to determine if knowledge from one particular language can be used
to classify other language, and to determine effective ways to achieve this. We
propose a hate specific data representation and evaluate its effectiveness
against general-purpose universal representations most of which, unlike our
proposed model, have been trained on massive amounts of data. We focus on a
cross-lingual setting, in which one needs to classify hate speech in one
language without having access to any labeled data for that language. We show
that the use of our simple yet specific multilingual hate representations
improves classification results. We explain this with a qualitative analysis
showing that our specific representation is able to capture some common
patterns in how hate speech presents itself in different languages.
  Our proposal constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt for
constructing multilingual specific-task representations. Despite its
simplicity, our model outperformed the previous approaches for most of the
experimental setups. Our findings can orient future solutions toward the use of
domain-specific representations.

proposes a simple and effective capsule autoencoder to address this issue,
called DPR-CAE. In our approach, the encoder parses the input into a set of
part capsules, including pose, intensity, and dynamic vector. The decoder
introduces a novel dynamic part representation (DPR) by combining the dynamic
vector and a shared template bank. These part representations are then
regulated by corresponding capsules to composite the final output in an
interpretable way. Besides, an extra translation-invariant module is proposed
to avoid directly learning the uncertain scene-part relationship in our
DPR-CAE, which makes the resulting method achieves a promising performance gain
on $rm$-MNIST and $rm$-Fashion-MNIST. % to model the scene-object relationship
DPR-CAE can be easily combined with the existing stacked capsule autoencoder
and experimental results show it significantly improves performance in terms of
unsupervised object classification. Our code is available in the Appendix.

reported by Yang (Phys. Rev. E, 98 (2018), 042202) for the fully integrable
case $\kappa=1$, we extend its considerations and offer criteria for soliton
stability and instability as a function of $\kappa$. In particular, we show
that for $\kappa <2$ the solutions are stable whereas for $\kappa >2$ they are
subject to collapse or blowup. At the critical point of $\kappa=2$, there is a
critical mass necessary for blowup or collapse. Furthermore, we show there is a
simple one-component nonlocal Lagrangian governing the dynamics of the system
which is amenable to a collective coordinate approximation. To that end, we
introduce a trial wave function with two collective coordinates to study the
small oscillations around the exact solution. We obtain analytical expressions
for the small oscillation frequency for the width parameter in the collective
coordinate approximation. We also discuss a four collective coordinate
approximation which in turn breaks the symmetry of the exact solution by
allowing for translational motion. The ensuing oscillations found in the latter
case capture the response of the soliton to a small translation. Finally, our
results are compared with numerical simulations of the system.

supply shortage are in real time. This lack of information hurts both riders
trying to find a ride and drivers trying to determine how to maximize their
earnings opportunity. Lyft's Personal Power Zone (PPZ) product helps the
company to maintain high levels of service on the platform by influencing the
spatial distribution of drivers in real time via monetary incentives that
encourage them to reposition their vehicles. The underlying system that powers
the product has two main components: (1) a novel 'escrow mechanism' that tracks
available incentive budgets tied to locations within a city in real time, and
(2) an algorithm that solves the stochastic driver positioning problem to
maximize short-run revenue from riders' fares. The optimization problem is a
multiagent dynamic program that is too complicated to solve optimally for our
large-scale application. Our approach is to decompose it into two subproblems.
The first determines the set of drivers to incentivize and where to incentivize
them to position themselves. The second determines how to fund each incentive
using the escrow budget. By formulating it as two convex programs, we are able
to use commercial solvers that find the optimal solution in a matter of
seconds. Rolled out to all 320 cities in which Lyft's operates in a little over
a year, the system now generates millions of bonuses that incentivize hundreds
of thousands of active drivers to optimally position themselves in anticipation
of ride requests every week. Together, the PPZ product and its underlying
algorithms represent a paradigm shift in how Lyft drivers drive and generate
earnings on the platform. Its direct business impact has been a 0.5% increase

investigate why and how these models work on VQA so well, in this paper we
explore the roles of individual heads and layers in Transformer models when
handling $12$ different types of questions. Specifically, we manually remove
(chop) heads (or layers) from a pre-trained VisualBERT model at a time, and
test it on different levels of questions to record its performance. As shown in
the interesting echelon shape of the result matrices, experiments reveal
different heads and layers are responsible for different question types, with
higher-level layers activated by higher-level visual reasoning questions. Based

remove heads and layers of the VisualBERT at an instance level when dealing
with different questions. Our dynamic chopping module can effectively reduce
the parameters of the original model by 50%, while only damaging the accuracy
by less than 1% on the VQA task.

patterns plays a critical role in building a re-identification (ReID) system.
Besides the basic requirement of discrimination, i.e., the features
corresponding to different identities should not be mixed, additional
intra-class distribution constraints, such as features from the same identities
should be close to their centers, have been adopted to construct losses.
Despite the advances of various new loss functions, it is still challenging to
strike the balance between the need of reducing the intra-class variation and
allowing certain distribution freedom. In this paper, we propose a new loss
based on center predictivity, that is, a sample must be positioned in a
location of the feature space such that from it we can roughly predict the
location of the center of same-class samples. The prediction error is then
regarded as a loss called Center Prediction Loss (CPL). We show that, without
introducing additional hyper-parameters, this new loss leads to a more flexible
intra-class distribution constraint while ensuring the between-class samples
are well-separated. Extensive experiments on various real-world ReID datasets
show that the proposed loss can achieve superior performance and can also be
complementary to existing losses.

provide high accuracy positioning based on the existing lighting
infrastructure. However, existing approaches often require dense lighting
distributions. Additionally, due to complicated indoor environments, it is
still challenging to develop a robust VLP. In this work, we proposed
loosely-coupled multi-sensor fusion method based on VLP and Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM), with light detection and ranging (LiDAR),
odometry, and rolling shutter camera. Our method can provide accurate and
robust robotics localization and navigation in LED-shortage or even outage
situations. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is verified by extensive
real-time experiment. The results show that our proposed scheme can provide an
average accuracy of 2 cm and the average computational time in low-cost
embedded platforms is around 50 ms.

predict near-term risk for hypoxemia, a rare, but life-threatening condition
known to cause serious patient harm during surgery. Inspired by the fact that a
hypoxemia event is defined based on a future sequence of low SpO2 (i.e., blood
oxygen saturation) instances, we propose the hybrid inference network (hiNet)
that makes hybrid inference on both future low SpO2 instances and hypoxemia
outcomes. hiNet integrates 1) a joint sequence autoencoder that simultaneously
optimizes a discriminative decoder for label prediction, and 2) two auxiliary
decoders trained for data reconstruction and forecast, which seamlessly learn
contextual latent representations that capture the transition from present
states to future states. All decoders share a memory-based encoder that helps
capture the global dynamics of patient measurement. For a large surgical cohort
of 72,081 surgeries at a major academic medical center, our model outperforms
strong baselines including the model used by the state-of-the-art hypoxemia
prediction system. With its capability to make real-time predictions of
near-term hypoxemic at clinically acceptable alarm rates, hiNet shows promise
in improving clinical decision making and easing burden of perioperative care.

few years. The success of existing methods heavily relies on the quality of
knowledge graphs. The entities with few triplets tend to be learned with less
expressive power. Fortunately, there are many knowledge graphs constructed from
various sources, the representations of which could contain much information.
We propose an adversarial embedding transfer network ATransN, which transfers
knowledge from one or more teacher knowledge graphs to a target one through an
aligned entity set without explicit data leakage. Specifically, we add soft
constraints on aligned entity pairs and neighbours to the existing knowledge
representation learning methods. To handle the problem of possible distribution
differences between teacher and target knowledge graphs, we introduce an
adversarial adaption module. The discriminator of this module evaluates the
degree of consistency between the embeddings of an aligned entity pair. The
consistency score is then used as the weights of soft constraints. It is not
necessary to acquire the relations and triplets in teacher knowledge graphs
because we only utilize the entity representations. Knowledge graph completion
results show that ATransN achieves better performance against baselines without
transfer on three datasets, CN3l, WK3l, and DWY100k. The ablation study
demonstrates that ATransN can bring steady and consistent improvement in
different settings. The extension of combining other knowledge graph embedding
algorithms and the extension with three teacher graphs display the promising
generalization of the adversarial transfer network.

enough to detect prompt emission associated with the alignment of magnetic
fields of a binary neutron star just prior to the merger, from the interaction

of a more powerful SGRB (a gamma-ray fluence an order of magnitude higher than
GRB 180805A and/or a brighter X-ray counterpart), our MWA observations may be

resource-scarce environments that are prone to the accumulation of technical
debt. While this general phenomenon is acknowledged, what remains unknown is
how technical debt specifically manifests in and affects software processes,
and how the software development techniques employed accommodate or mitigate
the presence of this debt. Objectives: We sought to draw on practitioner
insights and experiences in order to classify the effects of agile method use
on technical debt management. We explore the breadth of practitioners'
knowledge about technical debt; how technical debt is manifested across the
software process; and the perceived effects of common agile software
development practices and processes on technical debt. In doing so, we address
a research gap in technical debt knowledge and provide novel and actionable
managerial recommendations. Method: We designed, tested and executed a
multi-national survey questionnaire to address our objectives, receiving 184
responses from practitioners in Brazil, Finland, and New Zealand. Results: Our
findings indicate that: 1) Practitioners are aware of technical debt, although,
there was under utilization of the concept, 2) Technical debt commonly resides
in legacy systems, however, concrete instances of technical debt are hard to
conceptualize which makes it problematic to manage, 3) Queried agile practices
and processes help to reduce technical debt; particularly, techniques that
verify and maintain the structure and clarity of implemented artifacts.
Conclusions: The fact that technical debt instances tend to have
characteristics in common means that a systematic approach to its management is
feasible. However, notwithstanding the positive effects of some agile practices
on technical debt management, competing stakeholders' interests remain a
concern.(Abridged)

excellent capability of excavating the instance and label relationship.
Specifically, we first construct an instance spatial graph and a label semantic

graph by connecting each instance to all labels. Subsequently, the graph
network block is adopted to aggregate and update all nodes and edges state on
the assignment graph to form structured representations for each instance and

correspondence and optimizes such correspondence with a weighted cross-entropy
loss. Extensive experiments conducted on various image datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method.

transformation between the 3D vector sets and point clouds, respectively. Due
to the presence of outliers, probably in very large numbers, among the putative
vector or point correspondences in real-world applications, robust estimation
is of great importance. In this paper, we present ICOS (Inlier searching using
COmpatible Structures), a novel, efficient and highly robust solver for both
the correspondence-based rotation search and point cloud registration problems.
Specifically, we (i) propose and construct a series of compatible structures
for the two problems where various invariants can be established, and (ii)
design three time-efficient frameworks, the first for rotation search, the
second for known-scale registration and the third for unknown-scale
registration, to filter out outliers and seek inliers from the
invariant-constrained random sampling based on the compatible structures
proposed. In this manner, even with extreme outlier ratios, inliers can be
sifted out and collected for solving the optimal rotation and transformation
effectively, leading to our robust solver ICOS. Through plentiful experiments
over standard datasets, we demonstrate that: (i) our solver ICOS is fast,
accurate, robust against over 95% outliers with nearly 100% recall ratio of
inliers for rotation search and both known-scale and unknown-scale

unreliable evaluation results, and more accurate density estimation can be
achieved using a truncated generalized normal distribution. Based on this, we
propose a novel metric for accurate evaluation of GANs, named TREND (TRuncated
gEneralized Normal Density estimation of inception embeddings). We demonstrate
that our approach significantly reduces errors of density estimation, which
consequently eliminates the risk of faulty evaluation results. Furthermore, we
show that the proposed metric significantly improves robustness of evaluation

Locally Invertible Embedding for point cloud adaptive sampling and recovery
(PointLIE). Instead of learning to predict the underlying geometry details in a
seemingly plausible manner, PointLIE unifies point cloud sampling and
upsampling to one single framework through bi-directional learning.
Specifically, PointLIE recursively samples and adjusts neighboring points on
each scale. Then it encodes the neighboring offsets of sampled points to a
latent space and thus decouples the sampled points and the corresponding local
geometric relationship. Once the latent space is determined and that the deep
model is optimized, the recovery process could be conducted by passing the
recover-pleasing sampled points and a randomly-drawn embedding to the same
network through an invertible operation. Such a scheme could guarantee the
fidelity of dense point recovery from sampled points. Extensive experiments

collaborative economy applications, we introduce a stochastic matching model on
hypergraphs and multigraphs, extending the model introduced by Mairesse and
Moyal 2016. In this thesis, the stochastic matching model
$(\mathbb{S},\Phi,\mu)$ on general graph structures are defined as follows:
given a compatibility general graph structure
$\mathbb{S}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{S})$ which of a set of nodes denoted by
$\mathcal{V}$ that represent the classes of items and by a set of edges denoted
by $\mathcal{S}$ that allows matching between different classes of items. Items
arrive at the system at a random time, by a sequence (assumed to be $i.i.d.$)
that consists of different classes of $\mathcal{V}$, and request to be matched
due to their compatibility according to $\mathbb{S}$. The compatibility by
groups of two or more (hypergraphical cases) and by groups of two with
possibilities of matching between the items of the same classes (multigraphical
cases). The unmatched items are stored in the system and wait for a future
compatible item and as soon as they are matched they leave it together. Upon
arrival, an item may find several possible matches, the items that leave the
system depend on a matching policy $\Phi$ to be specified. We study the
stability of the stochastic matching model on hypergraphs, for different
hypergraphical topologies. Then, the stability of the stochastic matching model
on multigraphs using the maximal subgraph and minimal blow-up to distinguish
the zone of stability.

structures to deviate from the locally tree-like behavior of most standard
random graph models. For the process of bond percolation, we derive analytical
approximations for large outbreaks and the critical percolation value.
Interestingly, these derivations show that when the average degree of a vertex
is large, the influence of the deviations from the locally tree-like structure
is small. Our simulations show that this insensitivity to local clique
structures often already kicks in for networks with average degrees as low as
6. Furthermore, we show that the different behavior of bond percolation on
clustered networks compared to tree-like networks that was found in previous
works can be almost completely attributed to differences in degree sequences
rather than differences in clustering structures. We finally show that these
results also extend to completely different types of dynamics, by deriving
similar conclusions and simulations for the Kuramoto model on the same types of
clustered and non-clustered networks.

extremum of an unknown function by alternating inference of the underlying

function optimization. Herein, we apply quantum annealing (QA) to overcome the
difficulty in the continuous black-box optimization. As QA specializes in
optimization of binary problems, a continuous vector has to be encoded to
binary, and the solution of QA has to be translated back. Our method has the
following three parts: 1) Random subspace coding based on axis-parallel
hyperrectangles from continuous vector to binary vector. 2) A quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) defined by acquisition function based
on nonnegative-weighted linear regression model which is solved by QA. 3) A
penalization scheme to ensure that the QA solution can be translated back. It
is shown in benchmark tests that its performance using D-Wave Advantage$^{\rm

the Gaussian process in high-dimensional problems. Our method may open up a new

intent classification. Rather than developing a two-stage approach that first
classifies the domain and then the intent, we propose a hierarchical multi-task

simultaneously. Novelties in the proposed approach include: (1) sharing
supervised out-of-scope signals in joint modeling of domain and intent
classification to replace a two-stage pipeline; and (2) introducing a
hierarchical model that learns the intent and domain representations in the
higher and lower layers respectively. Experiments show that the model
outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, out-of-scope recall and F1.
Additionally, threshold-based post-processing further improves performance by
balancing precision and recall in intent classification.

Specifically, BiCnet contains two branches. Detail Branch processes frames at

with a down-sampling strategy is employed to capture long-range contexts. On
each branch, BiCnet appends multiple parallel and diverse attention modules to
discover divergent body parts for consecutive frames, so as to obtain an
integral characteristic of target identity. Furthermore, a Temporal Kernel
Selection (TKS) block is designed to capture short-term as well as long-term
temporal relations by an adaptive mode. TKS can be inserted into BiCnet at any
depth to construct BiCnetTKS for spatial-temporal modeling. Experimental
results on multiple benchmarks show that BiCnet-TKS outperforms
state-of-the-arts with about 50% less computations. The source code is

but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the
visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we
propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video
generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The
core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic
entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time
coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered
representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the
dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide
range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous
functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well
as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised
manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the
spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle
the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is
further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a
novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient
training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework
further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale
and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create
numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality,
photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamic

Ne$^{+}$-ion irradiation. The spin polarization increases monotonically as a
function of ion fluence. A relatively high polarization of 46 % and the SHA of
3.1 % are achieved on 40 nm thick films irradiated with 2 $\cdot$ 10$^{16}$

efficiency (SE) through spatial multiplexing of users, which requires accurate
channel state information. It is often assumed that regular pilots (RP), where
a fraction of the time-frequency resources is reserved for pilots, suffices to
provide high SE. However, the SE is limited by the pilot overhead and pilot
contamination. An alternative is superimposed pilots (SP) where all resources
are used for pilots and data. This removes the pilot overhead and reduces pilot
contamination by using longer pilots. However, SP suffers from data
interference that reduces the SE gains. This paper proposes the Massive-MIMO
Iterative Channel Estimation and Decoding (MICED) algorithm where partially
decoded data is used as side-information to improve the channel estimation and
increase SE. We show that users with precise data estimates can help users with
poor data estimates to decode. Numerical results with QPSK modulation and LDPC
codes show that the MICED algorithm increases the SE and reduces the
block-error-rate with RP and SP compared to conventional methods. The MICED
algorithm with SP delivers the highest SE and it is especially effective in
scenarios with short coherence blocks like high mobility or high frequencies.

interest. However, most cases studied so far are direct generalizations of the
topological states from electronic systems. Here, we reveal a novel class of
topological phonons -- the symmetry-enforced nodal-chain phonons, which
manifest features unique for phononic systems. We show that with $D_{2d}$
little co-group at a non-time-reversal-invariant-momentum point, the phononic
nodal chain is guaranteed to exist owing to the vector basis symmetry of
phonons, which is a unique character distinct from electronic and other
systems. Combined with the spinless character, this makes the proposed
nodal-chain phonons enforced by symmorphic crystal symmetries. We further
screen all 230 space groups, and find five candidate groups. Interestingly, the
nodal chains in these five groups exhibit two different patterns: for
tetragonal systems, they are one-dimensional along the fourfold axis; for cubic
systems, they form a three-dimensional network structure. Based on
first-principles calculations, we identify K$_{2}$O as a realistic material
hosting almost ideal nodal-chain phonons. We show that the effect of LO-TO
splitting, another unique feature for phonons, helps to expose the nodal-chain
phonons in K$_{2}$O in a large energy window. In addition, all the five
candidate groups have spacetime inversion symmetry, so the nodal chains also
feature a quantized $\pi$ Berry phase. This leads to drumhead surface phonon
modes that must exist on multiple surfaces of a sample.

the composite structure can be derived. The troublesome junction handling
techniques are not needed and non-conformal meshes are intrinsically supported.

basis of ion partitioning into nanopores. For confined ions in chemical
equilibrium with a bulk of dielectric constant $\epsilon_b>\epsilon$, three
physical mechanisms, at the origin of ion exclusion in nanopores, are expected
to be modified due to this dielectric mismatch: dielectric exclusion at the
water-pore interface (with membrane dielectric constant,
$\epsilon_m<\epsilon$), the solvation energy related to the difference in
Debye-H\""uckel screening parameters in the pore, $\kappa$, and in the bulk
$\kappa_b$, and the classical Born solvation self-energy proportional to
$\epsilon^{-1}-\epsilon_b^{-1}$. Our goal is to clarify the interplay between
these three mechanisms and investigate the role played by the Born contribution
in ionic liquid-vapor (LV) phase separation in confined geometries. We first
compute analytically the potential of mean force (PMF) of an ion of radius
$R_i$ located at the center of a nanometric spherical pore of radius $R$.
Computing the variational grand potential for a solution of confined ions, we
then deduce the partition coefficients of ions in the pore. Phase diagrams of
the LV transition are established for various parameter values and we show that
a signature of this phase transition can be detected by monitoring the total
osmotic pressure. For charged nanopores, these exclusion effects compete with
the electrostatic attraction that imposes the entry of counterions into the
pore to enforce electro-neutrality. This study will therefore help in
deciphering the respective roles of the Born self-energy and dielectric

by the mean-square error, has been a standard practice in image/video
compression over the years. RDO serves well for optimization of codec
performance for evaluation of the results in terms of PSNR. However, it is well
known that the PSNR does not correlate well with perceptual evaluation of
images; hence, RDO is not well suited for perceptual optimization of codecs.
Recently, rate-distortion-perception trade-off has been formalized by taking
the Kullback-Leibner (KL) divergence between the distributions of the original
and reconstructed images as a perception measure. Learned image compression
methods that simultaneously optimize rate, mean-square loss, VGG loss, and an
adversarial loss were proposed. Yet, there exists no easy approach to fix the
rate, distortion or perception at a desired level in a practical learned image
compression solution to perform an analysis of the trade-off between rate,
distortion and perception measures. In this paper, we propose a practical
approach to fix the rate to carry out perception-distortion analysis at a fixed
rate in order to perform perceptual evaluation of image compression results in
a principled manner. Experimental results provide several insights for
practical rate-distortion-perception analysis in learned image compression.

reliable performance reconstruction, suffering from challenging interaction
patterns and severe occlusions, especially for the monocular setting. To fill
this gap, in this paper, we propose RobustFusion, a robust volumetric
performance reconstruction system for human-object interaction scenarios using
only a single RGBD sensor, which combines various data-driven visual and
interaction cues to handle the complex interaction patterns and severe
occlusions. We propose a semantic-aware scene decoupling scheme to model the
occlusions explicitly, with a segmentation refinement and robust object
tracking to prevent disentanglement uncertainty and maintain temporal
consistency. We further introduce a robust performance capture scheme with the
aid of various data-driven cues, which not only enables re-initialization
ability, but also models the complex human-object interaction patterns in a
data-driven manner. To this end, we introduce a spatial relation prior to
prevent implausible intersections, as well as data-driven interaction cues to
maintain natural motions, especially for those regions under severe
human-object occlusions. We also adopt an adaptive fusion scheme for temporally
coherent human-object reconstruction with occlusion analysis and human parsing

achieve high-quality 4D human performance reconstruction under complex

LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interfaces grown on STO (100) single crystals with
partial TiO2 termination, utilizing in-situ local conductivity atomic force
microscopy (LC-AFM) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy
(s-SNOM). Using substrates with different degrees of chemical surface
termination, we can link the resulting interface chemistry to an inhomogeneous
2DEG formation. In conductivity maps recorded by LC-AFM, a significant lack of
conductivity is observed at topographic features, indicative of a local
SrO/AlO2 interface stacking order, while significant local conductivity can be
probed in regions showing TiO2/LaO interface stacking order. These results
could be corroborated by s SNOM, showing a similar contrast distribution in the
optical signal which can be linked to the local electronic properties of the
material. The results are further complimented by low-temperature conductivity
measurements, which show an increasing residual resistance at 5 K with
increasing portion of insulating SrO terminated areas. Therefore, we can
correlate the macroscopic electrical behavior of our samples to its nanoscopic
structure. Using proper parameters, 2DEG mapping can be carried out without any
visible alteration of sample properties, proving LC AFM and s SNOM to be viable
and destruction-free techniques for the identification of local 2DEG formation.
Furthermore, applying LC AFM and s SNOM in this manner opens the exciting

in practice on a broad range of problems? There are still some mysteries about
Adam that have not been unraveled. This paper provides a novel non-convex
analysis of Adam and its many variants to uncover some of these mysteries. Our
analysis exhibits that an increasing or large enough ""momentum"" parameter for
the first-order moment used in practice is sufficient to ensure Adam and its
many variants converge under a mild boundness condition on the adaptive scaling
factor of the step size. In contrast, the original problematic analysis of Adam
uses a momentum parameter that decreases to zero, which is the key reason that
makes it diverge on some problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time the gap between analysis and practice is bridged. Our analysis also
exhibits more insights for practical implementations of Adam, e.g., increasing
the momentum parameter in a stage-wise manner in accordance with stagewise
decreasing step size would help improve the convergence. Our analysis of the
Adam family is modular such that it can be (has been) extended to solving other
optimization problems, e.g., compositional, min-max and bi-level problems. As
an interesting yet non-trivial use case, we present an extension for solving

reaches Ip>80kA for high density (>5e18me-2) discharge with 150kW ECHR heating.
An analysis was carried out combining reconstructed multi-fluid equilibrium,

learning. We can alleviate this using weak supervision: a framework that uses
expert-defined rules $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ to estimate probabilistic labels
$p(y|\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ for the entire data set. These rules, however, are
dependent on what experts know about the problem, and hence may be inaccurate
or may fail to capture important parts of the problem-space. To mitigate this,
we propose Active WeaSuL: an approach that incorporates active learning into
weak supervision. In Active WeaSuL, experts do not only define rules, but they
also iteratively provide the true label for a small set of points where the
weak supervision model is most likely to be mistaken, which are then used to
better estimate the probabilistic labels. In this way, the weak labels provide
a warm start, which active learning then improves upon. We make two
contributions: 1) a modification of the weak supervision loss function, such
that the expert-labelled data inform and improve the combination of weak
labels; and 2) the maxKL divergence sampling strategy, which determines for
which data points expert labelling is most beneficial. Our experiments show
that when the budget for labelling data is limited (e.g. $\leq 60$ data
points), Active WeaSuL outperforms weak supervision, active learning, and
competing strategies, with only a handful of labelled data points. This makes
Active WeaSuL ideal for situations where obtaining labelled data is difficult.

both autonomously and by cooperating with each other. Cooperating robots,
fleets of cars and fleets of drones, emergency coordination systems are
examples of SSAs. One approach to enable cooperation of SSAs is to form dynamic
cooperation groups-ensembles-between components at runtime. Ensembles can be
formed based on predefined rules that determine which components should be part
of an ensemble based on their current state and the state of the environment
(e.g., ""group together 3 robots that are closer to the obstacle, their battery
is sufficient and they would not be better used in another ensemble""). This is
a computationally hard problem since all components are potential members of
all possible ensembles at runtime. In our experience working with ensembles in
several case studies the past years, using constraint programming to decide
which ensembles should be formed does not scale for more than a limited number
of components and ensembles. Also, the strict formulation in terms of hard/soft
constraints does not easily permit for runtime self-adaptation via learning.
This poses a serious limitation to the use of ensembles in large-scale and
partially uncertain SSAs. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to
recast the ensemble formation problem as a classification problem and use
machine learning to efficiently form ensembles at scale.

wavevector $q=(\pi/2,0),(0,\pi/2)$, which is derived from the paramagnon
interference mechanism in recent theoretical studies. Based on the $4 \times 1$
and $4 \times 4$ cluster Hubbard models, the feedback effects between spin
susceptibility and self-energy are calculated self-consistently by using the
fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation. It is found that the $d$-wave BO
leads to a sizable suppression of the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_1$.
In contrast, the reduction in $T_c$ is small, since the static susceptibility
$\chi^s(Q_s)$ is affected by the BO just slightly. It is verified that the
$d$-wave BO scenario is consistent with the experimental electronic properties
below $T_{CDW}$.

form its zero-field counterpart. One important difference in the presence of a
field is the Lorentz force acting on the nuclei, which can be decomposed as the
sum of the bare nuclear Lorentz force and a screening force due to the
electrons. This screening force is calculated from the Berry curvature and can
change the dynamics qualitatively. It is therefore important to include the
contributions from the Berry curvature in molecular dynamics simulations in a
magnetic field. In this work, we present a scheme for calculating the Berry
curvature numerically, by a finite-difference technique, addressing challenges
related to the arbitrary global phase of the wave function. The Berry curvature
is calculated as a function of bond distance for H$_2$ at the restricted and
unrestricted Hartree--Fock levels of theory and for CH$^{+}$ as a function of
the magnetic field strength at the restricted Hartree--Fock level of theory.
The calculations are carried out using basis sets of contracted Gaussian
functions equipped with London phase factors (London orbitals) to ensure
gauge-origin invariance. In the paper, we also interpret the Berry curvature in
terms of atomic charges and discuss its convergence in basis sets with and
without London phase factors. Calculation of the Berry curvature allows for its
inclusion in \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations in a magnetic

common to report peak-signal to noise ratio (PSNR) results. However, there does
not exist a generally agreed upon practice to compute PSNR for sets of images
or video. Some authors report average of individual image/frame PSNR, which is
equivalent to computing a single PSNR from the geometric mean of individual
image/frame mean-square error (MSE). Others compute a single PSNR from the
arithmetic mean of frame MSEs for each video. Furthermore, some compute the
MSE/PSNR of Y-channel only, while others compute MSE/PSNR for RGB channels.
This paper investigates different approaches to computing PSNR for sets of
images, single video, and sets of video and the relation between them. We show
the difference between computing the PSNR based on arithmetic vs. geometric
mean of MSE depends on the distribution of MSE over the set of images or video,
and that this distribution is task-dependent. In particular, these two methods
yield larger differences in restoration problems, where the MSE is
exponentially distributed and smaller differences in compression problems,
where the MSE distribution is narrower. We hope this paper will motivate the
community to clearly describe how they compute reported PSNR values to enable
consistent comparison.

based on artificial neural networks. Each system level development is designed
to solve different aspects of the action recognition problem including online
real-time processing, action segmentation and the involvement of objects. The
analysis of the experimental results are illustrated and described in six
articles. The proposed action recognition architecture of this thesis is
composed of several processing layers including a preprocessing layer, an
ordered vector representation layer and three layers of neural networks. It
utilizes self-organizing neural networks such as Kohonen feature maps and
growing grids as the main neural network layers. Thus the architecture presents
a biological plausible approach with certain features such as topographic
organization of the neurons, lateral interactions, semi-supervised learning and
the ability to represent high dimensional input space in lower dimensional
maps. For each level of development the system is trained with the input data
consisting of consecutive 3D body postures and tested with generalized input
data that the system has never met before. The experimental results of
different system level developments show that the system performs well with

structure (``3D histology reconstruction'') finds application in areas such as
atlas building and validation of \emph{in vivo} imaging. Straightforward
pairwise registration of neighbouring sections yields smooth reconstructions
but has well-known problems such as ``banana effect'' (straightening of curved
structures) and ``z-shift'' (drift). While these problems can be alleviated
with an external, linearly aligned reference (e.g., Magnetic Resonance (MR)
images), registration is often inaccurate due to contrast differences and the
strong nonlinear distortion of the tissue, including artefacts such as folds
and tears. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model of spatial
deformation that yields reconstructions for multiple histological stains that
that are jointly smooth, robust to outliers, and follow the reference shape.
The model relies on a spanning tree of latent transforms connecting all the
sections and slices of the reference volume, and assumes that the registration
between any pair of images can be see as a noisy version of the composition of
(possibly inverted) latent transforms connecting the two images. Bayesian
inference is used to compute the most likely latent transforms given a set of
pairwise registrations between image pairs within and across modalities. The
framework is used for accurate 3D reconstruction of two stains (Nissl and
parvalbumin) from the Allen human brain atlas, showing its benefits on real
data with severe distortions. Moreover, we also provide the registration of the
reconstructed volume to MNI space, bridging the gaps between two of the most
widely used atlases in histology and MRI. The 3D reconstructed volumes and
atlas registration can be downloaded from

problems on near-term quantum devices. Their PQCs have been conventionally
constructed from parametrized rotational angles of single-qubit gates around
predetermined set of axes, and two-qubit entangling gates, such as CNOT gates.
We propose a method to construct a PQC by continuous parametrization of both
the angles and the axes of its single-qubit rotation gates. The method is based
on the observation that when rotational angles are fixed, optimal axes of
rotations can be computed by solving a system of linear equations whose
coefficients can be determined from the PQC with small computational overhead.
The method can be further simplified to select axes freely from continuous
parameters with rotational angles fixed to half rotation or $\pi$. We show the
simplified free-axis selection method has better expressibility against other
structural optimization methods when measured with Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence. We also demonstrate PQCs with free-axis selection are more
effective to search the ground states of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and
combinatorial optimization. Because free-axis selection allows designing PQCs
without specifying their single-qubit rotational axes, it may significantly
improve the handiness of PQCs.

  of B1-inhomogeneity at 3T","15 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Magnetization transfer (MT) saturation reflects the additional
saturation of the MRI signal imposed by an MT pulse and is largely driven by
the saturation of the bound pool. This reduction of the bound polarization by
the MT pulse is less efficient than predicted by the differential B1-square law
of absorption. Thus, B1 inhomogeneities lead to a residual bias in the MT
saturation maps. We derive a heuristic correction to reduce this bias for a
widely used multi-parameter mapping protocol at 3T. Methods: The amplitude of
the MT pulse was varied via the nominal flip angle to mimic variations in B1.
The MT saturation's dependence on the actual flip angle features a linear
correction term, which was determined separately for gray and white matter.
Results: The deviation of MT saturation from differential B1-square law is well
described by a linear decrease with the actual flip angle of the MT pulse. This
decrease showed no significant differences between gray and white matter. Thus,
the post hoc correction does not need to take different tissue types into
account. Bias-corrected MT saturation maps appeared more symmetric and
highlighted highly myelinated tracts. Discussion: Our correction involves a
calibration that is specific for the MT pulse. While it can also be used to
rescale nominal flip angles, different MT pulses and/or protocols will require
individual calibration. Conclusion: The suggested B1 correction of the MT maps
can be applied post hoc using an independently acquired flip angle map.

Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation cross section increases monotonically with
decreasing DM velocity, severe constraints appear from the data of gamma rays
from dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) and the cosmic microwave

that in the Galactic halo. In this work, we consider Sommerfeld-enhanced

enhanced at certain velocities but eventually be highly suppressed when the DM
velocities become extremely low. We calculate the velocity-dependent
astrophysics factors ($J$-factors) for the Sommerfeld-enhanced $p$-wave DM
annihilation for fifteen nearby dSphs. Taking the channel of DM annihilating
into $4\mu$ through two light mediators as an example, we show that there are

dSphs gamma rays measured by Fermi-LAT and that from the CMB measured by

rigour, most famously presented in his 1967 paper `Informal rigour and

historical context, we then present two schemas under which we claim his
various examples of informal rigour can be subsumed. We then present detailed
reconstructions of his three original examples: his squeezing argument in favor
of the adequacy of the model theoretic analysis of logical validity, his
argument for the determinacy of the Continuum Hypothesis, and his refutation of
Markov's principle in intuitionistic analysis. We conclude by offering a
comparison of Kreisel's understanding of informal rigour with Carnap's method
of explication. In an appendix, we also offer briefer reconstructions of
Kreisel's attempts to apply informal rigour to the discovery of set theoretic
axioms, the distinction between standard and nonstandard models of arithmetic,
and the concepts of finitist proof, predicative definability, and

wide range of complex dynamic phenomena with potential for microwave signal

magnetic domains, stabilized by external fields and magnetostatic interactions.
In its original theory, the droplet was described as an imminently collapsing
bubble stabilized by spin transfer torque and, in its zero-frequency limit, as
equivalent to a bubble. Without nanoscale lateral confinement, pinning, or an
external applied field, such a nanobubble is unstable, and should collapse.
Here, we show that we can freeze dynamic droplets into static nanobubbles by
decreasing the magnetic field. While the bubble has virtually the same
resistance as the droplet, all signs of low-frequency microwave noise
disappear. The transition is fully reversible and the bubble can be thawed back
into a droplet if the magnetic field is increased under current. Whereas the
droplet collapses without a sustaining current, the bubble is highly stable and
remains intact for days without external drive. Electrical measurements are
complemented by direct observation using scanning transmission x-ray
microscopy, which corroborates the analysis and confirms that the bubble is
stabilized by pinning.

predictions of the Glauber model. The data were previously explained by arguing
that the nucleon-nucleon cross section may be shadowed in nucleus-nucleus

the same collision energy. This interpretation has quite significant
consequences for the understanding of heavy-ion data, in particular in the

the data by assuming that there is a mild bias present in the centrality
determination of the measurement; on the size of the related systematic
uncertainty. Using this assumption, we show that the data is in agreement with
theoretical calculations using nuclear parton distribution functions. Finally,
we speculate that the centrality dependence of the W$^-$/W$^{+}$ ratio may
point to the relevance of a larger skin thickness of the Pb nucleus, which, if
present, would result in a few percent larger PbPb cross section than currently
accounted for in the Glauber model and may hence be the root of the centrality

oil, chemical, natural gas, shale gas, etc. If there is some defect in steel
pipes, it will lead to serious adverse consequences. Applying object detection
in the field of deep learning to pipe weld defect detection and identification
can effectively improve inspection efficiency and promote the development of
industrial automation. Most predecessors used traditional computer vision
methods applied to detect defects of steel pipe weld seams. However,
traditional computer vision methods rely on prior knowledge and can only detect
defects with a single feature, so it is difficult to complete the task of
multi-defect classification, while deep learning is end-to-end. In this paper,
the state-of-the-art single-stage object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is proposed
to be applied to the field of steel pipe weld defect detection, and compared
with the two-stage representative object detection algorithm Faster R-CNN. The
experimental results show that applying YOLOv5 to steel pipe weld defect
detection can greatly improve the accuracy, complete the multi-classification
task, and meet the criteria of real-time detection.

developed our code in both C++ and Python, and our numerical algorithm can
further be adapted to solve any nonlinear PDEs appearing in other areas of

in computer vision. The key to tackling the challenging task is to exploit both
spatial and temporal clues in video sequences. In this work, we propose a novel
graph-based framework, namely Multi-Granular Hypergraph (MGH), to pursue better
representational capabilities by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in terms
of multiple granularities. Specifically, hypergraphs with different spatial
granularities are constructed using various levels of part-based features
across the video sequence. In each hypergraph, different temporal granularities
are captured by hyperedges that connect a set of graph nodes (i.e., part-based
features) across different temporal ranges. Two critical issues (misalignment
and occlusion) are explicitly addressed by the proposed hypergraph propagation
and feature aggregation schemes. Finally, we further enhance the overall video
representation by learning more diversified graph-level representations of
multiple granularities based on mutual information minimization. Extensive
experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, 90.0% top-1 accuracy on MARS
is achieved using MGH, outperforming the state-of-the-arts. Code is available

the input information is not only conveyed but also transformed by the spin
waves into high-dimensional information space when the waves propagate in the
film in a spatially distributed manner. This spatiotemporal dynamics realizes a
rich reservoir-computational functionality. First, we simulate spin waves in a
rectangular garnet film with two input electrodes to obtain spatial
distributions of the reservoir states in response to input signals, which are
represented as spin vectors and used for a machine-learning waveform
classification task. The detected reservoir states are combined through readout
connection weights to generate a final output. We visualize the spatial
distribution of the weights after training to discuss the number and positions
of the output electrodes by arranging them at grid points, equiangularly
circular points or at random. We evaluate the classification accuracy by
changing the number of the output electrodes, and find that a high accuracy
($>$ 90\%) is achieved with only several tens of output electrodes regardless
of grid, circular or random arrangement. These results suggest that the spin
waves possess sufficiently complex and rich dynamics for this type of tasks.
Then we investigate in which area useful information is distributed more by
arranging the electrodes locally on the chip. Finally, we show that this device
has generalization ability for input wave-signal frequency in a certain
frequency range. These results will lead to practical design of spin-wave
reservoir devices for low-power intelligent computing in the near future.

enough due to their recurrent operations. Additionally, there is a severe lack
of fair comparison among different methods on the same datasets. To address the
above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel traffic prediction

DGCRN, hyper-networks are designed to leverage and extract dynamic

are generated at each time step. We filter the node embeddings and then use
them to generate a dynamic graph, which is integrated with a pre-defined static
graph. As far as we know, we are the first to employ a generation method to
model fine topology of dynamic graph at each time step. Further, to enhance
efficiency and performance, we employ a training strategy for DGCRN by
restricting the iteration number of decoder during forward and backward
propagation. Finally, a reproducible standardized benchmark and a brand new
representative traffic dataset are opened for fair comparison and further
research. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model

cannot be inferred by the intruder, i.e., opacity of secrets against the
intruder, and the existence of the dynamic mask and the edit function should
not be discovered by the intruder, i.e., covertness of dynamic mask and edit
function against the intruder; 2) the closed-loop system behaviors should
satisfy some safety and nonblockingness requirement. We assume the intruder can
eavesdrop both the sensing information generated by the sensors and the control
commands issued to the actuators, and we refer to such an intruder as a
sensor-actuator eavesdropping intruder. Our approach is to model the
co-synthesis problem as a distributed supervisor synthesis problem in the
Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control framework, and we propose an incremental
synthesis heuristic to incrementally synthesize a dynamic mask, an edit
function, and a supervisor, which consists of three steps: 1) we first
synthesize an ensemble ME of dynamic mask and edit function to ensure the
opacity and the covertness against a sensor eavesdropping but command
non-eavesdropping intruder, and marker-reachability; 2) we then decompose ME
into a dynamic mask and an edit function by using a constraint-based approach,
with the help of a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver; 3) finally, we
synthesize a supervisor such that opacity and covertness can be ensured against
the sensor-actuator eavesdropping intruder, and at the same time safety and
nonblockingness requirement can be ensured. The effectiveness of our approach
is illustrated on an example about the enforcement of location privacy for an

renormalization of the in-gap quasiparticles, speeding up the quantum

applications in urban environments. However, allowing UAVs to fly above densely
populated areas raises concerns regarding safety. One of the main safety issues
is the possibility for a failure to cause the loss of navigation capabilities,
which can result in the UAV falling/landing in hazardous areas such as busy
roads, where it can cause fatal accidents. Current standards, such as the SORA
published in 2019, do not consider applicable mitigation techniques to handle
this kind of hazardous situations. Consequently, certifying UAV urban
operations implies to demonstrate very high levels of integrity, which results
in prohibitive development costs. To address this issue, this paper explores
the concept of Emergency Landing (EL). A safety analysis is conducted on an
urban UAV case study, and requirements are proposed to enable the integration
of EL as an acceptable mitigation mean in the SORA. Based on these
requirements, an EL implementation was developed, together with a runtime
monitoring architecture to enhance confidence in the system. Preliminary
qualitative results are presented and the monitor seem to be able to detect
errors of the EL system effectively.

of single layer boron hosting tilted Dirac cone, namely, the $hr$-$sB$ and
$8Pmmn$ borophene. In-plane anisotropy in borophene is manifested in the

located in the visible range. The $hr$-$sB$ borophene is characterised with an
intrinsic high carrier density and it supports strong hyperbolic plasmon modes
in the visible part of the spectrum. The $8Pmmn$ borophene, on the other hand,
resembles the prototypical Dirac material graphene, and upon carrier doping
acquires anisotropic Dirac plasmons in the mid-infrared. We have also
investigated the impact of the electron-phonon coupling and Landau damping on
these hyperbolic plasmon modes. Our results show that borophene, having high

from sensing systems are often incomplete with considerable corruption and
large amounts of missing values, preventing users from harnessing the full
power of the data. Missing data imputation has been a long-standing research
topic and critical application for real-world intelligent transportation
systems. A widely applied imputation method is low-rank matrix/tensor
completion; however, the low-rank assumption only preserves the global
structure while ignores the strong local consistency in spatiotemporal data. In
this paper, we propose a low-rank autoregressive tensor completion (LATC)
framework by introducing \textit{temporal variation} as a new regularization
term into the completion of a third-order (sensor $\times$ time of day $\times$
day) tensor. The third-order tensor structure allows us to better capture the
global consistency of traffic data, such as the inherent seasonality and
day-to-day similarity. To achieve local consistency, we design the temporal
variation by imposing an AR($p$) model for each time series with coefficients
as learnable parameters. Different from previous spatial and temporal
regularization schemes, the minimization of temporal variation can better
characterize temporal generative mechanisms beyond local smoothness, allowing
us to deal with more challenging scenarios such ""blackout"" missing. To solve
the optimization problem in LATC, we introduce an alternating minimization
scheme that estimates the low-rank tensor and autoregressive coefficients
iteratively. We conduct extensive numerical experiments on several real-world
traffic data sets, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of LATC in
diverse missing scenarios.

we show that most existing schemes do not satisfy a perturbation energy

They are shown to generalise the usual two-mode squeezed states of single-field

in the Fock space, we use the symplectic structure of the phase space. For this
reason, we first present a pedagogical analysis of the symplectic group
$\mathrm{Sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$ and its Lie algebra, from which we construct the
four-mode squeezed states and discuss their structure. We also study the
reduced single-field system obtained by tracing out one of the two fields. This
procedure being easier in the phase space, it motivates the use of the Wigner
function which we introduce as an alternative description of the state. It
allows us to discuss environmental effects in the case of linear interactions.

autoencoder to describe normal event patterns with small reconstruction errors.
The video inputs with large reconstruction errors are regarded as anomalies at
the test time. However, these methods sometimes reconstruct abnormal inputs
well because of the powerful generalization ability of deep autoencoder. To
address this problem, we present a novel approach for anomaly detection, which
utilizes discriminative prototypes of normal data to reconstruct video frames.
In this way, the model will favor the reconstruction of normal events and
distort the reconstruction of abnormal events. Specifically, we use a
prototype-guided memory module to perform discriminative latent embedding. We
introduce a new discriminative criterion for the memory module, as well as a
loss function correspondingly, which can encourage memory items to record the
representative embeddings of normal data, i.e. prototypes. Besides, we design a
novel two-branch autoencoder, which is composed of a future frame prediction
network and an RGB difference generation network that share the same encoder.
The stacked RGB difference contains motion information just like optical flow,
so our model can learn temporal regularity. We evaluate the effectiveness of
our method on three benchmark datasets and experimental results demonstrate the
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

quantum circuit (ADQC) approach to efficiently prepare arbitrary quantum
many-qubit states. A key ingredient is to introduce the latent gates whose
decompositions give the unitary gates that form the quantum circuit. The
circuit is optimized by updating the latent gates using back propagation to
minimize the distance between the evolved and target states. Taking the ground
states of quantum lattice models and random matrix product states as examples,
with the number of qubits where processing the full coefficients is unlikely,
ADQC obtains high fidelities with small numbers of layers $N_L \sim O(1)$.
Superior accuracy is reached compared with the existing state-preparation

spatial identities of urban areas. However, the manual, labour-intensive and
subjective nature of such approaches represents an impediment to the
development of a scalable, replicable and data-driven urban form

tessellation, a spatial unit derivative of Voronoi tessellation, obtained from
building footprints. Hence, we derive homogeneous urban tissue types and, by

interplanetary magnetic field. While the large scale morphology is well
understood, the impact of variations in coronal properties on the scale of a
few degrees on properties of the interplanetary medium is not known. Solar
Orbiter, carrying both remote sensing and in situ instruments into the inner
solar system, is intended to make these connections better than ever before.
Aims. We combine remote sensing and in situ measurements from Solar Orbiter's
first perihelion at 0.5 AU to study the fine scale structure of the solar wind
from the equatorward edge of a polar coronal hole with the aim of identifying
characteristics of the corona which can explain the in situ variations.
Methods. We use in situ measurements of the magnetic field, density and solar
wind speed to identify structures on scales of hours at the spacecraft. Using
Potential Field Source Surface mapping we estimate the source locations of the
measured solar wind as a function of time and use EUI images to characterise
these solar sources. Results. We identify small scale stream interactions in
the solar wind with compressed magnetic field and density along with speed
variations which are associated with corrugations in the edge of the coronal
hole on scales of several degrees, demonstrating that fine scale coronal
structure can directly influence solar wind properties and drive variations
within individual streams. Conclusions. This early analysis already
demonstrates the power of Solar Orbiter's combined remote sensing and in situ
payload and shows that with future, closer perihelia it will be possible
dramatically to improve our knowledge of the coronal sources of fine scale
solar wind structure, which is important both for understanding the phenomena
driving the solar wind and predicting its impacts at the Earth and elsewhere.

However, accurately counting animals in the wild to inform conservation
decision-making is difficult. Monitoring populations through image sampling has
made data collection cheaper, wide-reaching and less intrusive but created a
need to process and analyse this data efficiently. Counting animals from such
data is challenging, particularly when densely packed in noisy images.
Attempting this manually is slow and expensive, while traditional computer
vision methods are limited in their generalisability. Deep learning is the
state-of-the-art method for many computer vision tasks, but it has yet to be
properly explored to count animals. To this end, we employ deep learning, with
a density-based regression approach, to count fish in low-resolution sonar
images. We introduce a large dataset of sonar videos, deployed to record wild
mullet schools (Mugil liza), with a subset of 500 labelled images. We utilise
abundant unlabelled data in a self-supervised task to improve the supervised
counting task. For the first time in this context, by introducing uncertainty

of prediction uncertainty for more informed biological decision-making.
Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of our proposed counting framework
through testing it on a recent benchmark dataset of high-resolution annotated
underwater images from varying habitats (DeepFish). From experiments on both
contrasting datasets, we demonstrate our network outperforms the few other deep

Mg/MgH$_2$ system a prime candidate for solid state hydrogen storage and

dehydrogenation hamper broad applicability. One promising strategy to improve
dehydrogenation is the formation of metastable $\gamma$-MgH$_2$. A nanoparticle
(NP) design, where $\gamma$-MgH$_2$ forms intrinsically during hydrogenation is
presented and a formation mechanism based on transmission electron microscopy
results is proposed.Volume expansion during hydrogenation causes compressive
stress within the confined, anisotropic NPs, leading to plastic deformation of
$\beta$-MgH$_2$ via (301) $\beta$ twinning. It is proposed that these twins
nucleate $\gamma$-MgH$_2$ nanolamellas, which are stabilized by residual
compressive stress. Understanding this mechanism is a crucial step toward
cycle-stable, Mg-based dynamic plasmonic and hydrogen-storage materials with
improved dehydrogenation. It is envisioned that a more general design of
confined NPs utilizes the inherent volume expansion to reform $\gamma$-MgH$_2$
during each rehydrogenation

unprecedented high precision parallax measurements to review the census of

exoplanets. We started our compilation from a query on all objects with a
parallax larger than 100 mas using SIMBAD. We completed the census by adding
companions, brown dwarfs with recent parallax measurements not in SIMBAD yet,
and vetted exoplanets. The compilation combines astrometry and photometry from
the recent Gaia Early Data Release 3 with literature magnitudes, spectral types
and line-of-sight velocities. We give a description of the astrophysical

networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), sometimes referred to as

components of the future wireless networks because they can reconfigure the
propagation environment for wireless signals with low-cost passive devices. In
doing so, the coverage of a cell can be expected to increase significantly as

attractive research area but also triggered a couple of projects to develop
appropriate solutions to enable the set-up of hardware demonstrations and
prototypes. In parallel, technical discussions and activities towards
standardization already took off in some regions. Promoting RIS to be
integrated into future commercial networks and become a commercial success
requires significant standardization work taken place both at regional level
standards developing organizations (SDO) and international SDOs such as the 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). While many research papers study how RIS
can be used and optimized, few effort is devoted to analyzing the challenges to
commercialize RIS and how RIS can be standardized. This paper intends to shed
some light on RIS from an industrial viewpoint and provide a clear roadmap to

concept of trying to outrun the beam damage by carefully tuning the dwell time
and distance between consecutively visited probe positions. We add a non linear
function to include a threshold effect and evaluate the accumulated damage in
each part of the image as a function of scan pattern details. Together, these
ingredients are able to describe qualitatively all aspects of the experimental
data and provide us with a model that could guide a further optimisation
towards even lower beam damage without lowering the applied electron dose. We
deliberately remain vague on what is diffusing here which avoids introducing
too many sample specific details. This provides hope that the model can be
applied also in sample classes that were not yet studied in such great detail

embed powerful ARM processors into their devices. These systems can be attacked
by redirecting the control-flow of a program to bypass critical pieces of code
such as privilege checks or signature verifications. Control-flow hijacks can
be performed using classical software vulnerabilities, physical fault attacks,
or software-induced fault attacks. To cope with this threat and to protect the
control-flow, dedicated countermeasures are needed. To counteract control-flow
hijacks, control-flow integrity~(CFI) aims to be a generic solution. However,
software-based CFI typically either protects against software or fault attacks,
but not against both. While hardware-assisted CFI can mitigate both types of
attacks, they require extensive hardware modifications. As hardware changes are
unrealistic for existing ARM architectures, a wide range of systems remains
unprotected and vulnerable to control-flow attacks.
  In this work, we present FIPAC, an efficient software-based CFI scheme
protecting the execution at basic block granularity of ARM-based devices
against software and fault attacks. FIPAC exploits ARM pointer authentication
of ARMv8.6-A to implement a cryptographically signed control-flow graph. We
cryptographically link the correct sequence of executed basic blocks to enforce
CFI at this granularity. We use an LLVM-based toolchain to automatically
instrument programs. The evaluation on SPEC2017 with different security
policies shows a code overhead between 54-97\% and a runtime overhead between
35-105%. While these overheads are higher than for countermeasures against
software attacks, FIPAC outperforms related work protecting the control-flow
against fault attacks. FIPAC is an efficient solution to provide protection
against software- and fault-based CFI attacks on basic block level on modern
ARM devices.

choice of the classes, that is the partitioning of the world map, is crucial
for the performance. In this paper, we present two contributions to improve the
interpretability of a geolocalization model: (1) We propose a novel semantic
partitioning method which intuitively leads to an improved understanding of the
predictions, while achieving state-of-the-art results for geolocational
accuracy on benchmark test sets; (2) We introduce a metric to assess the
importance of semantic visual concepts for a certain prediction to provide
additional interpretable information, which allows for a large-scale analysis
of already trained models. Source code and dataset are publicly available.

  mixtures of Fock states","Numerical part replaced by analytical proof; typos corrected; 18
  pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I show that a nonnegative Wigner function that represents a mixture of Fock
states is majorized by the Wigner function of the vacuum state. As a
consequence, the integration of any concave function over the Wigner phase
space has a lower value for the vacuum state than for a mixture of Fock states.
The Shannon differential entropy is an example of such concave function of
significant physical importance. I demonstrate that the very cause of the
majorization lies in the fact that a Wigner function is the result of a
convolution. My proof is based on a new majorization result dedicated to the
convolution of the negative exponential distribution with a precisely
constrained function. I present a geometrical interpretation of the new
majorization property in a discrete setting and extend this relation to a
continuous setting. Findings presented in this article might be expanded upon
to explain why the Wigner function of the vacuum majorizes - beyond mixtures of
Fock states - many other physical states represented by a nonnegative Wigner
function.

phenomenological interest typically contain a classical period of kinetic
dominance prior to slow-roll inflation, with consequences on the power spectrum
that here we try and tell apart from those of phenomena occuring in the
vicinity of a bounce in hybrid LQC. For this comparison, we use the same
criterion for the choice of a vacuum state of the primordial perturbations,
both in the context of relativistic cosmology and on the LQC cosmological
background. As a first approximation to the problem, our study ignores the
influence of a quasi-de Sitter evolution (rather than de Sitter) in the
slow-roll inflationary regime, and of a typically short transition between the
kinetically dominated era and the slow-roll period. Our results show that,
while the two studied types of effects can lead to a drastic power suppression
in the infrared sector of the spectrum, the mode scale at which this happens is
much larger for LQC than for classical relativistic cosmology, the
corresponding scales being related to the spacetime curvature at the bounce and
at the onset of inflation, respectively.

implementation of a dynamic data structure exhibits a metadata overhead related
to resolving synchronization issues caused by concurrent data accesses. An

minimal possible memory overhead, which, in practice, reduces cache misses and
unnecessary memory reclamation.
  In this paper, we discuss the memory-optimality question in the context of
non-blocking bounded queues. We observe first that, in special cases when the
ABA problem is precluded, e.g., by assuming that the hardware supports LL/SC

there exist lock-free queues with constant memory overhead (in the number of
concurrent processes $O(n)$). For the general and more realistic case, we
present a CAS-based lock-free bounded queue implementation with $O(n)$ memory
overhead. We show that this overhead is asymptotically optimal: it is
impossible to construct a non-blocking concurrent bounded queue with the
constant memory overhead, e.g., a bounded queue that maintains a fixed-size
array for the data and uses counters for enqueue/dequeue operations. This work
opens a new research avenue devoted to the memory-optimality phenomenon in

revealing that i) in the optical, long-term flux changes are almost achromatic,

at 37 GHz follow those in the optical with a delay of about three weeks; iii)
the range of variation of the polarization degree and angle is much larger in
the optical than in the radio band, but the mean polarization angles are

quasi-periodicity of about one month. We explain the source behaviour in terms
of a rotating inhomogeneous helical jet, whose pitch angle can change in time.

the orbital angular momentum. Otherwise, the spin configuration is constant and
the subsequent binary dynamics and gravitational-wave emission are much
simpler. We summarize a series of works which has shown that, while three of
the aligned configurations are stable equilibria, the `up-down' configuration,
in which the heavier (lighter) black hole is (anti) aligned with the orbital
angular momentum, is unstable when perturbed; at a critical point in the
inspiral the black hole spins begin to tilt wildly as precession takes over. We
present two equivalent approaches to derive the instability onset based on
multitimescale post-Newtonian techniques, and point out that the instability
has a predictable endpoint. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of this
precessional instability in the strong-field regime of numerical relativity
with simulations of aligned-spin binaries lasting $\sim100$ orbits before
merger. The spins of up-down systems can tilt by $\sim90^\circ$, leaving a
notable imprint in the emitted gravitational-wave signals and providing a
possible mechanism to form precessing systems in astrophysical environments
from which sources are preferentially born with (anti) aligned spins.

characterised by three configuration parameters: the radius of the filament,
R_FIL, the mean density of H_2 in the filament, n_FIL, and the rate at which
the O star emits ionising photons, Ndot_LyC. We show that for a wide range of
these configuration parameters, ionising radiation from the O star rapidly
erodes the filament, and the ionised gas from the filament disperses into the
surroundings. Under these circumstances the distance from the O star to the
ionisation front (IF) is given approximately by L ~ 5.2 pc [R_FIL/0.2pc]^-1/6
[n_FIL/10^4cm^-3]^-1/3 [Ndot_LyC/10^49s^-1]^1/6 [t/Myr]^2/3, and we derive
similar simple power-law expressions for other quantities, for example the rate
at which ionised gas boils off the filament, and the mass of the
shock-compressed layer (SCL) that is swept up behind the IF. We show that a
very small fraction of the ionising radiation is expended locally, and a rather
small amount of molecular gas is ionised and dispersed. We discuss some
features of more realistic models, and the extent to which they might modify or
invalidate the predictions of this idealised model. In particular we show that,
for very large R_FIL and/or large n_FIL and/or low Ndot_LyC, continuing
accretion onto the filament might trap the ionising radiation from the O star,
slowing the erosion of the filament even further.

transport system and land use by replacing private vehicles. Sharing vehicles
without drivers is expected to reduce parking demand, and as a side effect,
increase congestion owing to the empty fleets made by SAVs picking up travelers
and relocating. Although the impact may not be uniform over a region of
interest owing to the heterogeneity of travel demand distribution and network
configuration, few studies have debated such impact at a local scale, such as
in transportation analysis zones (TAZs). To understand the impact in relation
to geographical situations, this study aims to estimate the impacts of SAVs at
the local scale by simulating their operation on a developed simulator. Using
the mainland of Okinawa, Japan as a case study, it was found that parking
demand was reduced the most in residence-dominant zones in terms of quantity
and in office-dominant zones in terms of proportion. As a side effect of
replacing private vehicles with SAVs, empty fleets increase congestion,
particularly at the periphery of the city. Overall, the results show the
heterogeneous impacts of the SAVs at the TAZ level on both land use and
traffic, thus suggesting the importance of developing appropriate strategies
for urban and transport planning when considering the characteristics of the
zones.

spectral M-type or C-type classification can be derived from Hamburg-ESO
objective prism spectra. Most of these are oxygen-rich (M-type) and very few
are carbon rich. The periods are in the range 100-500 days, and CSS amplitudes
are up to 3 mag. In this small sample, no halo AGB star is fainter than
Ks0=12.5. This may be due to the scarcity of AGBs in the outer halo, or
insufficient instrumental depth. Leaving aside spectral information, we then
searched for even fainter pulsators (Ks>12.5) in the entire CSS catalogue. Gaia
astrometry makes it possible to identify some contaminants. Our final result is
the identification of ten candidate distant LPVs. If these ten stars obey the
fundamental mode K-band period luminosity relation used for Miras and
small-amplitude Miras, their distances are between 50 and 120kpc from the Sun.
In a diagram showing distance versus Gaia tangential velocity, these ten stars
have positions similar to those of other objects in the halo, such as globular
clusters and dwarf galaxies. We also detect some underluminous AGBs that
deserve further study. A detailed catalogue of the 77 high-latitude M or C

flexible loads (FL) and energy storage systems (ESS). Accordingly, the paper
proposes and solves for the first time a new problem formulation in the form of

a non-linear programming (NLP) problem. It computes optimal setpoints of

of this paper is the comprehensive and accurate modelling, using: AC power flow
model for both pre-contingency and post-contingency states, inter-temporal
constraints for resources such as FL and ESS in a 24-hours time horizon and RES
uncertainties. The importance and performances of the proposed model through a
direct approach, pushing the problem size up to the solver limit, are
illustrated on two test systems of 5 nodes and 60 nodes, respectively, while

  controllers of VSC-HVDC links","conference",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  High voltage direct current links based on voltage source converters
(VSC-HVDC) embedded in alternating current (AC) systems are receiving a great
deal of attention recently because they can contribute positively to the
flexibilisation of modern power systems. Among several possibilities,
AC-line-emulation control has been highlighted as an simple-but-useful
alternative for these type of systems. With this strategy, the power flow
through the link is controlled proportionally to the angle difference between
its two AC terminals and this provides self-adaptation of the power flow in
case of contingencies in the parallel AC lines, naturally. Although this
controller is mainly concerned with steady state, it can also have an impact on
the dynamic behaviour of the system, which has not been sufficiently analysed.
Along this line, this paper analyses the impact of AC-line-emulation
controllers of VSC-HVDC on power system transient stability. Nonlinear
time-domain simulations were carried out by using PSS/E on a small test system
with an embedded point-to-point VSC-HVDC link. The critical clearing time (CCT)
of a test fault has been used to assess transient-stability margins of the
whole system. The paper provides recommendations for the design of
AC-line-emulation controllers in order to ensure that transient stability is
not jeopardised.

that Demystify produces match those provided by humans by comparing our results
with those provided independently by puzzle experts on a range of puzzles. We
compare Demystify to published guides for solving a range of different pen and

of the first publicly available datasets which includes all the slates that are
presented to users as well as which items (if any) in the slates were clicked
on. Such a data set allows us to move beyond the common assumption that
implicitly assumes that users are considering all possible items at each
interaction. Instead we build our likelihood using the items that are actually

theoretically and in experiments. We also introduce a hierarchical prior for
the item parameters based on group memberships. Both item parameters and user
preferences are learned probabilistically. Furthermore, we combine our model
with bandit strategies to ensure learning, and introduce `in-slate Thompson
Sampling' which makes use of the slates to maximise explorative opportunities.
We show experimentally that explorative recommender strategies perform on par

autonomous mobile robots. Moreover, the presence of time-delay restricts the
response time of the system and hinders the safety performance. Thus, this
paper proposes a modular and scalable safety-control design that utilizes the
Smith predictor and barrier certificates to safely and consistently avoid
obstacles with different footprints. The proposed solution includes a two-layer
predictor to compensate for the time-delay in the servo-system and angle
control loops. The proposed predictor configuration dramatically improves the
transient performance and reduces response time. Barrier certificates are used
to determine the safe range of the robot's heading angle to avoid collisions.
The proposed obstacle avoidance technique conveniently integrates with various
trajectory tracking algorithms, which enhances design flexibility. The angle
condition is adaptively calculated and corrects the robot's heading angle and
angular velocity. Also, the proposed method accommodates multiple obstacles and
decouples the control structure from the obstacles' shape, count, and
distribution. The control structure has only eight tunable parameters
facilitating control calibration and tuning in large systems of mobile robots.
Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
safety-control.

Fourier-like basis on which to expand the solution; however, more complex

reproducibility of radiomics has limited its applicability to clinical
practice. This issue is especially prominent when radiomic features are
calculated from noisy images, such as low dose computed tomography (CT) scans.
In this article, we investigate the possibility of improving the
reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs by using
generative models for denoising.One traditional denoising method - non-local
means - and two generative models - encoder-decoder networks (EDN) and
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) - were selected as the test
models. We added noise to the sinograms of full dose CTs to mimic low dose CTs
with two different levels of noise: low-noise CT and high-noise CT. Models were
trained on high-noise CTs and used to denoise low-noise CTs without
re-training. We also test the performance of our model in real data, using
dataset of same-day repeat low dose CTs to assess the reproducibility of
radiomic features in denoised images. The EDN and the CGAN improved the
concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features for low-noise
images from 0.87 to 0.92 and for high-noise images from 0.68 to 0.92
respectively. Moreover, the EDN and the CGAN improved the test-retest
reliability of radiomic features (mean CCC increased from 0.89 to 0.94) based
on real low dose CTs. The results show that denoising using EDN and CGANs can
improve the reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs.
Moreover, images with different noise levels can be denoised to improve the
reproducibility using these models without re-training, as long as the noise
intensity is equal or lower than that in high-noise CTs. To the authors'
knowledge, this is the first effort to improve the reproducibility of radiomic
features calculated on low dose CT scans.

efficient designs of $2n$-to-$n$-bit compression functions from non-compressing

domains ($> 2n$ bits) is still an open problem.
  In this work we propose the new \textit{compactness} efficiency notion. It
allows us to focus on asymptotically optimally collision resistant hash
function and normalize their parameters based on Stam's bound from CRYPTO 2008
to obtain maximal efficiency.
  We then present two tree-based modes of operation
  -Our first construction is an \underline{A}ugmented \underline{B}inary
T\underline{r}ee (ABR) mode. The design is a $(2^{\ell}+2^{\ell-1}

$2n$-to-$n$-bit compression functions for any $\ell\geq 2$. Our construction is
optimally compact with asymptotically (optimal) $2^{n/2-\epsilon}$-query
collision resistance in the ideal model. For a tree of height $\ell$, in
comparison with Merkle tree, the $ABR$ mode processes additional
$(2^{\ell-1}-1)$ data blocks making the same number of internal compression
function calls.
  -While the $ABR$ mode achieves collision resistance, it fails to achieve
indifferentiability from a random oracle within $2^{n/3}$ queries. $ABR^{+}$
compresses only $1$ less data block than $ABR$ with the same number of
compression calls and achieves in addition indifferentiability up to

previous decisions. In this paper, we look at perpetual voting rules from an
axiomatic perspective and study two main questions. First, we ask how simple
such rules can be while still meeting basic desiderata. For two simple but
natural classes, we fully characterize the axiomatic possibilities. Second, we
ask how proportionality can be formalized in perpetual voting. We study
proportionality on simple profiles that are equivalent to the apportionment
setting and show that lower and upper quota axioms can be used to distinguish
(and sometimes characterize) perpetual voting rules. Furthermore, we show a
surprising connection between a perpetual rule called Perpetual Consensus and
Frege's apportionment method.

we aim to learn to simulate a dynamic environment directly in pixel-space, by
watching unannotated sequences of frames and their associated action pairs. We
introduce a novel high-quality neural simulator referred to as DriveGAN that
achieves controllability by disentangling different components without
supervision. In addition to steering controls, it also includes controls for
sampling features of a scene, such as the weather as well as the location of
non-player objects. Since DriveGAN is a fully differentiable simulator, it
further allows for re-simulation of a given video sequence, offering an agent
to drive through a recorded scene again, possibly taking different actions. We
train DriveGAN on multiple datasets, including 160 hours of real-world driving
data. We showcase that our approach greatly surpasses the performance of
previous data-driven simulators, and allows for new features not explored

state-of-the-art performance on various graph representation learning tasks.
However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
i.e. an attacker is able to fool the GNNs by perturbing the graph structure or
node features deliberately. While being able to successfully decrease the
performance of GNNs, most existing attacking algorithms require access to
either the model parameters or the training data, which is not practical in the
real world.
  In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the Mettack algorithm, which
is a representative grey-box attacking method, and then we propose a
gradient-based black-box attacking algorithm. Firstly, we show that the Mettack
algorithm will perturb the edges unevenly, thus the attack will be highly
dependent on a specific training set. As a result, a simple yet useful strategy
to defense against Mettack is to train the GNN with the validation set.
Secondly, to overcome the drawbacks, we propose the Black-Box Gradient Attack
(BBGA) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that out proposed method is
able to achieve stable attack performance without accessing the training sets
of the GNNs. Further results shows that our proposed method is also applicable
when attacking against various defense methods.

industry has switched to an auction-based allocation system at the onset of
Phase III of the EU ETS to bring economic efficiency by negating windfall
profits that have been resulted from grandfathered allocation of allowances in
the previous phases. In this work, we analyze and simulate the interaction of
oligopolistic generators in an electricity market with a game-theoretical
framework where the electricity and the emissions markets interact in a
two-stage electricity market. For analytical simplicity, we assume a single
futures market where the electricity is committed at the futures price, and the
emissions allowance is contracted in advance, prior to a spot market where the
energy and allowances delivery takes place. Moreover, a coherent risk measure
is applied (Conditional Value at Risk) to model both risk averse and risk
neutral generators and a two-stage stochastic optimization setting is
introduced to deal with the uncertainty of renewable capacity, demand,
generation, and emission costs. The performance of the proposed equilibrium
model and its main properties are examined through realistic numerical
simulations. Our results show that renewable generators are surging and
substituting conventional generators without compromising social welfare.
Hence, both renewable deployment and emission allowance auctioning are

another class of adversarial attacks, called black-box adversarial attacks,
emerged, which does not make use of information on the gradients, being more
suitable for real-world attack scenarios. In this work, we compare three
well-known evolution strategies on the generation of black-box adversarial

migration, and budding. Many living cells, such as budding yeast and fission
yeast, use cytoskeletal structures to actively transport proteins to one
location on the membrane and create a high density spot of membrane-bound
proteins. Yet, the thermodynamic constraints on filament-based cell
polarization remain unknown. We show by mathematical modeling that cell
polarization requires detailed balance to be broken, and we quantify the
free-energy cost of maintaining a polarized state of the cell. Our study
reveals that detailed balance cannot only be broken via the active transport of
proteins along filaments, but also via a chemical modification cycle, allowing
detailed balance to be broken by the shuttling of proteins between the
filament, membrane, and cytosol. Our model thus shows that cell polarization
can be established via two distinct driving mechanisms, one based on active
transport and one based on non-equilibrium binding. Furthermore, the model
predicts that the driven binding process dissipates orders of magnitude less
free-energy than the transport-based process to create the same membrane spot.
Active transport along filaments may be sufficient to create a polarized
distribution of membrane-bound proteins, but an additional chemical
modification cycle of the proteins themselves is more efficient and less
sensitive to the physical exclusion of proteins on the transporting filaments,
providing insight in the design principles of the Pom1/Tea1/Tea4 system in
fission yeast and the Cdc42 system in budding yeast.

ecosystem. At the same time, attacks towards DeFi applications (apps) are
increasing. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing smart contract
vulnerability detection tools cannot be directly used to detect DeFi attacks.
That's because they lack the capability to recover and understand high-level
DeFi semantics, e.g., a user trades a token pair X and Y in a Decentralized
EXchange (DEX).
  In this work, we focus on the detection of two types of new attacks on DeFi
apps, including direct and indirect price manipulation attacks. The former one
means that an attacker directly manipulates the token price in DEX by
performing an unwanted trade in the same DEX by attacking the vulnerable DeFi
app. The latter one means that an attacker indirectly manipulates the token
price of the vulnerable DeFi app (e.g., a lending app). To this end, we propose
a platform-independent way to recover high-level DeFi semantics by first
constructing the cash flow tree from raw Ethereum transactions and then lifting
the low-level semantics to high-level ones, including token trade, liquidity
mining, and liquidity cancel. Finally, we detect price manipulation attacks
using the patterns expressed with the recovered DeFi semantics.
  We have implemented a prototype named \tool{} and applied it to more than 350
million transactions. It successfully detected 432 real-world attacks in the
wild. We confirm that they belong to four known security incidents and five
zero-day ones. We reported our findings. Two CVEs have been assigned. We
further performed an attack analysis to reveal the root cause of the
vulnerability, the attack footprint, and the impact of the attack. Our work

generators to render high-resolution videos. We frame the video synthesis
problem as discovering a trajectory in the latent space of a pre-trained and
fixed image generator. Not only does such a framework render high-resolution
videos, but it also is an order of magnitude more computationally efficient. We
introduce a motion generator that discovers the desired trajectory, in which
content and motion are disentangled. With such a representation, our framework
allows for a broad range of applications, including content and motion
manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce a new task, which we call cross-domain
video synthesis, in which the image and motion generators are trained on
disjoint datasets belonging to different domains. This allows for generating
moving objects for which the desired video data is not available. Extensive
experiments on various datasets demonstrate the advantages of our methods over
existing video generation techniques. Code will be released at

decide on how to allocate public funds to indivisible projects. This paper
focuses on PB processes where citizens may give additional money to projects
they want to see funded. We introduce a formal framework for this kind of PB
with donations. Our framework also allows for diversity constraints, meaning
that each project belongs to one or more types, and there are lower and upper
bounds on the number of projects of the same type that can be funded. We
propose three general classes of methods for aggregating the citizens'
preferences in the presence of donations and analyze their axiomatic

  Stochastic Rounding",,,"10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0343.1",,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivated by recent advances in operational weather forecasting, we study the
efficacy of low-precision arithmetic for climate simulations. We develop a
framework to measure rounding error in a climate model which provides a
stress-test for a low-precision version of the model, and we apply our method
to a variety of models including the Lorenz system; a shallow water
approximation for flow over a ridge; and a coarse resolution global atmospheric
model with simplified parameterisations (SPEEDY). Although double precision (52
significant bits) is standard across operational climate models, in our
experiments we find that single precision (23 sbits) is more than enough and
that as low as half precision (10 sbits) is often sufficient. For example,
SPEEDY can be run with 12 sbits across the entire code with negligible rounding
error and this can be lowered to 10 sbits if very minor errors are accepted,
amounting to less than 0.1 mm/6hr for the average grid-point precipitation, for
example. Our test is based on the Wasserstein metric and this provides
stringent non-parametric bounds on rounding error accounting for annual means
as well as extreme weather events. In addition, by testing models using both
round-to-nearest (RN) and stochastic rounding (SR) we find that SR can mitigate
rounding error across a range of applications. Thus our results also provide
evidence that SR could be relevant to next-generation climate models. While
many studies have shown that low-precision arithmetic can be suitable on
short-term weather forecasting timescales, our results give the first evidence
that a similar low precision level can be suitable for climate.

identify the states that could potentially be interpreted as superposition of
effective spacetimes. These states are unstable and the source of instability
from a microscopic point of view can be related to the absence of a

explore the consequences of these instabilities and argue that they resonate
with Penrose's ideas about the decay that superpositions of states with
sufficiently different gravitational fields associated should experience.

multitenancy, which allows diverse operators sharing the same wireless

of the required radio capacity is needed. Likewise, installing small cells is
an effective resource to provide greater performance and capacity to both
indoor and outdoor places. This paper proposes a new framework for automated
cell planning in multitenant small cell networks. In particular, taking
advantage of the available network data, a set of detailed planning
specifications over time and space domains are generated in order to meet the
contracted capacity by each tenant. Then, the network infrastructure and
configuration are updated according to an algorithm that considers different
actions such as adding/removing channels and adding or relocating small cells.
The simulation results show the effectiveness of various methods to derive the
planning specifications depending on the correlation between the tenant's and
network's traffic demands.

potential, enable law-making, and relieve human suffering. Second, we highlight
current best practices to support the design and implementation of ethics-based
auditing: To be feasible and effective, ethics-based auditing should take the
form of a continuous and constructive process, approach ethical alignment from
a system perspective, and be aligned with public policies and incentives for
ethically desirable behaviour. Third, we identify and discuss the constraints
associated with ethics-based auditing. Only by understanding and accounting for
these constraints can ethics-based auditing facilitate ethical alignment of AI,
while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of

10-fold cross validation on 100 different patient conditions and the proposed

However, the slow hydrogen diffusion kinetics and the deleterious blocking

formation of remarkable self-organized finger patterns extending over tens of

and unidirectionally walk into the hotspot of a plasmonic nanoantenna along a
designated origami track. Successive fluorescence intensity increase and
lifetime reduction are in situ monitored using single-molecule fluorescence

enters the plasmonic hotspot. Our scheme offers a dynamic platform, which can
be used to develop functional materials, investigate intriguing light-matter

management of subsurface energy and environment related activities. The
numerical simulators used for modeling such processes rely on spatial and
temporal discretization of the governing partial-differential equations (PDEs)
into algebraic systems via numerical methods. These simulators usually require
dedicated software development and maintenance, and suffer low efficiency from
a runtime and memory standpoint. Therefore, developing cost-effective,
data-driven models can become a practical choice since deep learning approaches
are considered to be universal approximations. In this paper, we describe a
gradient-based deep neural network (GDNN) constrained by the physics related to
multiphase flow in porous media. We tackle the nonlinearity of flow in porous
media induced by rock heterogeneity, fluid properties and fluid-rock
interactions by decomposing the nonlinear PDEs into a dictionary of elementary
differential operators. We use a combination of operators to handle rock
spatial heterogeneity and fluid flow by advection. Since the augmented
differential operators are inherently related to the physics of fluid flow, we
treat them as first principles prior knowledge to regularize the GDNN training.
We use the example of pressure management at geologic CO2 storage sites, where
CO2 is injected in saline aquifers and brine is produced, and apply GDNN to
construct a predictive model that is trained from physics-based simulation data
and emulates the physics process. We demonstrate that GDNN can effectively
predict the nonlinear patterns of subsurface responses including the
temporal-spatial evolution of the pressure and saturation plumes. GDNN has
great potential to tackle challenging problems that are governed by highly
nonlinear physics and enables development of data-driven models with higher
fidelity.

chiroptical properties vastly outperform those of their molecular counterparts.
We focus on chiral plasmonic nanostructures created using bottom-up approaches,
which not only allow for rational design and fabrication but most intriguingly
in many cases also enable dynamic manipulation and tuning of chiroptical
responses. We first discuss plasmon-induced chirality, resulting from the
interaction of chiral molecules with plasmonic excitations. Subsequently, we
discuss intrinsically chiral colloids, which give rise to optical chirality
owing to their chiral shapes. Finally, we discuss plasmonic chirality, achieved
by arranging achiral plasmonic particles into handed configurations on static
or active templates. Chiral plasmonic nanostructures are very promising
candidates for real-life applications owing to their significantly larger
optical chirality than natural molecules. In addition, chiral plasmonic
nanostructures offer engineerable and dynamic chiroptical responses, which are
formidable to achieve in molecular systems. We thus anticipate that the field
of chiral plasmonics will attract further widespread attention in applications
ranging from enantioselective analysis to chiral sensing, structural
determination, and in situ ultrasensitive detection of multiple disease
biomarkers, as well as optical monitoring of transmembrane transport and

aimed at data partition using the graph information. However, one limitation of
the most of graph-based methods is that they assume the graph structure to
operate is fixed and reliable. And there are inevitably some edges in the graph
that are not conducive to graph clustering, which we call spurious edges. This
paper is the first attempt to employ graph pooling technique for node
clustering and we propose a novel dual graph embedding network (DGEN), which is
designed as a two-step graph encoder connected by a graph pooling layer to
learn the graph embedding. In our model, it is assumed that if a node and its
nearest neighboring node are close to the same clustering center, this node is
an informative node and this edge can be considered as a cluster-friendly edge.
Based on this assumption, the neighbor cluster pooling (NCPool) is devised to
select the most informative subset of nodes and the corresponding edges based
on the distance of nodes and their nearest neighbors to the cluster centers.
This can effectively alleviate the impact of the spurious edges on the
clustering. Finally, to obtain the clustering assignment of all nodes, a
classifier is trained using the clustering results of the selected nodes.
Experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over state-of-the-art algorithms.

of fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images for reducing
training cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training
data samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is
separately constructed as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on
the predictions of state variables from the deep learning model. We use the
example of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the
physics-constrained deep learning model that is trained from physics-based

with a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based simulations, and the

generally accepted to propagate at the speed of light from their sources. To
obtain these fields for a moving charge which are consistent with special
relativity, transformations should be applied to the propagating field in the
charge's rest frame to acquire the propagating field in the charge's primed
inertial frame. These transformations are of its coordinates, and also the
velocity vectors of the field's propagation, which consequently lead to a
change in the field's direction and as a result its strength. Yet, the electric
field propagation velocities are neglected and not currently transformed. This
omission has consequences when it comes to transforming the field from the
source's rest frame to the source's primed frame, as this primed frame's field
would then be inconsistent with the calculated retarded field's directions and
consequently its strengths in this primed frame. Here the retarded field of a
moving point charge will be derived and from this the requirement of the
velocity transforms and the aberrational effects will be shown. Hence, the full
consistent inertial frame transform will be given. This work shows the general

pandemic and prepare for a possible endemic phase. Current prophylactic
vaccines are highly effective to prevent disease but lose their ability to
reduce viral transmission as viral evolution leads to increasing immune escape.
Long term proactive public health policies must therefore complement
vaccination with available nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) aiming to
reduce the viral transmission risk in public spaces. Here, we revisit the
quantitative assessment of airborne transmission risk, considering asymptotic
limits that considerably simplify its expression. We show that the aerosol
transmission risk is the product of three factors: a biological factor that
depends on the viral strain, a hydrodynamical factor defined as the ratio of
concentration in viral particles between inhaled and exhaled air, and a face
mask filtering factor. The short range contribution to the risk, both present
indoors and outdoors, is related to the turbulent dispersion of exhaled
aerosols by air drafts and by convection (indoor), or by the wind (outdoors).
We show experimentally that airborne droplets and CO$_2$ molecules present the
same dispersion. As a consequence, the dilution factor, and therefore the risk,
can be measured quantitatively using the CO$_2$ concentration, regardless of
the room volume, the flow rate of fresh air and the occupancy. We show that the
dispersion cone leads to a concentration in viral particles, and therefore a
short range transmission risk, inversely proportional to the squared distance
to an infected person and to the flow velocity. The aerosolization criterion
derived as an intermediate result, which compares the Stokes relaxation time to
the Lagrangian time scale, may find application for a broad class of
aerosol-borne pathogens and pollutants.
