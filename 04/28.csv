to cyberattacks. To ensure security to the computer systems in an industrial
environment, it is required to build effective intrusion detection systems to
monitor the cyber-physical systems (e.g., computer networks) in the industry
for malicious activities. This paper aims to build such intrusion detection
systems to protect the computer networks from cyberattacks. More specifically,
we propose a novel unsupervised machine learning approach that combines the
K-Means algorithm with the Isolation Forest for anomaly detection in industrial
big data scenarios. Since our objective is to build the intrusion detection
system for the big data scenario in the industrial domain, we utilize the
Apache Spark framework to implement our proposed model which was trained in
large network traffic data (about 123 million instances of network traffic)
stored in Elasticsearch. Moreover, we evaluate our proposed model on the live
streaming data and find that our proposed system can be used for real-time
anomaly detection in the industrial setup. In addition, we address different
challenges that we face while training our model on large datasets and
explicitly describe how these issues were resolved. Based on our empirical
evaluation in different use-cases for anomaly detection in real-world network
traffic data, we observe that our proposed system is effective to detect
anomalies in big data scenarios. Finally, we evaluate our proposed model on
several academic datasets to compare with other models and find that it
provides comparable performance with other state-of-the-art approaches.

could contain evidence of an attack, and the speed at which defensive actions
must be taken, innovations which enable autonomy in cybersecurity must continue
to expand, in order to move away from a reactive defense posture and towards a
more proactive one.
  The challenges in this space are quite different from those associated with
applying AI in other domains such as computer vision. The environment suffers
from an incredibly high degree of uncertainty, stemming from the intractability
of ingesting all the available data, as well as the possibility that malicious
actors are manipulating the data. Another unique challenge in this space is the
dynamism of the adversary causes the indicators of compromise to change
frequently and without warning.
  In spite of these challenges, machine learning has been applied to this
domain and has achieved some success in the realm of detection. While this
aspect of the problem is far from solved, a growing part of the commercial

point in thinking on meaning was Tarski's definition of truth, and the rapid
development of logical semantics and model theory was a consequence of this
achievement. Perhaps less well-known among classical logicians and philosophers
is that it is category theory that provides adequate mathematical tools to
study the relationship between the syntax of formalized theories and their
semantics. The aim of this article is to change this situation and make a
preliminary philosophical analysis of the results obtained so far. They concern
formalized algebraic theories with axioms in the form of equational laws,
theories based on propositional logic and coherent Boolean logic, as well as
decidable logic which is not necessarily Boolean. The syntactic-semantics
relation for these theories takes the form of dualisms between the respective
syntactic and semantic categories. These dualisms are given by the appropriate
adjoint functors. In all the considered cases, the syntax--semantics dualism
corresponds to the algebra-geometry dualism. We analyze the philosophical
significance of these results. They allow us to look at the problem of meaning
in a new light and formulate a criterion distinguishing formal theories from
empirical theories. The disputes that were once fought over Tarski's definition
of truth are transferred to a new context. The polemics as to whether Tarski
actually succeeded in reducing the problem of meaning to purely syntactic terms
has been superseded: between the syntactic and semantic categories there is not
a relation of reducibility but rather that of interaction, and this relation is
given by adjoint functors. We also touch upon other philosophical aspects of
the categorical approach to the problem of meaning.

not based on increasing the number of sources, they could indeed pave the way
to greener and potentially limitless wireless communications. In this paper, we
design, model and demonstrate experimentally a millimeter wave reconfigurable
intelligent surface based on an electronically tunable metasurface with binary
phase modulation. We first study numerically the unit cell of the metasurface,
based on a PIN diode, and obtain a good phase shift and return loss for both
polarizations, over a wide frequency range around 28.5 GHz. We then fabricate
and characterize the unit cell and verify its properties, before fabricating
the whole 10 cm x10 cm reconfigurable intelligent surface. We propose an
analytical description of the use that can be done of the binary phase RIS,
both in the near field (reflectarray configuration) and in the far field
(access point extender). We finally verify experimentally that the designed RIS
works as expected, performing laboratory experiments of millimeter wave
beamforming both in the near field and far field configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency of our binary phase RIS to
control millimeter waves in any kind of scenario and this at the sole cost of
the energy dissipated by the PIN diodes used in our design.

evasion attacks, in which a malware developer manipulates their malicious
software such that it is misclassified as benign. Such software hides some
properties of the real class or adopts some properties of a different class by
applying small perturbations. A special case of evasive malware hides by
repackaging a bonafide benign mobile app to contain malware in addition to the
original functionality of the app, thus retaining most of the benign properties
of the original app. We present a novel malware detection system based on
metamorphic testing principles that can detect such benign-seeming malware
apps. We apply metamorphic testing to the feature representation of the mobile
app rather than to the app itself. That is, the source input is the original
feature vector for the app and the derived input is that vector with selected
features removed. If the app was originally classified benign and is indeed
benign, the output for the source and derived inputs should be the same class,
i.e., benign, but if they differ, then the app is exposed as likely malware.
Malware apps originally classified as malware should retain that classification
since only features prevalent in benign apps are removed. This approach enables
the machine learning model to classify repackaged malware with reasonably few
false negatives and false positives. Our training pipeline is simpler than many
existing ML-based malware detection methods, as the network is trained
end-to-end to learn appropriate features and perform classification. We
pre-trained our classifier model on 3 million apps collected from the
widely-used AndroZoo dataset. We perform an extensive study on other publicly
available datasets to show our approach's effectiveness in detecting repackaged
malware with more than94% accuracy, 0.98 precision, 0.95 recall, and 0.96 F1

of creating oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of electronegative dopants, due to
the capture of the associated electrons by dopant mid-gap states, and the
weakening of Al-O bonds. These oxygen vacancies and vacancy clusters also bind
significantly to the dopant, thereby serving as preferential sites and building
blocks in the formation of conducting paths. We validate this theory
experimentally by implanting multiple dopants over a range of
electronegativities, and find superior repeatability and yield with highly
electronegative metals, Au, Pt and Pd. These devices also exhibit a gradual SET

applications is often performed using ray-tracing codes, which rely on the
geometrical-optics (GO) approximation. However, GO fails at wave cutoffs and
caustics. To accurately model the wave behavior in these regions, more advanced
and computationally expensive ""full-wave"" simulations are typically used, but
this is not strictly necessary. A new generalized formulation called
metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO) has been proposed that reinstates GO near
caustics. The MGO framework yields an integral representation of the wavefield
that must be evaluated numerically in general. We present an algorithm for
computing these integrals using Gauss-Freud quadrature along the
steepest-descent contours. Benchmarking is performed on the standard Airy
problem, for which the exact solution is known analytically. The numerical MGO
solution provided by the new algorithm agrees remarkably well with the exact
solution and significantly improves upon previously derived analytical
approximations of the MGO integral.

over-loaded single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in
frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode, where the base station is equipped
with a dual-polarized uniform planar array (DP-UPA) and serves a large number
of single-antenna users. Due to the absence of uplink-downlink channel
reciprocity and the high-dimensionality of channel matrices, it is extremely
challenging to design downlink precoders using closed-loop channel probing and
feedback with limited spectrum resource. To address these issues, a novel
methodology -- active channel sparsification (ACS) -- has been proposed
recently in the literature for uniform linear array (ULA) to design sparsifying
precoders, which boosts spectral efficiency for multi-user downlink
transmission with substantially reduced channel feedback overhead. Pushing
forward this line of research, we aim to facilitate the potential deployment of
ACS in practical FDD massive MIMO systems, by extending it from ULA to DP-UPA
with explicit user selection and making the current ACS implementation
simplified. To this end, by leveraging Toeplitz structure of channel covariance
matrices, we extend the original ACS using scale-weight bipartite graph
representation to the matrix-weight counterpart. Building upon this, we propose
a multi-dimensional ACS (MD-ACS) method, which is a generalization of original
ACS formulation and is more suitable for DP-UPA antenna configurations. The
nonlinear integer program formulation of MD-ACS can be classified as a
generalized multi-assignment problem (GMAP), for which we propose a simple yet
efficient greedy algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the
performance improvement of the proposed MD-ACS with greedy algorithm over the
state-of-the-art methods based on the QuaDRiGa channel models.

datasets, i.e., data that may contain incorrect/corrupted input-output

process to synthesize programs which optimize the tradeoff between the loss
over the noisy dataset and the complexity of the synthesized program. The
algorithm uses abstractions to divide the search space of programs into
subspaces by computing an abstract value that represents outputs for all
programs in a subspace. The abstract value allows our algorithm to compute, for
each subspace, a sound approximate lower bound of the loss over all programs in
the subspace. It iteratively refines these abstractions to further subdivide
the space into smaller subspaces, prune subspaces that do not contain an
optimal program, and eventually synthesize an optimal program.
  We implemented this algorithm in a tool called Rose. We compare Rose to a
current state-of-the-art noisy program synthesis system using the SyGuS 2018
benchmark suite. Our evaluation demonstrates that Rose significantly
outperforms this previous system: on two noisy benchmark program synthesis
problems sets drawn from the SyGus 2018 benchmark suite, Rose delivers speedups
of up to 1587 and 81.7, with median speedups of 20.5 and 81.7. Rose also
terminates on 20 (out of 54) and 4 (out of 11) more benchmark problems than the

optimal over the provided noisy data sets. For the majority of the problems in
the benchmark sets ($272$ out of $286$), the synthesized programs also produce
correct outputs for all inputs in the original (unseen) noise-free data set.

equations, natural convection in a porous medium is uniquely determined by the
Rayleigh number. However, in contrast with experiments, DOB simulations yield a
linear scaling of the Sherwood number with the Rayleigh number (Ra) for high

fully resolving the flow field within the pores. We show that the boundary

Vehicles (AUVs) are investigated and analyzed under the influence of rotating
flow fields, that were generated in a recirculating water tank via a rotating
propeller. Initially, experiments were carried out for the measurement of flow
field variables and Quantities of Interest across the AUV in the presence of
the rotating propeller while varying the rotational speed and the extent of
rotational flow strength. The flow field across the AUV was measured using an
Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). These measured turbulent flow statistics
were used to validate the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) based numerical
predictions in a commercial CFD solver. After preliminary validation of the
turbulent flow statistics with the numerical predictions, a series of numerical
simulations were performed to investigate the effect of the rotational flow
field of the propeller on the drag, skin friction and pressure coefficients of
the AUV. The operating speed and location of the propeller were also varied to
check their affects on the hydrodynamic performance of AUV. The results
provided in this article will be useful for the design optimization of AUVs
cruising in shallow water where the flow is highly rotational because of
wave-current interactions. Additionally the results and analysis are relevant
to study the design and operation of AUVs that have to operate in a group of
unmanned underwater vehicles or near submarines and ships where the flow field
is highly complex and such rotational effects are present.

is theoretically studied for a thin superconducting strip of a rectangular
cross section, taking an interplay between the Bean-Livingston and the
geometric barriers in the sample into account. It is assumed that bulk vortex
pinning is negligible, and the London penetration depth $\lambda$ is
essentially less than the thickness $d$ of the strip. To investigate the effect
of these barriers on $I_c$ rigorously, a two-dimensional distribution of the
current over the cross section of the sample is derived, using the approach
based on the methods of conformal mappings. With this distribution, the
dependence $I_c(H_a)$ is calculated for the fields $H_a$ not exceeding the
lower critical field. This calculation reveals that the following two
situations are possible: i) The critical current $I_c(H_a)$ is determined by
the Bean-Livingston barrier in the corners of the strip. ii) The geometrical
barrier prevails at low $H_a$, but with increasing magnetic field, the
Bean-Livingston barrier begins to dominate. The realization of one or the other
of these two situations is determined by the ratio $\lambda/d$.

video of a spoken utterance. Previous approaches to this task have relied on a
two-step process where an intermediate representation is inferred from the
video, and is then decoded into waveform audio using a vocoder or a waveform
reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we propose a new end-to-end
video-to-speech model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which
translates spoken video to waveform end-to-end without using any intermediate
representation or separate waveform synthesis algorithm. Our model consists of
an encoder-decoder architecture that receives raw video as input and generates
speech, which is then fed to a waveform critic and a power critic. The use of
an adversarial loss based on these two critics enables the direct synthesis of
raw audio waveform and ensures its realism. In addition, the use of our three
comparative losses helps establish direct correspondence between the generated
audio and the input video. We show that this model is able to reconstruct
speech with remarkable realism for constrained datasets such as GRID, and that
it is the first end-to-end model to produce intelligible speech for LRW (Lip
Reading in the Wild), featuring hundreds of speakers recorded entirely `in the
wild'. We evaluate the generated samples in two different scenarios -- seen and
unseen speakers -- using four objective metrics which measure the quality and
intelligibility of artificial speech. We demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms all previous works in most metrics on GRID and LRW.

forces are derived from the point of view of large deviation theory. For a
given set of macroscopic variables, we consider the short-time evolution of
near-equilibrium fluctuations, represented as the limit of finite-size
conditional expectations. The resulting asymptotic conditional expectation is
taken to represent the typical macrostate of the system and is used in place of
the usual time-averaged macrostate of traditional approaches. By expanding in
the short-time, near-equilibrium limit and equating the large deviation rate
function with the thermodynamic entropy, a linear relation is obtained between
the time rate of change of the macrostate and the conjugate initial macrostate.
A Green-Kubo formula for the Onsager matrix is derived and shown to be positive
semi-definite, while the Onsager reciprocity relations readily follow from time
reversal invariance. Although the initial tendency of a macroscopic variable is
to evolve towards equilibrium, we find that this evolution need not be
monotonic. The example of an ideal Knundsen gas is considered as an
illustration.

optical conductivity. The unique feature of such polaron is the interplay
between long- and short wavelength acoustic vibrations creating a composite
phonon cloud and leading to persistent self-trapping due to the existence of
multiple quasi-stable states. This results in a spectral response whose

subject of active research for decades. In recent years, the use of deep
learning in audio signal processing has allowed to drastically improve
performances for machine hearing. This has motivated the scientific community
to also develop machine learning strategies for source localization
applications. In this paper, we present BeamLearning, a multi-resolution deep
learning approach that allows to encode relevant information contained in
unprocessed time domain acoustic signals captured by microphone arrays. The use
of raw data aims at avoiding simplifying hypothesis that most traditional
model-based localization methods rely on. Benefits of its use are shown for
realtime sound source 2D-localization tasks in reverberating and noisy
environments. Since supervised machine learning approaches require large-sized,
physically realistic, precisely labelled datasets, we also developed a fast
GPU-based computation of room impulse responses using fractional delays for
image source models. A thorough analysis of the network representation and
extensive performance tests are carried out using the BeamLearning network with
synthetic and experimental datasets. Obtained results demonstrate that the
BeamLearning approach significantly outperforms the wideband MUSIC and SRP-PHAT
methods in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency in

into the minimum number of bins such that for each bin $B$, we have
$\left\|\sum_{v\in B}v\right\|_\infty\leq 1$. Woeginger [Woe97] claimed that
the problem has no APTAS for dimensions greater than or equal to 2. We note
that there was a slight oversight in the original proof. Hence, we give a
revised proof using some additional ideas from [BCKS06, CC09]. In fact, we show
that it is NP-hard to get an asymptotic approximation ratio better than
$\frac{600}{599}$, for $d=2$.
  An instance of vector bin packing is called $\delta$-skewed if every item has
at most one dimension greater than $\delta$. As a natural extension of our
general $d$-dimensional vector bin packing result we show that for $\epsilon\in
(0,\frac{1}{2500})$ it is NP-hard to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for
$\delta$-skewed vector bin packing if $\delta>20\sqrt \epsilon$.
  In the vector bin covering problem given a set of $d$-dimensional vectors
from $(0,1]^d$, the aim is to obtain a family of disjoint subsets (called bins)
with the maximum cardinality such that for each bin $B$, we have $\sum_{v\in
B}v\geq \mathbf 1$. Using ideas similar to our vector bin packing result, we
show that for vector bin covering there is no APTAS for dimensions greater than
or equal to 2. In fact, we show that it is NP-hard to get an asymptotic
approximation ratio better than $\frac{998}{997}$.

to domain gaps. In contrast to previous fully supervised approaches, in this

Network (GAN) inversion to shape completion for the first time. ShapeInversion
uses a GAN pre-trained on complete shapes by searching for a latent code that
gives a complete shape that best reconstructs the given partial input. In this
way, ShapeInversion no longer needs paired training data, and is capable of
incorporating the rich prior captured in a well-trained generative model. On
the ShapeNet benchmark, the proposed ShapeInversion outperforms the SOTA
unsupervised method, and is comparable with supervised methods that are learned
using paired data. It also demonstrates remarkable generalization ability,
giving robust results for real-world scans and partial inputs of various forms

series of additional abilities thanks to the involvement of a pre-trained GAN,
such as producing multiple valid complete shapes for an ambiguous partial

in information? The very existence of the special sciences above and beyond
physics seems to hint no. Previous research has shown that dimension reduction
(macroscales) can increase the dependency between elements of a system (a
phenomenon called ""causal emergence""). However, this has been shown only for
specific measures like effective information or integrated information. Here,
we provide an umbrella mathematical framework for emergence based on
information conversion. Specifically, we show evidence that a macroscale can
have more of a certain type of information than its underlying microscale. This
is because macroscales can convert information from one type to another. In
such cases, reduction to a microscale means the loss of this type of
information. We demonstrate this using the well-understood mutual information
measure applied to Boolean networks. By using the partial information
decomposition, the mutual information can be decomposed into redundant, unique,
and synergistic information atoms. Then by introducing a novel measure of the
synergy bias of a given decomposition, we are able to show that the synergy
component of a Boolean network's mutual information can increase at
macroscales. This can occur even when there is no difference in the total
mutual information between a macroscale and its underlying microscale, proving
information conversion. We relate this broad framework to previous work,
compare it to other theories, and argue it complexifies any notion of universal
reduction in the sciences, since such reduction would likely lead to a loss of
synergistic information in scientific models.

multiple attributes that underlie classifier decisions. A natural source for
such attributes is the StyleSpace of StyleGAN, which is known to generate
semantically meaningful dimensions in the image. However, because standard GAN
training is not dependent on the classifier, it may not represent these
attributes which are important for the classifier decision, and the dimensions
of StyleSpace may represent irrelevant attributes. To overcome this, we propose
a training procedure for a StyleGAN, which incorporates the classifier model,
in order to learn a classifier-specific StyleSpace. Explanatory attributes are
then selected from this space. These can be used to visualize the effect of
changing multiple attributes per image, thus providing image-specific

a stochastic coordinate proximal gradient method which takes into account the

scalability by constructing at each iteration a local approximation model of

described by conformal field theory, analogous to short-range-interacting
hybrid circuits. However, beyond a critical power-law, we demonstrate that
long-range interactions give rise to a continuum of non-conformal universality
classes, with continuously varying critical exponents. We numerically determine
the phase diagram for a one-dimensional, long-range-interacting hybrid circuit
model as a function of the power-law exponent and the measurement rate.

from real space to redshift (velocity) space, with an extended construction of

modelling to constrain the galaxy-halo connection to see whether there is any

for early- and late-forming central galaxies, corroborated by lensing

characterise the mutual relaxation between central galaxies and their host

generic case of negative-curvature compactifications of M-theory, with minimal
ingredients. M-theory on a hyperbolic manifold with small closed geodesics
supporting Casimir energy -- along with a single classical source (7-form flux)
-- contains an immediate 3-term structure for volume stabilization at positive
potential energy. Hyperbolic manifolds are well-studied mathematically, with an
important rigidity property at fixed volume. They and their Dehn fillings to
more general Einstein spaces exhibit explicit discrete parameters that yield
small closed geodesics supporting Casimir energy. The off-shell effective
potential derived by M. Douglas incorporates the warped product structure via
the constraints of general relativity, screening negative energy. Analyzing the
fields sourced by the localized Casimir energy and the available discrete
choices of manifolds and fluxes, we find a regime where the net curvature,
Casimir energy, and flux compete at large radius and stabilize the volume.
Further metric and form field deformations are highly constrained by hyperbolic
rigidity and warping effects, leading to calculations giving strong indications
of a positive Hessian, and residual tadpoles are small. We test this via
explicit back reacted solutions and perturbations in patches including the Dehn
filling regions, initiate a neural network study of further aspects of the
internal fields, and derive a Maldacena-Nunez style no-go theorem for Anti-de
Sitter extrema. A simple generalization incorporating 4-form flux produces
axion monodromy inflation. As a relatively simple de Sitter uplift of the
large-N M2-brane theory, the construction applies to de Sitter holography as
well as to cosmological modeling, and introduces new connections between
mathematics and the physics of string/M theory compactifications.

magnetization, susceptibility and transport measurements that are seen well
below the Curie temperature, leading to speculation that a ""hidden"" phase
coexists with ferromagnetism. Here we report spatially-resolved measurements by
Kerr effect microscopy that identify this phase. We find that the anomalies
coincide with a deep minimum in domain wall (DW) mobility, indicating a
crossover between two regimes of DW propagation. We demonstrate that this
crossover is a manifestation of a 2D phase transition that occurs within the
DW, in which the magnetization texture changes from continuous rotation to
unidirectional variation. We propose that the existence of this 2D transition
deep within the ferromagnetic state of the bulk is a consequence of a giant
quality factor for magnetocrystalline anisotropy unique to this compound. This
work broadens the horizon of the conventional binary classification of DWs into

the North Ecliptic Pole and has both broadband (grizY) and narrowband (NB816

ULLAEs. The remaining sources are an AGN at z=5.7, an [OIII]5007 emitter at
z=0.63, a red star, and two spectroscopic non-detections. Using the 9 confirmed

incompleteness correction, we compare our new z=5.7 LF with our recent z=6.6 LF

radiation recurring every few hours and originating near the central
supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. It is currently unknown what
triggers these events, how long they last and how they are connected to the
physical properties of the inner accretion flows. Previously, only two such
sources were known, found either serendipitously or in archival data, with
emission lines in their optical spectra classifying their nuclei as hosting an
actively accreting supermassive black hole. Here we present the detection of
QPEs in two further galaxies, obtained with a blind and systematic search over
half of the X-ray sky. The optical spectra of these galaxies show no signature
of black hole activity, indicating that a pre-existing accretion flow typical
of active nuclei is not required to trigger these events. Indeed, the periods,
amplitudes and profiles of the newly discovered QPEs are inconsistent with
current models that invoke radiation-pressure driven accretion disk
instabilities. Instead, QPEs might be driven by an orbiting compact object.
Furthermore, their observed properties require the mass of the secondary object
to be much smaller than the main body and future X-ray observations may
constrain possible changes in the period due to orbital evolution. This
scenario could make QPEs a viable candidate for the electromagnetic
counterparts of the so-called extreme mass ratio inspirals, with considerable
implications for multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology.

explain the properties of galaxies that entered the cluster recently and the
nature of the last significant merger that the cluster underwent. Confirming
these scenarios requires extremely faithful numerical counterparts of the

This cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, with feedback from supernovae and
active galactic nuclei, with a ~3x10^7Msun dark matter particle mass and a
minimum cell size of 350pc in the zoom region, reproduces Virgo within its
large scale environment unlike a random cluster simulation. Overall the
distribution of the simulated galaxy population matches the observed one
including M87. The simulated cluster formation reveals exquisite agreements
with observationally-driven scenarios: within the last Gigayear, about 300
small galaxies (M*>10^7Msun) entered the cluster, most of them within the last
500Myr. The last significant merger event occurred about 2 Gigayears ago: a
group with a tenth of the mass of today's cluster entered from the far side as
viewed from the Milky Way. This excellent numerical replica of Virgo will

elastic photon-initiated (PI) production at the LHC, both in $pp$ and heavy ion
collisions. We first demonstrate that the source of difference between our
predictions and other results in the literature for PI muon pair production is
dominantly due to an unphysical cut that is imposed in these latter results on
the dimuon-hadron impact parameter. We in addition show that this is
experimentally disfavoured by the shape of the muon kinematic distributions
measured by ATLAS in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions. We then consider the
theoretical uncertainty due to the survival probability for no additional
hadron-hadron interactions, and in particular the role this may play in the
tendency for the predicted cross sections to lie somewhat above ATLAS data on
PI muon pair production, in both $pp$ and PbPb collisions. This difference is
relatively mild, at the $\sim 10\%$ level, and hence a very good control over
the theory is clearly required. We show that this uncertainty is very small,
and it is only by taking very extreme and rather unphysical variations in the
modelling of the survival factor that this tension can be removed. This
underlines the basic, rather model independent, point that a significant
fraction of elastic PI scattering occurs for hadron-hadron impact parameters
that are simply outside the range of QCD interactions, and hence this sets a
lower bound on the survival factor in any physically reasonable approach.
Finally, other possible origins for this discrepancy are discussed.

instance, the paradigmatic quantum Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain falls at low
temperature within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid framework, while its
high-temperature dynamics is superdiffusive and relates to the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in $1+1$ dimensions. This Letter aims at
reconciling the two regimes. Building on large-scale matrix product state
simulations, we find that they are connected by a temperature-dependent
spatiotemporal crossover. As the temperature $T$ is reduced, we show that the
onset of superdiffusion takes place at longer length and timescales $\propto
1/T$. This prediction has direct consequences for experiments including nuclear
magnetic resonance: it is consistent with earlier measurements on the nearly

Here, we show how density-assisted tunneling can be tailored in view of
simulating the effects of strain in synthetic graphene-type systems.
Specifically, we consider a mixture of two atomic species on a honeycomb
optical lattice: one species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate in an anisotropic
harmonic trap, whose inhomogeneous density profile induces an effective
uniaxial strain for the second species through density-assisted tunneling
processes. In direct analogy with strained graphene, the second species

because of the Fermi-Dirac filling effect. Here, we theoretically analyze and
experimentally confirm a novel class of multi-gap topological phases, which we

These unprecedented forms of matter depend on the notion of Euler class and
frame charges which arise due to non-Abelian charge conversion processes when
band nodes of different gaps are braided along each other in momentum space. We
identify such exotic phenomena in acoustic metamaterials and uncover a rich
topological phase diagram induced by the creation, braiding and recombination
of band nodes. Using pump-probe measurements, we verify the non-Abelian charge
conversion processes where topological charges of nodes are transferred from
one gap to another. Moreover, in such processes, we discover symmetry-enforced
intermediate phases featuring triply-degenerate band nodes with unique
dispersions that are directly linked to the multi-gap topological invariants.
Furthermore, we confirm that edge states can faithfully characterize the
multi-gap topological phase diagram. Our study unveils a new regime of

backpropagation algorithm, spiking neural networks are still mostly applied to
tasks stemming from sensory processing, operating on traditional data
structures like visual or auditory data. A rich data representation that finds
wide application in industry and research is the so-called knowledge graph - a
graph-based structure where entities are depicted as nodes and relations
between them as edges. Complex systems like molecules, social networks and
industrial factory systems can be described using the common language of
knowledge graphs, allowing the usage of graph embedding algorithms to make
context-aware predictions in these information-packed environments. We propose
a spike-based algorithm where nodes in a graph are represented by single spike
times of neuron populations and relations as spike time differences between
populations. Learning such spike-based embeddings only requires knowledge about
spike times and spike time differences, compatible with recently proposed
frameworks for training spiking neural networks. The presented model is easily
mapped to current neuromorphic hardware systems and thereby moves inference on
knowledge graphs into a domain where these architectures thrive, unlocking a
promising industrial application area for this technology.

action and carry out simulations that include in the sea two light
mass-degenerate quarks, as well as the strange and charm quarks. In the
analysis we use gauge ensembles simulated at three values of the lattice
spacing and with light quarks that correspond to pion masses in the range from
350 MeV to the physical value, while the strange and charm quark masses are
tuned approximately to their physical values. We use several quantities to set
the scale in order to check for finite lattice spacing effects and in the
continuum limit we get compatible results. The quark mass renormalization is
carried out non-perturbatively using the RI'-MOM method converted into the
$\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme. For the determination of the quark masses we use
physical observables from both the meson and the baryon sectors, obtaining
$m_{ud} = 3.636(66)(^{+60}_{-57})$~MeV and $m_s =
98.7(2.4)(^{+4.0}_{-3.2})$~MeV in the $\overline{\rm MS}(2\,{\rm GeV})$ scheme

during their life. Populations of massive stars older than ~20 Myr allow us to
probe the outcome of such interactions after many systems have experienced mass
and angular momentum transfer. Using multi-epoch integral-field spectroscopy,
we investigate the multiplicity properties of the massive-star population in
NGC 330 (~40 Myr) in the Small Magellanic Cloud to search for imprints of
stellar evolution on the multiplicity properties. From six epochs of VLT/MUSE
observations supported by adaptive optics we extract spectra and measure radial
velocities for stars brighter than F814W = 19. We identify single-lined
spectroscopic binaries through significant RV variability as well as
double-lined spectroscopic binaries, and quantify the observational biases for
binary detection. The observed spectroscopic binary fraction is 13.2+/-2.0 %.
Considering period and mass ratio ranges from log(P)=0.15-3.5, and q = 0.1-1.0,
and a representative set of orbital parameter distributions, we find a
bias-corrected close binary fraction of 34 +8 -7 %. This seems to decline for
the fainter stars, which indicates either that the close binary fraction drops
in the B-type domain, or that the period distribution becomes more heavily
weighted towards longer orbital periods. Both fractions vary strongly in
different regions of the color-magnitude diagram which probably reveals the
imprint of the binary history of different groups of stars. We provide the
first homogeneous RV study of a large sample of B-type stars at a low
metallicity. The overall bias-corrected close binary fraction of B stars in NGC
330 is lower than the one reported for younger Galactic and LMC clusters. More
data are needed to establish whether this result from an age or a metallicty

to our understanding of the chemical trail of water during the star and planet

water and, in particular, determine whether the D/H ratio is inherited from the
molecular cloud or established locally. We seek to determine the D$_2$O column
density and derive the D$_2$O/HDO ratios in the warm region toward the low-mass
Class 0 sources B335 and L483. The results are compared with astrochemical
models and previous observations to determine their implications for the
chemical evolution of water. We present ALMA observations of the D$_2$O
transition at 316.8 GHz toward B335 and L483 at $<$0.5"" ($<$ 100 au)
resolution, probing the inner warm envelope gas. The column densities of
D$_2$O, HDO, and H$_{2}^{18}$O are determined by synthetic spectrum modeling
and direct Gaussian fitting, under the assumption of a single excitation
temperature and similar spatial extent for the three water isotopologs. D$_2$O
is detected toward both sources in the inner warm envelope. The derived
D$_2$O/HDO ratios is $(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{-2}$ for L483 and
$(1.4\pm0.1)\times10^{-2}$ for B335. The high D$_2$O/HDO ratios are a strong
indication of chemical inheritance of water from the prestellar phase down to
the inner warm envelope. This implies that the local cloud conditions in the
prestellar phase, such as temperatures and timescales, determine the water
chemistry at later stages and could provide a source of chemical
differentiation in young systems. In addition, the observed D$_2$O/H$_2$O
ratios support an observed dichotomy in the deuterium fractionation of water
toward isolated and clustered protostars, namely, a higher D/H ratio toward
isolated sources

intertwined in time and space, like in the case of traffic signals. Defining
signals on graphs relaxes such complexities by representing the evolution of
signals over a space using relevant graph kernels such as the heat diffusion
kernel. However, this kernel alone does not fully capture the actual dynamics
of the data as it only relies on the graph structure. The gap can be filled by
combining the graph kernel representation with data-driven models that utilize
historical data. This paper proposes a traffic propagation model that merges
multiple heat diffusion kernels into a data-driven prediction model to forecast
traffic signals. We optimize the model parameters using Bayesian inference to
minimize the prediction errors and, consequently, determine the mixing ratio of
the two approaches. Such mixing ratio strongly depends on training data size
and data anomalies, which typically correspond to the peak hours for traffic
data. The proposed model demonstrates prediction accuracy comparable to that of
the state-of-the-art deep neural networks with lower computational effort. It
notably achieves excellent performance for long-term prediction through the

where a server aggregates a global model from many client-trained models while
having no access to the client data. Although it is recognized that statistical
heterogeneity of the client local data yields slower global model convergence,
it is less commonly recognized that it also yields a biased federated global
model with a high variance of accuracy across clients. In this work, we aim to
provide federated learning schemes with improved fairness. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a novel federated learning system that employs zero-shot
data augmentation on under-represented data to mitigate statistical
heterogeneity and encourage more uniform accuracy performance across clients in
federated networks. We study two variants of this scheme, Fed-ZDAC (federated
learning with zero-shot data augmentation at the clients) and Fed-ZDAS
(federated learning with zero-shot data augmentation at the server). Empirical
results on a suite of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on
simultaneously improving the test accuracy and fairness.

affect the interactions between the beam and RF system. In this paper we
further explore this topic to study how filling patterns affect the beam

use the Jacobian of the inverse-mapping function to guide the search in the

evaluate our contributions on four continuous-control tasks in simulated

correlated events mimicking the IBD coincidence signature remain a potentially

96 % while reducing the residual NC background to 2 % of the original rate.
Comparing to recent predictions of the DSNB signal and measurements of the NC

The North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field provides a unique set of

Selection of AGN candidates is often based on mid-infrared (MIR) measurements.
Such method, despite its effectiveness, strongly reduces a catalog volume due
to the MIR detection condition. Modern machine learning techniques can solve
this problem by finding similar selection criteria using only optical and
near-infrared (NIR) data. Aims. Aims of this work were to create a reliable AGN
candidates catalog from the NEP field using a combination of optical SUBARU/HSC
and NIR AKARI/IRC data and, consequently, to develop an efficient alternative
for the MIR-based AKARI/IRC selection technique. Methods. A set of supervised
machine learning algorithms was tested in order to perform an efficient AGN
selection. Best of the models were formed into a majority voting scheme, which
used the most popular classification result to produce the final AGN catalog.
Additional analysis of catalog properties was performed in form of the spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting via the CIGALE software. Results. The
obtained catalog of 465 AGN candidates (out of 33 119 objects) is characterized
by 73% purity and 64% completeness. This new classification shows consistency
with the MIR-based selection. Moreover, 76% of the obtained catalog can be

One problem faced when evaluating filtering algorithms is that real image data

is taking advantage of GL. Objective: This research aimed to understand how SE
researchers use GL in their secondary studies. Method: We conducted a tertiary
study of studies published between 2011 and 2018 in high-quality software
engineering conferences and journals. We then applied qualitative and
quantitative analysis to investigate 446 potential studies. Results: From the
446 selected studies, 126 studies cited GL but only 95 of those used GL to
answer a specific research question representing almost 21% of all the 446
secondary studies. Interestingly, we identified that few studies employed
specific search mechanisms and used additional criteria for assessing GL.
Moreover, by the time we conducted this research, 49% of the GL URLs are not
working anymore. Based on our findings, we discuss some challenges in using GL
and potential mitigation plans. Conclusion: In this paper, we summarized the
last 10 years of software engineering research that uses GL, showing that GL
has been essential for bringing practical new perspectives that are scarce in
traditional literature. By drawing the current landscape of use, we also raise
some awareness of related challenges (and strategies to deal with them).

high-dimensional functions using tree tensor networks in a least-squares
setting. Given a dimension tree or architecture of the tensor network, we
provide an algorithm that generates a sequence of nested tensor subspaces based
on a generalization of principal component analysis for multivariate functions.
An optimal least-squares method is used for computing projections onto the
generated tensor subspaces, using samples generated from a distribution
depending on the previously generated subspaces. We provide an error bound in
expectation for the obtained approximation. Practical strategies are proposed
for adapting the feature spaces and ranks to achieve a prescribed error. Also,
we propose an algorithm that progressively constructs the dimension tree by
suitable pairings of variables, that allows to further reduce the number of
samples necessary to reach that error. Numerical examples illustrate the
performance of the proposed algorithms and show that stable approximations are
obtained with a number of samples close to the number of free parameters of the
estimated tensor networks.

is based on the trajectories followed by the vehicles. Trajectory information
is provided by vehicle detection and tracking algorithms on visual data
streamed from a fisheye camera. Deep learning algorithms are used for vehicle
detection, and Kalman Filter is used for tracking. To observe the trajectories
more accurately, the detected vehicle coordinates are transferred to the bird's
eye view coordinates using the lens distortion model prediction algorithm. The
system determines whether there is an abnormality in trajectories by comparing
historical trajectory data and instantaneous incoming data. The proposed system

abnormality detection on synthetic data. The system also works with a 97.3%

show that two basic mechanisms - displacement and replacement of elements -

outages is a challenging task because of the combinatorial nature of the
problem. Traditional approaches for security assessment are often limited by
their scope and/or speed, resulting in missing of critical contingencies that
could lead to cascading failures. This paper proposes a two-component
methodology to enhance power system security. The first component combines an
efficient algorithm to detect cut-set saturation (called the feasibility test
(FT) algorithm) with real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) to create an
integrated corrective action (iCA), whose goal is to secure the system against
cut-set saturation as well as critical branch overloads. The second component
only employs the results of the FT to create a relaxed corrective action (rCA)
to secure the system against post-contingency cut-set saturation. The first
component is more comprehensive, but the latter is computationally more
efficient. The effectiveness of the two components is evaluated based upon the
number of cascade triggering contingencies alleviated, and the computation
time. The results obtained by analyzing different case-studies on the IEEE
118-bus and 2000-bus synthetic Texas systems indicate that the proposed
two-component methodology successfully enhances the scope and speed of power

Cortana, enable users to interact with search systems in multiple rounds
through natural language dialogues. Evaluating such systems is very challenging
given that any natural language responses could be generated, and users
commonly interact for multiple semantically coherent rounds to accomplish a
search task. Although prior studies proposed many evaluation metrics, the
extent of how those measures effectively capture user preference remains to be
investigated. In this paper, we systematically meta-evaluate a variety of
conversational search metrics. We specifically study three perspectives on
those metrics: (1) reliability: the ability to detect ""actual"" performance
differences as opposed to those observed by chance; (2) fidelity: the ability
to agree with ultimate user preference; and (3) intuitiveness: the ability to
capture any property deemed important: adequacy, informativeness, and fluency
in the context of conversational search. By conducting experiments on two test
collections, we find that the performance of different metrics varies
significantly across different scenarios whereas consistent with prior studies,
existing metrics only achieve a weak correlation with ultimate user preference
and satisfaction. METEOR is, comparatively speaking, the best existing
single-turn metric considering all three perspectives. We also demonstrate that
adapted session-based evaluation metrics can be used to measure multi-turn
conversational search, achieving moderate concordance with user satisfaction.
To our knowledge, our work establishes the most comprehensive meta-evaluation
for conversational search to date.

popular recently as it allows capturing a wide range of daily activities in
unconstrained environments, which is difficult for traditional outside-in
motion capture with external cameras. However, existing methods have several
limitations. A prominent problem is that the estimated poses lie in the local
coordinate system of the fisheye camera, rather than in the world coordinate
system, which is restrictive for many applications. Furthermore, these methods
suffer from limited accuracy and temporal instability due to ambiguities caused
by the monocular setup and the severe occlusion in a strongly distorted
egocentric perspective. To tackle these limitations, we present a new method
for egocentric global 3D body pose estimation using a single head-mounted
fisheye camera. To achieve accurate and temporally stable global poses, a
spatio-temporal optimization is performed over a sequence of frames by
minimizing heatmap reprojection errors and enforcing local and global body
motion priors learned from a mocap dataset. Experimental results show that our

In this paper we discuss the legitimacy of carrying out joint analyses with the

tension estimator to perform a quantitative analysis of the physical
consistency between the latest data of Cosmic Microwave Background, type Ia

the flat and non-flat cases of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and of two dark

between these data sets are significant enough to make the results of their

supports answering many navigational queries on the compressed representation

apply hypersuccinct trees to obtain a universal compressed data structure for
range-minimum queries. It has constant query time and the optimal worst-case
space usage of $2n+o(n)$ bits, but the space drops to $1.736n + o(n)$ bits on
average for random permutations of $n$ elements, and $2\lg\binom nr + o(n)$ for

tailor our data structure to specific applications; hypersuccinct trees
automatically adapt to the trees at hand. We show that they simultaneously
achieve the optimal space usage to within lower order terms for a wide range of

the high energy costs associated with training and running deep neural networks

an alternative physical platform for deep learning, as it has been
theoretically predicted that they can fundamentally achieve higher energy

Here, we experimentally demonstrate an optical neural network achieving 99%
accuracy on handwritten-digit classification using ~3.2 detected photons per
weight multiplication and ~90% accuracy using ~0.64 photons (~$2.4 \times

achieved using a custom free-space optical processor that executes
matrix-vector multiplications in a massively parallel fashion, with up to ~0.5
million scalar (weight) multiplications performed at the same time. Using
commercially available optical components and standard neural-network training
methods, we demonstrated that optical neural networks can operate near the
standard quantum limit with extremely low optical powers and still achieve high
accuracy. Our results provide a proof-of-principle for low-optical-power
operation, and with careful system design including the surrounding electronics
used for data storage and control, open up a path to realizing optical

We create a machine learning model containing two variables, $\chi_D$, and

$1.0 - P_j$, where $P_j$ is the probability, the electron being in the targeted

Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) model, and it is then applied to a more complex
system with an additional intermediate state. In this trimer configuration, the
PIML approach discovers desired resonant paths from the donor to acceptor
units. The proposed PIML method is general and may be used in the chemical

segments of 5 ksecs, and fitting the SXT and LAXPC spectra for each segment.
Synchrotron emission of a broken power-law particle density model provided a
better fit than the log-parabola one. The X-ray flux and the normalised
particle density at an energy less than the break one, were found to
anti-correlate with the index before the break. However, a stronger correlation
between the density and index was obtained when a delay of $\sim 60$ ksec was
introduced. The amplitude of the normalised particle density variation $|\Delta

$\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.5$. We model the amplitudes and the time delay in a
scenario where the particle acceleration time-scale varies on a time-scale

machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many
high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such
as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with
appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is
built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of
representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical,
features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and
second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented
as backpropagation.
  While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation
problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential
pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and
structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these
regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied
throughout a wide spectrum of applications.
  Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's
Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common
mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network
architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand,
it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into
neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures

problem is reformulated as the optimization problem of finding band-limited
shape and impedance functions which minimize the $L^2$ distance between the
computed value of the scattered field at the receivers and the data. The
optimization problem is non-linear, non-convex, and ill-posed. Moreover, the
objective function is computationally expensive to evaluate. The recursive
linearization approach (RLA) proposed by Chen has been successful in addressing
these issues in the context of recovering the sound speed of a domain or the
shape of a sound-soft obstacle. We present an extension of the RLA for the
recovery of both the shape and impedance functions. The RLA is a continuation
method in frequency where a sequence of single frequency inverse problems is
solved. At each higher frequency, one attempts to recover incrementally higher
resolution features using a step assumed to be small enough to ensure that the
initial guess obtained at the preceding frequency lies in the basin of
attraction for Newton's method at the new frequency. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method with several numerical examples. Surprisingly, we
find that one can recover the shape with high accuracy even when the
measurements are from sound-hard or sound-soft objects. While the method is
effective in obtaining high quality reconstructions for complicated geometries

imposed great pressure on mobile/wireless network infrastructures. To ease
congestion in the network and to increase perceived user experience, caching of
popular content closer to the end-users can play a significant role and as such
this issue has received significant attention over the last few years.
Additionally, energy efficiency is treated as a fundamental requirement in the
design of next-generation mobile networks. However, there has been little
attention to the overlapping area between energy efficiency and network caching
especially when considering multipath routing. To this end, this paper proposes
an energy-efficient caching with multipath routing support. The proposed scheme
provides a joint anchoring of popular content into a set of potential caching
nodes with optimized multipath support whilst ensuring a balance between
transmission and caching energy cost. The proposed model also considers
different content delivery modes, such as multicast and unicast. Two separated
Integer-Linear Programming (ILP) models are formulated for each delivery mode.
To tackle the curse of dimensionality we then provide a greedy simulated
annealing algorithm, which not only reduces the time complexity but also
provides a competitive performance. A wide set of numerical investigations
reveal that the proposed scheme reduces the energy consumption up to 80%
compared with other widely used caching approaches under the premise of network
resource limitation. Sensitivity analysis to different parameters is also

a probability distribution (PD)-free method of obtaining deterministic

the existing methods that use scenarios sampled from pre-known PD functions,
the PD-free method uses historical measurements of uncertain variables as input
to convert the logical models into a type of deterministic equivalents called
General Scenario Program (GSP). Our contributions to the PD-free deterministic
equivalent construction reside in generalization (making it applicable to
general optimization under uncertainty rather than just chance-constrained
optimization) and extension (enabling it to the problems under endogenous
uncertainty via developing an iterative and a non-iterative frameworks).
Second, this paper reveals some unknown properties of the PD-free deterministic
equivalent construction, such as the characteristics of active scenarios and
repeated scenarios. Base on this discoveries, we propose a concept and methods
of strategic scenario selection which can effectively reduce the required
number of scenarios as demonstrated in both mathematical analysis and numerical

major point of interest for these targets is the gas density at the region of
interaction where the laser ionizes the gas plume to create a plasma, providing
the acceleration structure. Tuning the density profiles at this interaction
region is crucial to LPA optimization. A ""flat-top"" density profile is desired
at this line of interaction to control laser propagation and high energy
electron acceleration, while a short high-density profile is often preferred
for acceleration of lower-energy tightly-focused laser-plasma interactions. A
particular design parameter of interest is the curvature of the nozzle's
diverging section. We examine three nozzle designs with different curvatures:
the concave ""bell"", straight conical and convex ""trumpet"" nozzles. We
demonstrate that, at mm-scale distances from the nozzle exit, the trumpet and
straight nozzles, if optimized, produce ""flat-top"" density profiles whereas the
bell nozzle creates focused regions of gas with higher densities. An
optimization procedure for the trumpet nozzle is derived and compared to the
straight nozzle optimization process. We find that the trumpet nozzle, by
providing an extra parameter of control through its curvature, is more
versatile for creating flat-top profiles and its optimization procedure is more

process. We present results for different nozzle designs from computational

placing a premium on tools that can extract and summarize relevant information.
This paper introduces the task of generating discharge summaries for a clinical
encounter. Summaries in this setting need to be faithful, traceable, and scale
to multiple long documents, motivating the use of extract-then-abstract
summarization cascades. We introduce two new measures, faithfulness and
hallucination rate for evaluation in this task, which complement existing
measures for fluency and informativeness. Results across seven medical sections
and five models show that a summarization architecture that supports
traceability yields promising results, and that a sentence-rewriting approach
performs consistently on the measure used for faithfulness
(faithfulness-adjusted $F_3$) over a diverse range of generated sections.

the width of the welded zone, which both are significantly different for FSW

in conjunction with the gradual increase of the impact angle. These simulations
elucidate the experimentally observed successive interface morphologies, i.e.,
the unwelded zone, vortex zone, intermediate (IM) layers and wavy interface.
Microstructural characterizations show that the IM layers are formed by
mechanical mixing combined with melting and are characterized by highly
heterogeneous porous zone with random sizes and distributions of void.
Subsequently, an Eulerian simulation is proposed to investigate the
thermomechanical effects during the wave formation which vastly influence the
joint quality. The predicted wavy morphologies, temperature distribution and
average equivalent plastic strain along the interface provided a better
understanding on the formation steps of the experimentally observed wave
morphologies. The actual kinematics during wave generation revealed that the

first develop a microscopic parking simulation model considering both on- and
off-street parking with limited capacity. In the microscopic model, a parking
search algorithm is proposed to mimic cruising-for-parking based on the
principle of proximity, and a parking-related state tracking algorithm is
proposed to acquire an event-based simulated data set. Some key aspects of
parking modeling are discussed based on the sim-ulated evidence and theoretical
analysis. Results suggest (i) although the low cruising speed reduces the
network performance, it does not significantly alter the macroscopic or network
fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD) unless the cruising vehicles dominate the
traffic stream; (ii) distance to park is not uniquely determined by parking
occupancy because factors such as cruising speed and parking dura-tion also
contribute; and (iii) multiscale parking occupancy-driven intelligent parking
guidance can re-duce distance to park yielding considerable network efficiency
gains. Using the microscopic model, we then extend, calibrate, and validate a
macroscopic parking dynamics model with an NFD representation. The demonstrated
consistency between the macro- and micro-models permits integration of the two
for online parking pricing optimization via model predictive control. Numerical
experiments highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as one
caveat. That is, when pricing on-street parking, the road network connected to
the alternate off-street parking lots must have sufficient capacity to
ac-commodate the increased parking demand; otherwise, local congestion may
arise that violates the ho-mogeneity assumption underlying the macroscopic
model.

where the solution is assumed as a linear combination of prescribed modes are
rooted in a well-developed theory. However, more general models where the

been derived in an ad hoc manner. Here, we introduce Reduced-order Nonlinear
Solutions (RONS): a unified framework for deriving reduced-order models that
depend nonlinearly on a set of time-dependent parameters. The set of all
possible reduced-order solutions are viewed as a manifold immersed in the
function space of the PDE. The parameters are evolved such that the
instantaneous discrepancy between reduced dynamics and the full PDE dynamics is
minimized. This results in a set of explicit ordinary differential equations on
the tangent bundle of the manifold. In the special case of linear parameter
dependence, our reduced equations coincide with the standard Galerkin
projection. Furthermore, any number of conserved quantities of the PDE can
readily be enforced in our framework. Since RONS does not assume an underlying
variational formulation for the PDE, it is applicable to a broad class of
problems. We demonstrate the efficacy of RONS on three examples: an
advection-diffusion equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and Euler's
equation for ideal fluids.

Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx, respectively, are spinning top-shaped rubble piles.
Other axisymmetric top-shaped near-Earth asteroids have been observed with
ground-based radar, most of which rotate near breakup rotation periods of ~ 3
hours. This suggests that rotation-induced deformation of asteroids through
rotational spinup produces top shapes. Although some previous simulations using
the Discrete Element Method showed that spinup of rubble piles may produce
oblate top shapes, it is still unclear what kinds of conditions such as
friction angles of constituent materials and spinup timescales are required for
top-shape formation. Here we show, through Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
simulations of granular bodies spinning-up at different rates, that the
rotation-induced deformation of spherical rubble piles before breakup can be
classified into three modes according to the friction angle \phi_{d}:
quasi-static and internal deformation for \phi_{d} < 40 degrees, dynamical and
internal deformation for 50 degrees < \phi_{d} < 60 degrees, and surface
landslides for \phi_{d} > 70 degrees. Note that these apparent large values of
friction angle can be acceptable if we consider the effect of cohesion among
blocks of a rubble pile under weak gravity. Bodies with \phi_{d} < 60 degrees
evolve into oblate spheroids through internal deformation, but never form
pronounced equators defining a top shape. In contrast, bodies with \phi_{d} >
70 degrees deform into axisymmetric top shapes through an axisymmetric surface
landslides if spinup timescales are < a few days. In addition, through slow
spinups with timescales > 1 month, bodies with \phi_{d} > 70 degrees deform
into non-axisymmetric shapes via localized landslides. We suggest that rapid
spinup mechanisms are preferable for the formation of axisymmetric top shapes.

the development of graph theory inspires scientists to understand graph

autocorrelation of count time series data is typically estimated in the
state-space modelling framework through extended Kalman filter. However,
because of the complex dependencies in count time series, estimation becomes
more challenging. PAR is viewed as an additive model and estimated using a
hybrid of cubic smoothing splines and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in
the backfitting framework. Simulation studies show that this estimation method
is comparable or better than PAR estimated in the state-space context,
especially with larger count values. However, as [2] formulated PAR for
stationary counts, both estimation procedures underestimate parameters in
nearly nonstationary models. The flexibility of the additive model has two
benefits though: robust estimation in the presence of temporary structural
change, and; viability to integrate PAR model into a more complex model
structure. We further generalized the PAR(p) model into multiple time series of

presence in space, and more immediately, several large-scale methalox-based
transport systems will begin operating in the near future. This raises the
question of whether indigenous carbon on the Moon is abundant and concentrated
to the extent where it could be used as a viable resource including as
propellant. Here, I assess potential sources of lunar carbon based on previous
work focused on polar water ice. A simplified model is used to estimate the
temperature-dependent Carbon Content of Ices at the lunar poles, and this is
combined with remote sensing data to estimate the total amount of carbon and
generate a Carbon Favorability Index that highlights promising deposits for
future ground-based prospecting. Hotspots in the index maps are identified, and
nearby staging areas are analyzed using quantitative models of trafficability
and solar irradiance. Overall, the Moon is extremely poor in carbon sources
compared to more abundant and readily accessible options at Mars. However, a
handful of polar regions may contain appreciable amounts of subsurface
carbon-bearing ices that could serve as a rich source in the near term, but
would be easily exhausted on longer timescales. Four of those regions were
found to have safe nearby staging areas with equatorial-like illumination at a
modest height above the surface. Any one of these sites could yield enough C, H
and O to produce propellant for hundreds of refuelings of a large spacecraft.
Other potential lunar carbon sources including bulk regolith and pyroclastic
glasses are less viable due to their low carbon concentrations.

such as the gauge coupling constants of $U(1)_{B-L}$, the kinetic mixing
parameter of between $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_{B-L}$ are determined by solving the
renormalization group equations for gauge coupling constants with appropriate
matching conditions. From the constraints of the DM lifetime and gamma-ray

find that the thermal relic abundance can be consistent with all the

quantum fluid system. For $We \lesssim 1$, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
induces flutter-finger patterns of the interface and quantized vortices are

a universal behavior with respect to $We$. When $We \gtrsim 1$ in which the
interface thickness is larger than the wavelength of the interface mode, the
nonlinear dynamics is effectively initiated by the counter-superflow

instability causes transient zipper pattern formation instead of generating
vortices due to the lack of enough circulation to form a quantized vortex per a

the instability leads to sealskin pattern in the overlapping region, in which
the frictional relaxation of the superflow cannot be explained only by the
homogeneous counter-superflow instability. We discuss the details of the linear

cavity in the low driving regime, with a particular focus on accounting for the

strengths between co- and cross-circularly polarized polaritons as well as a
realistic linear-polarization splitting allows one to model the system as two
coupled nonlinear resonators with both self- and cross-Kerr-like
nonlinearities, thus making our results potentially relevant for other
experimental platforms. Within an effective wave-function approach, we obtain
analytical expressions for the steady-state polarization-resolved polariton
populations and second-order correlation functions, which agree very well with
our numerical results obtained from a Lindblad master equation. Notably, we
highlight that depending on the excitation polarization (circular or linear),
both the unconventional (interference-mediated) and conventional (mediated by
nonlinearities) antibunchings can be investigated in a single cavity. Moreover,
using our results, we argue that recent experiments on confined fiber-cavity
polaritons are likely to have probed a regime where the dominant interaction is
between cross-polarized polaritons, which is characteristic of the polariton
Feshbach resonance. We furthermore investigate the regime close to resonance
using a two-channel model, and we show that systems with large biexciton
binding energies, such as atomically thin semiconductors, are promising
platforms for realizing strong polariton antibunching.

feedback control of robots with complex, non-smooth dynamics, and cost

algorithms has been a key bottleneck in their application to high-dimensional
robotic manipulation problems in the real world. Previous methods have
addressed this issue by running MPC in the task space while relying on a
low-level operational space controller for joint control. However, by not using
the joint space of the robot in the MPC formulation, existing methods cannot
directly account for non-task space related constraints such as avoiding joint
limits, singular configurations, and link collisions. In this paper, we develop
a system for fast, joint space sampling-based MPC for manipulators that is
efficiently parallelized using GPUs. Our approach can handle task and joint
space constraints while taking less than 8ms~(125Hz) to compute the next
control command. Further, our method can tightly integrate perception into the
control problem by utilizing learned cost functions from raw sensor data. We
validate our approach by deploying it on a Franka Panda robot for a variety of
dynamic manipulation tasks. We study the effect of different cost formulations
and MPC parameters on the synthesized behavior and provide key insights that
pave the way for the application of sampling-based MPC for manipulators in a
principled manner. We also provide highly optimized, open-source code to be

ignition delay and burning rate of ethanol droplets are experimentally
investigated. Three graphene oxide samples are synthesized and characterized.
Separate high-speed OH* chemiluminescence and high-speed shadowgraphy images
are collected. The results suggest that increasing the loading concentration
from 0 to 0.1% generally increases the ignition delay, except for ethanol doped
with the highly oxidized graphene. The probability density function of the
atomized baby droplet diameter, initial projected velocity, and length of the
projected trajectory are similar for all tested conditions and independent of
the oxidation level and loading concentration of the additives. The joint
probability density function calculated for the atomization-related parameters
against one another suggests that the majority of the baby droplets feature a
relatively short lifetime, indicating they may potentially burn inside the
flame envelope. Using droplet surface regression curves versus time, the
burning rate for periods in which the atomization does not occur, and for the
periods that the atomization is present are estimated. The former burning rate
is shown to enhance by increasing the loading concentration and reducing the
oxidation level of graphene. However, it is found that a maximum increase in
the latter burning rate for both loading concentrations occurs for ethanol
doped with the graphene oxide that features maximum amount of infrared
radiation absorption. It is shown that relatively intense atomization
suppresses the mass loss. Doping ethanol with graphene oxide and increasing the
loading concentration from 0.01 to 0.1% enhances the overall burning rate, with
a maximum enhancement of 8.4% pertaining to addition of reduced oxidized

prominences or filaments, among which direct injection and
evaporation-condensation models are the two most popular ones. In the direct
injection model, cold plasma is ejected from the chromosphere into the corona
along magnetic field lines; In the evaporation-condensation model, the cold
chromospheric plasma is heated to over a million degrees and is evaporated into
the corona, where the accumulated plasma finally reaches thermal instability or
non-equilibrium so as to condensate to cold prominences. In this paper, we try
to unify the two mechanisms: The essence of filament formation is the localized
heating in the chromosphere. If the heating happens in the lower chromosphere,
the enhanced gas pressure pushes the cold plasma in the upper chromosphere to
move up to the corona, such a process is manifested as the direct injection
model. If the heating happens in the upper chromosphere, the local plasma is
heated to million degrees, and is evaporated into the corona. Later, the plasma
condensates to form a prominence. Such a process is manifested as the
evaporation-condensation model. With radiative hydrodynamic simulations we
confirmed that the two widely accepted formation mechanisms of solar
prominences can really be unified in such a single framework. A particular case
is also found where both injection and evaporation-condensation processes occur
together.

penguin-exchange amplitude induced from final-state rescattering that nicely
accounts for the CP asymmetry difference between $D^0\to K^+K^-$ and
$\pi^+\pi^-$ modes, we find that CP asymmetry can also occur at the per mille

point out six golden modes which have sufficiently large branching fractions
and direct CP violation of order $10^{-3}$. In particular, the direct CP
asymmetry difference $\Delta a_{CP}^{V\!P}$ between $D^0\to K^+K^{*-}$ and
$\pi^+\rho^-$ is predicted to be $(-1.61\pm0.33)\times 10^{-3}$, very similar
to the counterpart in the $P\!P$ sector. Besides, we find a positive and large
CP asymmetry of order $10^{-3}$ in $D^0\to K_S K^{*0}$, an example of the

matrix for a spatially discrete reaction-diffusion system on a one dimensional
domain. The domain has two subregions which share a single common boundary.
Each of the subregions is further partitioned into a finite number of
compartments. Chemical reactions can occur within a compartment, whereas
diffusion is represented as movement between adjacent compartments. Inspired by
biology, we study both 1) the case where the reactions on each side of the
boundary are different and only certain species diffuse across the boundary as
well as 2) the case with spatially homogenous reactions and diffusion. We write
the stoichiometry matrix for these two classes of systems using a Kronecker
product formulation. For the first scenario, we apply linear perturbation
theory to derive an approximate singular value decomposition in the limit as
diffusion becomes much faster than reactions. For the second scenario, we
derive an exact analytical singular value decomposition for all relative
diffusion and reaction time scales. By writing the stoichiometry matrix using
Kronecker products, we show that the singular vectors and values can also be
written concisely using Kronecker products.
  Ultimately, we find that the singular value decomposition of the
reaction-diffusion stoichiometry matrix depends on the singular value
decompositions of smaller matrices. These smaller matrices represent modified

the epithelial lining of proximal convoluted renal tubules. These cells undergo
abnormal mutations in the presence of Ki67 protein and create a lump-like
structure through cell proliferation. Manual counting of tumor cells in the
tissue-affected sections is one of the strongest prognostic markers for renal
cancer. However, this procedure is time-consuming and also prone to
subjectivity. These assessments are based on the physical cell appearance and
suffer wide intra-observer variations. Therefore, better cell nucleus detection
and counting techniques can be an important biomarker for the assessment of
tumor cell proliferation in routine pathological investigations. In this paper,
we introduce a deep learning-based detection model for cell classification on

rates is an important yet difficult problem in numerous chemical and biological
systems especially in situations with multiple competing pathways. When these
high-dimensional systems are projected on low-dimensional coordinates, which
are often needed for enhanced sampling or for interpretation of simulations and
experiments, one can end up losing the kinetic connectivity of the underlying
high-dimensional landscape. Thus in the low-dimensional projection metastable
states might appear closer or further than they actually are. To deal with this
issue, in this work we develop a formalism that learns a multi-dimensional yet
minimally complex reaction coordinate (RC) for generic high-dimensional
systems. When projected along this RC, all possible kinetically relevant
pathways can be demarcated and the true high-dimensional connectivity is
maintained. One of the defining attributes of our method lies in that it can
work on long unbiased simulations as well as biased simulations often needed
for rare event systems. We demonstrate the utility of the method by studying a
range of model systems including conformational transitions in a small peptide
Ace-Ala$_3$-Nme, where we show how two-dimensional and three-dimensional

In contrast to traditional rendering pipelines, this prohibits changing surface

  In this work, we explicitly model the light transport between scene surfaces

reconstruct a scene. The proposed method allows BSDF recovery with unknown
light conditions and classic light transports such as pathtracing. By learning
decomposed transport with surface representations established in conventional
rendering methods, the method naturally facilitates editing shape, reflectance,

the analogy to the van der Waals liquid/gas phase transition is valid
irrespective of the multihair characteristics of the NUT parameter. However, as
the NUT parameter increases to be comparable to the electric charge, such
analogy to the van der Waals system will be broken, and the corresponding
inflection point is not a thermodynamic critical point any more. For a large
NUT parameter, there are frequent occurrences of the zeroth order phase

microstructural variations across individuals and into the impact of central

diffusion signals has been to use biologically relevant analytical models to
link millimetre scale diffusion MRI measures with microscale influences. The
other approach has been to represent diffusion as an anomalous transport
process and infer microstructural information from the different anomalous
diffusion equation parameters. In this study, we investigated how parameters of
various anomalous diffusion models vary with age in the human brain white
matter, particularly focusing on the corpus callosum. We first unified several
established anomalous diffusion models (the super-diffusion, sub-diffusion,
quasi-diffusion and fractional Bloch-Torrey models) under the continuous time
random walk modelling framework. This unification allows a consistent parameter
fitting strategy to be applied from which meaningful model parameter
comparisons can be made. We then provided a novel way to derive the diffusional
kurtosis imaging (DKI) model, which is shown to be a degree two approximation
of the sub-diffusion model. This link between the DKI and sub-diffusion models
led to a new robust technique for generating maps of kurtosis and diffusivity
using the sub-diffusion parameters \b{eta}_SUB and D_SUB. Superior tissue
contrast is achieved in kurtosis maps based on the sub-diffusion model. 7T
diffusion weighted MRI data for 65 healthy participants in the age range 19-78
years was used in this study. Results revealed that anomalous diffusion model
parameters {\alpha} and \b{eta} have shown consistent positive correlation with

processes. Considering the inherent effects of the channel access protocol, the
spatial density of throughput (SDT), which depends on channel access
probability and coverage rate, is derived as the performance objective.
Leveraging spatial statistics of the network, a throughput-utility maximization
problem is formulated to seek AP association and PCS threshold selection
policies that jointly maximize SDT. The AP association and the PCS threshold
selection policies are derived analytically while an algorithm is proposed for
numerical solution. Under simulated scenarios involving full-duplex (FD) nodes,
optimizing AP association yields performance gains for low to high node density

optimization jointly with AP association is shown to improve performance by
effectively separating concurrent transmissions in space. It is shown that AP

threshold optimization reduces the interference domain of user groups for
additional performance gains.

  distribution","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum key distribution (QKD) is an important branch of quantum information
science as it holds promise for unconditionally secure communication. For QKD
research, a central issue is to improve the final secure key rate (SKR) and the
maximal transmission distance. To address this issue, most works focused on
reducing the information leakage of QKD. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to further reduce the information leakage by specially considering the
overlap between the information leakage of quantum part and post-processing
part. The overlap means that the information leakage of post-processing part
caused solely by multi-photon pulses is considered twice in previous studies,
i.e., both in quantum part and post-processing part. Since the information
carried by multi-photon pulses has been considered as completely known by Eve
through the photon-number-splitting attack in quantum part, there is no need to
consider it in post-processing part repetitively during the SKR calculation.
Therefore, our approach can theoretically reduce the information leakage of a
QKD protocol. Based on this idea, we derive the formulas to calculate the
amount of information leakage for decoy-BB84 and sending-or-not-sending
twin-field protocols. Simulation results for these two typical protocols also
demonstrate that our approach evidently improves the SKR as well as the maximal
transmission distance under practical experimental parameters.

with the aim to generalize to new domains at test time without an adaptation
step. This is known as domain generalization (DG). Previous works on DG assume
identical categories or label space across the source domains. In the case of
category shift among the source domains, previous methods on DG are vulnerable
to negative transfer due to the large mismatch among label spaces, decreasing
the target classification accuracy. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we
introduce an end-to-end feature-norm network (FNN) which is robust to negative
transfer as it does not need to match the feature distribution among the source
domains. We also introduce a collaborative feature-norm network (CFNN) to
further improve the generalization capability of FNN. The CFNN matches the
predictions of the next most likely categories for each training sample which
increases each network's posterior entropy. We apply the proposed FNN and CFNN
networks to the problem of DG for image classification tasks and demonstrate
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.

conditions. The threat model is such that the FD adversary can jam a frequency
band and measure the jammed band's power level. We first point out that due to
the presence of this FD adversary, Frequency Hopping (FH) fails. We then
propose a fast-forward cooperative relaying scheme, wherein the victim node
hops to the frequency band of a nearby FD helper node that fast-forwards the
victim's symbol along with its symbol. At the same time, the victim and the
helper cooperatively pour some fraction of their power on the jammed band to
engage the adversary. Due to fast-fading channel conditions, the victim and the
helper use amplitude based non-coherent signalling referred to as Non-Coherent
Fast-Forward Full-Duplex (NC-F2FD) relaying. To minimize the error-rate of this
strategy, we jointly design the constellations at the helper node and the
victim node by formulating an optimization problem. Using non-trivial results,
we first analyse the objective function and then, based on the analytical
results, propose a low-complexity algorithm to synthesize the fast-forwarded
constellations. Through simulations, we show that the error performance of the

cross-dataset settings. Also, PoseC3D can handle multiple-person scenarios
without additional computation cost, and its features can be easily integrated
with other modalities at early fusion stages, which provides a great design
space to further boost the performance. On four challenging datasets, PoseC3D
consistently obtains superior performance, when used alone on skeletons and in

increasingly important. Still, conventional Poisson regression has remaining
issues in terms of identifiability and computational efficiency. Especially,
due to an identification problem, Poisson regression can be unstable for small
samples with many zeros. Provided this, we develop a closed-form inference for
an over-dispersed Poisson regression including Poisson additive mixed models.
The approach is derived via mode-based log-Gaussian approximation. The
resulting method is fast, practical, and free from the identification problem.
Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the estimation error of the proposed
method is a considerably smaller estimation error than the closed-form
alternatives and as small as the usual Poisson regressions. For counts with
many zeros, our approximation has better estimation accuracy than conventional
Poisson regression. We obtained similar results in the case of Poisson additive
mixed modeling considering spatial or group effects. The developed method was
applied for analyzing COVID-19 data in Japan. This result suggests that
influences of pedestrian density, age, and other factors on the number of cases

cross-correlating foreground convergence fields constructed from galaxy shear
measurements with background galaxy positional distributions, namely
shear-number density correlation. We apply it to the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey data. With 27 non-independent data points
and their full covariance, $\chi_0^2\approx 34.1$ and $\chi_T^2\approx 24.0$
with respect to the null and the cosmological model with the parameters from
HSC shear correlation analyses in Hamana et al. 2020 (arXiv:1906.06041),
respectively. The Bayes factor of the two is $\log_{10}B_{T0}\approx 2.2$
assuming equal model probabilities of null and HSC cosmology, showing a clear
detection of the magnification signals. Theoretically, the ratio of the
shear-number density and shear-shear correlations can provide a constraint on
the effective multiplicative shear bias $\bar m$ using internal data
themselves. We demonstrate the idea with the signals from our HSC-SSP mock
simulations and rescaling the statistical uncertainties to a survey of
$15000\deg^2$. For two-bin analyses with background galaxies brighter than
$m_{lim}=23$, the combined analyses lead to a forecasted constraint of
$\sigma(\bar m) \sim 0.032$, $2.3$ times tighter than that of using the
shear-shear correlation alone. Correspondingly, $\sigma(S_8)$ with
$S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ is tightened by $\sim 2.1$ times.
Importantly, the joint constraint on $\bar m$ is nearly independent of
cosmological parameters. Our studies therefore point to the importance of
including the shear-number density correlation in weak lensing analyses, which
can provide valuable consistency tests of observational data, and thus to
solidify the derived cosmological constraints.

anisotropy of the current-carrying capacity relative to magnetic field
direction - Ic({\theta}). However, today there is no sufficiently comprehensive
model that takes into account the anisotropy, therefore the angular dependences
are usually not analysed, but only described using various mathematical
formulas. As a result, the fitting parameters have no physical meaning and it
is difficult to correlate the picture with the features of the microstructure.
In this paper, we propose a method for analysing the critical current angular
dependences based on the anisotropic pinning model. The applicability of this
model for conventional superconducting Nb-Ti tapes with one peak in the Ic
({\theta}) dependence is shown. The possibility of extending this model to
analyse the angular dependences of HTS materials is discussed.

photonic crystal cavity has a wavelength-dependent spatial profile. We generate
the spatial transmittance function of the system using finite-difference

function serves as a transfer function in our reconstructive algorithm. We show
accurate estimation of various kinds of input spectra. We also show that the
spectral resolution of the system depends on the cavity linewidth that can be
improved by increasing the number of periodic layers in distributed Bragg

catastrophic forgetting issue. However, old knowledge learned earlier is
commonly less preserved than that learned more recently. In order to reduce the
forgetting of particularly earlier learned old knowledge and improve the
overall continual learning performance, we propose a simple yet effective
fusion mechanism by including all the previously learned feature extractors
into the intelligent model. In addition, a new feature extractor is included to
the model when learning a new set of classes each time, and a feature extractor
pruning is also applied to prevent the whole model size from growing rapidly.
Experiments on multiple classification tasks show that the proposed approach

navigate through intersections where only traffic signs are provided. We
propose a multi-agent system using a continuous, model-free Deep Reinforcement
Learning algorithm used to train a neural network for predicting both the
acceleration and the steering angle at each time step. We demonstrate that
agents learn both the basic rules needed to handle intersections by
understanding the priorities of other learners inside the environment, and to
drive safely along their paths. Moreover, a comparison between our system and a
rule-based method proves that our model achieves better results especially with
dense traffic conditions. Finally, we test our system on real world scenarios
using real recorded traffic data, proving that our module is able to generalize
both to unseen environments and to different traffic conditions.

graph convolution on water networks is possible. The effect of the number of

In addition, a weighting method is shown, wherewith information on friction

The performance of the proposed model is presented on 3 WDSs at different

problem of the incremental retransmission latency caused by packet loss in a

emulating the packet loss by a dropout method, which randomly drops the output

robustness against packet losses. Our ML experimental evaluation reveals that
SI-NR obtains accurate predictions without packet retransmission at a packet

$T_{A}\:(f=100\:\mathrm{kHz})\sim$ 4 K once both magnetic transitions at
$T_{N1}\sim$ 7 K and $T_{N2}\sim$ 14 K set in. The observed dielectric anomaly
is attributed to the emergency of possible local electric polarizations whose
inversion symmetry is broken by inhomogeneously distributed stacking faults. A
field-induced intermediate phase is only observed when a magnetic field is
applied perpendicular to the Ru-Ru bonds for samples with minimal stacking
faults. Less pronounced in-plane anisotropy is found in samples with sizable
contribution from stacking imperfections. Our findings suggest that dielectric
measurement is a sensitive probe in detecting the structural and magnetic
properties, which may be a promising tool especially in studying
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ thin film devices. Moreover, the stacking details of RuCl$_3$
layers strongly affect the ground state both in the magnetic and electric
channels. Such a fragile ground state against stacking faults needs to be
overcome for realistic applications utilizing the magnetic and/or electric
properties of Kitaev based physics in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

methods to mitigate such biases, particularly in the light of the advances in

measure the fairness in the retrieved text contents of ranking models.
Introducing a ranker-agnostic measurement, the framework also enables the
disentanglement of the effect on fairness of collection from that of rankers.
To mitigate these biases, we propose AdvBert, a ranking model achieved by
adapting adversarial bias mitigation for IR, which jointly learns to predict
relevance and remove protected attributes. We conduct experiments on two
passage retrieval collections (MSMARCO Passage Re-ranking and TREC Deep
Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking), which we extend by fairness annotations of a
selected subset of queries regarding gender attributes. Our results on the
MSMARCO benchmark show that, (1) all ranking models are less fair in comparison
with ranker-agnostic baselines, and (2) the fairness of Bert rankers
significantly improves when using the proposed AdvBert models. Lastly, we
investigate the trade-off between fairness and utility, showing that we can
maintain the significant improvements in fairness without any significant loss

a set of gallery (database) images. Such systems are used in various
applications e.g. person re-identification (ReID) or visual product search.
Despite active development of retrieval models it still remains a challenging
task mainly due to large intra-class variance caused by changes in view angle,
lighting, background clutter or occlusion, while inter-class variance may be
relatively low. A large portion of current research focuses on creating more
robust features and modifying objective functions, usually based on Triplet
Loss. Some works experiment with using centroid/proxy representation of a class
to alleviate problems with computing speed and hard samples mining used with
Triplet Loss. However, these approaches are used for training alone and
discarded during the retrieval stage. In this paper we propose to use the mean
centroid representation both during training and retrieval. Such an aggregated
representation is more robust to outliers and assures more stable features. As
each class is represented by a single embedding - the class centroid - both
retrieval time and storage requirements are reduced significantly. Aggregating
multiple embeddings results in a significant reduction of the search space due
to lowering the number of candidate target vectors, which makes the method
especially suitable for production deployments. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on two ReID and Fashion Retrieval datasets demonstrate effectiveness
of our method, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art. We propose
centroid training and retrieval as a viable method for both Fashion Retrieval

encouraging people to behave prosocially. Classical economic theory, according
to which a specific behavior becomes more prevalent when it is rewarded,
struggles to explain why incentives sometimes backfire. More recent theories
therefore posit a reputational cost offsetting the benefits of receiving an
incentive -- yet unexplained effects of incentives remain, for instance across
incentive types and countries. We propose that social norms can offer an
explanation for these inconsistencies. Ultimately, social norms determine the
reputational costs or benefits resulting from a given behavior, and thus
variation in the effect of incentives may reflect variation in norms. We
implemented a formal model of prosocial behavior integrating social norms,
which we empirically tested on the real-world prosocial behavior of blood
donation. Blood donation is essential for many life-saving medical procedures,
but also presents an ideal testing ground for our theory: Various incentive
policies for blood donors exist across countries, enabling a comparative
approach. Our preregistered analyses reveal that social norms can indeed
account for the varying effects of financial and time incentives on
individual-level blood donation behavior across 28 European countries.
Incentives are associated with higher levels of prosociality when norms
regarding the incentive are more positive. The results indicate that social
norms play an important role in explaining the relationship between incentives
and prosocial behavior. More generally, our approach highlights the potential
of integrating theory from across the economic and behavioral sciences to
generate novel insights, with tangible consequences for policy-making.

explore a wide range of spacings of the planets, and were integrated for
virtual times of up to 10 billion years or until the orbits of any pair of

exponentially with separation between orbits seen by previous studies of
systems of three or more planets. One focus of this paper is to go beyond the
rough trends found by previous numerical studies and quantitatively explore the
nature of the scatter in lifetimes and the destabilizing effects of mean motion
resonances. In contrast to previous results for five-planet systems, a
nontrivial fraction of three-planet systems survive at least several orders of

post-instability survival time of systems depends upon the initial orbital
separation, mutual inclination, planetary radius, and the closest encounter
experienced. Additionally, we examine the effects of very small changes in the
initial positions of the planets upon the time to collision and show the effect
that the choice of integrator can have upon simulation results. We generalise

its performance suffers from the many short cycles inherent in a quantum

propose a decoding algorithm for quantum codes based on quaternary BP with
additional memory effects (called MBP). This MBP is like a recursive neural
network with inhibitions between neurons (edges with negative weights), which
enhance the perception capability of a network. Moreover, MBP exploits the
degeneracy of a quantum code so that the most probable error or its degenerate
errors can be found with high probability. The decoding performance is
significantly improved over the conventional BP for various quantum codes,
including quantum bicycle, hypergraph-product, surface and toric codes. For MBP
on the surface and toric codes over depolarizing errors, we observe error
thresholds of 16% and 17.5%, respectively.

plays an important role in stellar physics. At the same time the direct
calculations of the high-resolution spectrum and then integrating it over the
given spectral pass-band is computationally demanding due to the vast number of
atomic and molecular lines. This is particularly so when employing
three-dimensional (3D) models of stellar atmospheres. To accelerate the
calculations, one can employ approximate methods, e.g., the use of Opacity
Distribution Functions (ODFs). Generally, ODFs provide a good approximation of
traditional spectral synthesis i.e., computation of intensities through filters
with strictly rectangular transmission function. However, their performance
strongly deteriorates when the filter transmission noticeably changes within
its pass-band, which is the case for almost all filters routinely used in
stellar physics. In this context, the aims of this paper are a) to generalize
the ODFs method for calculating intensities through filters with arbitrary
transmission functions; b) to study the performance of the standard and
generalized ODFs methods for calculating intensities emergent from 3D models of
stellar atmosphere. For this purpose we use the newly-developed MPS-ATLAS
radiative transfer code to compute intensities emergent 3D cubes simulated with
the radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM. The calculations are performed
in the 1.5D regime, i.e., along many parallel rays passing through the
simulated cube. We demonstrate that generalized ODFs method allows accurate and
fast syntheses of spectral intensities and their centre-to-limb variations.

established notion that they are suitable primarily for error detection can be
set aside through use of the recently proposed Guessing Random Additive Noise
Decoding (GRAND). Hard-detection (GRAND-SOS) and soft-detection (ORBGRAND)
variants can decode any short, high-rate block code, making them suitable for
error correction of CRC-coded data. When decoded with GRAND, short CRC codes
have error correction capability that is at least as good as popular codes such
as BCH codes, but with no restriction on either code length or rate.
  The state-of-the-art CA-Polar codes are concatenated CRC and Polar codes. For
error correction, we find that the CRC is a better short code than either Polar
or CA-Polar codes. Moreover, the standard CA-SCL decoder only uses the CRC for
error detection and therefore suffers severe performance degradation in short,
high rate settings when compared with the performance GRAND provides, which
uses all of the CA-Polar bits for error correction.
  Using GRAND, existing systems can be upgraded from error detection to
low-latency error correction without re-engineering the encoder, and additional
applications of CRCs can be found in IoT, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency
Communication (URLLC), and beyond. The universality of GRAND, its ready
parallelized implementation in hardware, and the good performance of CRC as
codes make their combination a viable solution for low-latency applications.

transiting planets, but also in a grazing, non-transiting regime, where the
solid body of the planet does not transit, but part of the comet-like tail can
transit. In this case the forward scattering on the escaping particles is the
dominant process, which amplifies the photometric signal of the parent star
detected by the observer. The change in the flux is small, about 10^-3 (1000
ppm) at the best properties of the planetary system, but if the observation is
enough precise, the detection is possible. The planned Ariel space observatory
is designed to achieve a stability of < 100 ppm (the goal is 10 ppm) over the
temporal bandwidth of the transit, typically less than 10 hours. In this case
study we took the disintegrating exoplanet Kepler-1520b and changed the orbital
properties of the system to get a grazing, non-transiting orbit scenario, and
investigated, how different particle sizes, species, Ariel observational
channels, and other factors affect the amplitude of the forward-scattering
peak, and the detectability of the scattering event. Our most important result
is that the forward-scattering amplitude is not sensitive to the dust
composition, but is very sensitive to the particle size, observational channel,
and other factors. These factors can reduce mainly the detectability of
1-micron grains. 0.1-micron grains will be detectable at short wavelengths.
0.01-micron grains generate long and very small forward scattering amplitude,
which is below the detection limit. Based on our results we can conclude that
using Ariel will be possible to detect and investigate not only transiting, but
also grazing, non-transiting disintegrating exoplanets based on the forward
scattering. From the viewpoint of such objects the big advantage of Ariel will
be the possibility of multiwavelength observations.

previous approaches based on linear models, the considered model is able to
explain nonlinear interactions between the agents in a network. The novelty in
the considered method is the use of a derivative-reproducing property to
enforce network sparsity, while reproducing kernels are used to model the
nonlinear interactions. The aim of this paper is to present a thorough
convergence analysis of this method. The analysis is proven to be sane both in

favorable interactions. The cell activity fluctuations are controlled by a
thermostat. The direction of cell velocity is changed according to stochastic
rules mimicking a dense fluid. We develop a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm
inspired from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method initially used
for dilute gases. The evolution of an initially localized tumor is analyzed.
Qualitatively different behaviors are observed as the field regulating activity
fluctuations decreases. For high field values, i.e. efficient thermalization,
cancer is controlled. For small field values, cancer rapidly and monotonously
escapes from immunosurveillance. For the critical field value separating these
two domains, the 3E's of immunotherapy are reproduced, with an apparent initial
elimination of cancer, a long quasi-equilibrium period followed by large
fluctuations, and the final escape of cancer, even for a favored production of
immune system cells. For field values slightly smaller than the critical value,
more regular oscillations of the number of immune system cells are
spontaneously observed in agreement with clinical observations. The
antagonistic effects that the stimulation of the immune system may have on
oncogenesis are reproduced in the model by activity-weighted rate constants for
the autocatalytic productions of immune system cells and cancer cells. Local
favorable conditions for the launching of the oscillations are met in the
fluctuating inhomogeneous system, able to generate a small cluster of immune
system cells with larger activities than those of the surrounding cancer cells.

often unknown and have been little explored in the literature. We introduce an
efficient method to infer both the entities interaction network and its
evolution according to the temporal distance separating interacting entities;
together, they form the interaction profile. The interaction profile allows
characterizing the mechanisms of the interaction processes. We approach this
problem via a convex model based on recent advances in multi-kernel inference.
We consider an ordered sequence of exposures to entities (URL, ads, situations)
and the actions the user exerts on them (share, click, decision). We study how
users exhibit different behaviors according to combinations of exposures they
have been exposed to. We show that the effect of a combination of exposures on
a user is more than the sum of each exposure's independent effect--there is an
interaction. We reduce this modeling to a non-parametric convex optimization
problem that can be solved in parallel. Our method recovers state-of-the-art
results on interaction processes on three real-world datasets and outperforms
baselines in the inference of the underlying data generation mechanisms.
Finally, we show that interaction profiles can be visualized intuitively,

adsorbed proteins, which later controls the eventual fate of the particle and
the route through which adverse outcomes may occur. The composition and
timescale for the formation of this corona are both highly dependent on both
the NP and its environment. The deposition of proteins on the surface of the NP
is related to processes of random sequential adsorption and, based on this
model, we develop a rate-equation treatment for the formation of a corona
represented by hard spheres on spherical and cylindrical NPs. We find that the
geometry of the NP significantly alters the composition of the corona through a
process independent of the rate constants assumed for adsorption and desorption
of proteins, with the radius and shape of the NP both influencing the corona.
Moreover, we demonstrate that in the condition of strong binding such that the
adsorption is effectively irreversible the corona content reflects the protein
mobility and concentration in solution rather than their binding affinity.

limit the performance of on-board instruments. A study of galactic cosmic-ray
(GCR) tracks observed in the first VL images gathered by Metis during the

here. A similar analysis is planned for the UV channel. A prediction of the GCR
flux up to hundreds of GeV is made here for the first part of the Solar Orbiter
mission to study the Metis coronagraph performance. GCR model predictions are
compared to observations gathered on board Solar Orbiter by the EPD/HET
experiment in the range 10 MeV-100 MeV in the summer 2020 and with previous
measurements. Estimated cosmic-ray fluxes above 70 MeV n$^{-1}$ have been also
parameterized and used for Monte Carlo simulations aiming at reproducing the
cosmic-ray track observations in the Metis coronagraph VL images. The same
parameterizations can also be used to study the performance of other detectors.
By comparing observations of cosmic-ray tracks in the Metis VL images with
FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations of cosmic-ray interactions in the VL detector, it
is found that cosmic rays fire a fraction of the order of 10$^{-4}$ of the
whole image pixel sample. Therefore, cosmic rays do not affect sensibly the
quality of Metis VL images. It is also found that the overall efficiency for
cosmic-ray identification in the Metis VL images is approximately equal to the
contribution of Z$>$2 particles. As a result, the Metis coronagraph may play
the role of a proton monitor for long-term GCR variations during the overall
mission duration.

  Node Classification",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph neural networks (GNN) have been ubiquitous in graph node classification
tasks. Most of GNN methods update the node embedding iteratively by aggregating
its neighbors' information. However, they often suffer from negative
disturbance, due to edges connecting nodes with different labels. One approach
to alleviate this negative disturbance is to use attention to learn the weights
of aggregation, but current attention-based GNNs only consider feature
similarity and also suffer from the lack of supervision. In this paper, we
consider the label dependency of graph nodes and propose a decoupling attention
mechanism to learn both hard and soft attention. The hard attention is learned
on labels for a refined graph structure with fewer inter-class edges, so that
the aggregation's negative disturbance can be reduced. The soft attention aims
to learn the aggregation weights based on features over the refined graph
structure to enhance information gains during message passing. Particularly, we
formulate our model under the EM framework, and the learned attention is used
to guide the label propagation in the M-step and the feature propagation in the
E-step, respectively. Extensive experiments are performed on six well-known
benchmark graph datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

driving safety and efficiency for connected and automated vehicles, has
attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, existing cooperative
driving strategies either suffer from computational complexity or cannot
guarantee global optimality. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes an
optimal and computationally efficient cooperative driving strategy with the
polynomial-time complexity. By modeling the conflict relations among the
vehicles, the solution space of the cooperative driving problem is completely
represented by a newly designed small-size state space. Then, based on dynamic
programming, the globally optimal solution can be searched inside the state

complexity of computation from exponential to a small-degree polynomial.
Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed strategy can obtain

significant increase in magnetocrystalline anisotropy only for the Re doped

were investigated experimentally. The desired (Fe,Co)$_2$B tetragonal phase was
synthesized by heat treatment of amorphous precursors. We observed that
isothermal annealing increases the coercive field of all samples. However, the
obtained values, without further optimization, are well below the threshold for
permanent magnet applications. Nevertheless, annealing of substituted samples
at 750$^o$C significantly improves saturation magnetization values.
Furthermore, M\""{o}ssbauer spectroscopy revealed a reduction of the hyperfine

upon, via the transfer of momentum from the light to the surface. In general,
this force is assumed to be pushing or repulsive in nature. In this paper, we
present a complete quantum treatment of radiation pressure. We show that the
interaction of an atom with light can lead to both repulsive and attractive
forces due to the absorption and emission of photons, respectively. An atom
prepared in the excited state initially will experience a pulling force when
interacting with light. On the other hand, if the atom is prepared in the
ground state then the force will be repulsive while having the same magnitude
as in the earlier case. Therefore, for an ensemble of atoms, the direction of
the net force will be decided by the excited and ground state populations. In
the semi-classical treatment of light-matter interaction, the absorption and
emission processes have the same probability. Therefore the magnitudes of the
force in the two processes turn out to be the same. We obtain the effective
emission profile for an excited atom interacting with a quantum electromagnetic
field, and show that in the quantum treatment, despite these probabilities
being different, the magnitudes of the two statistical forces remain the same.
This can be explained by noting that the extra contribution in the emission
process is due to the interaction of the atom with the vacuum modes of the
electromagnetic field, which results in a symmetric emission profile,
contributing to a net zero force on the atoms in an ensemble. We further
identify the set of states of electromagnetic field which give rise to non-zero
momentum transfer to the atom.

scattering spectra of both disordered and crystalline materials. The current
paradigm presents the boson peak as the result of a Ioffe-Regel crossover
between ballistic (phonon) and diffusive-type excitations, where the loss of
coherence of phonons is described as a purely harmonic process due to
structural disorder. This ""harmonic disorder"" paradigm for the BP has never
been challenged or tested at the atomistic level. Here, through a set of
atomistically-resolved characterizations of amorphous metallic alloys, we
uncover a robust inverse proportionality between the intensity of boson peak
and the activation energy of excitations in the potential energy landscape
(PEL). Larger boson peak is linked with shallower basins and lower activation
barriers and, consequently, with strongly anharmonic sectors of the PEL.
Numerical evidence from atomistic simulations indicates that THz atomic
vibrations contributing the most to the BP in atomic glasses are strongly
anharmonic, as evidenced through very large values of the atomic- and
mode-resolved Gr\""{u}neisen parameter found for the atomic vibrations that
constitute the BP. These results provide a direct bridge between the
vibrational spectrum and the topology of the PEL in solids, and point towards a
new ""giant anharmonicity"" paradigm for both generic disordered materials and
for the phonon-glass problem in emerging materials for energy applications. In
this sense, disorder and anharmonicity emerge as the two sides of the same
coin.

to detect and quantify the temporal changes that occurred in two depressions of
the Ash region during the last perihelion passage. We find that the two
depressions grew by several meters. The area of the smallest depression
(structure I) increased by 90+/-20%, with two preferential growths: one close
to the cliff associated with the apparition of new boulders at its foot, and a
second one on the opposite side of the cliff. The largest depression (structure
II) grew in all directions, increasing in area by 20+/-5%, and no new deposits
have been detected. We interpreted these two depression changes as being driven
by the sublimation of ices, which explains their global growth and which can
also trigger landslides. The deposits associated with depression II reveal a
stair-like topography, indicating that they have accumulated during several
successive landslides from different perihelion passages. Overall, these
observations bring additional evidence of complex active processes and

features for various masked regions is nontrivial. Though U-shaped
encoder-decoder frameworks have been witnessed to be successful, most of them
share a common drawback of mask unawareness in feature extraction because all
convolution windows (or regions), including those with various shapes of
missing pixels, are treated equally and filtered with fixed learned kernels. To
this end, we propose our novel mask-aware inpainting solution. Firstly, a
Mask-Aware Dynamic Filtering (MADF) module is designed to effectively learn
multi-scale features for missing regions in the encoding phase. Specifically,
filters for each convolution window are generated from features of the
corresponding region of the mask. The second fold of mask awareness is achieved
by adopting Point-wise Normalization (PN) in our decoding phase, considering
that statistical natures of features at masked points differentiate from those
of unmasked points. The proposed PN can tackle this issue by dynamically
assigning point-wise scaling factor and bias. Lastly, our model is designed to
be an end-to-end cascaded refinement one. Supervision information such as
reconstruction loss, perceptual loss and total variation loss is incrementally
leveraged to boost the inpainting results from coarse to fine. Effectiveness of
the proposed framework is validated both quantitatively and qualitatively via
extensive experiments on three public datasets including Places2, CelebA and

growing research field, both within the relational database and the Semantic

specifically targeted at open-domain question answering using DBpedia, or
require large training datasets to translate a natural language question to
SPARQL in order to query the knowledge graph. Hence, these approaches often
cannot be applied directly to complex scientific datasets where no prior

  In this paper, we focus on the challenges of natural language processing over
knowledge graphs of scientific datasets. In particular, we introduce Bio-SODA,
a natural language processing engine that does not require training data in the
form of question-answer pairs for generating SPARQL queries. Bio-SODA uses a
generic graph-based approach for translating user questions to a ranked list of
SPARQL candidate queries. Furthermore, Bio-SODA uses a novel ranking algorithm
that includes node centrality as a measure of relevance for selecting the best
SPARQL candidate query. Our experiments with real-world datasets across several

discretized at scattered points using polyharmonic radial basis function

to achieve exponential convergence of discretization errors. The interpolations
are performed over local clouds of points and the Poisson equation is
collocated at each of the scattered points, resulting in a sparse set of
discrete equations for the unkown variables. To solve this set of equations, we
have developed a non-nested multilevel algorithm utilizing multiple
independently generated coarse sets of points. The restriction and prolongation
operators are also constructed with the same RBF interpolations procedure. The
performance of the algorithm for Dirichlet and all-Neumann boundary conditions
is evaluated in three model geometries using a manufactured solution. For
Dirichlet boundary conditions, rapid convergence is observed using SOR point
solver as the relaxation scheme. For cases of all-Neumann boundary conditions,
convergence is seen to slow down with the degree of the appended polynomial.
However, when the multilevel procedure is combined with a GMRES algorithm, the
convergence is seen to significantly improve. The GMRES accelerated multilevel
algorithm is included in a fractional step method to solve incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations.

  Pedestrian Detection","Pre-print version of a paper accepted to The Visual Computer",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a segmentation-based bounding box generation method for
omnidirectional pedestrian detection that enables detectors to tightly fit
bounding boxes to pedestrians without omnidirectional images for training. Due
to the wide angle of view, omnidirectional cameras are more cost-effective than
standard cameras and hence suitable for large-scale monitoring. The problem of
using omnidirectional cameras for pedestrian detection is that the performance
of standard pedestrian detectors is likely to be substantially degraded because
pedestrians' appearance in omnidirectional images may be rotated to any angle.
Existing methods mitigate this issue by transforming images during inference.
However, the transformation substantially degrades the detection accuracy and
speed. A recently proposed method obviates the transformation by training
detectors with omnidirectional images, which instead incurs huge annotation
costs. To obviate both the transformation and annotation works, we leverage an
existing large-scale object detection dataset. We train a detector with rotated
images and tightly fitted bounding box annotations generated from the
segmentation annotations in the dataset, resulting in detecting pedestrians in
omnidirectional images with tightly fitted bounding boxes. We also develop
pseudo-fisheye distortion augmentation, which further enhances the performance.
Extensive analysis shows that our detector successfully fits bounding boxes to
pedestrians and demonstrates substantial performance improvement.

proposed to preserve the semantic information of the person during pose
transfer. To ensure fine image details are realistic after pose translation, an
appearance discriminator is used while a pose discriminator is used to ensure
the pose of the transferred images will exactly be the same as the target pose.

security and privacy in its design. As concerns of privacy increased on the
Internet, security and privacy enhancements of DNS have been actively
investigated and deployed. Specially for user's privacy in DNS queries, several
relay-based anonymization schemes have been recently introduced, however, they
are vulnerable to the collusion of a relay with a full-service resolver, i.e.,
identities of users cannot be hidden to the resolver. This paper introduces a
new concept of a multiple-relay-based DNS for user anonymity in DNS queries,
called the mutualized oblivious DNS ($\mu$ODNS), by extending the concept of
existing relay-based schemes. The $\mu$ODNS introduces a small and reasonable
assumption that each user has at least one trusted/dedicated relay in a network
and mutually shares the dedicated one with others. The user just sets the
dedicated one as his next-hop, first relay, conveying his queries to the
resolver, and randomly chooses its $0$ or more subsequent relays shared by
other entities. Under this small assumption, the user's identity is concealed
to a target resolver in the $\mu$ODNS even if a certain (unknown) subset of
relays collude with the resolver. That is, in $\mu$ODNS, users can preserve
their privacy and anonymity just by paying a small cost of sharing its
resource. Moreover, we present a PoC implementation of $\mu$ODNS that is
publicly available on the Internet. We also show that by measurement of
round-trip-time for queries, and our PoC implementation of $\mu$ODNS achieves
the performance comparable to existing relay-based schemes.

anomaly occurrences and underlying generating processes, it is hard to
characterize them and obtain labeled data. Obtaining labeled data is especially
difficult in biomedical applications, where only trained domain experts can
provide labels, which often come in large diversity and complexity. Recently
presented approaches for unsupervised detection of visual anomalies approaches
omit the need for labeled data and demonstrate promising results in domains,
where anomalous samples significantly deviate from the normal appearance.
Despite promising results, the performance of such approaches still lags behind
supervised approaches and does not provide a one-fits-all solution. In this
work, we present an image-to-image translation-based framework that
significantly surpasses the performance of existing unsupervised methods and
approaches the performance of supervised methods in a challenging domain of

an open problem whether the convergence rate can be further improved without
sacrificing its generalization ability. %on how to exploit strong convexity to
further improve the convergence rate of AdaBelief. To this end, we make a first

FastAdaBelief that aims to exploit its strong convexity in order to achieve an

better considers strong convexity and prevents fluctuation, our proposed
FastAdaBelief demonstrates excellent generalization ability as well as superior

FastAdaBelief attains a data-dependant $O(\log T)$ regret bound, which is
substantially lower than AdaBelief. On the empirical side, we validate our
theoretical analysis with extensive experiments in both scenarios of strong and
non-strong convexity on three popular baseline models. Experimental results are
very encouraging: FastAdaBelief converges the quickest in comparison to all
mainstream algorithms while maintaining an excellent generalization ability, in
cases of both strong or non-strong convexity. FastAdaBelief is thus posited as

verification very complex. In this work, we propose two contributions. The
first is a method for identifying unexpected actions selected by POMCP with
respect to expert prior knowledge of the task. The second is a shielding
approach that prevents POMCP from selecting unexpected actions. The first
method is based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). It inspects traces
(i.e., sequences of belief-action-observation triplets) generated by POMCP to
compute the parameters of logical formulas about policy properties defined by
the expert. The second contribution is a module that uses online the logical
formulas to identify anomalous actions selected by POMCP and substitutes those
actions with actions that satisfy the logical formulas fulfilling expert
knowledge. We evaluate our approach on Tiger, a standard benchmark for POMDPs,
and a real-world problem related to velocity regulation in mobile robot
navigation. Results show that the shielded POMCP outperforms the standard POMCP
in a case study in which a wrong parameter of POMCP makes it select wrong

log-k-decomp requires only a logarithmic number of recursion levels and
additionally allows for highly parallelised pruning of the search space by
restriction to balanced separators. We provide detailed experimental evaluation

core research challenge with many applications. In recent years, various
techniques for calculating the ""value"" of individual training datapoints have
been proposed for explaining trained models. However, the value of a training
datapoint also depends on other selected training datapoints - a notion that is
not explicitly captured by existing methods. In this paper, we study the
problem of selecting high-value subsets of training data. The key idea is to
design a learnable framework for online subset selection, which can be learned
using mini-batches of training data, thus making our method scalable. This
results in a parameterized convex subset selection problem that is amenable to
a differentiable convex programming paradigm, thus allowing us to learn the
parameters of the selection model in end-to-end training. Using this framework,
we design an online alternating minimization-based algorithm for jointly
learning the parameters of the selection model and ML model. Extensive
evaluation on a synthetic dataset, and three standard datasets, show that our
algorithm finds consistently higher value subsets of training data, compared to
the recent state-of-the-art methods, sometimes ~20% higher value than existing
methods. The subsets are also useful in finding mislabelled training data. Our
algorithm takes running time comparable to the existing valuation functions.

reasonable notion of space for the lambda-calculus, but such an important

  In this paper we introduce a new intersection type system precisely measuring
the space consumption of the IAM on the typed term. Intersection types have
been repeatedly used to measure time, which they achieve by dropping
idempotency, turning intersections into multisets. Here we show that the space
consumption of the IAM is connected to a further structural modification,
turning multisets into trees. Tree intersection types lead to a finer

shed new light on the conjecture about reasonable space: we show that the usual
way of encoding Turing machines into the lambda calculus cannot be used to
prove that the space of the IAM is a reasonable cost model.

second order in the interaction. Here we argue that higher powers of
$\log(\omega)$ appearin the backscattering contribution at higher orders. We
show that these terms come from ""planar"" processes, which are effectively
one-dimensional. This is explicitly demonstated by extending a Fermi liquid to
the limit of $N \gg 1$ fermionic flavors, when only planar processes survive.
We sum the leading logarithms for the case of a 2D Fermi liquid near a nematic

orders in the interaction. For a repulsive interaction, the resulting rate is
logarithmically suppressed, and the result is valid down to $\omega = 0$. For
an attractive interaction, the ground state is an $s$-wave superconductor with
a gap $\Delta_0$. We show that in this case the scattering rate increases as
$\omega$ is reduced towards $\Delta_0$. At $\omega \geq \Delta_0$, the behavior
of the scattering rate is rather unconventional as many pairing channels
compete near a nematic critical point, and $s$-wave wins only by a narrow
margin. We take superconductivity into consideration and obtain the scattering
rate also at smaller $\omega \simeq \Delta_0$.

Kirchhoff-Love shells. Due to their conceptual simplicity, these algorithms are
readily applicable to the displacement and rotational coupling of trimmed,
non-conforming surfaces. However, the accuracy of the resulting solution
depends heavily on the choice of penalty parameters. Furthermore, the selection
of these coefficients is generally problem-dependent and is based on a
heuristic approach. Moreover, developing a penalty-like procedure that avoids
interface locking while retaining optimal accuracy is still an open question.
This work focuses on these challenges. In particular, we devise a penalty-like
strategy based on the $L^2$-projection of displacement and rotational coupling
terms onto a degree-reduced spline space defined on the corresponding
interface. Additionally, the penalty factors are completely defined by the
problem setup and are constructed to ensure optimality of the method. To
demonstrate this, we asses the performance of the proposed numerical framework
on a series of non-trimmed and trimmed multi-patch benchmarks discretized by
non-conforming meshes. We systematically observe a significant gain of accuracy
per degree-of-freedom and no interface locking phenomena compared to other
penalty-like approaches. Lastly, we perform a static shell analysis of a
complex engineering structure, namely the blade of a wind turbine.

the transit-timing variations of short-period low-mass rocky exoplanets. For
such purpose, we employ the recently-developed creep tide theory to compute
tidally-induced TTVs. We implement the creep tide in the recently-developed
Posidonius N-body code, thus allowing for a high-precision evolution of the
coupled spin-orbit dynamics of planetary systems. As a working example for the
analyses of tidally-induced TTVs, we apply our version of the code to the
K2-265 b planet. We analyse the dependence of tidally-induced TTVs with the
planetary rotation rate, uniform viscosity coefficient and eccentricity. Our
results show that the tidally-induced TTVs are more significant in the case
where the planet is trapped in non-synchronous spin-orbit resonances, in
particular the 3/2 and 2/1 spin-orbit resonant states. An analysis of the TTVs
induced separately by apsidal precession and tidally-induced orbital decay has
allowed for the conclusion that the latter effect is much more efficient at
causing high-amplitude TTVs than the former effect by 2 - 3 orders of
magnitude. We compare our findings for the tidally-induced TTVs obtained with
Posidonius with analytical formulations for the transit timings used in
previous works, and verified that the results for the TTVs coming from
Posidonius are in excellent agreement with the analytical formulations. These
results show that the new version of Posidonius containing the creep tide
theory implementation can be used to study more complex cases in the future.
For instance, the code can be used to study multiplanetary systems, in which
case planet-planet gravitational perturbations must be taken into account
additionally to tidal interactions to obtain the TTVs.

This leads to processes on graphs (or networks), where both the states of

our derivation we follow the basic paradigm of statistical mechanics: We start
from paradigmatic microscopic models and derive a Liouville-type equation in a

mean-field solution can only arise if the weight distributions between nodes of
equal states are concentrated. In a more interesting general case we propose a
suitable closure at the level of a two-particle distribution (including the
weight between them) and discuss some properties of the arising kinetic
equations. Moreover, we highlight some structure-preserving properties of this

understanding of social and emotional characteristic inherent to dialogue is
required. Chatbots in particular face the challenge of conveying human-like
behaviour while being restricted to one channel of interaction, i.e., text. The
goal of the presented work is thus to investigate whether characteristics of
social intelligence embedded in human-chatbot interactions are perceivable by
human interlocutors and if yes, whether such influences the experienced
interaction quality. Focusing on the social intelligence dimensions
Authenticity, Clarity and Empathy, we first used a questionnaire survey
evaluating the level of perception in text utterances, and then conducted a
Wizard of Oz study to investigate the effects of these utterances in a more
interactive setting. Results show that people have great difficulties
perceiving elements of social intelligence in text. While on the one hand they
find anthropomorphic behaviour pleasant and positive for the naturalness of a
dialogue, they may also perceive it as frightening and unsuitable when
expressed by an artificial agent in the wrong way or at the wrong time.

thermodynamically consistent step-flow model that (i) circumvents the
quasistatic approximation that prevails in the literature by accounting for the
dynamics of adatom diffusion on terraces and attachment-detachment at steps
(referred to as the dynamical effect), and (ii) generalizes the expression of
the step chemical potential by incorporating the necessary coupling between the
diffusion fields on adjacent terraces (referred to as the chemical effect).
Having previously shown that these effects can explain the onset of step
bunching without recourse to the inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel (iES) barrier or
other extraneous mechanisms, we are here interested in the evolution of step
bunches beyond the linear-stability regime. In particular, the numerical
resolution of the step-flow problem yields a robust power-law coarsening of the
surface profile, with the bunch height growing in time as $H\sim t^{1/2}$ and
the minimal interstep distance as a function of the number of steps in the
bunch cell obeying $\ell_{min}\sim N^{-2/3}$. Although these exponents have
previously been reported, this is the first time such scaling laws are obtained
in the absence of an iES barrier or adatom electromigration. In order to
validate our simulations, we take the continuum limit of the discrete step-flow
system, leading to a novel nonlinear evolution equation for the surface height.
We investigate the existence of self-similar solutions of this equation and
confirm the 1/2 coarsening exponent obtained numerically for $H$. We highlight
the influence of the combined dynamical-chemical effect and show that it can be
interpreted as an effective iES barrier in the standard BCF theory. Finally, we
use a Pad\'e approximant to derive an analytical expression for the velocity of
steadily moving step bunches and compare it to numerical simulations.

concentration robustness ($\alpha$-robustness), which is related to the
influence of the perturbation of the initial concentration of one species

preserving scalar tensor action that contains up to second order covariant
derivatives of the scalar field. A rotating stealth black hole solution is
constructed where the metric is given by the Myers-Perry spacetime with equal
momenta and the scalar field is identified with the Hamilton-Jacobi potential.
This nontrivial scalar field has an extra hair associated with the rest mass of
the test particle, and the solution does not require any fine tuning of the
coupling functions of the theory. Interestingly enough, we show that the
disformal transformation, generated by this scalar field, and with a constant
degree of disformality, leaves invariant (up to diffeomorphisms) the
Myers-Perry metric with equal momenta. This means that the hair of the scalar
field, along with the constant disformality parameter, can be consistently
absorbed into further redefinitions of the mass and of the single angular
parameter of the disformed metric. These results are extended in higher odd
dimensions with a Myers-Perry metric for which all the momenta are equal. The
key of the invariance under disformal transformation of the metric is mainly
the cohomogeneity-1 character of the Myers-Perry metric with equal momenta.
Starting from this observation, we consider a general class of cohomogeneity-1
metrics in arbitrary dimension, and we list the conditions ensuring that this
class of metrics remain invariant (up to diffeomorphisms) under a disformal
transformation with a constant degree of disformality and with a scalar field
with constant kinetic term. The extension to the Kerr-(A)dS case is also
considered where it is shown that rotating stealth solutions may exist provided
some fine tuning of the coupling functions of the scalar tensor theory.

  Reinforcement Learning","Accepted for publication in JMLR 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many reinforcement learning algorithms rely on value estimation, however, the
most widely used algorithms -- namely temporal difference algorithms -- can
diverge under both off-policy sampling and nonlinear function approximation.
Many algorithms have been developed for off-policy value estimation based on
the linear mean squared projected Bellman error (MSPBE) and are sound under
linear function approximation. Extending these methods to the nonlinear case
has been largely unsuccessful. Recently, several methods have been introduced
that approximate a different objective -- the mean-squared Bellman error (MSBE)
-- which naturally facilitate nonlinear approximation. In this work, we build
on these insights and introduce a new generalized MSPBE that extends the linear
MSPBE to the nonlinear setting. We show how this generalized objective unifies
previous work and obtain new bounds for the value error of the solutions of the
generalized objective. We derive an easy-to-use, but sound, algorithm to
minimize the generalized objective, and show that it is more stable across
runs, is less sensitive to hyperparameters, and performs favorably across four
control domains with neural network function approximation.

phase transitions, including some that are beyond the Landau symmetry breaking
theory, in condensed matter models. However, challenges remain in locating the
transition points with precision in several models with unconventional phases
such as the quantum spin liquid phase in spin-1 Kitaev-Heisenberg model. In
this work, we propose a novel approach, which we named the fidelity map, to
detect quantum phase transitions with higher accuracy and sensitivity as
compared to the conventional fidelity measures. Our scheme extends the fidelity
concept from a single dimension quantity to a multi-dimensional quantity, and
use a meta-heuristic algorithm to search for the critical points that globally
maximized the fidelity within each phase. We test the scheme in three
interacting condensed matter models, namely the spin-1 Kitaev Heisenberg model
which consists of the quantum spin liquid phase and the topological Haldane
phase, the spin-1/2 XXZ model which possesses a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition, and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model that exhibits a topological
quantum phase transition. The result shows that the fidelity map can capture a
wide range of phase transitions accurately, thus providing a new tool to study
phase transitions in unseen models without prior knowledge of the system's
symmetry.

symmetry takes place before or during inflation, and in which axion dark matter

Background isocurvature bounds. Dark matter isocurvature is thought to be
suppressed in models with axion-inflaton interactions, for which axion
perturbations are assumed to freeze at horizon crossing during inflation.
However, this assumption can be an oversimplification due to the interactions
themselves. In particular, non-perturbative effects during reheating may lead
to a dramatic growth of axion perturbations. We perform lattice calculations in
two models in which the Peccei-Quinn field participates in inflation. We find
that the growth of axion perturbations is such that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry
is restored for an axion decay constant $f_A\lesssim10^{16}$-$10^{17}$ GeV,
leading to an over-abundance of dark matter, unless $f_A \lesssim 2 \times
10^{11}$ GeV. For $f_A\gtrsim10^{16}$-$10^{17}$ GeV we still find a large
growth of axion perturbations at low momentum, such that a naive extrapolation
to CMB scales suggests a violation of the isocurvature bounds.

about how to combine information from the recent and distant past. In the
context of classifying sleep status from actigraphy, Webster's rescoring rules
offer one popular solution based on the long-term patterns in the output of a
moving-window model. Unfortunately, the question of how to optimize rescoring
rules for any given setting has remained unsolved. To address this problem and
expand the possible use cases of rescoring rules, we propose rephrasing these
rules in terms of epoch-specific features. Our features take two general forms:
(1) the time lag between now and the most recent [or closest upcoming] bout of
time spent in a given state, and (2) the length of the most recent [or closest
upcoming] bout of time spent in a given state. Given any initial moving window
model, these features can be defined recursively, allowing for straightforward
optimization of rescoring rules. Joint optimization of the moving window model
and the subsequent rescoring rules can also be implemented using gradient-based
optimization software, such as Tensorflow. Beyond binary classification
problems (e.g., sleep-wake), the same approach can be applied to summarize
long-term patterns for multi-state classification problems (e.g., sitting,
walking, or stair climbing). We find that optimized rescoring rules improve the
performance of sleep-wake classifiers, achieving accuracy comparable to that of
certain neural network architectures.

peephole connections, after manipulating the computer-simulation. Our neural
network modes are trained on the daily time-series dataset during seven years
(from 2014 to 2020). From the trained results for 2500, 5000, and 7500 epochs,
we obtain the predicted accuracies of the meteorological factors produced from
outputs in ten metropolitan cities (Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, Incheon,
Gwangju, Pohang, Mokpo, Tongyeong, and Jeonju). The error statistics is found
from the result of outputs, and we compare these values to each other after the
manipulation of five neural networks. As using the long-short-term memory model
in testing 1 (the average temperature predicted from the input layer with six
input nodes), Tonyeong has the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) value of
0.866 $(%)$ in summer from the computer-simulation in order to predict the
temperature. To predict the humidity, the RMSE is shown the lowest value of
5.732 $(%)$, when using the long short-term memory model in summer in Mokpo in
testing 2 (the average humidity predicted from the input layer with six input
nodes). Particularly, the long short-term memory model is is found to be more
accurate in forecasting daily levels than other neural network models in
temperature and humidity forecastings. Our result may provide a
computer-simuation basis for the necessity of exploring and develping a novel
neural network evaluation method in the future.

disputable topics in social studies. Many researchers devote their work to
identifying the factors that influence it most. Bulgaria is one of the EU
member states with the highest poverty levels. Regional facets of social
exclusion and risks of poverty among the population are a key priority of the
National Development Strategy for the third decade of 21st century. In order to
mitigate the regional poverty levels it is necessary for the social policy
makers to pay more attention to the various factors expected to influence these
levels. Results: Poverty reduction is observed in most areas of the country.
The regions with obviously favorable developments are Sofia district, Pernik,
Pleven, Lovech, Gabrovo, Veliko Tarnovo, Silistra, Shumen, Stara Zagora,
Smolyan, Kyustendil and others. Increased levels of poverty are found for
Razgrad and Montana districts. It was fond that the reduction in the risk of
poverty is associated to the increase in employment, investment, and housing.
Conclusion: The social policy making needs to be aware of the fact that the
degree of exposition to risk of poverty and social exclusion significantly
relates to the levels of regional employment, investment and housing.

focused on raw popularity across all students, and one focused on proportional
likelihoods of co-enrollment with other courses. A variety of network metrics
are calculated to evaluate the course networks. Academic departments and
high-level academic categories, such as Humanities vs STEM, are studied for
their influence over course groupings. The identification of hub courses has

describes a physically motivated local hidden-variable model based on

Detection efficiencies for the model are within the bounds permitted for local
realism and, interestingly, exhibit statistical correlations between detectors,

the cost of decreased detection efficiency. A curious emergent feature of the

The motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the
investigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still
achieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered in
real-time forecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are
examined on the data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM,

each method to forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths in Australia and

  This study is novel as it carries out a comprehensive evaluation of the
aforementioned three deep learning methods and their bidirectional extensions
to perform prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new death rate time series. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bi-GRU and Bi-Conv-LSTM

Friedman statistical test. The results show that the bidirectional models have

concatenates the speech segments extracted from the source domain data. To get
the time stamp, a phone prediction branch is added to the RNN-T model by

requirements for the efficiency of airport ground support services. In the
existing ground support research, there has not yet been a process model that
directly obtains support from the ground support log to study the causal
relationship between service nodes and flight delays. Most ground support
studies mainly use machine learning methods to predict flight delays, and the
flight support model they are based on is an ideal model. The study did not
conduct an in-depth study of the causal mechanism behind the ground support
link and did not reveal the true cause of flight delays. Therefore, there is a
certain deviation in the prediction of flight delays by machine learning, and
there is a certain deviation between the ideal model based on the research and
the actual service process. Therefore, it is of practical significance to
obtain the process model from the guarantee log and analyze its causality.
However, the existing process causal factor discovery methods only do certain
research when the assumption of causal sufficiency is established and does not
consider the existence of latent variables. Therefore, this article proposes a
framework to realize the discovery of process causal factors without assuming
causal sufficiency. The optimized fuzzy mining process model is used as the
service benchmark model, and the local causal discovery algorithm is used to
discover the causal factors. Under this framework, this paper proposes a new
Markov blanket discovery algorithm that does not assume causal sufficiency to
discover causal factors and uses benchmark data sets for testing. Finally, the
actual flight service data is used.

quantum mechanics may be interpreted as a contextual hidden variable theory. It
is shown that such a hidden variable description can be viewed as either
contextual in the random variables mapping hidden states to observable outcomes
or in the probability measure on the hidden state space. The latter view
suggests that this apparent contextuality may be interpreted as a simple
consequence of measurement disturbance, wherein the initial hidden state is
altered through interaction with the measuring device, thereby giving rise to a
possibly different final hidden variable state from which the measurement
outcome is obtained. In light of this observation, a less restrictive and,
arguably, more reasonable definition of noncontextuality is suggested. To prove
that such a description is possible, an explicit and, in this sense,
noncontextual hidden variable model is constructed which reproduces all quantum
theoretic predictions for the Mermin-Peres square. A critical analysis of some
recent and proposed experimental tests of contextuality is also provided.
Although the discussion is restricted to a four-dimensional Hilbert space, the
approach and conclusions are expected to generalize to any Hilbert space.

  for 2-D Image Classification","10 pages 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are computationally and memory intensive, which
makes their hardware implementation a challenging task especially for resource
constrained devices such as IoT nodes. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces a new method to improve DNNs performance by fusing approximate
computing with data reuse techniques to be used for image recognition
applications. DNNs weights are approximated based on the linear and quadratic
approximation methods during the training phase, then, all of the weights are
replaced with the linear/quadratic coefficients to execute the inference in a
way where different weights could be computed using the same coefficients. This
leads to a repetition of the weights across the processing element (PE) array,
which in turn enables the reuse of the DNN sub-computations (computational
reuse) and leverage the same data (data reuse) to reduce DNNs computations,
memory accesses, and improve energy efficiency albeit at the cost of increased
training time. Complete analysis for both MNIST and CIFAR 10 datasets is
presented for image recognition , where LeNet 5 revealed a reduction in the
number of parameters by a factor of 1211.3x with a drop of less than 0.9% in
accuracy. When compared to the state of the art Row Stationary (RS) method, the
proposed architecture saved 54% of the total number of adders and multipliers
needed. Overall, the proposed approach is suitable for IoT edge devices as it
reduces the memory size requirement as well as the number of needed memory
accesses.

distinguish affine quantization are emphasized, especially, that affine
quantization differs from canonical quantization only by the choice of
classical variables promoted to quantum operators. Coherent states are used to
ensure proper quantizations are physically correct. While quantization of
nonrenormalizable covariant scalars and gravity are difficult, we focus on
appropriate ultralocal scalars and gravity which are fully soluble while, in

the validity of affine quantizations for nonrenormalizable covariant scalar
fields and Einstein's gravity.

this work, Euler's approach consists of two parts: geometrical and mechanical.
The geometrical part contains most of the analytical developments, in which
Euler makes use of Cartesian and spherical trigonometry as well - the latter
not always in a clear enough way. With few sketches to show the geometrical
constructions envisaged by Euler - represented by several geometrical variables
-, it is a hard to follow publication. The Translator, on trying to clear the
way to the non-specialized reader, used the best of his abilities to add his
own figures to the translation. In the latter part of the work, Euler
particularizes his developments to the Moon, ending up with eight coupled
differential equations for resolving the perturbed motion of this celestial
body, which makes his claim of an ""easy method"" as being rather fallacious.
Despite showing great analytical skills, Euler did not give indications on how
this system of equations could be solved, which renders his efforts practically
useless in the determination of the variations of the nodal line and
inclination of the Moon's orbit.

Doctors diagnose MCI based on various clinical examinations, which are
expensive and the diagnosis results rely on the knowledge of doctors.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a robot diagnostic system to eliminate
the influence of human factors and obtain a higher accuracy rate. In this
paper, we propose a novel Group Feature Domain Adversarial Neural Network
(GF-DANN) for amnestic MCI (aMCI) diagnosis, which involves two important
modules. A Group Feature Extraction (GFE) module is proposed to reduce
individual differences by learning group-level features through adversarial
learning. A Dual Branch Domain Adaptation (DBDA) module is carefully designed
to reduce the distribution difference between the source and target domain in a
domain adaption way. On three types of data set, GF-DANN achieves the best
accuracy compared with classic machine learning and deep learning methods. On
the DMS data set, GF-DANN has obtained an accuracy rate of 89.47%, and the
sensitivity and specificity are 90% and 89%. In addition, by comparing three
EEG data collection paradigms, our results demonstrate that the DMS paradigm
has the potential to build an aMCI diagnose robot system.

algorithm called Dynamic Cat Swarm Optimization. The formulation is through
modifying the existing Cat Swarm Optimization. The original Cat Swarm
Optimization suffers from the shortcoming of 'premature convergence', which is
the possibility of entrapment in local optima which usually happens due to the
off-balance between exploration and exploitation phases. Therefore, the
proposed algorithm suggests a new method to provide a proper balance between
these phases by modifying the selection scheme and the seeking mode of the
algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, 23 classical
test functions, 10 modern test functions (CEC 2019) and a real world scenario
are used. In addition, the Dimension-wise diversity metric is used to measure
the percentage of the exploration and exploitation phases. The optimization
results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which ranks first
compared to several well-known algorithms available in the literature.
Furthermore, statistical methods and graphs are also used to further confirm
the outperformance of the algorithm. Finally, the conclusion as well as future
directions to further improve the algorithm are discussed.
