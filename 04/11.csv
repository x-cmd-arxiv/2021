implicit neural representations. Our approach represents a scalar field as a
learned function, wherein a neural network maps a point in the domain to an
output scalar value. By setting the number of weights of the neural network to
be smaller than the input size, we achieve compressed representations of scalar
fields, thus framing compression as a type of function approximation. Combined
with carefully quantizing network weights, we show that this approach yields
highly compact representations that outperform state-of-the-art volume
compression approaches. The conceptual simplicity of our approach enables a
number of benefits, such as support for time-varying scalar fields, optimizing
to preserve spatial gradients, and random-access field evaluation. We study the
impact of network design choices on compression performance, highlighting how
simple network architectures are effective for a broad range of volumes.

as they help ensure unidirectionality and provide crucial protection from
undesirable reflections. While commercial isolators are exclusively built on
magneto-optic (MO) principles they are not readily implemented within photonic
integrated circuits due to the need for specialized materials. Importantly, the
MO effect is generally weak, especially at shorter wavelengths. These
challenges as a whole have motivated extensive research on non-MO alternatives.
To date, however, no alternative technology has managed to simultaneously
combine linearity (i.e. no frequency shift), linear response (i.e. input-output
scaling), ultralow insertion loss, and large directional contrast on-chip. Here
we demonstrate an optical isolator design that leverages the unbeatable
transparency of a short, high quality dielectric waveguide, with the
near-perfect attenuation from a critically-coupled absorber. Our design concept
is implemented using a lithium niobate racetrack resonator in which phonon
mediated Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) breaks the chiral symmetry of the
resonant modes. We demonstrate on-chip optical isolators at wavelengths one
octave apart near 1550 nm and 780 nm, fabricated from the same lithium
niobate-on-insulator wafer. Linear optical isolation is demonstrated with
simultaneously <1 dB insertion loss, >39 dB contrast, and bandwidth as wide as
the optical mode that is used. Our results outperform the current best-in-class
MO isolator on-chip on both insertion loss and isolator figures-of-merit, and
demonstrate a lithographically defined wavelength adaptability that cannot yet
be achieved with any MO isolator.

practical subjects as varied as speech processing, natural language processing,

automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have recently become popular.
Specifically, non-autoregressive modeling, which boasts fast inference and
performance comparable to conventional autoregressive methods, is an emerging
research topic. In the context of natural language processing, the
bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model has
received widespread attention, partially due to its ability to infer
contextualized word representations and to enable superior performance for
downstream tasks while needing only simple fine-tuning. Motivated by the
success, we intend to view speech recognition as a downstream task of BERT,
thus an ASR system is expected to be deduced by performing fine-tuning.
Consequently, to not only inherit the advantages of non-autoregressive ASR
models but also enjoy the benefits of a pre-trained language model (e.g.,
BERT), we propose a non-autoregressive Transformer-based end-to-end ASR model

thanks to a new set of heliocentric distances, 120808 in total. About a third
of the 150223 entries are located in the newly added portion of the Galactic
plane. A first classification based on detection at 70 $\mu$m as a signature of
ongoing star-forming activity distinguishes between protostellar sources
(23~per cent of the total) and starless sources, with the latter further
classified as gravitationally bound (pre-stellar) or unbound. The integral of
the spectral energy distribution, including ancillary photometry from
$\lambda=21$ to 1100 $\mu$m, gives the source luminosity and other bolometric
quantities, while a modified black body fitted to data for $\lambda \geq 160\,
\mu$m yields mass and temperature. All tabulated clump properties are then
derived using photometry and heliocentric distance, where possible. Statistics
of these quantities are discussed with respect to both source Galactic location
and evolutionary stage. No strong differences in the distributions of
evolutionary indicators are found between the inner and outer Galaxy. However,
masses and densities in the inner Galaxy are on average significantly larger,
resulting in a higher number of clumps that are candidates to host massive star
formation. Median behaviour of distance-independent parameters tracing source
evolutionary status is examined as a function of the Galactocentric radius,
showing no clear evidence of correlation with spiral arm positions.

processes are efficient. We find that a change in Hubble rate can have a
significant impact on when the weak sphalerons become active. As a result of a
change in the evolution of baryonic asymmetry, alters the evolution of
hypermagnetic field amplitude. It is known that if the hypermagnetic field
amplitude is large enough, it can save the baryon asymmetry from diminishing.

complement high renewables. However, the real-time energy management of
microgrids with battery ESS is challenging in two aspects: 1) the evolution
process of battery energy level is across-time coupled; 2) uncertainties
unavoidably arise in the forecasting process for renewable generation. In this
paper, a tube-based model predictive control (MPC) approach is innovatively
proposed in accommodating the real-time energy management of microgrids with
battery ESS. Firstly, a real-time operation model of battery, including the
degradation cost and time-aware SoC range, is proposed for the battery ESS. In
particular, the battery feature shallower-cheaper is depicted and the terminal
SoC requirement is achieved. Secondly, two cascaded MPC controllers are
designed in the proposed tube-based MPC, in which reference trajectories are
generated by the nominal MPC without uncertainties, and then the ancillary MPC
steers the actual trajectories to the nominal ones upon the realization of
uncertainties. Specifically, in this paper, the battery SoC is viewed as the
state variable of the system, while the generator power output and exchange
power with the utility are seen as control variables. Lastly, numerous case
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including both
the low and high penetration level of renewables. Additional Monte Carlo
simulations of consecutive 365 days show that the competitive ratio of the
proposed approach is excellently below 1.10.

computing is conducive to training deep learning turbulence models using
indirect observations. This paper demonstrates the viability of this approach
and presents an end-to-end differentiable framework for training deep neural
networks to learn eddy viscosity models from indirect observations derived from
the velocity and pressure fields. The framework consists of a Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver and a neural-network-represented turbulence model,
each accompanied by its derivative computations. For computing the
sensitivities of the indirect observations to the Reynolds stress field, we use
the continuous adjoint equations for the RANS equations, while the gradient of
the neural network is obtained via its built-in automatic differentiation
capability. We demonstrate the ability of this approach to learn the true
underlying turbulence closure when one exists by training models using
synthetic velocity data from linear and nonlinear closures. We also train a
linear eddy viscosity model using synthetic velocity measurements from direct
numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations for which no true
underlying linear closure exists. The trained deep-neural-network turbulence
model showed predictive capability on similar flows.

exoplanets are made of, how they formed and how they evolve, by surveying a
diverse sample of about 1000 extrasolar planets, simultaneously in visible and
infrared wavelengths. It is the first mission dedicated to measuring the
chemical composition and thermal structures of hundreds of transiting
exoplanets, enabling planetary science far beyond the boundaries of the Solar
System. The payload consists of an off-axis Cassegrain telescope (primary
mirror 1100 mm x 730 mm ellipse) and two separate instruments (FGS and AIRS)
covering simultaneously 0.5-7.8 micron spectral range. The satellite is best
placed into an L2 orbit to maximise the thermal stability and the field of
regard. The payload module is passively cooled via a series of V-Groove
radiators; the detectors for the AIRS are the only items that require active
cooling via an active Ne JT cooler. The Ariel payload is developed by a
consortium of more than 50 institutes from 16 ESA countries, which include the
UK, France, Italy, Belgium, Poland, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Portugal,
Czech Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Estonia, and a NASA
contribution.

can be used to construct generalizations of the classical Thompson's groups
$F$, $T$, and $V$. Given a family of groups $(G_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ with a

in this paper we find some mild, natural conditions under which the group von

instance, if the $d$-ary cloning system is ""fully compatible"" and ""diverse""
then we prove that $\mathcal{L}(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type $\textrm{II}_1$
factor. If moreover the $d$-ary cloning system is ""uniform"" and ""slightly pure""

$\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)$ is inner amenable. Examples of $d$-ary cloning systems

human resources to study and manage them. Nevertheless, the need for these
documents to be accessed efficiently and effectively is evident in numerous
purposes. A blog, news article, or technical note is considered a relatively
long text since the reader aims to learn the subject based on keywords or
topics. Our approach consists of a combination of two models: graph centrality
features and textural features. The proposed method has been used to extract
the best keyword among the candidate keywords with an optimal combination of
graph centralities, such as degree, betweenness, eigenvector, closeness
centrality and etc, and textural, such as Casing, Term position, Term frequency
normalization, Term different sentence, Part Of Speech tagging. There have also
been attempts to distinguish keywords from candidate phrases and consider them
on separate keywords. For evaluating the proposed method, seven datasets were

  Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimisation for polyp localisation","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the first cause of death in many countries. CRC
originates from a small clump of cells on the lining of the colon called
polyps, which over time might grow and become malignant. Early detection and
removal of polyps are therefore necessary for the prevention of colon cancer.
In this paper, we introduce an ensemble of medical polyp segmentation
algorithms. Based on an observation that different segmentation algorithms will
perform well on different subsets of examples because of the nature and size of
training sets they have been exposed to and because of method-intrinsic
factors, we propose to measure the confidence in the prediction of each
algorithm and then use an associate threshold to determine whether the
confidence is acceptable or not. An algorithm is selected for the ensemble if
the confidence is below its associate threshold. The optimal threshold for each
segmentation algorithm is found by using Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm
Optimization (CLPSO), a swarm intelligence algorithm. The Dice coefficient, a
popular performance metric for image segmentation, is used as the fitness
criteria. Experimental results on two polyp segmentation datasets MICCAI2015
and Kvasir-SEG confirm that our ensemble achieves better results compared to
some well-known segmentation algorithms.

  Characterization of lower semicontinuity and relaxation","25 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on recent developments in the theory of fractional Sobolev spaces, an
interesting new class of nonlocal variational problems has emerged in the
literature. These problems, which are the focus of this work, involve integral
functionals that depend on Riesz fractional gradients instead of ordinary
gradients and are considered subject to a complementary-value condition. With
the goal of establishing a comprehensive existence theory, we provide a full
characterization for the weak lower semicontinuity of these functionals under
suitable growth assumptions on the integrands. In doing so, we surprisingly
identify quasiconvexity, which is intrinsic to the standard vectorial calculus
of variations, as the natural notion also in the fractional setting. In the
absence of quasiconvexity, we determine a representation formula for the
corresponding relaxed functionals, obtained via partial quasiconvexification
outside the region where complementary values are prescribed. Thus, in contrast
to classical results, the relaxation process induces a structural change in the
functional, turning the integrand from a homogeneous into an inhomogeneous one.
Our proofs rely crucially on an inherent relation between classical and
fractional gradients, which we extend to Sobolev spaces, enabling us to
transition between the two settings.

cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, that can be positive or negative. The linear
instability of these metrics in the case $\Lambda <0$, has already been
established. In the case $\Lambda>0$, it was found in a recent analysis that
the perturbation equations admit unstable modes. The analysis was based on the
construction of a gauge invariant function of the metric perturbation
coefficients, called here $W(y)$. This function satisfied a linear second order
equation that could be used to set up a boundary value problem determining the
allowed, real or purely imaginary frequencies for the perturbations.
Nevertheless, the relation of these solutions to the full spectrum of
perturbations, and, therefore, to the evolution of arbitrary perturbations,
remained open. In this paper we consider again the perturbations of the
Linet-Tian metric with $\Lambda >0$, and show, using a form of the Darboux
transformation, that one can associate with the perturbation equations a self
adjoint problem that provides a solution to the completeness and spectrum of
the perturbations. This is also used to construct the explicit relation between
the solutions of the gauge invariant equation for $W(y)$, and the evolution of
arbitrary initial data, thus solving the problem that remained open in the
previous study. Numerical methods are then used to confirm the existence of
unstable modes as a part of the complete spectrum of the perturbations, thus
establishing the linear gravitational instability of the Linet-Tian metrics

projected in the SNR to construct color-magnitude diagrams and compare the

peculiar radial velocities as diagnostics of surviving companions. We further
use the HST and Gaia data to inspect proper motions of stars for complementary

and if in addition the two measures are strongly $c$-compatible, then there is
an optimal plan concentrated on a $c$-subgradient of a $c$-class function. This

$c$-compatibility implies a strong connectivity result for a directed graph
associated with an optimal map. Strong connectivity of the graph implies that
the $c$-cyclic monotonicity of the support set (which follows from classical
reasoning) guarantees its $c$-path-boundedness, implying, in turn, the
existence of a potential. We also give a constructive proof, in the case when

translation by considering the sentiment scores of the source sentence and
translation on a continuous interval, rather than using e.g. binary
classification, allowing for more fine-grained selection of translation
candidates. The results of human evaluations show that, in comparison to the

digital surface models (DSMs) constructed from multiple satellite images. In
this study the uncertainty in surface geometry is separated into two spatial
components; global error that affects the absolute position of the surface, and
local error that varies from surface point to surface point. The global error
component is caused by inaccuracy in the satellite imaging process, mainly due
to uncertainty in the satellite position and orientation (pose) during image
collection. A key result of the investigation is a new algorithm for
determining the absolute geoposition of the DSM that takes into account the
pose covariance of each satellite during image collection. This covariance
information is used to weigh the evidence from each image in the computation of
the global position of the DSM. The use of covariance information significantly
decreases the overall uncertainty in global position. The paper also describes
an approach to the prediction of local error in the DSM surface. The observed
variance in surface position within a single stereo surface reconstruction
defines the local horizontal error. The variance in the fused set of elevations
from multiple stereo pairs at a single DSM location defines the local vertical
error. These accuracy predictions are compared to ground truth provided by
LiDAR scans of the same geographic region of interest.

arrays of triangular nano-holes of aluminum using a self-consistent methodology
based on the hydrodynamics-Maxwell-Bloch approach. It is shown that angular
polarization patterns of the far-field second harmonic response abide to
three-fold symmetry constraints on tensors. When a molecular layer is added to
the system and its parameters are adjusted to achieve the strong coupling
regime between a localized plasmon mode and molecular excitons, Rabi splitting
is observed from occurrence of both single- and two-photon transition peaks
within the SHG power spectrum. It is argued that the splitting observed for
both transitions results from direct transitions between lower and upper
polaritonic states of the strongly coupled system. This interpretation can be
accounted by a tailored three-level quantum model, with results in agreement
with the unbiased numerical approach. Our results suggest the hybrid states
formed in strongly coupled systems directly contribute to the nonlinear
dynamics. This opens new directions in designing THz sources and nonlinear

problem subject to a knapsack and a $k$-system constraints. The input of our
problem is a set of items, where each item has a particular state drawn from a
known prior distribution. However, the state of an item is initially unknown,
one must select an item in order to reveal the state of that item. There is a
utility function which is defined over items and states. Our objective is to
sequentially select a group of items to maximize the expected utility. Although
the cardinality-constrained non-monotone adaptive submodular maximization has
been well studied in the literature, whether there exists a constant
approximation solution for the knapsack-constrained or $k$-system constrained
adaptive submodular maximization problem remains an open problem. It fact, it
has only been settled given the additional assumption of pointwise
submodularity. In this paper, we remove the common assumption on pointwise
submodularity and propose the first constant approximation solutions for both
cases. Inspired by two recent studies on non-monotone adaptive submodular
maximization, we develop a sampling-based randomized algorithm that achieves a
$\frac{1}{10}$ approximation for the case of a knapsack constraint and that
achieves a $\frac{1}{2k+4}$ approximation ratio for the case of a $k$-system
constraint.

linear parabolic PDEs with spatially varying coefficients and bilateral
actuation. By making use of the folding technique, a system representation with
unilateral actuation is obtained, allowing to apply the standard backstepping
transformation. To ensure the regularity of the solution, the folded system is
subject to unusual folding boundary conditions, which lead to additional
boundary couplings between the PDEs. Therefore, the solution of the
corresponding kernel equations determining the transformations is a very
challenging problem. A systematic approach to derive the corresponding integral
equations is proposed, allowing to solve them with the method of successive
approximations. By making use of a Volterra and a Volterra-Fredholm
transformation, the closed-loop system is mapped into a cascade of stable
parabolic systems. This allows a simple proof of exponential stability in the
$L_2$-norm with the decay rate as design parameter. The bilateral state

  Construction of a Masonry Arch","17 pages + 4 page appendix",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Geometrically complex masonry structures (e.g., arches, domes, vaults) are
traditionally built with expensive scaffolding or falsework to provide
stability during construction. The process of building such structures can
potentially be improved through the use of multiple robots working together in
a cooperative assembly framework. Here a robot is envisioned as both a
placement and external support agent during fabrication - the unfinished
structure is supported in such a way that scaffolding is not required. The goal
of this paper is to present and validate the efficacy of three cooperative
fabrication approaches using two or three robots, for the scaffold-free
construction of a stable masonry arch from which a medium-span vault is built.
A simplified numerical method to represent a masonry structure is first
presented and validated to analyse systems composed of discrete volumetric
elements. This method is then used to evaluate the effect of the three
cooperative robotic fabrication strategies on the stability performance of the
central arch. The sequential method and cantilever method, which utilize two
robotic arms, are shown to be viable methods, but have challenges related to
scalability and robustness. By adding a third robotic agent, it becomes
possible to determine a structurally optimal fabrication sequence through a
multi-objective optimization process. The optimized three robot method is shown
to significantly improve the structural behavior over all fabrication steps.
The modeling approaches presented in this paper are broadly formulated and
widely applicable for the analysis of cooperative robotic fabrication sequences
for the construction of discrete element structures across scales and
materials.

of initial-boundary value problems for linear as well as for a particular class
of nonlinear partial differential equations called integrable. If the latter
equations are formulated in two dimensions (either one space and one time, or
two space dimensions), the UTM expresses the solution in terms of a matrix
Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem with explicit dependence on the independent
variables. For nonlinear integrable evolution equations, such as the celebrated
nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation, the associated jump matrices are
computed in terms of the initial conditions and all boundary values. The
unknown boundary values are characterized in terms of the initial datum and the
given boundary conditions via the analysis of the so-called global relation. In
general, this analysis involves the solution of certain nonlinear equations. In
certain cases, called linearizable, it is possible to bypass this nonlinear
step. In these cases, the UTM solves the given initial-boundary value problem
with the same level of efficiency as the well-known inverse scattering
transform solves the initial value problem on the infinite line. We show here
that the initial-boundary value problem on a finite interval with $x$-periodic
boundary conditions (which can alternatively be viewed as the initial value
problem on a circle), belongs to the linearizable class. Indeed, by employing
certain transformations of the associated RH problem and by using the global
relation, the relevant jump matrices can be expressed explicitly in terms of
the so-called scattering data, which are computed in terms of the initial
datum. Details are given for NLS, but similar considerations are valid for
other well-known integrable evolution equations, including the Korteweg-de

influence the phonon dynamics and lead to the helicity of acoustic phonons,
namely, two transverse phonon modes mix with each other to form a circular

the phonon angular momentum reverses its sign for opposite momenta due to time
reversal symmetry. The phonon helicity can be probed through measuring the

environments. We address, in particular, the problem of inductive biases and
their impact on the data collection process. To be effective and robust,
activity recognition systems must take these biases into account at all levels
and model them as hyperparameters by which they can be controlled. Whether it
is a bias related to sensor measurement, transmission protocol, sensor
deployment topology, heterogeneity, dynamicity, or stochastic effects, it is
important to understand their substantial impact on the quality of activity
recognition models. This study highlights the need to separate the different
types of biases arising in real situations so that machine learning models,
e.g., adapt to the dynamicity of these environments, resist to sensor failures,
and follow the evolution of the sensors topology. We propose a metamodeling
process in which the sensor data is structured in layers. The lower layers
encode the various biases linked to transformations, transmissions, and
topology of data. The upper layers encode biases related to the data itself.
This way, it becomes easier to model hyperparameters and follow changes in the
data acquisition infrastructure. We illustrate our approach on the SHL dataset

under real conditions. The trade-offs exposed and the broader implications of
our approach are discussed with alternative techniques to encode and

solved by alternating gradient descent/ascent algorithms. Such a formulation
treats the adversarial and the defending players equally, which is undesirable
because only the defending player contributes to the generalization
performance. To address this issue, we propose Stackelberg Adversarial
Regularization (SALT), which formulates adversarial regularization as a
Stackelberg game. This formulation induces a competition between a leader and a
follower, where the follower generates perturbations, and the leader trains the
model subject to the perturbations. Different from conventional approaches, in
SALT, the leader is in an advantageous position. When the leader moves, it
recognizes the strategy of the follower and takes the anticipated follower's
outcomes into consideration. Such a leader's advantage enables us to improve
the model fitting to the unperturbed data. The leader's strategic information
is captured by the Stackelberg gradient, which is obtained using an unrolling
algorithm. Our experimental results on a set of machine translation and natural
language understanding tasks show that SALT outperforms existing adversarial
regularization baselines across all tasks. Our code is available at

that may correlate with this contamination. We introduce a new stellar activity
indicator called the Stellar Activity F-statistic for Exoplanet surveys (SAFE)
that has higher statistical power (i.e., probability of detecting a true
stellar activity signal) than many traditional stellar activity indicators in a
simulation study of an active region on a Sun-like star with moderate to high
signal-to-noise. Also through simulation, the SAFE is demonstrated to be
associated with the projected area on the visible side of the star covered by
active regions. We also demonstrate that the SAFE detects statistically
significant stellar activity in most of the spectra for HD 22049, a star known
to have high stellar variability. Additionally, the SAFE is calculated for
recent observations of the three low-variability stars HD 34411, HD 10700, and
HD 3651, the latter of which is known to have a planetary companion. As
expected, the SAFE for these three only occasionally detects activity.

equations (SDEs), we evaluate the safety of the system through
characterizations of its exit time moments. We lift the (possibly nonlinear)
dynamics into the space of the occupation and exit measures to obtain a set of
linear evolution equations which depend on the infinitesimal generator of the
SDE. Coupled with appropriate semidefinite positive matrix constraints, this
yields a moment-based approach for the computation of exit time moments of SDEs
with polynomial drift and diffusion dynamics. However, the existing moment
approach suffers from drawbacks which impede its applicability to the analysis
of higher dimensional physical systems. To apply the existing approach, the
dynamics of the systems are limited to polynomials of the state - excluding a
large majority of real world examples. Computational scalability is also poor
as the dimensionality of the state increases, largely due to the combinatorial
growth of the optimization program. In this paper, we propose changes to the
existing moment method to make feasible the safety analysis of higher
dimensional physical systems. The restriction to polynomial dynamics is lifted
by using a state augmentation method which allows one to generate the evolution
equations for a broader class of nonlinear stochastic systems. We then
reformulate the constraints of the optimization to mitigate the computational
limitations associated with an increase in state dimensionality. We employ our
methodology on two example processes to characterize their safety via expected

guaranteed quality of service(QoS), radio access network(RAN) slicing becomes
an important aspect in implementation of next generation wireless systems(5G).
RAN slicing involves division of network resources into many logical segments
where each segment has specific QoS and can serve users of mobile virtual
network operator(MVNO) with these requirements. This allows the Network
Operator(NO) to provide service to multiple MVNOs each with different service
requirements. Efficient allocation of the available resources to slices becomes
vital in determining number of users and therefore, number of MVNOs that a NO
can support. In this work, we study the problem of Modulation and Coding
Scheme(MCS) aware RAN slicing(MaRS) in the context of a wireless system having
MVNOs which have users with minimum data rate requirement. Channel Quality
Indicator(CQI) report sent from each user in the network determines the MCS
selected, which in turn determines the achievable data rate. But the channel
conditions might not remain the same for the entire duration of user being
served. For this reason, we consider the channel conditions to be dynamic where
the choice of MCS level varies at each time instant. We model the MaRS problem
as a Non-Linear Programming problem and show that it is NP-Hard. Next, we
propose a solution based on greedy algorithm paradigm. We then develop an upper
performance bound for this problem and finally evaluate the performance of
proposed solution by comparing against the upper bound under various channel

city states against city requirements at runtime. In this paper, we develop a
novel spatial-temporal specification-based monitoring system for smart cities.
We first describe a study of over 1,000 smart city requirements, some of which
cannot be specified using existing logic such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
and its variants. To tackle this limitation, we develop SaSTL -- a novel
Spatial Aggregation Signal Temporal Logic -- for the efficient runtime
monitoring of safety and performance requirements in smart cities. We develop
two new logical operators in SaSTL to augment STL for expressing spatial
aggregation and spatial counting characteristics that are commonly found in
real city requirements. We define Boolean and \newcontent{quantitative
semantics}~for SaSTL in support of the analysis of city performance across
different periods and locations. We also develop efficient monitoring
algorithms that can check a SaSTL requirement in parallel over multiple data
streams (e.g., generated by multiple sensors distributed spatially in a city).
Additionally, we build a SaSTL-based monitoring tool to support decision making
of different stakeholders to specify and runtime monitor their requirements in
smart cities. We evaluate our SaSTL monitor by applying it to three case
studies with large-scale real city sensing data (e.g., up to 10,000 sensors in
one study). The results show that SaSTL has a much higher coverage
expressiveness than other spatial-temporal logic, and with a significant
reduction of computation time for monitoring requirements. We also demonstrate
that the SaSTL monitor improves the safety and performance of smart cities via
simulated experiments.

develop a new lower bound technique that proves that for many problems of

requires either $n^{\Omega(1)}$ space or $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ passes, even on
highly restricted families of graphs such as bounded-degree planar graphs. For
multiple of these problems, this bound matches those of existing algorithms and
is thus (asymptotically) optimal.
  Our results considerably strengthen prior lower bounds even for arbitrary
graphs: starting from the influential work of [Verbin, Yu; SODA 2011], there
has been a plethora of lower bounds for single-pass algorithms for these
problems; however, the only multi-pass lower bounds proven very recently in
[Assadi, Kol, Saxena, Yu; FOCS 2020] rules out sublinear-space algorithms with
exponentially smaller $o(\log{(1/\epsilon)})$ passes for these problems.
  One key ingredient of our proofs is a simple streaming XOR Lemma, a generic
hardness amplification result, that we prove: informally speaking, if a
$p$-pass $s$-space streaming algorithm can only solve a decision problem with
advantage $\delta > 0$ over random guessing, then it cannot solve XOR of $\ell$
independent copies of the problem with advantage much better than
$\delta^{\ell}$. This result can be of independent interest and useful for
other streaming lower bounds as well.

distributions look quite different from the classical normal ones. For
instance, its uncertainty is characterized by a set of distributions which
covers not only classical normal with different variances, but additional
distributions typically having non-zero skewness. The $G$-moments of
$G$-normals are defined by a class of fully nonlinear PDEs called $G$-heat
equations. To understand $G$-normal in a probabilistic and stochastic way that
is more friendly to statisticians and practitioners, we introduce a
substructure called semi-$G$-normal, which behaves like a hybrid between normal
and $G$-normal: it has variance uncertainty but zero-skewness. We will show
that the non-zero skewness arises when we impose the $G$-version sequential
independence on the semi-$G$-normal. More importantly, we provide a series of
representations of random vectors with semi-$G$-normal marginals under various

population interact with each other over a contact network. When the number of
agents is large and the contact network is a complete graph, it is well known
that the population behavior -- that is, the fraction of susceptible, infected
and recovered agents -- converges to the solution of an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) known as the classical SIR model as the population size
approaches infinity. In contrast, we study interactions over contact networks
with generic topologies and derive conditions under which the population
behavior concentrates around either the classic SIR model or other
deterministic models. Specifically, we show that when most vertex degrees in
the contact network are sufficiently large, the population behavior
concentrates around an ODE known as the network SIR model. We then study the
short and intermediate-term evolution of the network SIR model and show that if
the contact network has an expander-type property or the initial set of
infections is well-mixed in the population, the network SIR model reduces to
the classical SIR model. To complement these results, we illustrate through
simulations that the two models can yield drastically different predictions,
hence use of the classical SIR model can be misleading in certain cases.

now understood that for a wide class of scalar quantum field theories,
tree-level amplitudes are canonical forms associated to polytopes known as
accordiohedra. Similarly the higher loop scalar integrands are canonical forms
associated to so called type-D cluster polytopes for cubic interactions or
recently discovered class of polytopes termed pseudo-accordiohedron for higher

  In this paper, we continue to probe the universality of these structures for
a wider class of scalar quantum field theories. More in detail, we discover new
realisations of the associahedron in planar kinematic space whose canonical

correlation scale along the magnetic field is the largest, and the correlation

that the Taylor scale anisotropy is more sensitive to the solar activity. The
Taylor scale and the correlation scale are used to calculate the effective

gas, and larger virial parameters. This is consistent with an interpretation of
negative feedback from AGN and/or starburst, in the sense that the
radiation/winds can heat and interact with the molecular gas even in relatively
dense regions. After subtracting the circular motion component of the molecular
gas and the stellar rotation, we detect two prominent non-circular motion
components of molecular and ionized hydrogen gas, reaching a line-of-sight

However, in order for it to be consistent with the observed population of
planets, tides must circularize the orbits in less than $\approx$ a Myr. A
potential mechanism for such rapid circularization is the diffusive growth of
the tidally driven planetary f-mode. Such growth occurs if the f-mode's phase
at pericenter varies chaotically from one pericenter passage to the next.
Previous studies focused on the variation of the orbital period due to tidal
back-reaction on the orbit as the source of chaos. Here we show that nonlinear
mode interactions can also be an important source. Specifically, we show that
nonlinear interactions between a parent f-mode and daughter f-/p-modes induce
an energy-dependent shift in the oscillation frequency of the parent. This
frequency shift varies randomly from orbit to orbit because the parent's energy
varies. As a result, the parent's phase at pericenter varies randomly, which we
find can trigger it to grow diffusively. We show that the phase shift induced
by nonlinear mode interactions in fact dominates the shift induced by tidal
back-reaction and significantly lowers the one-kick energy threshold for
diffusive growth by about a factor of 5 compared to the linear theory's
prediction. Nonlinear interactions could thus enhance the formation rate of hot
Jupiters through the high-eccentricity migration channel and potentially
mitigate the discrepancy between the observed and predicted occurrence rates
for close-in gas giants as compared to those further from the star.

control is supported through a simple interface toolkit, enabling to refine the

system combines heat equations, in the bulk domain and on the contact surface,
with mechanical force balances, including micro-forces, that result in the
equation for the displacements and in the flow rule for the damage-type
internal variable describing the state of the adhesive bonds. Nonlocal effects
are accounted for by terms featuring integral operators on the contact surface.
The analysis of this system poses several difficulties due to its overall
highly nonlinear character, and in particular to the presence of quadratic
terms, in the rates of the strain tensor and of the internal variable, that
feature in the bulk and surface heat equations. Another major challenge is
related to proving strict positivity for the bulk and surface temperatures. We
tackle these issues by very careful estimates that enable us to prove the

the decay products of $\tau^-$ inevitably include an undetected $\nu_{\tau}$.
As a consequence, the angular distribution of this decay cannot be measured. In
this work, we construct a {\it measurable} angular distribution by considering
the subsequent decay $\tau^- \to \pi^- \nu_\tau$. The full cascade decay is
$B_c^- \to J/\psi (\to \mu^+ \mu^-)\tau^- (\to \pi^- \nu_\tau)\bar{\nu}_\tau$,
in which the three-momenta $\boldsymbol{p}_{\mu^+}$, $\boldsymbol{p}_{\mu^-}$,
and $\boldsymbol{p}_{\pi^-}$ can be measured. The five-fold differential
angular distribution containing all Lorentz structures of the new physics (NP)
effective operators can be written in terms of twelve angular observables
$\mathcal{I}_i (q^2, E_\pi)$. Integrating over the energy of pion $E_\pi$, we
construct twelve normalized angular observables $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_i(q^2)$
and two lepton-flavor-universality ratios $R(P_{L,T}^{J/\psi})(q^2)$. Based on
the $B_c \to J/\psi$ form factors calculated by the latest lattice QCD and sum

$R(P_{L,T}^{J/\psi})$, except $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_{5}$. The ratios
$R(P_{L,T}^{J/\psi})$ are more sensitive to the NP with pseudo-scalar operators
than the $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_{i}$. Finally, we discuss the symmetries in the
angular observables and present a model-independent method to determine the

weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task, there are still challenges
to identify the entire body of an object, rather than only discriminative
parts. In this paper, we propose a novel residual fine-grained attention (RFGA)
module that autonomously excites the less activated regions of an object by
utilizing information distributed over channels and locations within feature
maps in combination with a residual operation. To be specific, we devise a
series of mechanisms of triple-view attention representation, attention
expansion, and feature calibration. Unlike other attention-based WSOL methods
that learn a coarse attention map, having the same values across elements in
feature maps, our proposed RFGA learns fine-grained values in an attention map
by assigning different attention values for each of the elements. We validated
the superiority of our proposed RFGA module by comparing it with the recent
methods in the literature over three datasets. Further, we analyzed the effect
of each mechanism in our RFGA and visualized attention maps to get insights.

challenging topic. Many methods have been proposed for EL defect detection, but
these methods are still unsatisfactory due to the diversity of the defect and
background. In this paper, we provide a new idea of using generative
adversarial network (GAN) for defect segmentation. Firstly, the GAN-based
method removes the defect region in the input defective image to get a
defect-free image, while keeping the background almost unchanged. Then, the
subtracted image is obtained by making difference between the defective input
image with the generated defect-free image. Finally, the defect region can be
segmented through thresholding the subtracted image. To keep the background
unchanged before and after image generation, we propose a novel strong identity
GAN (SIGAN), which adopts a novel strong identity loss to constraint the
background consistency. The SIGAN can be used not only for defect segmentation,
but also small-samples defective dataset augmentation. Moreover, we release a
new solar cell EL image dataset named as EL-2019, which includes three types of
images: crack, finger interruption and defect-free. Experiments on EL-2019
dataset show that the proposed method achieves 90.34% F-score, which
outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of solar cell defects

learning based cost model for automatic code optimization. This model was
integrated in a search method and implemented in the Tiramisu compiler to
select the best code transformations. The input of the proposed model is a set
of simple features representing the unoptimized code and a sequence of code

transformations are applied. Unlike previous models, the proposed one works on
full programs and does not rely on any heavy feature engineering. The proposed
model has only 16% of mean absolute percentage error in predicting speedups on

network intrusion detection, especially in revealing anomalous flows, which
often hide cyber-threats. Typically, ML algorithms are exploited to
classify/recognize data traffic on the basis of statistical features such as
inter-arrival times, packets length distribution, mean number of flows, etc.
Dealing with the vast diversity and number of features that typically
characterize data traffic is a hard problem. This results in the following
issues: i) the presence of so many features leads to lengthy training processes
(particularly when features are highly correlated), while prediction accuracy
does not proportionally improve; ii) some of the features may introduce bias
during the classification process, particularly those that have scarce relation
with the data traffic to be classified. To this end, by reducing the feature
space and retaining only the most significant features, Feature Selection (FS)
becomes a crucial pre-processing step in network management and, specifically,
for the purposes of network intrusion detection. In this review paper, we
complement other surveys in multiple ways: i) evaluating more recent datasets
(updated w.r.t. obsolete KDD 99) by means of a designed-from-scratch
Python-based procedure; ii) providing a synopsis of most credited FS approaches
in the field of intrusion detection, including Multi-Objective Evolutionary

investor that invests in a risky asset and manages risk by using Value-at-Risk
(VaR). The VaR is estimated by using past data via an adaptive expectation
scheme. We show that the leverage dynamics can be described by a dynamical
system of slow-fast type associated with a unimodal map on [0,1] with an
additive heteroscedastic noise whose variance is related to the portfolio
rebalancing frequency to target leverage. In absence of noise the model is
purely deterministic and the parameter space splits in two regions: (i) a
region with a globally attracting fixed point or a 2-cycle; (ii) a dynamical
core region, where the map could exhibit chaotic behavior. Whenever the model
is randomly perturbed, we prove the existence of a unique stationary density
with bounded variation, the stochastic stability of the process and the almost
certain existence and continuity of the Lyapunov exponent for the stationary
measure. We then use deep neural networks to estimate map parameters from a
short time series. Using this method, we estimate the model in a large dataset
of US commercial banks over the period 2001-2014. We find that the parameters
of a substantial fraction of banks lie in the dynamical core, and their
leverage time series are consistent with a chaotic behavior. We also present
evidence that the time series of the leverage of large banks tend to exhibit
chaoticity more frequently than those of small banks.

methods such as linear mixed effects models are used to handle within subject
correlations. However, assumptions of these parametric models such as
continuity and normality are usually hard to come by in many cases. The
homoscedasticity assumption is rather hard to verify in practice. Furthermore,
these assumptions may not even be realistic when data are measured in a
non-metric scale as commonly happens, for example, in Quality of Life outcomes.
In this article, nonparametric effect-size measures for clustered data in
factorial designs with pre-post measurements will be introduced. The
effect-size measures provide intuitively-interpretable and informative
probabilistic comparisons of treatment and time effects. The dependence among
observations within a cluster can be arbitrary across treatment groups. The
effect-size estimators along with their asymptotic properties for computing
confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests will be discussed.
ANOVA-type statistics with $\chi^2$ approximation that retain some of the
optimal asymptotic behaviors in small samples are investigated. Within each
treatment group, we allow some clusters to involve observations measured on
both pre and post intervention periods (referred to as complete clusters),
while others to contain observations from either pre or post intervention
period only (referred to as incomplete clusters). Our methods are shown to be,
particularly effective in the presence of multiple forms of clustering. The
developed nonparametric methods are illustrated with data from a three-arm
Randomized Trial of Indoor Wood Smoke reduction. The study considered two
active treatments to improve asthma symptoms of kids living in homes that use

  and Localization in Chest X-rays with Radiomics using a Feedback Loop","Accepted by WACV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building a highly accurate predictive model for classification and
localization of abnormalities in chest X-rays usually requires a large number
of manually annotated labels and pixel regions (bounding boxes) of
abnormalities. However, it is expensive to acquire such annotations, especially
the bounding boxes. Recently, contrastive learning has shown strong promise in
leveraging unlabeled natural images to produce highly generalizable and
discriminative features. However, extending its power to the medical image
domain is under-explored and highly non-trivial, since medical images are much
less amendable to data augmentations. In contrast, their prior knowledge, as
well as radiomic features, is often crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose an
end-to-end semi-supervised knowledge-augmented contrastive learning framework,
that simultaneously performs disease classification and localization tasks. The
key knob of our framework is a unique positive sampling approach tailored for
the medical images, by seamlessly integrating radiomic features as a knowledge
augmentation. Specifically, we first apply an image encoder to classify the
chest X-rays and to generate the image features. We next leverage Grad-CAM to
highlight the crucial (abnormal) regions for chest X-rays (even when
unannotated), from which we extract radiomic features. The radiomic features
are then passed through another dedicated encoder to act as the positive sample
for the image features generated from the same chest X-ray. In this way, our
framework constitutes a feedback loop for image and radiomic modality features
to mutually reinforce each other. Their contrasting yields knowledge-augmented
representations that are both robust and interpretable. Extensive experiments
on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing baselines in both classification and localization tasks.

state (EoS) and neutron star structure, in the relativistic mean field theory,
both in the absence and presence of a crust. The $\sigma-\omega$ model is
modified by adding a WIMP-DM component, which interacts with nucleonic matter
through the Higgs portal. This model agrees well with previous studies which
utilized either a more complicated nuclear model or higher-order terms of the
Higgs potential, in that DM softens the EoS, resulting in stars with lower
maximum masses. However, instabilities corresponding to negative pressure
values in the low-energy density regime of the DM-admixed EoS are present, and
this effect becomes more prominent as we increase the DM Fermi momentum. We
resolve this by confining DM in the star's core. The regions of instability
were replaced by three types of crust: first by the
Friedman-Pandharipande-Skyrme (FPS), Skyrme-Lyon (SLy) and BSk19 EoS from the
Brussels-Montreal Group, which can be represented by analytical approximations.
For a fixed value of the DM Fermi momentum $p_F^{DM}$, the DM-admixed neutron
star does not have significant changes in its mass with the addition of the
crusts. However, the entire mass-radius relation of the neutron star is
significantly affected, with an observed increase in the radius of the star
corresponding to the mass. The effect of DM is to reduce the mass of the star,
while the crust does not affect the radius significantly, as the value of the
$p_F^{DM}$ increases.

namely, the Magnus Hall effect. The transverse current here is caused by the
Magnus velocity that is proportional to the built-in electric field allowing us
to examine the Magnus Hall conductivity and Magnus Nernst conductivity with
chemical potential. Starting with two-dimensional (2D) topological systems, we
find that warping induced asymmetry in both the Fermi surface and Berry
curvature can in general enhance the Magnus Hall response for monolayer
graphene and surface states of topological insulator. Interestingly, strain can
change the Fermi surface character substantially that further results in
distinct behavior of Magnus transport coefficients as we observe in bilayer
graphene. Going beyond 2D systems, we also investigate the Magnus Hall and
Nernst responses in three-dimensional multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs).
Remarkably, Magnus responses can only survive for the tilted WSMs, and
therefore can be measured as a tool to distinguish between the untilted and
tilted WSMs in experiments. In addition, we find that the Magnus Hall responses
get suppressed with increasing the non-linearity associated with the band
touching around multi-Weyl node.

of machine learning on graphs. Automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs is
on the horizon to automatically design the optimal machine learning algorithm
for a given graph task. However, none of the existing libraries can fully
support AutoML on graphs. To fill this gap, we present Automated Graph Learning
(AutoGL), the first library for automated machine learning on graphs. AutoGL is
open-source, easy to use, and flexible to be extended. Specifically, we propose
an automated machine learning pipeline for graph data containing four modules:
auto feature engineering, model training, hyper-parameter optimization, and
auto ensemble. For each module, we provide numerous state-of-the-art methods
and flexible base classes and APIs, which allow easy customization. We further
provide experimental results to showcase the usage of our AutoGL library.

recursion, stochastic conditioning and sampling from continuous distributions.
  Reasoning about the termination probability of programs with continuous
distributions is hard, because the enumeration of terminating executions cannot
provide any non-trivial bounds. We present a new operational semantics based on
traces of intervals, which is sound and complete with respect to the standard
sampling-based semantics, in which (countable) enumeration can provide
arbitrarily tight lower bounds. Consequently we obtain the first proof that
deciding almost-sure termination (AST) for programs with continuous
distributions is $\Pi^0_2$-complete. We also provide a compositional
representation of our semantics in terms of an intersection type system.
  In the second part, we present a method of proving AST for non-affine
programs, i.e., recursive programs that can, during the evaluation of the
recursive body, make multiple recursive calls (of a first-order function) from
distinct call sites. Unlike in a deterministic language, the number of
recursion call sites has direct consequences on the termination probability.
Our framework supports a proof system that can verify AST for programs that are
well beyond the scope of existing methods.
  We have constructed prototype implementations of our method of computing
lower bounds of termination probability, and AST verification.

  Retrieval","Accepted by Pattern Recognition",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurately matching visual and textual data in cross-modal retrieval has been
widely studied in the multimedia community. To address these challenges posited
by the heterogeneity gap and the semantic gap, we propose integrating Shannon
information theory and adversarial learning. In terms of the heterogeneity gap,
we integrate modality classification and information entropy maximization
adversarially. For this purpose, a modality classifier (as a discriminator) is
built to distinguish the text and image modalities according to their different
statistical properties. This discriminator uses its output probabilities to
compute Shannon information entropy, which measures the uncertainty of the
modality classification it performs. Moreover, feature encoders (as a
generator) project uni-modal features into a commonly shared space and attempt
to fool the discriminator by maximizing its output information entropy. Thus,
maximizing information entropy gradually reduces the distribution discrepancy
of cross-modal features, thereby achieving a domain confusion state where the
discriminator cannot classify two modalities confidently. To reduce the
semantic gap, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and bi-directional triplet loss
are used to associate the intra- and inter-modality similarity between features
in the shared space. Furthermore, a regularization term based on KL-divergence
with temperature scaling is used to calibrate the biased label classifier
caused by the data imbalance issue. Extensive experiments with four deep models
on four benchmarks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

subgroup that is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the open unit disc and
this subgroup partitions the bidisc into a complex curve and a family of
strongly pseudo-convex hypersurfaces that are non-spherical as CR-manifolds.
Our work reverses this process and shows that any $2$-dimensional
Kobayashi-hyperbolic manifold whose automorphism group (which is known, from
the general theory, to be a Lie group) has a $3$-dimensional subgroup that is
non-solvable (as a Lie group) and that acts on the manifold to produce a
collection of orbits possessing essentially the characteristics of the

graph embedding (KGE) models has gained significant attention for knowledge

prediction tasks by using embeddings with a high dimension (e.g. 1000) which
accelerate the costs of training and evaluation considering the large scale of
KGs. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective performance boosting
strategy for KGE models by using multiple low dimensions in different
repetition rounds of the same model. For example, instead of training a model
one time with a large embedding size of 1200, we repeat the training of the
model 6 times in parallel with an embedding size of 200 and then combine the 6
separate models for testing while the overall numbers of adjustable parameters
are same (6*200=1200) and the total memory footprint remains the same. We show
that our approach enables different models to better cope with their
expressiveness issues on modeling various graph patterns such as symmetric,
1-n, n-1 and n-n. In order to justify our findings, we conduct experiments on

by testing them, mainly, against integral quantities (either known from theory

recent experiments demonstrated that, at least for the self contribution, which
dominates in the incoherent scattering case of hydrogen, accurate calculations
can be performed by means of quantum simulations of the velocity

These two anomalies indicate that there may exist new interaction specifically

ones. The new gauge boson $Z'$ from $U(1)_{B_q-L_\mu}$ interacts with muon and

parameter space for such models to solve both the anomalies simultaneously,
after taking into account existing constraints from $\tau \to \mu \gamma$,

leptonic processes restrict $Z^\prime$ mass to be less than a few hundred MeV

data from $B_s - \bar B_s$, $D^0 - \bar D^0$ mixing and also hadron decays with
$Z^\prime$ in the final states. The effects of $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_{B_q-L_\mu}$

change during operation in electrochemical applications. While synchrotron
X-ray scattering is powerful for the characterization of stand-alone and
ex-situ organic thin films, in situ structural characterization has been
underutilized--in large part due to complications arising from supporting
electrolyte scattering. This has greatly hampered the development of
application relevant structure property relationships. Therefore, we have
developed a new methodology for in situ and operando X-ray characterization
that separates the incident and scattered X-ray beam path from the electrolyte.
As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the in situ structural changes of
weakly-scattering, organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor thin films in an
aqueous electrolyte environment, enabling access to previously unexplored
changes in the pi-pi peak and diffuse scatter in situ, while capturing the
solvent swollen thin film structure which was inaccessible in previous ex situ
studies. These in situ measurements improve the sensitivity to structural
changes, capturing minute changes not possible ex situ, and have multimodal
potential such as combined Raman measurements that also serve to validate the
true in situ/operando conditions of the cell. Finally, we examine new
directions enabled by this operando cell design and compare state of the art

vorticity, and the hypermagnetic field in the symmetric phase of the early
Universe, and in the temperature range 100 GeV < T < 10 TeV. We assume a
configuration for the hypermagnetic field which includes both helical and
non-helical (Bz) components. Consequently, the hypermagnetic field and the
fluid vorticity can directly affect each other, the manifestations of which we
explore in three scenarios. In the first scenario, we show that in the presence
of a small vorticity and a large {\eta}eR, helicity can be generated and
amplified for an initially strong Bz. The generation of the helical seed is due
to the chiral vortical effect (CVE) and/or the advection term, while its growth
is mainly due to the chiral magnetic effect (CME) which leads to the production
of the baryon asymmetry, as well. The vorticity saturates to a nonzero value
which depends on Bz, even in the presence of the viscosity, due to the
back-reaction of Bz on the plasma. Increasing the initial vorticity, makes the
values of the helicity, {\eta}s, and vorticity reach their saturation curves
sooner, but does not change their final values at the onset of the electroweak
phase transition. The second scenario is similar to the first except we assume
that all initial {\eta}s are zero. We find that much higher initial vorticity
is required for the generation process. In the third scenario, we show that in
the presence of only a strong hypermagnetic field, {\eta}s and vorticity can be
generated and amplified. Increasing the initial helicity, increases the final
{\eta}s and vorticity. We find that although the presence of a nonzero initial
Bz is necessary in all three scenarios, its increase only increases the final
values of vorticity.

reformulated from the boundary value problems can be solved iteratively with
the simple Richardson iteration or the Krylov subspace iteration method. During
the iteration, the boundary and volume integrals are evaluated by limiting the
structured grid-based discrete solutions of the equivalent interface problems

arises as an alternative measure to the Fubini metric between two quantum
states. Given two states and a set of allowed gates, it is defined as the least
complex unitary operator capable of transforming one state into the other.
Starting with K qubits evolving through a k-local Hamiltonian, it is possible
to draw an analogy between the quantum system and an auxiliary classical
system. Using the definition of complexity to define a metric for the classical
system, it is possible to relate its entropy with the quantum complexity of the
K qubits, defining the Second Law of Quantum Complexity. The law states that,
if it is not already saturated, the quantum complexity of a system will
increase with an overwhelming probability towards its maximum value. In the
context of AdS/CFT duality and the ER=EPR conjecture, the growth of the volume
of the Einstein Rosen bridge interior is proportional to the quantum complexity
of the instantaneous state of the conformal field theory. Therefore, the
interior of the wormhole connecting two entangled CFT will grow as a natural
consequence of the complexification of the boundary state.

progressively shorter paths. After computing feasible path $\xi$ between start
$x_s$ and goal $x_t$, the Informed Set (IS) prunes the configuration space
$\mathcal{C}$ by conservatively eliminating points that cannot yield shorter
paths. Densification via sampling from this Informed Set retains asymptotic
optimality of sampling from the entire configuration space. For path length
$c(\xi)$ and Euclidean heuristic $h$, $IS = \{ x | x \in \mathcal{C}, h(x_s, x)
+ h(x, x_t) \leq c(\xi) \}$.
  Relying on the heuristic can render the IS especially conservative in high
dimensions or complex environments. Furthermore, the IS only shrinks when
shorter paths are discovered. Thus, the computational effort from each
iteration of densification and planning is wasted if it fails to yield a
shorter path, despite improving the cost-to-come for vertices in the search
tree. Our key insight is that even in such a failure, shorter paths to vertices
in the search tree (rather than just the goal) can immediately improve the
planner's sampling strategy. Guided Incremental Local Densification (GuILD)
leverages this information to sample from Local Subsets of the IS. We show that
GuILD significantly outperforms uniform sampling of the Informed Set in
simulated $\mathbb{R}^2$, $SE(2)$ environments and manipulation tasks in
$\mathbb{R}^7$.

Within Tokamak and Stellarator reactors, plasma is confined by twisted magnetic
fields. Reactors which produce fusion energy have existed since Princeton Large
Torus Tokamak in 1978, nevertheless in all reactors built up to now, energy
loss from plasma vastly exceeded fusion energy production. In order for a
thermonuclear power plant to run, generated fusion energy must significantly
exceed energy loss by the plasma. There are four processes by which plasma
looses energy -- neutron radiation, Bremsstrahlung radiation, synchrotron
radiation, and heat conduction to the walls. For a deuterium -- tritium
reactor, 80\% of energy produced by fusion is lost to neutron radiation, about
4\% to 6\% of fusion energy is lost to Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron
radiation. For a deuterium -- $^3$He reactor, 5\% of energy produced by fusion
is lost to neutron radiation, about 50\% to 75\% of fusion energy is lost to
Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation. Increasing reactor operating
temperature decreases loss to Bremsstrahlung radiation and increases loss to
synchrotron radiation. Power loss to conduction is either independent or weakly
dependent on fusion power production. Up to now, no single theoretical or
experimental model can accurately predict conduction power loss. For small
Tokamaks and Stellarators, conduction power loss vastly exceeds power generated
by fusion. For large and powerful thermonuclear reactors which are yet to be
built, conduction power loss should be much lower then power produced by
fusion.

find the information flowing from the unit of concern to the rest of the

collective phenomenon that a group is not the addition of the individual

considerably simpler, both to set up and to execute. It is shown that the
unusual word length distribution of the Voynich MS, which is very close to

In this paper, a step-by-step algorithm is presented to estimate the
sensitivities of identified material parameters. As a part of the sensitivity
analysis method, a new mechanics-based metric in the space of material
parameters is proposed especially for ratcheting-related applications. The
sensitivity of material parameters to experimental errors is estimated, based
on this metric. For demonstration purposes, the accumulation of irreversible
strain in the titanium alloy VT6 (Russian analog of Ti-6Al-4V) is analysed.
Three types of phenomenological models of plastic ratcheting are considered.
They are the Armstrong-Frederick model as well as the first and the second
Ohno-Wang models. Based on real data, a new rule of isotropic hardening is
proposed for greater accuracy of simulation. The ability of the sensitivity
analysis to determine reliable and unreliable parameters is demonstrated. The
plausibility of the new method is checked by alternative approaches, like the
consideration of correlation matrices and validation of identified parameters
on ""unseen"" data. A relation between pathological error sensitivity and
overparametrization is established.
