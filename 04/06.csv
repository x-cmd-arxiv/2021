probabilistic way to infer about moves performed by an agent in a setting
governed by Newtonian laws of motion. However, methods of probabilistic
programs can be slow in such setting due to their need to generate many
samples. We complement the model with a model-free approach to aid the sampling
procedures in becoming more efficient through learning from experience during
game playing. We present an approach where combining model-free approaches (a
convolutional neural network in our model) and model-based approaches
(probabilistic physics simulation) is able to achieve what neither could alone.
This way the model outperforms an all model-free or all model-based approach.

  Erasure Coding",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep-learning-based recommendation models (DLRMs) are widely deployed to
serve personalized content to users. DLRMs are large in size due to their use
of large embedding tables, and are trained by distributing the model across the
memory of tens or hundreds of servers. Server failures are common in such large
distributed systems and must be mitigated to enable training to progress.
Checkpointing is the primary approach used for fault tolerance in these
systems, but incurs significant training-time overhead both during normal
operation and when recovering from failures. As these overheads increase with
DLRM size, checkpointing is slated to become an even larger overhead for future
DLRMs, which are expected to grow in size. This calls for rethinking fault
tolerance in DLRM training.
  We present ECRM, a DLRM training system that achieves efficient fault
tolerance using erasure coding. ECRM chooses which DLRM parameters to encode,
correctly and efficiently updates parities, and enables training to proceed
without any pauses, while maintaining consistency of the recovered parameters.
We implement ECRM atop XDL, an open-source, industrial-scale DLRM training
system. Compared to checkpointing, ECRM reduces training-time overhead for
large DLRMs by up to 88%, recovers from failures up to 10.3$\times$ faster, and
allows training to proceed during recovery. These results show the promise of
erasure coding in imparting efficient fault tolerance to training current and
future DLRMs.

  lumen segmentation in ureteroscopy",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: Ureteroscopy is an efficient endoscopic minimally invasive technique
for the diagnosis and treatment of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
During ureteroscopy, the automatic segmentation of the hollow lumen is of
primary importance, since it indicates the path that the endoscope should
follow. In order to obtain an accurate segmentation of the hollow lumen, this
paper presents an automatic method based on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs).
  Methods: The proposed method is based on an ensemble of 4 parallel CNNs to
simultaneously process single and multi-frame information. Of these, two
architectures are taken as core-models, namely U-Net based in residual
blocks($m_1$) and Mask-RCNN($m_2$), which are fed with single still-frames
$I(t)$. The other two models ($M_1$, $M_2$) are modifications of the former
ones consisting on the addition of a stage which makes use of 3D Convolutions
to process temporal information. $M_1$, $M_2$ are fed with triplets of frames
($I(t-1)$, $I(t)$, $I(t+1)$) to produce the segmentation for $I(t)$.
  Results: The proposed method was evaluated using a custom dataset of 11
videos (2,673 frames) which were collected and manually annotated from 6
patients. We obtain a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.80, outperforming
previous state-of-the-art methods.
  Conclusion: The obtained results show that spatial-temporal information can
be effectively exploited by the ensemble model to improve hollow lumen
segmentation in ureteroscopic images. The method is effective also in presence
of poor visibility, occasional bleeding, or specular reflections.

  Based on Optimal Transport","97 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distribution-free tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test are popular for
testing the equality of two univariate distributions. Among the important
reasons for their popularity are the striking results of Hodges-Lehmann (1956)
and Chernoff-Savage (1958), where the authors show that the asymptotic (Pitman)
relative efficiency of Wilcoxon's test with respect to Student's $t$-test,
under location-shift alternatives, never falls below $0.864$ (with the identity
score) and $1$ (with the Gaussian score) respectively, despite the former being
exactly distribution-free for all sample sizes. Motivated by these results, we
propose and study a large family of exactly distribution-free multivariate
rank-based two-sample tests by leveraging the theory of optimal transport.
First, we propose distribution-free analogs of the Hotelling $T^2$ test (the
natural multidimensional counterpart of Student's $t$-test) and show that they
satisfy Hodges-Lehmann and Chernoff-Savage-type efficiency lower bounds over
natural sub-families of multivariate distributions, despite being entirely
agnostic to the underlying data generating mechanism -- making them the first
multivariate, nonparametric, exactly distribution-free tests that provably
achieve such efficiency lower bounds. As these tests are derived from Hotelling
$T^2$, naturally they are not universally consistent (same as Wilcoxon's test).
To overcome this, we propose exactly distribution-free versions of the
celebrated kernel maximum mean discrepancy test and the energy test. These
tests are indeed universally consistent under no moment assumptions, exactly
distribution-free for all sample sizes, and have non-trivial Pitman efficiency.
We believe this trifecta of properties hasn't yet been proven for any existing
test in the literature.

introduced a framework that alleviated data requirements by constructing joint

of nonlinear controlled systems are learned from data by using neural networks.
While Koopman operator theory allows us to represent a nonlinear system as a
linear system in an infinite-dimensional space of observables, exact
linearization is guaranteed only for autonomous systems with no input, and
finding effective observable functions for approximation with a low-order
linear system remains an open question. Dual-Faceted Linearization uses a set
of effective observables for low-order lifting linearization, but the method
requires knowledge of the physical structure of the nonlinear system. Here, a
data-driven method is presented for generating a set of nonlinear observable
functions that can accurately approximate a nonlinear control system to a
low-order linear control system. A caveat in using data of measured variables
as observables is that the measured variables may contain input to the system,
which incurs a causality contradiction when lifting the system, i.e. taking
derivatives of the observables. The current work presents a method for
eliminating such anti-causal components of the observables and lifting the
system using only causal observables. The method is applied to excavation
automation, a complex nonlinear dynamical system, to obtain a low-order lifted
linear model for control design.

achieve scalable and prompt digital pre-screening. However, there are still two
unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model
training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users
tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features.
Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions.
Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the
uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an
ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19
detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data.
As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling
and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a
specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from
the disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions
often yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty
higher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take
clinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails. This study paves the way for a
more robust sound-based COVID-19 automated screening system.

results in novel domains being synthesized implicitly, which increase the
domain diversity of the source domains, and hence the generalizability of the

supergravity in $D=4$ for arbitrary Barbero-Immirzi parameters. This action
turns out to play a crucial role in context of boundaries in the framework of
supergravity if one imposes supersymmetry invariance at the boundary. For the
$\mathcal{N}=2$ case, it follows that this amounts to the introduction of a
$\theta$-topological term to the Yang-Mills sector which explicitly depends on
the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. This shows the close connection between this
parameter and the $\theta$-ambiguity of gauge theory. We will also discuss the
chiral limit of the theory, which turns out to possess some very special
properties such as the manifest invariance of the resulting action under an
enlarged gauge symmetry. Moreover, we will show that demanding supersymmetry
invariance at the boundary yields a unique boundary term corresponding to a
super Chern-Simons theory with $\mathrm{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|2)$ gauge group. In
this context, we will also derive boundary conditions that couple boundary and

using self-supervised learning. One straightforward approach to model
personalization is to use the target speaker's noisy recordings as
pseudo-sources. Then, a pseudo denoising model learns to remove injected
training noises and recover the pseudo-sources. However, this approach is
volatile as it depends on the quality of the pseudo-sources, which may be too
noisy. As a remedy, we propose an improvement to the self-supervised approach
through data purification. We first train an SNR predictor model to estimate
the frame-by-frame SNR of the pseudo-sources. Then, the predictor's estimates
are converted into weights which adjust the frame-by-frame contribution of the
pseudo-sources towards training the personalized model. We empirically show
that the proposed data purification step improves the usability of the

the notion of maximal coupling of random variables. We then employ this

for the von Neumann entropy of states of infinite-dimensional quantum systems,
when the Hamiltonian is the number operator, which is arguably the most
relevant Hamiltonian in the study of infinite-dimensional quantum systems in
the context of quantum information theory.
  The above scheme works only for Shannon- and von Neumann entropies. Hence, to
deal with more general entropies, e.g. $\alpha$-R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Tsallis
entropies, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$, for which continuity bounds are known only

Monte Carlo algorithm is critical to the quality of the generated samples. Much
work has gone into obtaining such results for various Metropolis-Hastings (MH)
algorithms. Recently, acceptance probabilities other than MH are being employed
in problems with intractable target distributions. There is little resource
available on tuning the Gaussian proposal distributions for this situation. We
obtain optimal scaling results for a general class of acceptance functions,
which includes Barker's and Lazy-MH. In particular, optimal values for the
Barker's algorithm are derived and found to be significantly different from
that obtained for the MH algorithm. Our theoretical conclusions are supported
by numerical simulations indicating that when the optimal proposal variance is
unknown, tuning to the optimal acceptance probability remains an effective
strategy.

of maternal deaths in Southeast Asia. The increase in and effectiveness of
using contraception are still considered to be the effective method to reduce
abortion rate. Data pertaining to abortion incidence and effective efforts to
reduce abortion rate in Indonesia is limited and difficult to access. Meanwhile
such supporting information is necessary to enable the planning and evaluation
of abortion control programs. This paper exemplifies the use of a mathematical
model to explain an abortion decline scenario. The model employs determinants
proposed by Bongaarts, which include average reproductive period, contraceptive
prevalence and effectiveness, total fertility rate (TFR), and intended total
fertility rate (ITFR), as well as birth and abortion intervals. The data used
is from the 1991-2007 Indonesian Demography and Health Survey (Survei Demografi
dan Kesehatan Indonesia/SDKI), and the unit of analysis is women who had been
married and aged 15-49 years old. Based on the current contraceptive prevalence
level in Indonesia at 59-61%, the estimated total abortion rate is 1.9-2.2.
Based on the plot of this total abortion rate, an abortion decline scenario can
be estimated. At the current TFR level of 2.6, the required contraceptive
prevalence is 69% (9% increase) for a decrease of one abortion case per woman.
With a delay of one year in the age of the first marriage and a birth interval
of three years, it is estimated that the abortion rate will decline from 3.05
to 0.69 case per woman throughout her reproductive period. Based on the
assumption of contraceptive prevalence growth at 1-1.4%, it can be estimated
that abortion rate will reach nearly 0 between 2018 and 2022.

terms of computational costs, since the simulator needs to be run over a large
number of input values. Building an emulator, i.e. a statistical surrogate
model of the simulator constructed using a design of experiments made of a
comparatively small number of evaluations of the forward solver, greatly
alleviates the computational burden to carry out such investigations.
Nevertheless, this can still be above the computational budget for many
studies. Two major approaches have been used to reduce the budget needed to
build the emulator: efficient design of experiments, such as sequential
designs, and combining training data of different degrees of sophistication in
a so-called multi-fidelity method, or multilevel in case these fidelities are
ordered typically for increasing resolutions. We present here a novel method
that combines both approaches, the multilevel adaptive sequential design of
computer experiments (MLASCE) in the framework of Gaussian process (GP)
emulators. We make use of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces as a tool for our
GP approximations of the differences between two consecutive levels. This dual
strategy allows us to allocate efficiently limited computational resources over
simulations of different levels of fidelity and build the GP emulator. The
allocation of computational resources is shown to be the solution of a simple
optimization problem in a special case where we theoretically prove the
validity of our approach. Our proposed method is compared with other existing
models of multi-fidelity Gaussian process emulation. Gains in orders of
magnitudes in accuracy or computing budgets are demonstrated in some of
numerical examples for some settings.

of a deep learning-based model for lung segmentation from CT images for normal

confirmed COVID-19 cases were used for training a residual neural network. The
reference lung masks were generated through semi-automated/manual segmentation
of the CT images. The performance of the model was evaluated on two distinct
external test datasets including 120 normal and COVID-19 subjects, and the
results of these groups were compared to each other. Different evaluation
metrics such as dice coefficient (DSC), mean absolute error (MAE), relative
mean HU difference, and relative volume difference were calculated to assess
the accuracy of the predicted lung masks. The proposed deep learning method
achieved DSC of 0.980 and 0.971 for normal and COVID-19 subjects, respectively,
demonstrating significant overlap between predicted and reference lung masks.
Moreover, MAEs of 0.037 HU and 0.061 HU, relative mean HU difference of -2.679%
and -4.403%, and relative volume difference of 2.405% and 5.928% were obtained
for normal and COVID-19 subjects, respectively. The comparable performance in
lung segmentation of the normal and COVID-19 patients indicates the accuracy of
the model for the identification of the lung tissue in the presence of the
COVID-19 induced infections (though slightly better performance was observed
for normal patients). The promising results achieved by the proposed deep
learning-based model demonstrated its reliability in COVID-19 lung
segmentation. This prerequisite step would lead to a more efficient and robust
pneumonia lesion analysis.

approach consists of three steps: first, the unknown contact impedances and an
anisotropic conductivity reproducing the measured EIT data in a model domain
are computed. Second, using isothermal coordinates, a deformation is
constructed that makes the conductivity isotropic. The final step minimizes the
error of true and reconstructed known geometric properties (like the electrode
lengths) using conformal deformations. The feasibility of the method is
illustrated with experimental EIT data, with robust and accurate

leverage points, which are identified by means of the projection statistics.
Good statistical efficiency under the Gaussian distribution assumption of the
process and the observation noise is achieved thanks to the use of the Huber
cost function, which is minimized via the iteratively reweighted least squares
algorithm. The asymptotic covariance matrix of the state estimation error
vector is derived via the covariance matrix of the total influence function of
the GM-estimator. Simulations carried out on the IEEE 39-bus test system reveal
that our robust extended Kalman filter exhibits good tracking capabilities
under Gaussian process and observation noise while suppressing observation

only under the validity of the linear approximation of the power system model.

a combination of angular momenta on $S^3$ and the $U(1)$ R-charge. We develop
the all-order asymptotic expansion of the index as $q = e^{2 \pi i \tau}$
approaches a root of unity, i.e. as $\widetilde \tau \equiv m \tau + n \to 0$,
with $m,n$ relatively prime integers. The asymptotic expansion of
$\log\mathcal{I}(\tau)$ has terms of the form $\widetilde \tau^k$, $k = -2, -1,
0, 1$. We determine the coefficients of the $k=-2,-1,1$ terms from the gauge

Chern-Simons partition function on $S^3/\mathbb{Z}_m$. We explain these
findings from the point of view of the 3d theory obtained by reducing the 4d
gauge theory on the $S^1$. The supersymmetric functional integral of the 3d
theory takes the form of a matrix integral over the dynamical 3d fields, with
an effective action given by supersymmetrized Chern-Simons couplings of
background and dynamical gauge fields. The singular terms in the $\widetilde
\tau \to 0$ expansion (dictating the growth of the 4d index) are governed by
the background Chern-Simons couplings. The constant term has a background piece
as well as a piece given by the localized functional integral over the
dynamical 3d gauge multiplet. The linear term arises from the supersymmetric
Casimir energy factor needed to go between the functional integral and the
Hamiltonian index.

requires an accurate disentanglement of object shape, appearance, and
background from each domain, so that the appearance and shape factors from the
two domains can be interchanged. We augment an existing approach that can
disentangle factors within a single domain but struggles to do so across

a differentiable histogram of visual features, and to optimize the generator so
that two images with the same latent appearance factor but different latent

170817 the radio and X-ray radiation has been dominated by emission from a
structured relativistic off-axis jet propagating into a low-density medium with
n $< 0.01\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$. We report on observational evidence for an excess of
X-ray emission at $\delta t>900$ days after the merger. With $L_x\approx5\times
10^{38}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ at 1234 days, the recently detected X-ray emission
represents a $\ge 3.2\,\sigma$ (Gaussian equivalent) deviation from the
universal post jet-break model that best fits the multi-wavelength afterglow at
earlier times. In the context of JetFit afterglow models, current data
represent a departure with statistical significance $\ge 3.1\,\sigma$,
depending on the fireball collimation, with the most realistic models showing
excesses at the level of $\ge 3.7\,\sigma$. A lack of detectable 3 GHz radio
emission suggests a harder broad-band spectrum than the jet afterglow. These
properties are consistent with the emergence of a new emission component such
as synchrotron radiation from a mildly relativistic shock generated by the
expanding merger ejecta, i.e. a kilonova afterglow. In this context, we present
a set of ab-initio numerical-relativity BNS merger simulations that show that
an X-ray excess supports the presence of a high-velocity tail in the merger
ejecta, and argues against the prompt collapse of the merger remnant into a
black hole. Radiation from accretion processes on the compact-object remnant
represents a viable alternative. Neither a kilonova afterglow nor
accretion-powered emission have been observed before, as detections of BNS
mergers at this phase of evolution are unprecedented.

considering fake, strictly off-shell degrees of freedom: the fakeons. To
demonstrate the approach and exemplify its reach, we re-analyze the
phenomenology of the Inert Doublet Model under the assumption that the second
doublet is a fakeon. Remarkably, the fake doublet avoids the most stringent
$Z$-pole constraints regardless of the chosen mass scale, thereby allowing for
the presence of new effects well below the electroweak scale. Furthermore, the
absence of on-shell propagation prevents fakeons from inducing missing energy
signatures in collider experiments. The distinguishing features of the model
appear at the loop level, where fakeons modify the Higgs boson
$h\to\gamma\gamma$ decay width and the Higgs trilinear coupling. The running of
Standard Model parameters proceeds as in the usual Inert Doublet Model case.
Therefore, the fake doublet can also ensure the stability of the Standard Model
vacuum. Our work shows that fakeons are a valid alternative to the usual tools
of particle physics model building, with the potential to shape a new paradigm,
where the significance of the existing experimental constraints towards new
physics must necessarily be reconsidered.

requires their orbits to be stirred. However, stirring levels remain largely
unconstrained, and consequently the stirring mechanisms as well. This work
shows how the sharpness of the outer edge of discs can be used to constrain the
stirring levels. Namely, the sharper the edge is the lower the eccentricity
dispersion must be. For a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities ($e$), I find
that the disc surface density near the outer edge can be parametrised as
$\tanh[(r_{\max}-r)/l_{\rm out}]$, where $r_{\max}$ approximates the maximum
semi-major axis and $l_{\rm out}$ defines the edge smoothness. If the
semi-major axis distribution has sharp edges $e_\mathrm{rms}$ is roughly $1.2
l_{\rm out}/r_{\max}$, or $e_\mathrm{rms}=0.77 l_{\rm out}/r_{\max}$ if
semi-major axes have diffused due to self-stirring. This model is fitted to
ALMA data of five wide discs: HD 107146, HD 92945, HD 206893, AU Mic and HR
8799. The results show that HD 107146, HD 92945 and AU Mic have the sharpest
outer edges, corresponding to $e_\mathrm{rms}$ values of $0.121\pm0.05$,
$0.15^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$ and $0.10\pm0.02$ if their discs are self-stirred,
suggesting the presence of Pluto-sized objects embedded in the disc. Although
these stirring values are larger than typically assumed, the radial stirring of
HD 92945 is in good agreement with its vertical stirring constrained by the
disc height. HD 206893 and HR~8799, on the other hand, have smooth outer edges
that are indicative of scattered discs since both systems have massive inner
companions.

black hole and neutron star mass spectrum, as well as how such binaries evolve
especially if isolated. In this work we study the dynamical formation of
compact object pairs, via multiple binary-single exchanges that occur at the
cores of globular clusters. We start with a population of binary star systems,
which interact with single compact objects as first generation black holes and
LMGOs. We evaluate the rate of exchange interactions leading to the formation
of compact object binaries. Our calculations include all possible types of
binary-single exchange interactions and also the interactions of individual
stars with compact object binaries that can evolve their orbital properties,
leading to their eventual merger. We perform our calculations for the full
range of the observed Milky Way globular cluster environments. We find that the
exchanges are efficient in forming hard compact object binaries at the cores of
dense astrophysical stellar environments. Furthermore, if the population size
of the LMGOs is related to that of neutron stars, the inferred merger rate
density of black hole-LMGO binaries inside globular clusters in the local
Universe is estimated to be about $0.1 \, \text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$.

a framework in which the mirror fermions are sub-nano-charged, as a consequence
of kinetic mixing between the photon and its mirror counterpart. We consider
both nuclear recoil and electron recoil experiments. The event rates depend on
the fraction of mirror DM that is ionized, and also on its distribution in the
galaxy. Since mirror DM is dissipative, at the location of the Earth it may be
in the form of a halo or may have collapsed into a disk, depending on the
cooling rate. For a given mirror DM abundance we determine the expected event
rates in direct detection experiments for the limiting cases of an ionized
halo, an ionized disk, an atomic halo and an atomic disk. We find that by
taking advantage of the complementarity of the different experiments, it may be
possible to establish not just the multi-component nature of mirror dark
matter, but also its distribution in the galaxy. In addition, a study of the
recoil energies may be able to determine the masses and charges of the
constituents of the mirror sector. By showing that the mass and charge of
mirror helium are integer multiples of those of mirror hydrogen, these
experiments have the potential to distinguish the mirror nature of the theory.
We also carefully consider mirror plasma screening effects, showing that the
capture of mirror dark matter particles in the Earth has at most a modest

from deep in the Earth's interior are not available, so our knowledge is based
on comparison of laboratory measurements with seismological observations,
informed by meteorite composition, and indications of the Earth's core
temperature. One of the most interesting results of such work has been the
suggestion that Earth's inner core must contain light elements because the
density of the core, as determined from seismological measurements, is lower
than the density of pure iron, its main constituent, as determined from
laboratory measurements and/or theoretical work: the density deficit is now
considered to be ~4%. However, this conclusion relies critically on having an
accurate pressure scale to relate lab generated pressures to geological
pressures. Establishing such a scale has been the subject of intensive research
but still involves significant extrapolation and approximations, especially at
higher pressures. Further, a pressure scale to the multi-megabar pressures is
indispensable for discussing super-Earth planets. Here we establish the first
primary pressure scale extending to the multi-megabar pressures of Earth's core
by measuring acoustic phonon velocities using inelastic scattering from a
rhenium sample in a diamond anvil cell. Our new pressure scale agrees with
previous primary scales at lower pressures and also shock compression
experiments, but is significantly different from previous secondary and
theoretical scales at Earth's core pressures: previous scales have
overestimated, by at least 20%, laboratory pressures at 230 gigapascals. Our
new scale suggests the density deficit of the inner core is ~9%, doubling the
light-element content of the core.

thought to be an essential channel in the as-yet little understood formation of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs). One model suggests that high accretion rates
of $0.1$-1 M$_\odot$/yr attainable in atomically-cooled primordial halos can
lead to the formation of a nuclear-burning SMS. This will ultimately undergo
collapse through a relativistic instability, leaving a massive BH remnant.
Recent simulations suggest that supermassive stars rarely form in isolation,
and that companion stars and even black holes formed may be captured/accreted
and inspiral to the SMS core due to gas dynamical friction. Here, we explore
the GW emission produced from such inspirals, which could probe the formation
and evolution of SMS and seeds of the first supermassive black holes. We use a
semi-analytic gas-dynamical friction model of the inspirals in the SMS to
characterize their properties. We find such sources could potentially be
observable by upcoming space-born GW-detectors at their formation redshifts
with the benefit of gravitational lensing. Mergers within closely-related
quasi-stars may produce a much stronger signal, though disambiguating such

low-energy degrees of freedom in mTBLG are governed by a network of
one-dimensional domain-wall states, described by two channels of
one-dimensional linearly dispersing spin-1/2 fermions. We show that the
interaction can realize a spin-gapped inter-channel charge density wave (CDW)
state at low temperatures, forming a ""Coulomb drag"" between the channels and
leaving only one charge conducting mode. For sufficiently high temperatures,
power-law-in-temperature resistivity emerges from the charge umklapp
scatterings within a domain wall. Remarkably, the presence of the CDW states
can strengthen the charge umklapp scattering and induce a resistivity minimum
at an intermediate temperature corresponding to the CDW correlation energy. We
further discuss the conditions that resistivity of the network is dominated by
the domain walls. In particular, the power-law-in-temperature resistivity
results can apply to other systems that manifest topological domain-wall
structures.

survey estimates that $\sim6\%$ of SNe Ia may interact with distant CSM, but
statistical inferences are complicated by the small sample size and selection

non-detections with the HST results, we constrain occurrence of late-onset CSM

similar to that of the Solar System, with the four imaged giant planets

being surrounded by a cold dust belt analogue to the Kuiper Belt. Previous
observations of this cold belt with ALMA in Band 6 (1.3 mm) revealed its inner

unclear whether the outermost planet HR 8799 b was dynamically sculpting it or
not. We present here new ALMA observations of this debris disk in Band 7 (340
GHz, 880 micron). These are the most detailed observations of this disk
obtained so far, with a resolution of 1"" (40 au) and sensitivity of
$9.8\,\mu\mathrm{Jy\,beam^{-1}}$, which allowed us to recover the disk

fit its emission using radiative transfer models combined with a MCMC
procedure. We find that this disk cannot be adequately represented by a single
power law with sharp edges. It exhibits a smoothly rising inner edge and
smoothly falling outer edge, with a peak in between, as expected from a disk
that contains a high eccentricity component, hence confirming previous
findings. Whether this excited population and inner edge shape stem from the
presence of an additional planet remains, however, an open question.

of gas stripping, three of them are passive galaxies and were included to
characterize the final stages of galaxy evolution. We therefore provide a

The analysis of VLT/MUSE data allows us to separate galaxies into the following
categories: Galaxy-galaxy interactions (2 galaxies), mergers (6), ram pressure
stripping (4), cosmic web stripping (2), cosmic web enhancement (5), gas
accretion (3), starvation (3). In one galaxy we identify the combination of
merger and ram pressure stripping. Only 6/27 of these galaxies have just a
tentative classification. We then investigate where these galaxies are located

the power of IFU data in pinning down the acting mechanism.

Here we consider Wightman 4-point functions of scalar primaries in Lorentzian

Wightman axioms (temperedness, spectral property, local commutativity,

the s-channel Lorentzian OPE. This is done constructively, by analytically
continuing the 4-point functions using the s-channel OPE expansion in the

processes leading to intrinsic correlations between their shapes and
orientations. Such correlations can be measured to high significance today,
suggesting that cosmological information can be extracted from them. Among the
most pressing questions in particle physics and cosmology is the nature of dark
matter. If dark matter is self-interacting, it can leave an imprint on galaxy
shapes. In this work, we investigate whether self-interactions can produce a
long-lasting imprint on intrinsic galaxy shape correlations. We investigate
this observable at low redshift ($z<0.4$) using a state-of-the-art suite of
cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations where the dark matter model is varied.
We find that dark matter self-interactions induce a mass dependent suppression
in the intrinsic alignment signal by up to 50\% out to ten's of mega-parsecs,
showing that self-interactions can impact structure outside the very core of
clusters. We find evidence that self-interactions have a scale-dependent impact
on the intrinsic alignment signal that is sufficiently different from
signatures introduced by differing baryonic physics prescriptions, suggesting
that it is detectable with up-coming all-sky surveys.

lepton-flavour universality violating mass effects. Our analysis shows that the
current presentation of the experimental data is not ideal and prohibits the
extraction of the full set of relevant BSM parameters, since the number of

only four. We uncover a $\sim4\sigma$ tension between data and predictions that

probe $e-\mu$ lepton-flavour universality. However, we find inconsistencies in

the inconsistencies do not affect the data materially. Our findings highlight
that $e-\mu$ non-universality in the SM, introduced by the finite muon mass, is

knowledge distillation (KD) to effectively compress a transformer-based large

inconsistent regional visual tokens extracted from different detectors of
Teacher and Student, resulting in the misalignment of hidden representations
and attention distributions. To address the problem, we retrain and adapt the
Teacher by using the same region proposals from Student's detector while the
features are from Teacher's own object detector. With aligned network inputs,
the adapted Teacher is capable of transferring the knowledge through the
intermediate representations. Specifically, we use the mean square error loss
to mimic the attention distribution inside the transformer block and present a
token-wise noise contrastive loss to align the hidden state by contrasting with
negative representations stored in a sample queue. To this end, we show that
our proposed distillation significantly improves the performance of small VL
models on image captioning and visual question answering tasks. It reaches
120.8 in CIDEr score on COCO captioning, an improvement of 5.1 over its

instead from Inverse Compton scattering off recently extinguished radio
galaxies rather than intracluster medium. Using ancillary COSMOS data, we also
constrain the SEDs of the two filaments' eight constituent galaxies from the

for describing magnetic materials and predicting their properties. This is
especially important for high-throughput screening of potentially good magnets
that without adequate description of the magnetic structure may result in an
enormous waste of computational resources. I introduce a method, which
accurately and efficiently treats magnetic ordering in the course of standard
first-principles calculations. The method is suitable for all temperatures and
is based on Monte Carlo (MC) technique. At high temperatures MC is coupled to
ab initio molecular dynamics, therefore treating atomic vibrations and magnetic
ordering simultaneously. The method takes care of the convergence to the true
ground-state magnetic structure at 0 K, coupling between spins and atomic
vibrations at high temperatures, and spin-spin interactions in non-Heisenberg
systems, i.e. it naturally goes beyond the usual pair-like effective exchange
interactions at all temperatures. I show that the method nicely reproduces the
magnetic structures at low and high temperatures even on relatively small
supercells and provides a ground for truly ab initio calculations of magnetic
systems in high-throughput studies. In its general formulation the MDMC method
deals with non-collinear magnetism, but its collinear version may be more
suitable for fast high-throughput calculations. The examples of the application
of the MDMC method addressed in this paper are $\alpha$-Mn; body-centered cubic
Fe, which is ferromagnetic at low and paramagnetic at high temperatures; and

method is that the various flight modes (i.e., hovering, transition and level
flight) of a VTOL UAV are controlled in a unified manner, as opposed to
treating them separately and in the runtime switching one from another. The
proposed controller consists of an outer-loop position controller and an
inner-loop attitude controller. The inner-loop controller is composed of a
proportional attitude controller and a loop-shaping linear angular rate
controller. For the outer-loop controller, we propose a nonlinear solver to
compute the desired attitude and thrust, based on the UAV dynamics and an
aerodynamic model, in addition to a cascaded PID controller for the position

approximate the behavior of the nonlinear solver, which suffers from high

study, an optimization model for vertically mounted agrivoltaic systems with
bifacial photovoltaic models is developed. The model combines three main
submodels: solar radiation and shadings, photovoltaic, and crop yield.
Validation of the submodels is performed showing good agreement with measured
data and commercial software. The optimization model is set as multi objective
to explore the trade-offs between competing agrivoltaic key performance
indicators. The results shows that the row distance between bifacial
photovoltaic modules structure affects significantly the photosyntetically
active radiation distribution by reducing the crop yield of potato and oat of
about 50% by passing from 20 m to 5 m. The implementation of agrivoltaic system
for the investigated crops at the chosen location shows a land equivalent ratio
above 1.2 that justify the technology for reaching the country sustainability
goals.

between text-dependent and text-independent models to reduce runtime cost and

speaker verification systems at the scale of 46 languages. The problem is
framed from the perspective of using a smart speaker device with interactions
consisting of a wake-up keyword (text-dependent) followed by a speech query
(text-independent). Experimental evidence suggests that training on multiple
languages can generalize to unseen varieties while maintaining performance on
seen varieties. We also found that it can reduce computational requirements for
training models by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, during model inference
on English data, we observe that leveraging a triage framework can reduce the
number of calls to the more computationally expensive text-independent system
by 73% (and reduce latency by 59%) while maintaining an EER no worse than the

survival and other ordinal/continuous clinical outcomes, such as neurocognitive

the clinical outcomes are truncated by death, where subjects die before their
clinical outcome is measured. Treating outcomes as ""missing"" or ""censored"" due
to death can be misleading for treatment effect evaluation. We show that if we
use the median in the survivors or in the always-survivors to summarize
clinical outcomes, we may conclude a trade-off exists between the probability
of survival and good clinical outcomes, even in settings where both the
probability of survival and the probability of any good clinical outcome are
better for one treatment. Therefore, we advocate not always treating death as a
mechanism through which clinical outcomes are missing, but rather as part of
the outcome measure. To account for the survival status, we describe the
survival-incorporated median as an alternative summary measure for outcomes in
the presence of death. The survival-incorporated median is the threshold such
that 50\% of the population is alive with an outcome above that threshold. We
use conceptual examples to show that the survival-incorporated median provides
a simple and useful summary measure to inform clinical practice.

artificial intelligence problem. However, in the past, there has been a lack of
scalable methods to collect commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose to
develop principles for collecting commonsense knowledge based on selectional
preference. We generalize the definition of selectional preference from one-hop
linguistic syntactic relations to higher-order relations over linguistic
graphs. Unlike previous commonsense knowledge definition (e.g., ConceptNet),
selectional preference (SP) knowledge only relies on statistical distribution
over linguistic graphs, which can be efficiently and accurately acquired from
the unlabeled corpus with modern tools. Following this principle, we develop a
large-scale eventuality (a linguistic term covering activity, state, and
event)-based knowledge graph ASER, where each eventuality is represented as a
dependency graph, and the relation between them is a discourse relation defined
in shallow discourse parsing. The higher-order selectional preference over
collected linguistic graphs reflects various kinds of commonsense knowledge.
Moreover, motivated by the observation that humans understand events by
abstracting the observed events to a higher level and can thus transfer their
knowledge to new events, we propose a conceptualization module to significantly
boost the coverage of ASER. In total, ASER contains 648 million edges between
438 million eventualities. After conceptualization with Probase, a selectional
preference based concept-instance relational knowledge base, our concept graph
contains 15 million conceptualized eventualities and 224 million edges between
them. Detailed analysis is provided to demonstrate its quality. All the
collected data, APIs, and tools are available at

The characteristic curves measured on Bernal-stacked graphite surfaces can be
understood with an ordinary self-consistent semiconductor modeling and quantum
mechanical tunneling current derivations. We show that the absence of a voltage
region without measurable current in the $I$-$V$ spectra is not a proof of the
lack of an energy band gap. It can be induced by a surface band bending due to
a finite contact potential between tip and sample surface. Taking this into
account in the model, we succeed to obtain a quantitative agreement between
simulated and measured tunnel spectra for band gaps $(12 \ldots 37)$\,meV, in
agreement to those extracted from the exponential temperature decrease of the
longitudinal resistance measured in graphite samples with Bernal stacking
order. In contrast, the surface of relatively thick graphite samples with
rhombohedral stacking reveals the existence of a maximum in the first

  Models",,,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDMs) are a special family of discrete latent
variable models that are widely used in modern educational, psychological,
social and biological sciences. A key component of CDMs is a binary $Q$-matrix
characterizing the dependence structure between the items and the latent
attributes. Additionally, researchers also assume in many applications certain
hierarchical structures among the latent attributes to characterize their
dependence. In most CDM applications, the attribute-attribute hierarchical
structures, the item-attribute $Q$-matrix, the item-level diagnostic model, as
well as the number of latent attributes, need to be fully or partially
pre-specified, which however may be subjective and misspecified as noted by
many recent studies. This paper considers the problem of jointly learning these
latent and hierarchical structures in CDMs from observed data with minimal
model assumptions. Specifically, a penalized likelihood approach is proposed to
select the number of attributes and estimate the latent and hierarchical
structures simultaneously. An efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
and a latent structure recovery algorithm are developed, and statistical
consistency theory is also established under mild conditions. The good

to introduce a methodology called transfer learning, which utilizes existing
data in situations where there are difficulties in collecting new annotated
data. Transfer learning aims to boost the performance of a target learner by
applying another related source data. In contrast to the traditional machine
learning and data mining techniques, which assume that the training and testing
data lie from the same feature space and distribution, transfer learning can
handle situations where there is a discrepancy between domains and
distributions. These characteristics give the model the potential to utilize
the available related source data and extend the underlying knowledge to the
target task achieving better performance. This survey paper aims to give a
concise review of traditional and current transfer learning settings, existing
challenges, and related approaches.

can lead to catastrophic consequences. One of the most effective methods to
defend against such disturbances is adversarial training but at the cost of
generalization of unseen attacks and transferability across models. In this
paper, we propose a robust defense against adversarial attacks, which is model
agnostic and generalizable to unseen adversaries. Initially, with a baseline
model, we extract the latent representations for each class and adaptively
cluster the latent representations that share a semantic similarity. We obtain
the distributions for the clustered latent representations and from their
originating images, we learn semantic reconstruction dictionaries (SRD). We
adversarially train a new model constraining the latent space representation to
minimize the distance between the adversarial latent representation and the
true cluster distribution. To purify the image, we decompose the input into low
and high-frequency components. The high-frequency component is reconstructed
based on the most adequate SRD from the clean dataset. In order to evaluate the
most adequate SRD, we rely on the distance between robust latent
representations and semantic cluster distributions. The output is a purified
image with no perturbation. Image purification on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10

parameters of these captured halos. This model is able provide qualitative
explanations for the features of this distribution as measured from N-body

smaller scales our model predicts an overall increase in the characteristic
velocities of merging halos, relative to the virial velocities of those halos,

and the Tiny ImageNet dataset. The optimization can be implemented without loss
of accuracy in almost all cases, while it causes slight accuracy losses in a
few cases. Through these optimizations, the SDMM is performed at the cost of a
small hardware overhead. For example, a single DSP block executes 3 8-bit
fixed-point parameter multiplications. As a result of our optimizations, the
parameters are represented in a different format on off-chip memory, providing
up to 33% compression without any hardware cost. The compression rate can be
further increased by up to 97% when used in conjunction with other compression
methods for the VGG-16. Reaching this compression rate requires extra hardware
cost. A prototype systolic array architecture was implemented employing our
optimizations on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA. It reduced the number of DSP blocks by
66.6%, 75%, and 83.3% for 8, 6, and 4-bit input variables, respectively.

functions. Synchronization in the gamma frequency band (30Hz-100Hz) is involved
in a variety of cognitive phenomena; abnormalities of the gamma synchronization
are found in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Frequently, the
strength of synchronization is not very high and is intermittent even on short
time scales (a few cycles of oscillations). That is, the network exhibits
intervals of synchronization followed by intervals of desynchronization. Neural
circuits dynamics may show different distributions of desynchronization
durations even if the synchronization strength is fixed. In this study, we use
a conductance-based neural network exhibiting pyramidal-interneuron (PING)
gamma rhythm to study the temporal patterning of synchronized neural
oscillations. We found that changes in the synaptic strength (as well as
changes in the membrane kinetics) can alter the temporal patterning of
synchrony. Moreover, we found that the changes in the temporal pattern of
synchrony may be independent of the changes in the average synchrony strength.
Even though the temporal patterning may vary, there is a tendency for dynamics
with short (although potentially numerous) desynchronizations, similar to what
was observed in experimental studies of neural activity synchronization in the
brain. Recent studies suggested that the short desynchronizations dynamics may
facilitate the formation and the break-up of transient neural assemblies. Thus,
the results of this study suggest that changes of synaptic strength may alter
the temporal patterning of the gamma synchronization as to make the neural
networks more efficient in the formation of neural assemblies and the
facilitation of cognitive phenomena.

classical gauge theory, in particular, the Lie algebra (and its action) is
generalized to a Lie algebroid $E$, equipped with a connection $\nabla$, and
the field strength has an extra term $\zeta$. In the classical situation $E$ is
an action Lie algebroid, $\nabla$ is then the canonical flat connection with
respect to such an $E$, and $\zeta\equiv 0$. The shortened main results of this
Ph.D.thesis are the following; see the abstract in the thesis itself for more
information: 1. Reformulating curved Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theory, also
including a thorough introduction and a coordinate-free formulation. Especially
the infinitesimal gauge transformation will be generalized to a derivation on
vector bundle $V$-valued functionals, induced by a Lie algebroid connection. 2.
We will discuss what type of connection for the definition of the infinitesimal
gauge transformation should be used, and this is argued by studying the
commutator of two infinitesimal gauge transformations, viewed as derivations on
$V$-valued functionals. We take the connection on $W$ then in such a way that
the commutator is again an infinitesimal gauge transformation. 3. Defining an
equivalence of CYMH GTs given by a field redefinition. In order to preserve the
physics, this equivalence is constructed in such a way that the Lagrangian of
the studied theory is invariant under this field redefinition. It is then
natural to study whether there are equivalence classes admitting
representatives with flat $\nabla$ and/or zero $\zeta$, and we will do so
especially for Lie algebra bundles, tangent bundles and their direct products
as Lie algebroids.

characters has been a fundamental challenge in computer animation. Data-driven
methods that leverage motion tracking are a prominent class of techniques for
producing high fidelity motions for a wide range of behaviors. However, the
effectiveness of these tracking-based methods often hinges on carefully
designed objective functions, and when applied to large and diverse motion
datasets, these methods require significant additional machinery to select the
appropriate motion for the character to track in a given scenario. In this
work, we propose to obviate the need to manually design imitation objectives
and mechanisms for motion selection by utilizing a fully automated approach
based on adversarial imitation learning. High-level task objectives that the
character should perform can be specified by relatively simple reward
functions, while the low-level style of the character's behaviors can be
specified by a dataset of unstructured motion clips, without any explicit clip
selection or sequencing. These motion clips are used to train an adversarial
motion prior, which specifies style-rewards for training the character through
reinforcement learning (RL). The adversarial RL procedure automatically selects
which motion to perform, dynamically interpolating and generalizing from the
dataset. Our system produces high-quality motions that are comparable to those
achieved by state-of-the-art tracking-based techniques, while also being able
to easily accommodate large datasets of unstructured motion clips. Composition
of disparate skills emerges automatically from the motion prior, without
requiring a high-level motion planner or other task-specific annotations of the
motion clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a diverse

even more crucial when the equation under study is time-dependent, forcing in
this way the choice of Hermite functions where the corresponding weight depends

proposed an automatic decision-making process that relies on machine learning

A quantum spin liquid appears as the ground state of the Kitaev model in the

sector, the Majorana fermion system has linear dispersions and shows power law
behavior in the Majorana correlations. On the other hand, periodically-arranged

find that one of the periodically arranged flux states results in the gapped
Majorana dispersion and the exponential decay in the Majorana correlations. The
Kitaev system with another flux configuration exhibits a semi-Dirac like
dispersion, leading to the power law decay with a smaller power than that in
the flux-free sector along symmetry axes. We also examine the effect of the
randomness in the flux configurations and clarify that the Majorana density of

of motion for galaxies with a time-dependent effective metric tensor
$G_{\mu\nu}(t)$. The strong cosmological principle states that
$G_{\mu\nu}(t)=\e_{\mu\nu} A^2(t)$ for $t \ge 0$. In a model (HHK) with
Yang-Mills gravity in the super-macroscopic limit, one has $A(t)= a_o t^{1/2}$,
which leads to the initial mass run away velocity $\dot{r}(0)=c$, associated
with $r(0)=r_o>0$. Thus, the Okubo equation of motion for galaxies predicts a
`detonation' at the beginning of the universe. The Okubo equation also implies
$r(\infty) \to \infty$, $\dot{r}(\infty) \to 0$ with zero redshift for the
future of the universe. In addition, the Okubo equation leads to the usual
Hubble's law $\dot{r}(t) \approx H(t) r(t)$, where $H(t)=\dot{A}(t)/A(t)$ in
non-relativistic approximation. We also discuss a model with a strict Hubble
linear relation $\dot{r}(t) \approx const.\times r(t)$ for all time. This model
gives a silent beginning of the universe: $\dot{r}(t)=0, \
\ddot{r}(t)\to\infty$ as $t \to 0$; and final radius $r(t) \to \infty,$ final

the diffuse aurora, which constitutes more than 75% of the particle energy

thought to be excited predominantly by the loss cone anisotropy (velocity-space
gradients) that arises naturally in a planetary dipole field. Recent THEMIS
observations, however, indicate that an electron beam can also excite such
waves in Earth's magnetotail. The ambient and beam plasma conditions under
which electron beam excitation can take place are unknown. Knowledge of such
conditions would allow us to further explore the relative contribution of this
excitation mechanism to ECH wave scattering of magnetospheric electrons at
Earth and the outer planets. Using the hot plasma dispersion relation, we
address the nature of beam-driven ECH waves and conduct a comprehensive
parametric survey of this instability. We find that growth is provided by beam
electron cyclotron resonances of both first and higher orders. We also find
that these waves are unstable under a wide range of plasma conditions. The
growth rate increases with beam density, beam velocity, and hot electron
temperature; it decreases with increasing beam temperature and beam temperature
anisotropy, hot electron density, and cold electron density and temperature.
Such conditions abound in Earth's magnetotail, where magnetospheric electrons
heated by earthward convection and magnetic reconnection coexist with colder
ionospheric electrons.

  Model",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that machine learning models are vulnerable to small but
cleverly-designed adversarial perturbations that can cause misclassification.
While there has been major progress in designing attacks and defenses for
various adversarial settings, many fundamental and theoretical problems are yet
to be resolved. In this paper, we consider classification in the presence of
$\ell_0$-bounded adversarial perturbations, a.k.a. sparse attacks. This setting
is significantly different from other $\ell_p$-adversarial settings, with
$p\geq 1$, as the $\ell_0$-ball is non-convex and highly non-smooth. Under the
assumption that data is distributed according to the Gaussian mixture model,
our goal is to characterize the optimal robust classifier and the corresponding
robust classification error as well as a variety of trade-offs between
robustness, accuracy, and the adversary's budget. To this end, we develop a
novel classification algorithm called FilTrun that has two main modules:
Filtration and Truncation. The key idea of our method is to first filter out
the non-robust coordinates of the input and then apply a carefully-designed
truncated inner product for classification. By analyzing the performance of
FilTrun, we derive an upper bound on the optimal robust classification error.
We also find a lower bound by designing a specific adversarial strategy that
enables us to derive the corresponding robust classifier and its achieved
error. For the case that the covariance matrix of the Gaussian mixtures is
diagonal, we show that as the input's dimension gets large, the upper and lower
bounds converge; i.e. we characterize the asymptotically-optimal robust
classifier. Throughout, we discuss several examples that illustrate interesting
behaviors such as the existence of a phase transition for adversary's budget
determining whether the effect of adversarial perturbation can be fully
neutralized.

formation in galaxies. While it is clear that the cold gas reservoir, which
fuels the formation of new stars, must be affected first, how this happens and
what are the dominant physical mechanisms involved is still a matter of debate.
At least for satellite galaxies, it is generally accepted that internal
processes alone cannot be responsible for fully quenching their star formation,
but that environment should play an important, if not dominant, role. In nearby
clusters, we see examples of cold gas being removed from the star-forming disks
of galaxies moving through the intracluster medium, but whether active
stripping is widespread and/or necessary to halt star formation in satellites,
or quenching is just a consequence of the inability of these galaxies to
replenish their cold gas reservoirs, remains unclear. In this work, we review
the current status of environmental studies of cold gas in star-forming
satellites in the local Universe from an observational perspective, focusing on
the evidence for a physical link between cold gas stripping and quenching of
the star formation. We find that stripping of cold gas is ubiquitous in
satellite galaxies in both group and cluster environments. While hydrodynamical
mechanisms such as ram pressure are important, the emerging picture across the
full range of dark matter halos and stellar masses is a complex one, where
different physical mechanisms may act simultaneously and cannot always be
easily separated. Most importantly, we show that stripping does not always lead
to full quenching, as only a fraction of the cold gas reservoir might be
affected at the first pericentre passage. We argue that this is a key point to
reconcile apparent tensions between statistical and detailed analyses of

prominent and experimentally accessible features. Using a combination of
dynamical systems theory, experiments on two-dimensional mixtures of
microtubules and kinesin and hydrodynamic simulations, we characterize
positional coherence in active nematics. These coherent structures can be
identified in the framework of Lagrangian dynamics as moving attractors and
repellers, which orchestrate complex motion. To understand the interaction of
positional and orientational coherence on the dynamics of defects, we then
analysed observations and simulations and see that +1/2 defects move and deform
the attractors, thus functioning as control centers for collective motion.
Additionally, we find that regions around isolated +1/2 defects undergo high
bending and low stretching/shearing deformations, consistent with the local
stress distribution. The stress is minimum at the defect, while high
differential stress along the defect orientation induces folding. Our work
offers a new perspective to describe self-organization in active fluids, with

analyzing the $K_{\rm s}$-band variability and $JHK_{\rm s}$ infrared colors
from the {\it VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea} (VVV) survey.
Additionally, SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 infrared spectra of selected objects are
analyzed.
  The sample show relatively high amplitudes ($0.661<\Delta K_{\rm S} <3.521$
mag). Most of them resemble sources with outbursts with amplitude $>1$ mag and
duration longer than a few days, typically at least a year, known as {\it
Eruptive Variables}. About 60% are likely to be Class II/Flat/I objects. This
is also confirmed by the spectral index $\alpha$ when available.
  From the analysis of APOGEE-2 near-infrared spectra of sources in the region,
another 122 stars are classified as YSOs, and displays some infrared
variability. The measured effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ peak is around
4000K and they are slightly super-solar in metal abundance. The modal radial
velocity is approximately $-$41 km/s.
  Combining available catalogs of YSOs in the region with our data, we
investigate the spatial distributions of 700 YSOs. They are clearly
concentrated within the central cavity formed by the massive clusters Danks 1

Our targets are the [NII] 122 $\rm{\mu m}$ fine-structure emission line and
underlying 120 $\rm{\mu m}$ dust continuum. The dust continuum is detected with
a $ \sim $19$ \sigma $ significance. From far-infrared spectral energy

\sigma $ upper limit of the [NII] luminosity is $ 8.1 \times 10^7\ {\rm

Cloudy photoionization code to estimate nebular parameters as functions of
metallicity. If the metallicity of the galaxy is high ($ Z > 0.4\ {\rm

The nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio, $\rm{N/O}$, is constrained to be
sub-solar. At $ Z < 0.4\ {\rm Z}_\odot$, the allowed $ U $ drastically
increases as the assumed metallicity decreases. For high ionization parameters,
the $\rm{N/O}$ constraint becomes weak. Finally, our Cloudy models predict the
location of B14-65666 on the BPT diagram, thereby allowing a comparison with

gives the future asymptotic of a homoclinic orbit as a function of the past

to assume that the asymptotic orbits have a special nature (periodic,
quasi-periodic, etc.).
  We add a non-conservative, time-dependent perturbation, as a model for a
thrust applied to the spacecraft for some duration of time, or for some other
effect, such as solar radiation pressure. We compute the first order

integrals of the perturbation along homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits of the
unperturbed system. As a possible application, this result can be used to
determine the trajectory of the spacecraft upon using the thrust.

3.6% as much memory. We stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on 5

increasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech
recognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)
speech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and
their variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart
from being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low
user-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This
work examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training
criteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our
analyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),
or measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability
to process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.
Thus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in
accurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded
devices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and
endpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off
between latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with
endpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization
mechanism.

electric dipole orders have also been predicted in two-dimensional van der

high integratability, the two-dimensional van der Waals materials will play an
important role in the investigation on noncollinear topological textures in

in the reviewed works, as well as investigating their abilities to improve the

an object in the air is more likely to be an airplane than a pig. The rich
notion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules,
statistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While
previous work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the
web to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual
violations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic
Out-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By
leveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity,
object co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a
virtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain
insights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision
using OCD. We conducted psychophysics experiments to establish a human
benchmark for out-of-context recognition, and then compared it with
state-of-the-art computer vision models to quantify the gap between the two. We
propose a context-aware recognition transformer model, fusing object and
contextual information via multi-head attention. Our model captures useful
information for contextual reasoning, enabling human-level performance and
better robustness in out-of-context conditions compared to baseline models

including interaction between the system under measurement and the measurement
apparatus. Augmenting the action with a nonlocal term (a double integration
over the duration of the interaction) results in a theory capable of describing
both the measurement process (agreement between system state and pointer state)
and the collapse of both systems into a single eigenstate (or superposition of
degenerate eigenstates) of the relevant operator. In the absence of the
interaction, a superposition of states is stable, and the theory agrees with
the predictions of standard quantum theory. Because the theory is nonlocal, the
resulting wave equation is an integrodifferential equation (IDE). We
demonstrate these ideas using a simple Lagrangian for both systems, as proof of
principle. The variational principle is time-symmetric and retrocausal, so the
solution for the measurement process is determined by boundary conditions at
both initial and final times; the initial condition is determined by the
experimental preparation and the final condition is the natural boundary
condition of variational calculus. We hypothesize that one or more hidden
variables (not ruled out by Bell's Theorem, due both to the retrocausality and
the nonlocality of the theory) influence the outcome of the measurement, and
that distributions of the hidden variables that arise plausibly in a typical
ensemble of experimental realizations give rise to outcome frequencies
consistent with Born's rule. We outline steps in a theoretical validation of
the hypothesis. We discuss the role of both initial and final conditions to
determine a solution at intermediate times, the mechanism by which a system
responds to measurement, time symmetry of the new theory, causality concerns,

sync with magnetic anisotropy switching from an out-of-plane orientation to an
in-plane one, respectively, via controlling the Te source flux during film
growth, leading to different c-lattice parameters while preserving the
stoichiometries and thicknesses of the films. We attributed this modulation of
magnetic anisotropy to the switching of the orbital magnetic moment, using
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism analysis. We also inferred that different
c-lattice constants might be responsible for the magnetic anisotropy change,
supported by theoretical calculations. These findings emphasize the potential
of ultrathin Cr_{2}Te_{3} films as candidates for developing room-temperature

  Mixup and Contrastive Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of existing underwater object detection methods degrades
seriously when facing domain shift caused by complicated underwater
environments. Due to the limitation of the number of domains in the dataset,
deep detectors easily memorize a few seen domains, which leads to low
generalization ability. There are two common ideas to improve the domain
generalization performance. First, it can be inferred that the detector trained
on as many domains as possible is domain-invariant. Second, for the images with
the same semantic content in different domains, their hidden features should be
equivalent. This paper further excavates these two ideas and proposes a domain
generalization framework (named DMC) that learns how to generalize across
domains from Domain Mixup and Contrastive Learning. First, based on the
formation of underwater images, an image in an underwater environment is the
linear transformation of another underwater environment. Thus, a style transfer
model, which outputs a linear transformation matrix instead of the whole image,
is proposed to transform images from one source domain to another, enriching
the domain diversity of the training data. Second, mixup operation interpolates
different domains on the feature level, sampling new domains on the domain
manifold. Third, contrastive loss is selectively applied to features from
different domains to force the model to learn domain invariant features but
retain the discriminative capacity. With our method, detectors will be robust
to domain shift. Also, a domain generalization benchmark S-UODAC2020 for
detection is set up to measure the performance of our method. Comprehensive
experiments on S-UODAC2020 and two object recognition benchmarks (PACS and
VLCS) demonstrate that the proposed method is able to learn domain-invariant
representations, and outperforms other domain generalization methods.

various image generation and synthesis tasks, yet their notoriously high
computational cost hinders their efficient deployment on edge devices. Directly
applying generic compression approaches yields poor results on GANs, which
motivates a number of recent GAN compression works. While prior works mainly
accelerate conditional GANs, e.g., pix2pix and CycleGAN, compressing
state-of-the-art unconditional GANs has rarely been explored and is more
challenging. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for unconditional GAN
compression. We first introduce effective channel pruning and knowledge
distillation schemes specialized for unconditional GANs. We then propose a
novel content-aware method to guide the processes of both pruning and
distillation. With content-awareness, we can effectively prune channels that
are unimportant to the contents of interest, e.g., human faces, and focus our
distillation on these regions, which significantly enhances the distillation
quality. On StyleGAN2 and SN-GAN, we achieve a substantial improvement over the
state-of-the-art compression method. Notably, we reduce the FLOPs of StyleGAN2
by 11x with visually negligible image quality loss compared to the full-size
model. More interestingly, when applied to various image manipulation tasks,
our compressed model forms a smoother and better disentangled latent manifold,
making it more effective for image editing.

this paper, we propose a multi-scale context aggregation network (MSCANet)
based on single-column encoder-decoder architecture for crowd counting, which
consists of an encoder based on a dense context-aware module (DCAM) and a
hierarchical attention-guided decoder. To handle the issue of scale variation,
we construct the DCAM to aggregate multi-scale contextual information by
densely connecting the dilated convolution with varying receptive fields. The
proposed DCAM can capture rich contextual information of crowd areas due to its
long-range receptive fields and dense scale sampling. Moreover, to suppress the
background noise and generate a high-quality density map, we adopt a
hierarchical attention-guided mechanism in the decoder. This helps to integrate
more useful spatial information from shallow feature maps of the encoder by
introducing multiple supervision based on semantic attention module (SAM).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better
performance than other similar state-of-the-art methods on three challenging
benchmark datasets for crowd counting. The code is available at

multivariate data is encoded into quantum states in a Hilbert space whose

tensor network (TTN) topology, which acts as an unsupervised feature extractor
to identify the most relevant quantum states in a data-driven fashion. This
unsupervised feature extractor then feeds a supervised linear classifier and
encodes the output in a small-dimensional quantum register. In contrast to
previous work on \emph{quantum-inspired} TTN classifiers, in which the
embedding map and class decision weights did not map the data to well-defined
quantum states, we present an approach that can be implemented on gate-based
quantum computing devices. In particular, we identify an embedding map with
accuracy similar to exponential machines (Novikov \emph{et al.},
arXiv:1605.03795), but which produces valid quantum states from classical data
vectors, and utilize manifold-based gradient optimization schemes to produce
isometric operations mapping quantum states to a register of qubits defining a
class decision. We detail methods for efficiently obtaining one- and two-point
correlation functions of the decision boundary vectors of the quantum model,
which can be used for model interpretability, as well as methods for obtaining
classifications from partial data vectors. Further, we show that the use of
isometric tensors can significantly aid in the human interpretability of the

existing hardware accelerators may not always be suitable for handling various
DNN models as their architecture paradigms and configuration tradeoffs are
highly application-specific. It is important to benchmark the accelerator
candidates in the earliest stage to gather comprehensive performance metrics
and locate the potential bottlenecks. Further demands also emerge after
benchmarking, which require adequate solutions to address the bottlenecks and
improve the current designs for targeted workloads. To achieve these goals, in
this paper, we leverage an automation tool called DNNExplorer for benchmarking
customized DNN hardware accelerators and exploring novel accelerator designs
with improved performance and efficiency. Key features include (1) direct
support to popular machine learning frameworks for DNN workload analysis and
accurate analytical models for fast accelerator benchmarking; (2) a novel
accelerator design paradigm with high-dimensional design space support and
fine-grained adjustability to overcome the existing design drawbacks; and (3) a
design space exploration (DSE) engine to generate optimized accelerators by
considering targeted AI workloads and available hardware resources. Results
show that accelerators adopting the proposed novel paradigm can deliver up to
4.2X higher throughput (GOP/s) than the state-of-the-art pipeline design in
DNNBuilder and up to 2.0X improved efficiency than the recently published
generic design in HybridDNN given the same DNN model and resource budgets. With
DNNExplorer's benchmarking and exploration features, we can be ahead at
building and optimizing customized AI accelerators and enable more efficient AI
applications.

the unknown depths for the remaining image pixels. Most methods model this as
depth interpolation and erroneously interpolate depth pixels into the empty
space between spatially distinct objects, resulting in depth-smearing across
occlusion boundaries. Here we propose a multi-hypothesis depth representation
that explicitly models both foreground and background depths in the difficult
occlusion-boundary regions. Our method can be thought of as performing
twin-surface extrapolation, rather than interpolation, in these regions. Next
our method fuses these extrapolated surfaces into a single depth image
leveraging the image data. Key to our method is the use of an asymmetric loss
function that operates on a novel twin-surface representation. This enables us
to train a network to simultaneously do surface extrapolation and surface
fusion. We characterize our loss function and compare with other common losses.
Finally, we validate our method on three different datasets; KITTI, an outdoor
real-world dataset, NYU2, indoor real-world depth dataset and Virtual KITTI, a
photo-realistic synthetic dataset with dense groundtruth, and demonstrate
improvement over the state of the art.

stronger resistance against structural attacks and more compact representation

Upon defining the Caputo fractional gradient with respect to the Cartesian

locally smoothed objective function. The generic CFGD requires three parameters
to be specified, and a choice of the parameters yields a version of CFGD. We
propose three versions -- non-adaptive, adaptive terminal and adaptive order.
By focusing on quadratic objective functions, we provide a convergence
analysis. We prove that the non-adaptive CFGD converges to a Tikhonov
regularized solution. For the two adaptive versions, we derive error bounds,
which show convergence to integer-order stationary point under some conditions.
We derive an explicit formula of CFGD for quadratic functions. We
computationally found that the adaptive terminal (AT) CFGD mitigates the
dependence on the condition number in the rate of convergence and results in
significant acceleration over gradient descent (GD). For non-quadratic
functions, we develop an efficient implementation of CFGD using the
Gauss-Jacobi quadrature, whose computational cost is approximately proportional
to the number of the quadrature points and the cost of GD. Our numerical
examples show that AT-CFGD results in acceleration over GD, even when a small
number of the Gauss-Jacobi quadrature points (including a single point) is
used.

servers to host Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, which perform inference tasks
for the clients. Such services require the client to send input data to the
service provider, who processes it using a DNN and returns the output
predictions to the client. Due to the rich nature of the inputs such as images
and speech, the input often contains more information than what is necessary to
perform the primary inference task. Consequently, in addition to the primary
inference task, a malicious service provider could infer secondary (sensitive)
attributes from the input, compromising the client's privacy. The goal of our
work is to improve inference privacy by injecting noise to the input to hide
the irrelevant features that are not conducive to the primary classification
task. To this end, we propose Adaptive Noise Injection (ANI), which uses a
light-weight DNN on the client-side to inject noise to each input, before
transmitting it to the service provider to perform inference. Our key insight
is that by customizing the noise to each input, we can achieve state-of-the-art
trade-off between utility and privacy (up to 48.5% degradation in
sensitive-task accuracy with <1% degradation in primary accuracy),
significantly outperforming existing noise injection schemes. Our method does

pandemics. It aims to identify individuals who closely contacted an infected
person during the incubation period of the virus and notify them to quarantine.
However, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and efficiency
issues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient
and privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of
depending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health
authorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using
Blockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of
failure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all
transactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is
important, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike
most of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system
consists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public
places access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control
subsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent
spreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based
on the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones.
Our analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy
of the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking
attacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our
extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system
(which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation,

local Berry curvature of low-energy massive Dirac fermions can give rise to
nontrivial spin and charge responses, even though the integral of the Berry
curvature over all occupied states is zero. In this work, we present a new
effect induced by the electronic Berry curvature. By studying electron-phonon
interactions in BaMnSb$_2$, a prototype two-dimensional Dirac material
possessing two TR-related massive Dirac cones, we find that the nonzero local
Berry curvature of electrons can induce a phonon angular momentum. The
direction of this phonon angular momentum is locked to the phonon propagation
direction, and thus we refer it as ""phonon helicity"", in a way that is
reminiscent of electron helicity in spin-orbit-coupled electronic systems. We
discuss possible experimental probes of such phonon helicity.

and has been actively studied. However, how to quickly teach a robot to grasp a
novel target object in clutter remains challenging. This paper attempts to
tackle the challenge by leveraging object attributes that facilitate
recognition, grasping, and quick adaptation. In this work, we introduce an
end-to-end learning method of attribute-based robotic grasping with one-grasp
adaptation capability. Our approach fuses the embeddings of a workspace image
and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and learns to predict
instance grasping affordances. Besides, we utilize object persistence before
and after grasping to learn a joint metric space of visual and textual
attributes. Our model is self-supervised in a simulation that only uses basic
objects of various colors and shapes but generalizes to novel objects and
real-world scenes. We further demonstrate that our model is capable of adapting
to novel objects with only one grasp data and improving instance grasping
performance significantly. Experimental results in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate that our approach achieves over 80\% instance grasping
success rate on unknown objects, which outperforms several baselines by large
margins.

derived. Based on the analysis, the RH problem with four jump matrices in a

this study designed and implemented three spatio-temporal graph convolutional

the road segment level in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris

the adjacency and distance between road segments, while Model 2 contains an
additional elevation block to account for elevation difference between road

representation capacity of features, alleviating feature drift of old network

over-fitting of the expanded network from a perspective of compact

considerable loss of animal and human life, as well as significant property
damage and regular insurance claims. Understanding their occurrence in relation
to various contributing factors and being able to identify locations of high
risk are valuable to AVC prevention, yielding economic, social and
environmental cost savings. However, many challenges exist in the study of AVC
datasets. These include seasonality of animal activity, unknown exposure (i.e.,
the number of animal crossings), very low AVC counts across most sections of
extensive roadway networks, and computational burdens that come with discrete
response analysis using large datasets. To overcome these challenges, a
Bayesian hierarchical model is proposed where the exposure is modeled with
nonparametric Dirichlet process, and the number of segment-level AVCs is
assumed to follow a Binomial distribution. A P\'olya-Gamma augmented Gibbs
sampler is derived to estimate the proposed model. By using the AVC data of
multiple years across about 100,000 segments of state-controlled highways in
Texas, U.S., it is demonstrated that the model is scalable to large datasets,
with a preponderance of zeros and clear monthly seasonality in counts, while
identifying high-risk locations (for application of design treatments, like

leadership is a process that organizes interactions among members to make a
group achieve collective goals. Understanding initiation of coordinated
activities allows scientists to gain more insight into social species
behaviors. However, by using only time series of activities data, inferring
leadership as manifested by the initiation of coordinated activities faces many
challenging issues. First, coordinated activities are dynamic and are changing
over time. Second, several different coordinated activities might occur
simultaneously among subgroups. Third, there is no fundamental concept to
describe these activities computationally. In this paper, we formalize Faction
Initiator Inference Problem and propose a leadership inference framework as a
solution of this problem. The framework makes no assumption about the
characteristics of a leader or the parameters of the coordination process. The
framework performs better than our non-trivial baseline in both simulated and

of our framework as a tool to study group merging and splitting dynamics on
another biological dataset of trajectories of wild baboons. In addition, our

construction before interacting with an environment. Although interest in this
problem has grown significantly in recent years, its theoretical foundations
remain under-developed. To advance the understanding of this problem, we
provide three results that characterize the limits and possibilities of batch
policy optimization in the finite-armed stochastic bandit setting. First, we
introduce a class of confidence-adjusted index algorithms that unifies
optimistic and pessimistic principles in a common framework, which enables a
general analysis. For this family, we show that any confidence-adjusted index
algorithm is minimax optimal, whether it be optimistic, pessimistic or neutral.
Our analysis reveals that instance-dependent optimality, commonly used to
establish optimality of on-line stochastic bandit algorithms, cannot be
achieved by any algorithm in the batch setting. In particular, for any
algorithm that performs optimally in some environment, there exists another
environment where the same algorithm suffers arbitrarily larger regret.
Therefore, to establish a framework for distinguishing algorithms, we introduce
a new weighted-minimax criterion that considers the inherent difficulty of
optimal value prediction. We demonstrate how this criterion can be used to
justify commonly used pessimistic principles for batch policy optimization.

Our motivation is that regressing keypoint positions accurately needs to learn

  We present a simple yet effective approach, named disentangled keypoint
regression (DEKR). We adopt adaptive convolutions through pixel-wise spatial
transformer to activate the pixels in the keypoint regions and accordingly
learn representations from them. We use a multi-branch structure for separate
regression: each branch learns a representation with dedicated adaptive
convolutions and regresses one keypoint. The resulting disentangled
representations are able to attend to the keypoint regions, respectively, and
thus the keypoint regression is spatially more accurate. We empirically show
that the proposed direct regression method outperforms keypoint detection and
grouping methods and achieves superior bottom-up pose estimation results on two

modeled the supersonic part of the wind by computing the line force (force
multiplier) with the Castor, Abbott and Klein formalism and XSTAR physics and
by solving the mass conservation and momentum balance equations. We computed
the line force locally in the wind considering the radiation fields from both
the donor and the compact star in each spectral state. The wind equations were
solved at different orbital angles from the line joining the stars and taking
the effect of wind clumping into account. Wind-induced accretion luminosities
were estimated using the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formalism and computed wind
velocities at the compact star. We found a correlation between the luminosities

show that soft X-rays (EUV) from the compact star penetrate the wind from the

the face-on side. This increases the computed accretion luminosities
qualitatively in a similar manner as observed in the spectral evolution of Cyg

as linear functionals (moment functionals) forming a 3D vector space, so force

The linear combination of these moment functions can naturally be used as a

to present a dimension independent way of treating forces as functions, that
returns the known stress-functions of planar and spatial graphic statics. This

However, the performance of CT denoising is generally limited due to the

pre-train CT denoising and noise models that can predict CT noise from Low-dose

the noise using the ensemble of noise models. We evaluate our method on the
2016 AAPM Low-Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset. The proposed ensemble noise
model can generate realistic CT noise, and thus our method significantly
improves the denoising performance existing denoising models trained by

classifying the presence or absence of tumor. For the brain MR dataset, our
method can achieve the average accuracy of 99.18% under ten-fold
cross-validation for identifying the presence or absence of tumor, and 83.38%

segment these vessels structures, especially the thin capillaries from the
color retinal image due to low contrast and ambiguousness. In this paper, we
propose pyramid U-Net for accurate retinal vessel segmentation. In pyramid
U-Net, the proposed pyramid-scale aggregation blocks (PSABs) are employed in
both the encoder and decoder to aggregate features at higher, current and lower
levels. In this way, coarse-to-fine context information is shared and
aggregated in each block thus to improve the location of capillaries. To
further improve performance, two optimizations including pyramid inputs
enhancement and deep pyramid supervision are applied to PSABs in the encoder
and decoder, respectively. For PSABs in the encoder, scaled input images are
added as extra inputs. While for PSABs in the decoder, scaled intermediate
outputs are supervised by the scaled segmentation labels. Extensive evaluations
show that our pyramid U-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on

since realizable physical systems are limited by the saturation of actuators.
The actuators' saturation degrades the performance of the control system, and
in extreme cases, the stability of the closed-loop system may be lost. However,
actuator saturation is typically neglected in the design of control systems,
with compensation being made in the form of over-designing the actuator or by
post-analyzing the resulting system to ensure acceptable performance. The
bounded input control of fully actuated systems has been investigated in
multiple studies, but it is not generalized for under actuated mechanical
systems. This article proposes a systematic framework for finding the upper
bound of control effort in underactuated systems, based on interconnection and
the damping assignment passivity based control (IDA-PBC) approach. The proposed
method also offers design variables for the control law to be tuned,
considering the actuator's limit. The major difficulty in finding the control
input upper bounds is the velocity dependent kinetic energy related terms.
Thus, the upper bound of velocity is computed using a suitable Lyapunov
candidate as a function of closed-loop system parameters. The validity and
application of the proposed method are investigated in detail through two
benchmark systems.

practices although it is ubiquitously recommended to prevent major bile duct
injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). This study aims to determine
whether performing a short intraoperative time out can improve CVS
implementation. Methods: Surgeons performing LCs at an academic centre were
invited to perform a 5-second long time out to verify CVS before dividing the
cystic duct (5-second rule). The primary endpoint was to compare the rate of
CVS achievement between LCs performed in the year before and the year after the
5-second rule. The CVS achievement rate was computed using the mediated
video-based assessment of two independent reviewers. Clinical outcomes, LC
workflows, and postoperative reports were also compared. Results: Three hundred
and forty-three (171 before and 172 after the 5-second rule) of the 381 LCs
performed over the 2-year study were analysed. After the implementation of the
5-second rule, the rate of CVS achievement increased significantly (15.9 vs
44.1 %; P<0.001) as well as the rate of bailout procedures (8.2 vs 15.7 %;
P=0.045), the median time to clip the cystic duct or artery (17:26
[interquartile range: 16:46] vs 23:12 [17:16] minutes; P=0.007), and the rate
of postoperative CVS reporting (1.3 vs 28.8 %; P<0.001). Morbidity was
comparable (1.75 vs 2.33 % before and after the 5-second rule respectively;
P=0.685). Conclusion: Performing a short intraoperative time out improves CVS
implementation during LC. Systematic intraoperative cognitive aids should be
studied to sustain the uptake of guidelines.

extending to the optical self-energy, and eventually, to the optical

electron-boson spectral density functions of K-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ (Ba-122) at
four different doping levels. We discuss the doping-dependent properties of the

suffering from trivial localization results. To solve this issue, we introduce
an adaptive mutual supervision framework (AMS) with two branches, where the
base branch adopts CAS to localize the most discriminative action regions,
while the supplementary branch localizes the less discriminative action regions
through a novel adaptive sampler. The adaptive sampler dynamically updates the
input of the supplementary branch with a sampling weight sequence negatively
correlated with the CAS from the base branch, thereby prompting the
supplementary branch to localize the action regions underestimated by the base
branch. To promote mutual enhancement between these two branches, we construct
mutual location supervision. Each branch leverages location pseudo-labels
generated from the other branch as localization supervision. By alternately
optimizing the two branches in multiple iterations, we progressively complete
action regions. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2
demonstrate that the proposed AMS method significantly outperforms the

widen the current understanding of people's practices in Nature and identify a
design space for technology that supports such practices. Speleology is a
practice based on the discovery, study, and dissemination of natural cavities.
Speleologists are amateur experts who often collaborate with scientists and
local institutions to understand the geology, hydrology, and biology of a
territory. Their skills are at the same time physical, technical, and
theoretical; this is why speleology is defined as a 'sporting science'. Being
at the boundary between outdoor adventure sports and citizen science,
speleology is an interesting case study for investigating the variety and
complexity of activities carried out in the natural context. We interviewed 15
experienced speleologists to explore their goals, routines, vision of the
outdoors, and attitude towards technology. From our study, it emerged that i)
the excitement of discovery and the unpredictability of an explorative trip are
the strongest motivations for people to engage in speleology; ii) physical
skilfulness is a means for knowledge generation; iii) the practice is
necessarily collective and requires group coordination. From these findings, an
ambivalent attitude towards technology emerged: on the one hand, the scientific
vocation of speleology welcomes technology supporting the development of
knowledge; on the other hand, aspects typical of adventure sports lead to
resistance to technology facilitating the physical performance. We conclude the
article by presenting design considerations for devices supporting speleology,
as well as a few reflections on how communities of speleologists can inspire
citizen science projects.

leptogenesis mechanism and dark matter relic density share a common origin via
decays of Majorana neutrinos $N$. Provided an additional species $\varphi$
whose energy density red-shifts as $\rho_{\varphi}\propto a^{-(4+n)}$, the
Hubble expansion rate is larger than the standard scenario, i.e., the Universe
expands faster. The consequences of such a fast expanding Universe on
leptogenesis as well as FIMP dark matter are investigated in detail. We
demonstrate a significant impact on the final baryon asymmetry and dark matter
abundance due to the existence of $\varphi$ for the strong washout scenario.
While for the weak washout scenario, the effects of FEU are relatively small.
We introduce scale factors $F_L$ and $F_\chi$ to describe the corresponding
effects of FEU. A semi-analytical approach to derive the efficiency factors
$\eta_L$ and $\eta_\chi$ in FEU is also discussed. The viable parameter space
for success thermal leptogenesis and correct FIMP DM relic density is obtained

resonance frequencies of a sound-hard slab with a finite number of arbitrarily
shaped cylindrical holes of diameter ${\cal O}(h)$ for $h\ll1$. Outside the
holes, a sound field can be expressed in terms of its normal derivatives on the
apertures of holes. Inside each hole, since the vertical variable can be
separated, the field can be expressed in terms of a countable set of Fourier
basis functions. Matching the field on each aperture yields a linear system of
countable equations in terms of a countable set of unknown Fourier
coefficients. The linear system can be reduced to a finite-dimensional linear
system based on the invertibility of its principal submatrix, which is proved
by the well-posedness of a closely related boundary value problem for each hole
in the limiting case $h\to 0$, so that only the leading Fourier coefficient of
each hole is preserved in the finite-dimensional system. The resonance
frequencies are those making the resulting finite-dimensional linear system
rank deficient. By regular asymptotic analysis for $h \ll 1$, we get a
systematic asymptotic formula for characterizing the resonance frequencies by
the 3D subwavelength structure. The formula reveals an important fact that when
all holes are of the same shape, the Q-factor for any resonance frequency
asymptotically behaves as ${\cal O}(h^{-2})$ for $h\ll1$ with its prefactor
independent of shapes of holes.

gradually ionize atoms to increase the ionization temperature (kT_{i}). The
observational fact is that most of the young and middle-to-old aged SNRs have
lower kT_{i} than kT_{e} after the shock heating. The temperature evolution in
the shell-like SNRs has been explained by this ionizing plasma (IP) scenario.
On the other hand, in the last decade, a significant fraction of the mixed

kT_{i} than kT_{e}. The origin and the evolution mechanism of the RP SNRs have
been puzzling. To address this puzzle, this paper presents the kT_{e} and

(TKE) dissipation in the surrounding water through direct observations. The
field work was carried out in Van Mijen Fjord on Svalbard, where an artificial
3x4 m^2 ice floe was sawed out in the 1 m thick ice. Wave motion was simulated
by pulling the ice floe back and forth in an oscillatory manner with two
electrical winches in a 4x6 m^2 pool. Ice floe motion was measured with a range
meter, and the water turbulence was measured with acoustic velocimeters. TKE
frequency spectra were found to contain an inertial subrange where energy was
cascading at a rate proportional to f^(-5/3). From the spectra estimated at
several vertical positions, the TKE dissipation rate was found to decrease
exponentially with depth. The total TKE dissipation rate was estimated by
assuming that turbulence was induced over an area spanning over the ice floe
width and the pool length. The preliminary energy budget suggests that
approximately 60% of the input power from the winches was dissipated in
turbulence, which experimentally confirms that energy dissipation by induced
turbulent water motion is an important mechanism for colliding ice floe fields.

for control and automation and need to fulfill strict real-time guarantees. To
facilitate more efficient business processes and remote control, such devices
are being connected to IP networks. Due to the difficulty in predicting network
packets and the interrelated workloads of interrupt handlers and drivers,
devices controlling time critical processes stand under the risk of missing
process deadlines when under high network loads. Additionally, devices at the
edge of large networks and the internet are subject to a high risk of load
spikes and network packet overloads.
  In this paper, we investigate strategies to detect network packet overloads
in real-time and present four approaches to adaptively mitigate local deadline
misses. In addition to two strategies mitigating network bursts with and
without hysteresis, we present and discuss two novel mitigation algorithms,
called Budget and Queue Mitigation. In an experimental evaluation, all
algorithms showed mitigating effects, with the Queue Mitigation strategy
enabling most packet processing while preventing lateness of critical tasks.

understanding of the process is still lacking. Here, we develop a microscopic
theory for chemotaxis, valid for enzymes and other small molecules. Our theory
includes both non-specific interactions between enzyme and substrate, as well
as complex formation through specific binding between the enzyme and the
substrate. We find that two distinct mechanisms contribute to enzyme
chemotaxis: a diffusiophoretic mechanism due to the non-specific interactions,
and a new type of mechanism due to binding-induced changes in the diffusion
coefficient of the enzyme. The latter chemotactic mechanism points towards
lower substrate concentration if the substrate enhances enzyme diffusion, and
towards higher substrate concentration if the substrate inhibits enzyme
diffusion. For a typical enzyme, attractive phoresis and binding-induced
enhanced diffusion will compete against each other. We find that phoresis
dominates above a critical substrate concentration, whereas binding-induced
enhanced diffusion dominates for low substrate concentration. Our results
resolve an apparent contradiction regarding the direction of urease chemotaxis
observed in experiments, and in general clarify the relation between enhanced
diffusion and chemotaxis of enzymes. Finally, we show that the competition
between the two distinct chemotactic mechanisms may be used to engineer
nanomachines that move towards or away from regions with a specific substrate

solution. Moreover, if the concentration of the substrate is non-uniform,
enzymes and other small molecules have been reported to show chemotaxis --
biased stochastic movement in the direction of the substrate gradient --
typically towards higher concentrations of this substrate, with a few
exceptions. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for enhanced
diffusion and chemotaxis at the nanoscale, however, are still not well

biological research, e.g. in the context of spatial organization of enzymes in

mechanisms relying on the catalytic step of the enzymatic reaction, and
equilibrium mechanisms which consider the reversible binding and unbinding of

fitting a regression curve to a cloud of observations of traffic variables.
Such estimates, however, may suffer from the confounding/endogeneity bias due
to omitted variables such as driving behaviour and weather. To this end, this
paper adopts a causal approach to obtain an unbiased estimate of the
fundamental flow-density relationship using traffic detector data. In
particular, we apply a Bayesian non-parametric spline-based regression approach
with instrumental variables to adjust for the aforementioned confounding bias.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against standard curve-fitting methods in
estimating the flow-density relationship for three highway bottlenecks in the
United States. Our empirical results suggest that the saturated (or
hypercongested) regime of the estimated flow-density relationship using
correlational curve fitting methods may be severely biased, which in turn leads
to biased estimates of important traffic control inputs such as capacity and
capacity-drop. We emphasise that our causal approach is based on the physical
laws of vehicle movement in a traffic stream as opposed to a demand-supply
framework adopted in the economics literature. By doing so, we also aim to
conciliate the engineering and economics approaches to this empirical problem.
Our results, thus, have important implications both for traffic engineers and
transport economists.

unambiguous confirmation of their flexoelectricity is challenging due to
artifacts associated with commonly used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM).
For example, unexpectedly small phase contrast ($\sim$$8^{\circ}$) between
opposite flexoelectric polarizations was reported in twisted bilayer graphene
(tBG), though theoretically predicted value is $180^{\circ}$. Here we developed
a methodology to extract intrinsic moir\'e flexoelectricity using twisted
double bilayer graphene (tDBG) as a model system, probed by lateral PFM. For
small twist angle samples, we found that a vectorial decomposition is essential
to recover the small intrinsic flexoelectric response at domain walls from a
large background signal. The obtained three-fold symmetry of commensurate
domains with significant flexoelectric response at domain walls is fully
consistent with our theoretical calculations. Incommensurate domains in tDBG
with relatively large twist angles can also be observed by this technique. Our
work provides a general strategy for unraveling intrinsic flexoelectricity in
van der Waals moir\'e superlattices while providing insights into engineered

without any noticeable change of physical properties, as the significant

particular, MT is sensitive to macromolecules and ihMT appears to be specific
to myelinated tissue. This study proposes a technique to characterize MT and
ihMT properties from a single acquisition, producing both semiquantitative
contrast ratios, and quantitative parameter maps.
  Theory and Methods: Building upon previous work that uses multiband
radiofrequency (RF) pulses to efficiently generate ihMT contrast, we propose a
cyclic-steady-state approach that cycles between multiband and single-band
pulses to boost the achieved contrast. Resultant time-variable signals are
reminiscent of a magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) acquisition, except
that the signal fluctuations are entirely mediated by magnetization transfer
effects. A dictionary-based low-rank inversion method is used to reconstruct
the resulting images and to produce both semiquantitative MT ratio (MTR) and
ihMT ratio (ihMTR) maps, as well as quantitative parameter estimates
corresponding to an ihMT tissue model.
  Results: Phantom and in vivo brain data acquired at 1.5T demonstrate the
expected contrast trends, with ihMTR maps showing contrast more specific to
white matter (WM), as has been reported by others. Quantitative estimation of
semisolid fraction and dipolar T1 was also possible and yielded measurements
consistent with literature values in the brain.
  Conclusions: By cycling between multiband and single-band pulses, an entirely
magnetization transfer mediated 'fingerprinting' method was demonstrated. This
proof-of-concept approach can be used to generate semiquantitative maps and
quantitatively estimate some macromolecular specific tissue parameters.

raising concerns about the fairness of such decisions. Such concerns are
usually attributed to flaws in algorithmic design or biased data, but we argue
that they are often the result of a lack of explicit specification of fairness
requirements. However, such requirements are challenging to elicit, a problem
exacerbated by increasingly dynamic environments in which software systems
operate, as well as stakeholders' changing needs. Therefore, capturing all
fairness requirements during the production of software is challenging, and is
insufficient for addressing software changes post deployment. In this paper, we
propose adaptive fairness as a means for maintaining the satisfaction of
changing fairness requirements. We demonstrate how to combine
requirements-driven and resource-driven adaptation in order to address
variabilities in both fairness requirements and their associated resources.
Using models for fairness requirements, resources, and their relations, we show
how the approach can be used to provide systems owners and end-users with
capabilities that reflect adaptive fairness behaviours at runtime. We
demonstrate our approach using an example drawn from shopping experiences of
citizens. We conclude with a discussion of open research challenges in the
engineering of adaptive fairness in human-facing software systems.

to create a high strength, transparent PDMS nanocomposite. The homogenous

gas cloud and the subsequent fragmentation processes lie at the heart of star
formation research. Aims: We aim to study the dynamical and fragmentation
properties at very early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation.
Methods: Employing the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the IRAM
30m telescope, we observed two young high-mass star-forming regions, ISOSS22478
and ISOSS23053, in the 1.3mm continuum and spectral line emission at a high
angular resolution (~0.8''). Results: We resolved 29 cores that are mostly
located along filament-like structures. Depending on the temperature
assumption, these cores follow a mass-size relation of approximately M~r^2.0,
corresponding to constant mean column densities. However, with different
temperature assumptions, a steeper mass-size relation up to M~r^3.0, which
would be more likely to correspond to constant mean volume densities, cannot be
ruled out. The correlation of the core masses with their nearest neighbor
separations is consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation. We found hardly any
core separations at the spatial resolution limit, indicating that the data
resolve the large-scale fragmentation well. Although the kinematics of the two
regions appear very different at first sight - multiple velocity components
along filaments in ISOSS22478 versus a steep velocity gradient of more than
50km/s/pc in ISOSS23053 - the findings can be explained within the framework of
a dynamical cloud collapse scenario. Conclusions: While our data are consistent
with a dynamical cloud collapse scenario and subsequent thermal Jeans
fragmentation, the importance of additional environmental properties, such as
the magnetization of the gas or external shocks triggering converging gas
flows, is nonetheless not as well constrained and would require future
investigation.

global branch and a local branch. The global branch takes the whole image as
input to extract features from a global perspective, while the local branch
takes as input the zoomed-in region-of-interest (RoI) w.r.t. the specified
attribute thus able to extract more fine-grained features. As the global branch
and the local branch extract the features from different perspectives, they are
complementary to each other. Additionally, in each branch, two attention

Attention, are integrated to make ASEN be able to locate the related regions
and capture the essential patterns under the guidance of the specified

the fine-grained similarity. Extensive experiments on three fashion-related

ASEN for fine-grained fashion similarity prediction and its potential for

Despite substantial advances, the molecular-level knowledge-base required to
exploit these materials to their full potential remains limited. A deeper
comprehension of structure/property relationships in epoxy resins at the
molecular level is critical to progressing these efforts. It can be laborious,
if not impractical, to elucidate these relationships based on experiments
alone. Here, molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate and compare
thermal conductivities and mechanical properties of an exemplar epoxy resin,
Bisphenol F cross-linked with Diethyl Toluene Diamine, revealing these
inter-relationships. Both elastic modulus and thermal transport of the epoxy
resin show an increase with greater cross-linking. Specifically, decomposition
of the thermal conductivity into different force contributions suggests that
the bonded term contributes to an increase in the heat flux. These outcomes
provide a foundation for designing and fabricating customized epoxy resins with
desirable thermal and mechanical attributes.

existence of linearly stable equilibria at the two equilibrium points that form

We analyze the stability of motion in the restricted three body problem by

Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory. The KCC theory is a differential geometric
approach to the variational equations describing the deviation of the whole

its strong capability of modelling objects with abundant information using
explicit network structure. Network embedding has been proved as an effective
method to convert information networks into lower-dimensional space, whereas
the core information can be well preserved. However, traditional network
embedding algorithms are sub-optimal in capturing rich while potentially
incompatible semantics provided by HINs. To address this issue, a novel
meta-path-based HIN representation learning framework named mSHINE is designed
to simultaneously learn multiple node representations for different meta-paths.
More specifically, one representation learning module inspired by the RNN
structure is developed and multiple node representations can be learned
simultaneously, where each representation is associated with one respective
meta-path. By measuring the relevance between nodes with the designed objective
function, the learned module can be applied in downstream link prediction
tasks. A set of criteria for selecting initial meta-paths is proposed as the
other module in mSHINE which is important to reduce the optimal meta-path
selection cost when no prior knowledge of suitable meta-paths is available. To
corroborate the effectiveness of mSHINE, extensive experimental studies
including node classification and link prediction are conducted on five
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that mSHINE outperforms other
state-of-the-art HIN embedding methods.

three representative normalized clusters, confirming an inverse correlation
between reflectance and spectral slope (the darkest areas being the reddest

However, to fully exploit the resolution it is crucial to account for the

of nanometers. We show here that astigmatic imaging in combination with

showcased with simulated data for various dipole orientations, and parameter

effective constant field is replaced by a fluctuating one. Integrating the
fluctuating field out numerically exactly allows to account for collective
electronic fluctuations mediated by this field without any assumptions on their
magnitude, degree of nonlinearity, etc. Using a half-filled Hubbard ring as a
benchmark system, we find that the FLF method noticeably improves a mean-field
estimation for the free energy, in particular below the mean-field Ne\'el

Q2138-431 is a gravitational lens. From early work, the two quasar images are
known to have almost identical spectra and redshifts, but no lensing galaxy has
so far been detected. In this paper we used recent deep surveys in infrared and
optical bands to search for the presence of a galaxy with the expected
properties of a gravitational lens. The search revealed a $5 \sigma$ detection
of a faint galaxy between the two quasar images on a deep $J$-band frame from
the VISTA Science Archive, with apparent magnitude $J = 20.68$. Non-detection
in the $I$-band implied a redshift $z > 0.6$, and mass modelling of the quasar
system gave a mass of $1.31 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ for the lensing galaxy,
with mass-to-light ratio $M_{\odot}/L_{\odot} = 9.0$. Archival photographic
data from the UK 1.2m Schmidt telescope covering 25 years were used to
construct light curves for the two quasar images, which were then
cross-correlated to measure any time lag. This showed image B to lead image A
by around a year, consistent with 410 days from the mass model. Although the
similarity of the spectra and the detection of the lensing galaxy are the most
compelling arguments for the classification of Q2138-431 as a gravitational
lens, the time delay and mass-to-light ratio provide a consistent picture to
support this conclusion. The wide separation of the quasar images and the
simplicity of the mass model make Q2138-431 an excellent system for the
measurement of the Hubble constant.

Chandra and XMM-Newton archival data indicate a very luminous ($L$ (2--10 keV)
= ($2.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) unobscured AGN with a power-law
photon index of $\Gamma$ = 1.73$_{-0.15}^{+0.16}$, and an absorption hydrogen
column density of $\log\,(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) < 21.0$. The IR luminosity
was estimated to be $L_{\rm IR}$ = (1.79 $\pm$ 0.09) $\times 10^{14}\,
L_{\odot}$ from spectral energy distribution modeling based on 22 photometric
data (X-ray to far-IR) with X-CIGALE, which confirmed that WISEJ0909+0002 is an
ELIRG. A remarkably high $L_{\rm IR}$ despite very low $N_{\rm H}$ would
indicate that we are witnessing a short-lived phase in which hydrogen gas along
the line of sight is blown outwards, whereas warm and hot dust heated by AGNs
still exist. As a consequence of eROSITA all-sky survey,
$6.8_{-5.6}^{+16}\times 10^2$ such X-ray bright ELIRGs are expected to be
discovered in the entire extragalactic sky ($|b| > 10^\circ$). This can

communication, such as circuit breaking. Circuit breaking actuation is
currently limited to an ""on/off"" switch, i.e., a tripped circuit breaker will
return an application-level error indicating service unavailability to the
calling micro-service. This paper proposes a soft circuit breaker actuator,
which returns cached data instead of an error. The overall resilience of a
cloud application is improved if constituent micro-services return stale data,
instead of no data at all. While caching is widely employed for serving web
service traffic, its usage in inter-micro-service communication is lacking.
Micro-services responses are highly dynamic, which requires carefully choosing
adaptive time-to-life caching algorithms. We evaluate our approach through two
experiments. First, we quantify the trade-off between traffic reduction and
data staleness using a purpose-build service, thereby identifying algorithm
configurations that keep data staleness at about 3% or less while reducing
network load by up to 30%. Second, we quantify the network load reduction with
the micro-service benchmark by Google Cloud called Hipster Shop. Our approach
results in caching of about 80% of requests. Results show the feasibility and
efficiency of our approach, which encourages implementing caching as a circuit
breaking actuator in service meshes.

design space exploration through a two-step approach encapsulated in a

In the first step, we use a genetic algorithm to search for system
architectures that allow discrete choices for component values or else only
component values for a fixed architecture. This step yields a coarse design
since the system may or may not meet the target specifications. In the second
step, we use an inverse design to search over a continuous space and fine-tune
the component values with the goal of improving the value of the objective
function. We use a neural network to model the system response. The neural
network is converted into a mixed-integer linear program for active learning to
sample component values efficiently. We illustrate the efficacy of ASSENT on
problems ranging from nonlinear system design to design of electrical circuits.
Experimental results show that ASSENT achieves the same or better value of the

stringent certification process. As machine learning is becoming more popular,
machine-learned components are now considered for inclusion in critical

established formal methods are limited to classic, i.e. non machine-learned

decades, both as a means of angular momentum transport and also because of its
role in controlling discs' vertical structure via heat transport. If the gas is
sufficiently ionized and threaded by a weak magnetic field, convection might
interact in non-trivial ways with the magnetorotational instability (MRI).
Recently, vertically stratified local simulations of the MRI have reported
considerable variation in the angular momentum transport, as measured by the
stress to thermal pressure ratio $\alpha$, when convection is thought to be
present. Although MRI turbulence can act as a heat source for convection, it is
not clear how the instabilities will interact dynamically. Here we aim to
investigate the interplay between the two instabilities in controlled numerical
experiments, and thus isolate the generic features of their interaction. We
perform vertically stratified, 3D MHD shearing box simulations with a perfect
gas equation of state with the conservative, finite-volume code PLUTO. We find
two characteristic outcomes of the interaction between the two instabilities:
straight MRI and MRI/convective cycles, with the latter exhibiting alternating
phases of convection-dominated flow (during which the turbulent transport is
weak) and MRI-dominated flow. During the latter phase we find that $\alpha$ is
enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude, reaching peak values of $\sim 0.08$.
In addition, we find that convection in the non-linear phase takes the form of
large-scale and oscillatory convective cells. Convection can also help the MRI
persist to lower Rm than it would otherwise do. Finally we discuss how our
results help interpret simulations of Dwarf Novae.

insensitive to the overall calibration of both the CC and SNe~Ia data (being
sensitive only to relative distances and expansion rates). Applying this method

alleviate the need for large labeled datasets in semantic segmentation. Most
current approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs), which can be generated
from image-level annotations. Nevertheless, resulting maps have been
demonstrated to be highly discriminant, failing to serve as optimal proxy
pixel-level labels. We present a novel learning strategy that leverages
self-supervision in a multi-modal image scenario to significantly enhance
original CAMs. In particular, the proposed method is based on two observations.
First, the learning of fully-supervised segmentation networks implicitly
imposes equivariance by means of data augmentation, whereas this implicit
constraint disappears on CAMs generated with image tags. And second, the
commonalities between image modalities can be employed as an efficient
self-supervisory signal, correcting the inconsistency shown by CAMs obtained
across multiple modalities. To effectively train our model, we integrate a
novel loss function that includes a within-modality and a cross-modality
equivariant term to explicitly impose these constraints during training. In
addition, we add a KL-divergence on the class prediction distributions to
facilitate the information exchange between modalities, which, combined with
the equivariant regularizers further improves the performance of our model.
Exhaustive experiments on the popular multi-modal BRATS dataset demonstrate
that our approach outperforms relevant recent literature under the same

Comparisons of the observations with evolutionary models indicate that NGVS
3543 has undergone a ram-pressure stripping (RPS) that peaked $\sim$100 Myr
ago, transforming a blue gas-rich UDG into a red gas-poor UDG. Star formation
has taken place in the ram pressure stripped gas, the mass of which is
$\sim$10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$, forming star complexes with a typical age of $\sim$20
Myr and a stellar mass of $\sim$10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$. These results suggest that
we are observing for the first time the ongoing transformation of a gas-rich
UDG into a red and quiescent UDG under the effect of a ram pressure stripping

Compared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics

Proof-of-concept experiments and test results of the undulator prototype in
step-by-step motion mode indicated excellent accuracy and stability properties
of the driver. In this note we present test results of hydraulic-assist driver

provide smooth continuous undulator gap change, keeping the undulator harmonic

energy errors at 1.8e-4 level (or less). That satisfies any application planned

physical applications of a mixed quasi-Einstein spacetime$[M(QE)_{4}]$, which
is a special type of nearly quasi-Einstein spacetime$[N(QE)_{4}]$. Firstly we
consider a nearly quasi-Einstein manifold$[N(QE)_{n}]$ along with a mixed
quasi-Einstein manifold$[M(QE)_{n}]$ and study some geometric conditions with
respect to different curvature tensors on them. Then we consider a mixed
quasi-Einstein spacetime and study $W_{2}$-Ricci pseudosymmetry and projective
Ricci pseudosymmetry on it. Then we study the conditions $H \cdot S=0$ and
$\tilde C \cdot S=0$ in an $M(QE)_{4}$ spacetime, where $H, \tilde C$ are the
conharmonical curvature tensor and semiconformal curvature tensor respectively.
Next we consider a semiconformally flat Ricci pseudosymmetric $M(QE)_{4}$
spacetime and find the nature of that spacetime. In the next section we study
about some applications of a perfect fluid $M(QE)_{4}$ spacetime in the general
theory of relativity. Followed by we discuss about the Ricci soliton structure
in a semiconformally flat $M(QE)_{4}$ spacetime satisfying Einstein field
equation without cosmological constant. Finally we give a nontrivial example of
a $M(QE)_{4}$ spacetime to establish the existence of it.

triangulene dimer with $S=0$ on account of intermolecular exchange. We focus on
the consequences of hybridization of the nanographene zero-modes with a
conducting substrate on the $dI/dV$ lineshapes associated with spin
excitations. The partially filled nanographene zero-modes coupled to the
conduction electrons in the substrate constitute multi-orbital Anderson
impurity models that we solve in the one-crossing approximation which treats
the coupling to the substrate to infinite order. We find that the coupling to
the substrate leads to (i) renormalization of the spin flip excitation energies
of the bare molecule, (ii) broadening of the spectral features and (iii) the
emergence of zero bias Kondo peaks for the $S=1$ ground states. The calculated
substrate induced shift of the spin excitation energies is found to be
significantly larger than their broadening, which implies that this effect has
to be considered when comparing experimental results and theory.

three-dimensional calculations of inhomogeneous nuclear matter and neutron-star
matter in the low-density region using the Thomas-Fermi approximation. The
nuclear interaction is described in the relativistic mean-field approach with
the point-coupling interaction, where the meson exchange in each channel is
replaced by the contact interaction between nucleons. We investigate the
influence of nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence on pasta
structures by introducing a coupling term between the isoscalar-vector and
isovector-vector interactions. It is found that the properties of pasta phases
in the neutron-rich matter are strongly dependent on the symmetry energy and
its slope. In addition to typical shapes like droplets, rods, slabs, tubes, and
bubbles, some intermediate pasta structures are also observed in cold stellar
matter with a relatively large proton fraction. We find that nonspherical
shapes are unlikely to be formed in neutron-star crusts, since the proton
fraction obtained in $\beta$ equilibrium is rather small. The inner crust
properties may lead to a visible difference in the neutron-star radius.

substantially when tested with partially-spoofed data, whereas training on

robust to disperse keypoints. Experiments demonstrate RCVPose to be highly

Cavalieri (J. Fluid Mech. 907, A32, 2021), and is here studied using a
reduced-order model based on a Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes system.
By considering a confined shear layer with free-slip boundary conditions on the
walls, periodic boundary conditions in streamwise and spanwise directions may
be used, simplifying the system and enabling the use of methods of dynamical
systems theory. A basis of eight modes is used in the Galerkin projection,
representing the mean flow, Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, rolls, streaks and
oblique waves, structures observed in the cited work, and also present in shear
layers and jets. A dynamical system is obtained, and its transition to chaos is
studied. Increasing Reynolds number $Re$ leads to pitchfork and Hopf
bifurcations, and the latter leads to a limit cycle with amplitude modulation
of vortices, as in the DNS by Nogueira \& Cavalieri. Further increase of $Re$
leads to the appearance of a chaotic saddle, followed by the emergence of
quasi-periodic and chaotic attractors. The chaotic attractors suffer a merging
crisis for higher $Re$, leading to chaotic dynamics with amplitude modulation
and phase jumps of vortices. This is reminiscent of observations of coherent
structures in turbulent jets, suggesting that the model represents dynamics
consistent with features of shear layers and jets.

use the Dynamic Vision Sensor 3D Human Pose Dataset (DHP19) to validate a
brain-inspired event-based stereo-matching architecture implemented on a
mixed-signal neuromorphic processor with real-world data. Our experiments show
that this SNN architecture, composed of coincidence detectors and disparity
sensitive neurons, is able to provide a coarse estimate of the input disparity
instantaneously, thereby detecting the presence of a stimulus moving in depth
in real-time.

The corpus aims at providing a resource for the development of ASR-based

exploited to develop a voice-controlled contact application for commercial
smartphones, aiming at improving dysarthric patients' ability to communicate
with their family and caregivers. Before recording the dataset, participants
were administered a survey to evaluate which commands are more likely to be
employed by dysarthric individuals in a voice-controlled contact application.
In addition, the dataset includes a list of non-commands (i.e., words
near/inside commands or phonetically close to commands) that can be leveraged
to build a more robust command recognition system. At present commercial ASR
systems perform poorly on the EasyCall Corpus as we report in this paper. This
result corroborates the need for dysarthric speech corpora for developing

activities and such social roles of retail centers contribute to the popularity
of the retail centers. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to
identify effective factors encouraging customers to engage with interactional
activities and measure how these factors affect customer behavior. Accordingly,
two hypotheses were raised illustrating that the travel time (i.e., the time it
takes for a customer to reach the retail center) and the variety of shops (in a
retail center) increase the percentage of people who spend their leisure time
and recreational activities retail centers. Two case studies were conducted in
two analogous retail centers, one in Tehran, Iran, and the other in Madrid,
Spain. According to the results, there is an interaction between the travel
time and the motivation for the presence of people in the retail center.
Furthermore, the results revealed that half of both retail center goers who
spend more than 10 minutes to reach the retail centers prefer to do leisure
activities and browsing than shopping. In other words, the longer it takes a
person to get to the center, the more likely he/she is to spend more time in
the mall and do more leisure activities. It is also found that there is a
significant relationship between the variety of shops in a retail center and
the motivation of customers attending a retail center that encourages people to
spend their leisure time in retail centers.

physical quantity in a globally hyperbolic spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. The role of
the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\mathcal{T}$,
whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled
by probability measures $\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices
$\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be
expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation
$\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability
measure $\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves
endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field
$X$ of $L^2_{\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \mapsto \mu_t$
satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of
the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the
differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to a topology induced
from a suitable $H^1_{\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to
construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\sigma$. In addition,

shells made of a common silicone elastomer. Unlike in quasi-static experiments,
shells buckled at ostensibly subcritical pressures (i.e. below the
experimentally-determined load at which buckling occurs elastically), often
following a significant time delay. While emphasizing the close connections to
elastic shell buckling, we rely on viscoelasticity to explain our observations.
In particular, we demonstrate that the lower critical load may be determined
from the material properties, which is rationalized by a simple analogy to
elastic spherical shell buckling. We then introduce a model centered on
empirical quantities to show that viscoelastic creep deformation lowers the
critical load in the same predictable, quantifiable way that a growing defect
would in an elastic shell. This allows us to capture how both the critical
deflection and the delay time depend on the applied pressure, material
properties, and defect geometry. These quantities are straightforward to
measure in experiments. Thus, our work not only provides intuition for
viscoelastic behavior from an elastic shell buckling perspective, but also
offers an accessible pathway to introduce tunable, time-controlled actuation to
existing mechanical actuators, e.g. pneumatic grippers.

direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using sensor arrays. This joint
estimation problem is referred to as self calibration. Unlike many previous
iterative approaches, we propose geometry independent convex optimization
algorithms for jointly estimating the sensor gain and phase errors as well as
the source DOAs. We derive these algorithms based on both the conventional
element-space data model and the covariance data model. We focus on sparse and
regular arrays formed using scalar sensors as well as vector sensors. The
developed algorithms are obtained by transforming the underlying bilinear
calibration model into a linear model, and subsequently by using standard
convex relaxation techniques to estimate the unknown parameters. Prior to the
algorithm discussion, we also derive identifiability conditions for the
existence of a unique solution to the self calibration problem. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of the developed techniques, numerical experiments and
comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods are provided. Finally, the results
from an experiment that was performed in an anechoic chamber using an acoustic
vector sensor array are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
self calibration techniques.

Formulas (QBF) operating on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs). These

as such admit short proofs of formulas of bounded path-width and quantifier
complexity. As a consequence, we obtain exponential separations from standard

  We further develop a lower bound technique for symbolic QBF proof systems
based on strategy extraction that lifts known lower bounds from communication

proof systems that are independent of the variable ordering of the underlying
OBDDs, and that hold even if the proof system is allowed access to an

at 700-m underground. An excellent energy resolution and a large fiducial
volume offer exciting opportunities for addressing many important topics in
neutrino and astro-particle physics. With 6 years of data, the neutrino mass
ordering can be determined at 3-4 sigma and three oscillation parameters can be
measured to a precision of 0.6% or better by detecting reactor antineutrinos.
With 10 years of data, DSNB could be observed at 3-sigma; a lower limit of the
proton lifetime of 8.34e33 years (90% C.L.) can be set by searching for
p->nu_bar K^+; detection of solar neutrinos would shed new light on the solar
metallicity problem and examine the vacuum-matter transition region. A
core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000 IBD and ~2000 (300)
all-flavor neutrino-proton (electron) scattering events. Geo-neutrinos can be
detected with a rate of ~400 events/year. We also summarize the final design of
the JUNO detector and the key R&D achievements. All 20-inch PMTs have been
tested. The average photon detection efficiency is 28.9% for the 15,000 MCP
PMTs and 28.1% for the 5,000 dynode PMTs, higher than the JUNO requirement of
27%. Together with the >20 m attenuation length of LS, we expect a yield of
1345 p.e. per MeV and an effective energy resolution of 3.02%/\sqrt{E (MeV)}$
in simulations. The underwater electronics is designed to have a loss rate
<0.5% in 6 years. With degassing membranes and a micro-bubble system, the radon
concentration in the 35-kton water pool could be lowered to <10 mBq/m^3.
Acrylic panels of radiopurity <0.5 ppt U/Th are produced. The 20-kton LS will
be purified onsite. Singles in the fiducial volume can be controlled to ~10 Hz.
The JUNO experiment also features a double calorimeter system with 25,600
3-inch PMTs, a LS testing facility OSIRIS, and a near detector TAO.

circle $ \mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ into $N$ intervals and show that
the proportion of intervals containing exactly $j$ points of the sequence
$(\sqrt{n} + \mathbb{Z})_{n=1}^N$ converges in the limit as $N \to \infty$.
  More generally, we investigate how the limiting distribution of the first
$sN$ points of the sequence varies with the parameter $s \geq 0$. A natural way
to examine this is via point processes - random measures on $[0,\infty)$ which
represent the arrival times of the points of our sequence to a random interval
from our partition. We show that the sequence of point processes we obtain
converges in distribution and give an explicit description of the limiting
process in terms of random affine unimodular lattices.
  Our work uses ergodic theory in the space of affine unimodular lattices,
building upon work of Elkies and McMullen. We prove a generalisation of

surface, working instead on non-linear horocycle sections.

pooling along the time axis. In this paper we examine an alternative pooling
method, where pairwise correlations between channels for given frequencies are
used as statistics. The method is inspired by style-transfer methods in
computer vision, where the style of an image, modeled by the matrix of
channel-wise correlations, is transferred to another image, in order to produce
a new image having the style of the first and the content of the second. By
drawing analogies between image style and speaker characteristics, and between
image content and phonetic sequence, we explore the use of such channel-wise
correlations features to train a ResNet architecture in an end-to-end fashion.
Our experiments on VoxCeleb demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
pooling method in speaker recognition.

Model which are drastically different from the ones calculated within the
KSVZ/DFSZ-type models, so that large part of the corresponding parameter space
can be probed by various projected experiments. Moreover, the axion we
introduce is consistent with the astrophysical hints suggested both by
anomalous TeV-transparency of the Universe and by excessive cooling of

can be used to provide continuous positioning information for the vehicle,

However, the displacement estimation from the wheel speed measurements are
characterised by uncertainties, which could be manifested as wheel slips or/and
changes to the tyre size or pressure, from wet and muddy road drives or tyres
wearing out. As such, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to propose
the Wheel Odometry neural Network (WhONet) to learn the uncertainties in the
wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning. The
performance of the proposed WhONet is first evaluated on several challenging
driving scenarios, such as on roundabouts, sharp cornering, hard-brake and wet
roads (drifts). WhONet's performance is then further and extensively evaluated
on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios of 30s, 60s, 120s and 180s duration,
respectively over a total distance of 493 km. The experimental results obtained
show that the proposed method is able to accurately position the vehicle with
up to 93% reduction in the positioning error of its original counterpart after
any 180s of travel. WhONet's implementation can be found at

can apply multiplexing technology in different degrees of freedom to enhance

networks are known to generate consistent physiological outcomes across vastly
different organisms. This remarkable robustness suggests that, at least in
bacteria, metabolic activity may be guided by universal principles. The
constrained optimization of evolutionarily-motivated objective functions like
the growth rate has emerged as the key theoretical assumption for the study of
bacterial metabolism. While conceptually and practically useful in many
situations, the idea that certain functions are optimized is hard to validate
in data. Moreover, it is not always clear how optimality can be reconciled with
the high degree of single-cell variability observed in experiments within
microbial populations. To shed light on these issues, we develop an inverse
modeling framework that connects the fitness of a population of cells
(represented by the mean single-cell growth rate) to the underlying metabolic
variability through the Maximum-Entropy inference of the distribution of
metabolic phenotypes from data. While no clear objective function emerges, we
find that, as the medium gets richer, the fitness and inferred variability for
Escherichia coli populations follow and slowly approach the theoretically
optimal bound defined by minimal reduction of variability at given fitness.
These results suggest that bacterial metabolism may be crucially shaped by a
population-level trade-off between growth and heterogeneity.

correlated with column density N as B_pos~N^p, where p=1.05+-0.08, and with
density n as B_pos~n^q, where q=0.66+-0.05. These magnetic properties are
consistent with those derived from Zeeman studies (Crutcher et al. 2010), with
less scatter. Relations between virial mass M_V, magnetic critical mass M_B,
and Alfven amplitude sigma_B/B match the observed range of M/M_B for cores
observed to be nearly virial, with M/M_V=0.5-2, with moderate Alfven
amplitudes, and with sigma_B/B=0.1-0.4. The B-N and B-n correlations in the DCF

nearly-critical cores have central concentration and spheroidal shape. For
these properties, B~N because M/M_B is nearly constant compared to the range of
N, and B~n^(2/3) because M^(1/3) is nearly constant compared to the range of
n^(2/3). The observed core fields which follow B~n^(2/3) need not be much
weaker than gravity, in contrast to core fields which follow B~n^(2/3) due to
spherical contraction at constant mass (Mestel 1966). Instead, the nearly

strong as possible, among values which allow gravitational contraction.

inserts logic to deobfuscate these string literals at runtime. In this work, we
demonstrate that string obfuscation is easily reversible. We present ASTANA, a
practical tool for Android applications to recovers the human-readable content

deobfuscation logic for a specific (obfuscated) string literal, which yields
the original string value. To obtain the relevant deobfuscation logic, we
present a lightweight and optimistic algorithm, based on program slicing

oxygen-neon cores following carbon burning. Electron captures in such cores can
trigger runaway oxygen burning, resulting in either a collapse or a
thermonuclear explosion. We provide a detailed description of the formalism
used in previous work and apply it to two further forbidden transitions that
are relevant to degenerate oxygen-neon cores: the
$4^+_\text{g.s.}\rightarrow{}2^+_1$ transition in
$^{24}\text{Na}(e^-,\nu_e)^{24}\text{Ne}$ and the ${5/2^+_{\text{g.s.}}

$^{27}\text{Al}(e^-,\nu_e)^{27}\text{Mg}$. The relevant nuclear matrix elements
are determined through shell model calculations and constraints from CVC

temperature range, the forbidden transitions substantially reduce the threshold
densities for $^{24}\text{Na}(e^-,\nu_e)^{24}\text{Ne}$ and
$^{27}\text{Al}(e^-,\nu_e)^{27}\text{Mg}$. In the MESA models,

convective instabilities triggered by the $A=24$ electron captures. The
transition between $^{27}\text{Al}$ and $^{27}\text{Mg}$ may have a minor
effect on the early evolution but is unlikely to affect the outcome. The

rotations linked with gamma-ray activity have been the subject of intense
interest and systematic investigation for over a decade. One difficulty in the
interpretation of EVPA rotations is the inherent 180{\deg} ambiguity in the
measurements. It is therefore essential, when studying EVPA rotations, to
ensure that the typical time-interval between successive observations -- i.e.
the cadence -- is short enough to ensure that the correct modulo 180{\deg}
value is selected. This optimal cadence depends on the maximum intrinsic EVPA
rotation speed in blazars, which is currently not known. In this paper we
address the following questions for the RoboPol sample: What range of rotation
speeds for rotations greater than 90{\deg} can we expect? What observation
cadence is required to detect such rotations? Have rapid rotations been missed
in EVPA rotation studies thus far? What fraction of data is affected by the
ambiguity? And how likely are detected rotations affected by the ambiguity? We
answer these questions with three seasons of optical polarimetric observations
of a statistical sample of blazars sampled weekly with the RoboPol instrument
and an additional season with daily observations. We model the distribution of
EVPA changes on time scales from 1-30 days and estimate the fraction of changes
exceeding 90{\deg}. We show that at least daily observations are necessary to
measure >96% of optical EVPA variability in the RoboPol sample of blazars
correctly and that intra-day observations are needed to measure the fastest
rotations that have been seen thus far.

are complex and not yet fully understood. In the present work, high-fidelity
numerical simulations are employed to describe the effects of welding position,
sulphur concentration (60-300 ppm) and travel speed (1.25-5 mm/s) on molten
metal flow dynamics in fully-penetrated melt-pools. A wavelet transform is
implemented to obtain time-resolved frequency spectra of the oscillation
signals, which overcomes the shortcomings of the Fourier transform in rendering
time resolution of the frequency spectra. Comparing the results of the present
numerical calculations with available analytical and experimental datasets, the
robustness of the proposed approach in predicting melt-pool oscillations is
demonstrated. The results reveal that changes in the surface morphology of the
pool resulting from a change in welding position alter the spatial distribution
of arc forces and power-density applied to the molten material, and in turn
affect flow patterns in the pool. Under similar welding conditions, changing
the sulphur concentration affects the Marangoni flow pattern, and increasing
the travel speed decreases the size of the pool and increases the offset
between top and bottom melt-pool surfaces, affecting the flow structures
(vortex formation) on the surface. Variations in the internal flow pattern
affect the evolution of melt-pool shape and its surface oscillations.

limitations. First, convolutional features are neither aligned with anchor
boxes nor with ground-truth bounding boxes, reducing the mask sensitivity to
spatial location. Second, a video is directly divided into individual frames
for frame-level instance segmentation, ignoring the temporal correlation
between adjacent frames. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet
effective one-stage video instance segmentation framework by spatial
calibration and temporal fusion, namely STMask. To ensure spatial feature
calibration with ground-truth bounding boxes, we first predict regressed
bounding boxes around ground-truth bounding boxes, and extract features from
them for frame-level instance segmentation. To further explore temporal
correlation among video frames, we aggregate a temporal fusion module to infer
instance masks from each frame to its adjacent frames, which helps our
framework to handle challenging videos such as motion blur, partial occlusion
and unusual object-to-camera poses. Experiments on the YouTube-VIS valid set
show that the proposed STMask with ResNet-50/-101 backbone obtains 33.5 % /
36.8 % mask AP, while achieving 28.6 / 23.4 FPS on video instance segmentation.

Stability analysis of the method is performed for both scalar equations and
