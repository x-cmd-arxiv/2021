the Dirichlet theorem. The geometric properties arising from this theory are
analyzed and some applications are presented, including Goldbach's conjecture,
the existence of infinite primes of the form $\rho = k^2+1$ and the convergence
of the sum of the inverses of the Mersenne's primes. Although the mathematics
that was used was elementary, you can notice the usefulness of this theory
based on geometric properties. In this paper, the study ends by introducing the

disaster events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated big data

and sharing multi-source multi-scale human mobility flows. Within the platform,
an origin-destination-time (ODT) data model is proposed to work with scalable
query engines to handle heterogenous mobility data in large volumes with
extensive spatial coverage, which allows for efficient extraction, query, and
aggregation of billion-level origin-destination (OD) flows in parallel at the
server-side. An interactive spatial web portal, ODT Flow Explorer, is developed
to allow users to explore multi-source mobility datasets with user-defined
spatiotemporal scales. To promote reproducibility and replicability, we further
develop ODT Flow REST APIs that provide researchers with the flexibility to
access the data programmatically via workflows, codes, and programs.
Demonstrations are provided to illustrate the potential of the APIs integrating
with scientific workflows and with the Jupyter Notebook environment. We believe
the platform coupled with the derived multi-scale mobility data can assist
human mobility monitoring and analysis during disaster events such as the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and benefit both scientific communities and the
general public in understanding human mobility dynamics.

usually take as the reward the non-parametric distance to a given goal in an
explicit embedding space. From a different viewpoint, we propose a novel
unsupervised learning approach named goal-conditioned policy with intrinsic
motivation (GPIM), which jointly learns both an abstract-level policy and a
goal-conditioned policy. The abstract-level policy is conditioned on a latent
variable to optimize a discriminator and discovers diverse states that are
further rendered into perceptually-specific goals for the goal-conditioned
policy. The learned discriminator serves as an intrinsic reward function for
the goal-conditioned policy to imitate the trajectory induced by the
abstract-level policy. Experiments on various robotic tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GPIM method which substantially
outperforms prior techniques.

Neural Network (FNN), a tensor-based nonlinear learning model that imposes

advantages compared to typical machine learning methods. First, it handles

establish the universal approximation and learnability properties of Rank-R

that preserve the output label but lead to a prediction error. While such
attacks have been extensively explored for the purpose of evaluating model
robustness, their utility for improving robustness has been limited to offline
augmentation only. Concretely, given a trained model, attacks are used to
generate perturbed (adversarial) examples, and the model is re-trained exactly
once. In this work, we address this gap and leverage discrete attacks for
online augmentation, where adversarial examples are generated at every training
step, adapting to the changing nature of the model. We propose (i) a new
discrete attack, based on best-first search, and (ii) random sampling attacks
that unlike prior work are not based on expensive search-based procedures.
Surprisingly, we find that random sampling leads to impressive gains in
robustness, outperforming the commonly-used offline augmentation, while leading
to a speedup at training time of ~10x. Furthermore, online augmentation with
search-based attacks justifies the higher training cost, significantly
improving robustness on three datasets. Last, we show that our new attack
substantially improves robustness compared to prior methods.

has been widely observed that pre-trained embeddings should be fine-tuned to a

an unsupervised task such as topic modeling. Thus, we propose several methods
for fine-tuning encoders to improve both monolingual and zero-shot polylingual

a new topic classification task, integrating the topic classification objective
directly into topic model training, and continued pre-training. We find that
fine-tuning encoder representations on topic classification and integrating the

the 90s. Recently, the densification and the sparsification of CSPs were
formulated as computational tasks and the systematical study of their
computational complexity was initiated.
  We approach this problem by introducing the densification operator, i.e. the
closure operator that, given an instance of a CSP, outputs all constraints that
are satisfied by all of its solutions. According to the Galois theory of
closure operators, any such operator is related to a certain implicational
system (or, a functional dependency) $\Sigma$. We are specifically interested
in those classes of fixed-template CSPs, parameterized by constraint languages
$\Gamma$, for which there is an implicational system $\Sigma$ whose size is a
polynomial in the number of variables $n$. We show that in the Boolean case,
such implicational systems exist if and only if $\Gamma$ is of bounded width.
For such languages, $\Sigma$ can be computed in log-space or in a logarithmic
time with a polynomial number of processors. Given an implicational system
$\Sigma$, the densification task is equivalent to the computation of the
closure of input constraints. The sparsification task is equivalent to the
computation of the minimal key.

in a $d$-dimensional spherical hard box of radius $R$ at temperature $T=0$. In
the large $N$ limit, the local density approximation (LDA) predicts that
$W_N({\bf x}, {\bf p}) \approx 1/(2 \pi \hbar)^d$ inside a finite region of the

that are willing to opt-in in the early stage of connected-vehicle deployment.
In this paper, we propose a ""whitelisting"" approach to V2X security, titled
Proof-of-Travel (POT), which leverages the support of roadside infrastructure.
Our goal is to transform the power of cryptography techniques embedded within
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) protocols into game-theoretic mechanisms to
incentivize connected-vehicle data sharing and validate data trustworthiness
simultaneously.
  The key idea is to determine the reputation of and the contribution made by a
vehicle based on its distance traveled and the information it shared through
V2I channels. In particular, the total vehicle miles traveled for a vehicle
must be testified by digital signatures signed by each infrastructure component
along the path of its movement. While building a chain of proofs of spatial
movement creates burdens for malicious vehicles, acquiring proofs does not
result in extra costs for normal vehicles, which naturally want to move from
the origin to the destination. The POT protocol is used to enhance the security
of previous voting-based data validation algorithms for V2I crowdsensing
applications. For the POT-enhanced voting, we prove that all vehicles choosing
to cheat are not a pure Nash equilibrium using game-theoretic analysis.
Simulation results suggest that the POT-enhanced voting is more robust to
malicious data.

combinations of 48 observed features (namely ionised lines, Lick indices,
photometric and morphological properties). Subsequently a K-means cluster
analysis is carried out on the basis of the 14 best chosen Independent
Components to obtain 12 distinct homogeneous groups of spiral galaxies. Amongst
these, 3 groups are the oldest ones (1.6 Gyr - 5.9 Gyr), while 5 groups fall in
the medium aged category (1.4 Gyr - 1.6 Gyr), 2 groups consist of only unbarred
spirals, 1 group is the youngest one and the remaining one is an outlier. In
many groups there are clear indication of recurrent bar formation phenomena
which is consistent with few previous simulation works. In order to study the
robustness a second method of clustering by Gaussian Mixture Modeling Method
(GMMBC) is applied.

The numerical examples utilize the recently introduced NN equalizer consisting
of a convolutional layer coupled with bi-directional long-short term memory

communication systems and draw the limits for the transfer learning efficiency.
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning for the fast
adaptation of NN architectures to different transmission regimes and scenarios,

censoring, where values are recorded only if they fall within a certain range.
Censoring is ubiquitous in practice, due to saturating sensors,
limit-of-detection effects, and image-frame effects. In light of recent
developments on learning linear dynamical systems (LDSs), and on censored
statistics with independent data, we revisit the decades-old problem of
learning an LDS, from censored observations (Lee and Maddala (1985); Zeger and
Brookmeyer (1986)). Here, the learner observes the state $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$
if and only if $x_t$ belongs to some set $S_t \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. We
develop the first computationally and statistically efficient algorithm for
learning the system, assuming only oracle access to the sets $S_t$. Our
algorithm, Stochastic Online Newton with Switching Gradients, is a novel
second-order method that builds on the Online Newton Step (ONS) of Hazan et al.
(2007). Our Switching-Gradient scheme does not always use (stochastic)
gradients of the function we want to optimize, which we call ""censor-aware""
function. Instead, in each iteration, it performs a simple test to decide
whether to use the censor-aware, or another ""censor-oblivious"" function, for
getting a stochastic gradient.
  In our analysis, we consider a ""generic"" Online Newton method, which uses
arbitrary vectors instead of gradients, and we prove an error-bound for it.
This can be used to appropriately design these vectors, leading to our
Switching-Gradient scheme. This framework significantly deviates from the
recent long line of works on censored statistics (e.g., Daskalakis et al.
(2018); Kontonis et al. (2019); Daskalakis et al. (2019)), which apply
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and their analysis reduces to establishing
conditions for off-the-shelf SGD-bounds.

validity of this inference relies on our understanding of the scattering
reaction, most importantly how rescattering of the detected nucleons (final
state interactions or FSI) distort their kinematical distributions. Recent SRC
measurements on medium to heavy nuclei have been performed at high-$x_B$ (i.e.,
anti-parallel kinematics) where calculations of light nuclei indicate that such
distortion effects are small. Here we study the impact of FSI on recent
$^{12}$C$(e,e'p)$ and $^{12}$C$(e,e'pp)$ measurements using a transport
approach. We find that while FSI can significantly distort the measured
kinematical distributions of SRC breakup events, selecting high-$x_B$
anti-parallel events strongly suppresses such distortions. In addition,
including the effects of FSI improves the agreement between Generalized Contact
Formalism-based calculations and data and can help identify those observables
that have minimal sensitivity to FSI effects. This result helps confirm the
interpretation of experimental data in terms of initial-state momentum
distributions and provides a new tool for the study of SRCs using

hashing-style solution where we given the ID of a ball can find its bin
efficiently.
  We are given a balancing parameter $c=1+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon\in (0,1)$.
With $n$ and $m$ the current numbers of balls and bins, we want no bin with
load above $C=\lceil c n/m\rceil$, referred to as the capacity of the bins.
  We present a scheme where we can locate a ball checking $1+O(\log

to move $O(1/\epsilon)$ balls, and when inserting or deleting a bin, we expect
to move $O(C/\epsilon)$ balls. Previous bounds were off by a factor
$1/\epsilon$.
  These bounds are best possible when $C=O(1)$ but for larger $C$, we can do
much better: Let $f=\epsilon C$ if $C\leq \log 1/\epsilon$,
$f=\epsilon\sqrt{C}\cdot \sqrt{\log(1/(\epsilon\sqrt{C}))}$ if $\log
1/\epsilon\leq C<\tfrac{1}{2\epsilon^2}$, and $C=1$ if $C\geq

bin.
  For the bounds with larger $C$, we first have to resolve a much simpler
probabilistic problem. Place $n$ balls in $m$ bins of capacity $C$, one ball at
the time. Each ball picks a uniformly random non-full bin. We show that in
expectation and with high probability, the fraction of non-full bins is
$\Theta(f)$. Then the expected number of bins that a new ball would have to
visit to find one that is not full is $\Theta(1/f)$. As it turns out, we obtain
the same complexity in our more complicated scheme where both balls and bins

changes in dynamics of finitely dimensional open quantum systems governed by

considering how the averages of system observables change with time and
quantifies how non-stationary the system is during a given time regime. By
drawing an analogy with the exponential decay, we are able to further
investigate regimes when such changes are negligible according to the
logarithmic scale of time, and thus the system is approximately stationary.
While this is always the case within the initial and final regimes of the
dynamics, with the system respectively approximated by its initial and
asymptotic states, we show that a distinct regime of approximate stationarity
may arise. In turn, we establish a quantitative description of the phenomenon
of metastability in open quantum systems. The initial relaxation occurring
before the corresponding metastable regime and of the long-time dynamics taking
place afterwards are also characterised. Furthermore, we explain how
metastability relates to the separation in the real part of the master equation
spectrum and connect our approach to the spectral theory of metastability,
clarifying when the latter follows. All of our general results directly
translate to Markovian dynamics of classical stochastic systems.

equations whose coefficients are defined in terms of singular integral kernels
such as the Biot-Savart kernel. These SDEs which involve the distributions of
solutions are in general not Lipschitz continuous with respect to the usual
distances on the space of distributions such as the Wasserstein distance.
Therefore there is an obstacle in adapting the ordinary SDE method for the
study of this class of SDEs, and the conventional methods seem not appropriate
for dealing with such distributional SDEs which appear in applications such as
fluid mechanics.

challenging to obtain in solid-state systems, ultimately limited by loss. We
present a novel approach to achieve tunable sub-MHz spectral features, at room
temperature, without resonators. We exploit gain-enhanced polarization pulling
in a twisted birefringent medium where polarization eigenmodes are
frequency-dependent. Using Brillouin gain in a commercial spun fiber, we
experimentally achieve a 0.72 MHz spectral dip, the narrowest backward
Brillouin scattering feature ever reported. Further optimization can
potentially reduce the linewidth to <0.1 MHz. Our approach is simple and
broadly applicable, offering on-demand tunability and high sensitivity, with a
wide range of applications such as microwave photonic filters, slow and fast

common, where each data point can be seen as a realisation of a network-valued

neuroimaging study collects one or more brain scans across multiple
individuals, each of which can be modelled as a network with nodes
corresponding to distinct brain regions and edges corresponding to structural
or functional connections between these regions. Most statistical network
models, however, were originally proposed to describe a single underlying

multilevel framework for populations of networks based on exponential random
graph models. By pooling information across the individual networks, this
framework provides a principled approach to characterise the relational
structure for an entire population. To perform inference, we devise a novel
exchange-within-Gibbs MCMC algorithm that generates samples from the

work, we present ParaBART, a semantic sentence embedding model that learns to
disentangle semantics and syntax in sentence embeddings obtained by pre-trained

based on a source sentence that shares semantics with the target paraphrase,

disentangled semantic and syntactic representations from their respective

modern telecommunications networks: detecting and counteracting them is still a
crucial unresolved challenge for network operators. DDoS attack detection is
usually carried out in one or more central nodes that collect significant
amounts of monitoring data from networking devices, potentially creating issues
related to network overload or delay in detection. The dawn of programmable
data planes in Software-Defined Networks can help mitigate this issue, opening
the door to the detection of DDoS attacks directly in the data plane of the
switches. However, the most widely-adopted data plane programming language,
namely P4, lacks supporting many arithmetic operations, therefore, some of the
advanced network monitoring functionalities needed for DDoS detection cannot be
straightforwardly implemented in P4. This work overcomes such a limitation and
presents two novel strategies for flow cardinality and for normalized network
traffic entropy estimation that only use P4-supported operations and guarantee
a low relative error. Additionally, based on these contributions, we propose a
DDoS detection strategy relying on variations of the normalized network traffic
entropy. Results show that it has comparable or higher detection accuracy than

systems and the rapid growth of 360 video content and virtual reality (VR)
devices are accelerating the adoption of VR video streaming. Unfortunately,
video streaming consumes significant system energy due to the high power
consumption of the system components (e.g., DRAM, display interfaces, and
display panel) involved in this process.
  We propose BurstLink, a novel system-level technique that improves the energy
efficiency of planar and VR video streaming. BurstLink is based on two key
ideas. First, BurstLink directly transfers a decoded video frame from the host
system to the display panel, bypassing the host DRAM. To this end, we extend
the display panel with a double remote frame buffer (DRFB), instead of the
DRAM's double frame buffer, so that the system can directly update the DRFB
with a new frame while updating the panel's pixels with the current frame
stored in the DRFB. Second, BurstLink transfers a complete decoded frame to the
display panel in a single burst, using the maximum bandwidth of modern display
interfaces. Unlike conventional systems where the frame transfer rate is
limited by the pixel-update throughput of the display panel, BurstLink can
always take full advantage of the high bandwidth of modern display interfaces
by decoupling the frame transfer from the pixel update as enabled by the DRFB.
This direct and burst frame transfer of BurstLink significantly reduces energy
consumption in video display by reducing access to the host DRAM and increasing
the system's residency at idle power states.
  We evaluate BurstLink using an analytical power model that we rigorously
validate on a real modern mobile system. Our evaluation shows that BurstLink
reduces system energy consumption for 4K planar and VR video streaming by 41%
and 33%, respectively.

manufacturing techniques it may be possible to reshape the fundamental mode of
a SMF into any arbitrary distribution. An optimization problem is setup to
investigate what the optimal mode field distribution is and what the
fundamental throughput limit is for SMF spectroscopy. Both single-object
spectrographs and integral-field spectrographs are investigated. The optimal
mode for single-object spectrographs is found to be the aperture function of
the exit pupil, while for integral-field spectrographs the optimal mode depends

is optimal, while for sparse sampling, the mode of a conventional SMF is near

Pneumonia (CAP) using the chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. In the
first stage, an infection - COVID-19 or CAP, is detected using a pre-trained
DenseNet architecture. Then, in the second stage, a fine-grained three-way
classification is done using EfficientNet architecture. The proposed
COVID+CAP-CNN framework achieved a slice-level classification accuracy of over
94% at identifying COVID-19 and CAP. Further, the proposed framework has the
potential to be an initial screening tool for differential diagnosis of
COVID-19 and CAP, achieving a validation accuracy of over 89.3% at the finer
three-way COVID-19, CAP, and healthy classification. Within the IEEE ICASSP
2021 Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC) on COVID-19 Diagnosis, our
proposed two-stage classification framework achieved an overall accuracy of 90%
and sensitivity of .857, .9, and .942 at distinguishing COVID-19, CAP, and
normal individuals respectively, to rank first in the evaluation. Code and

programming overhead. GC techniques for sequential programs are based on
reachability analysis. However, testing reachability from a root set is
inadequate for determining whether an actor is garbage: Observe that an
unreachable actor may send a message to a reachable actor. Instead, it is
sufficient to check termination (sometimes also called quiescence): an actor is
terminated if it is not currently processing a message and cannot receive a
message in the future. Moreover, many actor frameworks provide all actors with
access to file I/O or external storage; without inspecting an actor's internal
code, it is necessary to check that the actor has terminated to ensure that it
may be garbage collected in these frameworks. Previous algorithms to detect
actor garbage require coordination mechanisms such as causal message delivery
or nonlocal monitoring of actors for mutation. Such coordination mechanisms
adversely affect concurrency and are therefore expensive in distributed
systems. We present a low-overhead deferred reference listing technique (called
DRL) for termination detection in actor systems. DRL is based on asynchronous
local snapshots and message-passing between actors. This enables a
decentralized implementation and transient network partition tolerance. The
paper provides a formal description of DRL, shows that all actors identified as
garbage have indeed terminated (safety), and that all terminated actors--under
certain reasonable assumptions--will eventually be identified (liveness).

come in fermion-boson pairs necessary for the realization of supersymmetry

a hypothetical SUSY breaking mechanism, operating at high energy inaccessible
to current experiments cannot be ruled out, this reduces SUSY's predictive
power and it is unclear whether SUSY, in its standard form, can help reducing
the remaining puzzles of the standard model (SM). Here we argue that SUSY can
be realized in a different way, connecting spacetime and internal bosonic
symmetries, combining bosonic gauge fields and fermionic matter particles in a
single gauge field, a Lie superalgebra-valued connection. In this
unconventional representation, states do not come in SUSY pairs, avoiding the
doubling of particles and fields and SUSY is not a fully off-shell invariance
of the action. The resulting systems are remarkably simple, closely resembling
a standard quantum field theory and SUSY still emerges as a contingent symmetry
that depends on the features of the vacuum/ground state. We illustrate the
general construction with two examples: i) A 2+1 dimensional system based on
the $osp(2,2|2)$ superalgebra, including Lorentz and $u(1)$ generators that
describes graphene; ii) A supersymmetric extension of 3+1 conformal gravity
with an $SU(2,2|2)$ connection that describes a gauge theory with an emergent
chiral symmetry breaking, coupled to gravity. The extensions to higher odd and
even dimensions, as well as the extensions to accommodate more general internal

is considered as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the no-U-turn sampler. In
multinomial HMC, proposed states are not limited to end-points as in Metropolis
HMC; instead points along the entire trajectory can be proposed. In this paper,
we establish couplings for multinomial HMC, based on optimal transport for
multinomial sampling in its transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting
time - the time it takes for the coupled chains to meet - based on the notion
of local contractivity. We evaluate our methods using three targets: 1,000
dimensional Gaussians, logistic regression and log-Gaussian Cox point
processes. Compared to Heng & Jacob (2019), coupled multinomial HMC generally
attains a smaller meeting time, and is more robust to choices of step sizes and
trajectory lengths, which allows re-use of existing adaptation methods for HMC.
These improvements together paves the way for a wider and more practical use of

Despite a priori degeneracies between modified gravity and the unknown
evolution of the merger rate and source masses, a large damping of the GW
amplitude could be falsifiable since as redshift grows it reduces the events
and lowers the edges of the PISN gap, which is against standard astrophysical
expectations. Applying a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to the current
LIGO--Virgo catalog (GWTC-2), the strongest constraints to date are placed on
deviations from the GW luminosity distance, finding $c_{_M}=-3.2^{+3.4}_{-2.0}$
at $68\%$ C.L., which is $\sim10$ times better than multi-messenger GW170817
bounds. These modifications also affects the determination of the BBH masses,
which is crucial to accommodate the high-mass binary GW190521 away from the
PISN gap. In this analysis it is found that the maximum mass of $99\%$ of the
population shifts to lower masses with increased uncertainty,
$m_{99\%}=46.2^{+11.4}_{-9.1}M_\odot$ at $68\%$ C.L. Testing gravity at large
scales with the population of BBHs will become increasingly relevant with
future catalogs, providing an independent and self-contained test of the
standard cosmological model.

photometrically identified as a distant quasar candidate at $z\approx5.5$.
Follow-up spectroscopic observations, done in August/September 2020 with the
SCORPIO-II instrument at the BTA 6-m telescope, confirmed that SRGE
J170245.3+130104 is a distant quasar at redshift z=5.466. The X-ray luminosity
of the quasar during the first half-year scan of the eROSITA all-sky survey was
$3.6^{+2.1}_{-1.5}\times 10^{46}$ erg/s (in the 2-10 keV energy range), whereas
its X-ray spectrum could be described by a power law with a slope of
$\Gamma=1.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$. Six months later (September 13-14, 2020), during
the second half-year scan of the eROSITA all-sky survey, the quasar was
detected again and its X-ray luminosity had decreased by a factor of 2 (at the
$\approx 1.9\sigma$ confidence level). The SRGE J170245.3+130104 proves to be
the most X-ray luminous among all known X-ray quasars at $z>5$. It is also one
of the radio-loudest distant quasars (with radio-loudness $R\sim10^3$), which

displacement of a swimmer as a path integral of a field in configuration space.
This representation can be transformed into an area integral for simple
swimmers using Stokes theorem. Since this transformation applies for any loop,
the integrand of this area integral can be used to help design these swimmers.
However, the extension of this Stokes theorem technique to more complicated
swimmers is hampered by problems with variables that do not commute and by how
to visualise and understand the higher dimensional spaces. In this paper, we
develop a treatment for each of these problems, thereby allowing the
displacement of general swimmers in any environment to be designed and
understood similarly to simple swimmers. The net displacement arising from
non-commuting variables is tackled by embedding the integral into a higher
dimensional space, which can then be visualised through a suitability
constructed surface. These methods are developed for general swimmers and
demonstrated on {three} benchmark examples: Purcell's two-hinged swimmer, an
axisymmetric squirmer in free space {and an axisymmetric squirmer approaching a
free interface}. We show in particular that for swimmers with more than two
modes of deformation, there exists an infinite set of strokes that generate
each net displacement. Hence, in the absence of additional restrictions,
general microscopic swimmers do not have a single stroke that maximises their
displacement.

the Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) individual-level surveys are
implemented in the most-affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa. PHIA is a
nationally-representative HIV-focused survey that combines household visits
with key questions and cutting-edge technologies such as biomarker tests for
HIV antibody and HIV viral load which offer the unique opportunity of
distinguishing between recent infection and long-term infection, and providing
relevant HIV information by age, gender, and location. In this article, we
propose a semi-supervised logistic regression model for estimating individual

sources -- the PHIA survey where the true HIV recency status is unknown, and
the cohort studies provided in the literature where the relationship between
HIV recency status and the covariates are presented in the form of a
contingency table. It also utilizes the national level HIV incidence estimates
from the epidemiology model. Applying the proposed model to Malawi PHIA data,
we demonstrate that our approach is more accurate for the individual level
estimation and more appropriate for estimating HIV recency rates at aggregated

a two-distance behavior: simultaneously containing a large-distance plateau

distributed training of large-scale DLRMs. We introduce a high-performance
scalable software stack based on PyTorch and pair it with the new evolution of
Zion platform, namely ZionEX. We demonstrate the capability to train very large
DLRMs with up to 12 Trillion parameters and show that we can attain 40X speedup

designing the ZionEX platform with dedicated scale-out network, provisioned
with high bandwidth, optimal topology and efficient transport (ii) implementing
an optimized PyTorch-based training stack supporting both model and data
parallelism (iii) developing sharding algorithms capable of hierarchical
partitioning of the embedding tables along row, column dimensions and load
balancing them across multiple workers; (iv) adding high-performance core
operators while retaining flexibility to support optimizers with fully
deterministic updates (v) leveraging reduced precision communications,
multi-level memory hierarchy (HBM+DDR+SSD) and pipelining. Furthermore, we
develop and briefly comment on distributed data ingestion and other supporting
services that are required for the robust and efficient end-to-end training in

of cosmological dark matter. The most important advantage is that ULDM with
mass $m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV can account for the small-scale problems encountered
in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model like the core-cusp problem,
missing satellite problem and the too-big-to-fail problem in galaxies. In this
article, we formulate a new simple model-independent analysis using the SPARC
data to constrain the range of ULDM mass. In particular, the most stringent
constraint comes from the data of a galaxy ESO563-G021, which can
conservatively exclude a ULDM mass range $m=(0.14-3.11)\times 10^{-22}$ eV.
This model-independent excluded range is consistent with many bounds obtained
by recent studies and it suggests that the ULDM proposal may not be able to
alleviate the small-scale problems.

Learning (FDRL) method for effective facial expression recognition. We view the
expression information as the combination of the shared information (expression
similarities) across different expressions and the unique information
(expression-specific variations) for each expression. More specifically, FDRL
mainly consists of two crucial networks: a Feature Decomposition Network (FDN)
and a Feature Reconstruction Network (FRN). In particular, FDN first decomposes
the basic features extracted from a backbone network into a set of facial
action-aware latent features to model expression similarities. Then, FRN
captures the intra-feature and inter-feature relationships for latent features
to characterize expression-specific variations, and reconstructs the expression
feature. To this end, two modules including an intra-feature relation modeling
module and an inter-feature relation modeling module are developed in FRN.
Experimental results on both the in-the-lab databases (including CK+, MMI, and
Oulu-CASIA) and the in-the-wild databases (including RAF-DB and SFEW) show that
the proposed FDRL method consistently achieves higher recognition accuracy than
several state-of-the-art methods. This clearly highlights the benefit of
feature decomposition and reconstruction for classifying expressions.

deep waters is investigated by means of a 'momentary' criterion of instability
for unsteady flows (Blondeaux and Seminara, 1979). In the parameter range
investigated, it is found that the flow is stable to 2-D perturbations. The
least stable eigenmode of the resulting Orr-Sommerfield spectrum attains its
maximum beneath the boundary layer of the Stokes wave. Moreover, an analysis of
the associated pseudospectrum indicates that the laminar flow when modified by
imperfections is unstable due to the non-normality of the Orr-Sommerfeld
operator, and the unstable pseudo-eigenmodes tend to peak within the boundary
layer. The laminar flow of the Stokes wave is also stable to 3-D
streamwise-independent perturbations. Instability is observed for the laminar
flow with imperfections. The associated unstable pseudo-eigenmodes are
streamwise vortical rolls similar to Langmuir cells. The laminar boundary layer
flow of a Stokes wave appears to be stable to infinitesimal perturbations, but
it may likely be unstable to finite perturbations, as in Poiseuille pipe flows.
The present results are supportive of the recent experimental evidence of
spontaneous occurrence of turbulence beneath unforced non-breaking surface
waves.

systems (ITS), and long-term network-wide accurate traffic speed forecasting is
one of the most challenging tasks. Recently, deep learning methods have become
popular in this domain. As traffic data are physically associated with road
networks, most proposed models treat it as a spatiotemporal graph modeling
problem and use Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods. These GCN-based
models highly depend on a predefined and fixed adjacent matrix to reflect the
spatial dependency. However, the predefined fixed adjacent matrix is limited in
reflecting the actual dependence of traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel
model, Traffic Transformer, for spatial-temporal graph modeling and long-term
traffic forecasting to overcome these limitations. Transformer is the most
popular framework in Natural Language Processing (NLP). And by adapting it to
the spatiotemporal problem, Traffic Transformer hierarchically extracts
spatiotemporal features through data dynamically by multi-head attention and
masked multi-head attention mechanism, and fuse these features for traffic
forecasting. Furthermore, analyzing the attention weight matrixes can find the
influential part of road networks, allowing us to learn the traffic networks
better. Experimental results on the public traffic network datasets and
real-world traffic network datasets generated by ourselves demonstrate our
proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art ones.

(UDA) addresses this problem by training a model with only labeled data in the

Existing studies show that self-supervised learning using both source and
target domain data can help improve the adaptability of trained models, but
they all rely on hand-crafted designs of the self-supervised tasks. In this
paper, we propose a learnable self-supervised task and integrate it into a
self-supervision-based point cloud UDA architecture. Specifically, we propose a
learnable nonlinear transformation that transforms a part of a point cloud to
generate abundant and complicated point clouds while retaining the original
semantic information, and the proposed self-supervised task is to reconstruct
the original point cloud from the transformed ones. In the UDA architecture, an
encoder is shared between the networks for the self-supervised task and the
main task of point cloud classification or segmentation, so that the encoder
can be trained to extract features suitable for both the source and the target

However, neural networks are predominantly feature-based - they map data to
unstructured vectorial representation and thus can fall into the trap of
exploiting shortcuts through surface statistics instead of true systematic

object-centric representation as a basis for constructing spatio-temporal

pattern recognition and high-level symbolic algebra. To this end, we propose a
new query-guided representation framework to turn a video into an evolving
relational graph of objects, whose features and interactions are dynamically
and conditionally inferred. The object lives are then summarized into resumes,
lending naturally for deliberative relational reasoning that produces an answer
to the query. The framework is evaluated on major Video QA datasets,
demonstrating clear benefits of the object-centric approach to video reasoning.

paper, we tackle the egopose estimation from a more natural human vision span,

For
neural image compression, end-to-end optimization requires differentiable
approximations of quantization, which can generally be grouped into three
categories: additive uniform noise, straight-through estimator and soft-to-hard
annealing. Training with additive uniform noise approximates the quantization
error variationally but suffers from the train-test mismatch. The other two
methods do not encounter this mismatch but, as shown in this paper, hurt the
rate-distortion performance since the latent representation ability is
weakened. We thus propose a novel soft-then-hard quantization strategy for
neural image compression that first learns an expressive latent space softly,
then closes the train-test mismatch with hard quantization. In addition, beyond
the fixed integer quantization, we apply scaled additive uniform noise to
adaptively control the quantization granularity by deriving a new variational

divided into several sub-blocks and a linear function with only two variables

compensate the channel frequency-selectivity. Second, we formulate the joint
active device detection and channel estimation in the block-wise linear system

  There are several objective functions that the emptier might wish to
minimize. One of the strongest guarantees would be to minimize tail size, which
is defined to be the number of cups with fill $2$ or greater. A simple
lower-bound construction shows that the optimal tail size for deterministic
emptying algorithms is $\Theta(n)$, however.
  We present a simple randomized emptying algorithm that achieves tail size

  Space Shape Completion",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper tackles the task of category-level pose estimation for garments.
With a near infinite degree of freedom, a garment's full configuration (i.e.,
poses) is often described by the per-vertex 3D locations of its entire 3D
surface. However, garments are also commonly subject to extreme cases of
self-occlusion, especially when folded or crumpled, making it challenging to
perceive their full 3D surface. To address these challenges, we propose
GarmentNets, where the key idea is to formulate the deformable object pose
estimation problem as a shape completion task in the canonical space. This
canonical space is defined across garments instances within a category,
therefore, specifies the shared category-level pose. By mapping the observed
partial surface to the canonical space and completing it in this space, the
output representation describes the garment's full configuration using a
complete 3D mesh with the per-vertex canonical coordinate label. To properly
handle the thin 3D structure presented on garments, we proposed a novel 3D
shape representation using the generalized winding number field. Experiments
demonstrate that GarmentNets is able to generalize to unseen garment instances
and achieve significantly better performance compared to alternative
approaches.

lightweight applications due to their high specific strength and other
favorable properties including enhanced endurance and corrosion resistance.
However, these materials are inevitably exposed to moisture, which is known to
drastically reduce their mechanical properties caused by moisture absorption
and often accompanied with plasticization, weight gain, hygrothermal swelling,
and de-bonding between fiber and matrix. Hence, it is vital to understand
moisture diffusion mechanics into FRPCs. The presence of fibers, especially
impermeable like Carbon fibers, introduce tortuous moisture diffusion pathways
through polymer matrix. In this paper, we elucidate the impact of fiber packing
and morphology on moisture diffusion in FRPC materials. Computational models
are developed within a finite element framework to evaluate moisture kinetics
in impermeable FRPCs. We introduce a tortuosity factor for measuring the extent
of deviation in moisture diffusion pathways due to impermeable fiber
reinforcements. Two-dimensional micromechanical models are analyzed with
varying fiber volume fractions, spatial distributions and morphology to
elucidate the influence of internal micromechanical fiber architectures on
tortuous diffusion pathways and corresponding diffusivities. Finally, a
relationship between tortuosity and diffusivity is established such that
diffusivity can be calculated using tortuosity for a given micro-architecture.
Tortuosity can be easily calculated for a given architecture by solving steady
state diffusion governing equations, whereas time-dependent transient diffusion
equations need to be solved for calculating moisture diffusivity. Hence,
tortuosity, instead of diffusivity, can be used in future composites designs,
multi-scale analyses, and optimization for enabling robust structures in
moisture environments.

deeply-embedded object with no near-IR counterpart. Using FORCAST and HAWC+ on
SOFIA, we have obtained the first mid-infrared images of this field since the
outburst began. Despite being undetected in pre-outburst ground-based 18 $\mu$m
images, MM1 is now the brightest region at all three wavelengths (25, 37, and
53 $\mu$m), exceeding the ultracompact HII region MM3 (NGC6334F). Combining the
SOFIA data with ALMA imaging at four wavelengths, we construct a spectral
energy distribution of the combination of MM1 and the nearby hot core MM2. The
best-fit Robitaille radiative transfer model yields a luminosity of
$(4.9\pm0.8)\times10^4 L_\odot$. Accounting for an estimated pre-outburst
luminosity ratio MM1:MM2 = $2.1\pm0.4$, the luminosity of MM1 has increased by
a factor of $16.3\pm4.4$. The pre-outburst luminosity implies a protostar of
mass 6.7 $M_\odot$, which can produce the ionizing photon rate required to
power the pre-outburst hypercompact HII region surrounding the likely
outbursting protostar MM1B. The total energy and duration of the outburst
exceed the S255IR-NIRS3 outburst by a factor of $\gtrsim3$, suggesting a
different scale of event involving expansion of the protostellar photosphere
(to $\gtrsim$ 20 $R_\odot$), thereby supporting a higher accretion rate
($\gtrsim$0.0023 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) and reducing the ionizing photon rate. In
the grid of hydrodynamic models of Meyer et al. 2021, the combination of
outburst luminosity and magnitude (3) places the NGC6334I-MM1 event in the
region of moderate total accretion ($\sim$0.1-0.3 $M_\odot$) and hence long
duration ($\sim$40-130 yr).

syntactic, semantic, and thematic transfers of text, as well as (2)
compositions of multiple transfers which allow modeling of fine-grained
stylistic changes as building blocks for more complex, high-level transfers. By
benchmarking existing methods on StylePTB, we find that they struggle to model
fine-grained changes and have an even more difficult time composing multiple

encourage future research in controllable text style transfer, compositional
models, and learning disentangled representations. Solving these challenges
would present important steps towards controllable text generation.

transition and operation. As outsourcing is now well established the switching
of vendors and transitioning from one system to another is common. However,
most of the research to date on outsourcing has focused on the decision and
operation phases, leaving a gap between theory and practice concerning the
transition phase. Transition in outsourcing entails the changing of systems,
business processes and/or vendors. If a suitable transition approach is not
applied pressures for another transition can immediately build. We present
results from a case study carried out on the Novopay Project in which the
Ministry of Education in New Zealand changed their vendor from an onshore to a
near-shore provider. This project resulted in a sequence of three transitions,
with each following a different approach as a direct result of the experiences
encountered in the previous transition. In this research we made use of the
rich 'data dump' of evidence provided by the Ministry of Education. Our
analysis describes how a client organization can become trapped in a continuous
transition cycle if a suitable approach is not applied. Transition1 involved
the client moving from complete outsourcing to selective insourcing. After
realizing that they did not have the capabilities to manage insourcing,
Transition2 was initiated. In Transition2 the sourcing approach reverted back
to complete outsourcing. When it was realized that the new vendor in
Transition2 could not in fact deliver a new service model or support end-users
in following new business processes, Transition3 was initiated. In Transition3,
the client established an internal company to insource service operations to
support end-users. Transition can be a sound business strategy, however, if a
flawed sourcing approach is chosen it can result in 'continuous transition'.

Hamiltonians that possess discrete time translation symmetry. The spontaneous
breaking of this symmetry leads to the emergence of a novel non-equilibrium
phase of matter - the Discrete Time Crystal (DTC). In this paper, we propose a
scheme to extend the lifetime of a DTC in a paradigmatic model - a translation
invariant Ising spin chain with nearest-neighbor interaction $J$, subjected to
a periodic kick by a transverse magnetic field with frequency $\frac{2
\pi}{T}$. This system exhibits the hallmark signature of a DTC - persistent
subharmonic oscillations with frequency $\frac{\pi}{T}$ - for a wide parameter
regime. Employing both analytical arguments as well as exact diagonalization
calculations, we demonstrate that the lifetime of the DTC is maximized, when
the interaction strength is tuned to an optimal value, $JT = \pi$. Our proposal
essentially relies on an interaction induced quantum interference mechanism
that suppresses the creation of excitations, and thereby enhances the DTC
lifetime. Intriguingly, we find that the period doubling oscillations can last
eternally in even size systems. This anomalously long lifetime can be
attributed to a time reflection symmetry that emerges at $JT=\pi$. Our work
provides a promising avenue for realizing a robust DTC in various quantum
emulator platforms.

combined conservative and dissipative couplings to propose new topological
phases for ultracold atoms and for photonics. However, the topological phases
that arise due to purely dissipative couplings remain largely unexplored. Here
we realize dissipatively coupled versions of two prominent topological models,
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the Harper-Hofstadter (HH) model, in
the synthetic dimensions of a time-multiplexed photonic resonator network. We
observe the topological edge state of the SSH and HH models, measure the SSH

SSH model's trivial and topological phases. In stark contrast with
conservatively coupled topological phases, the topological phases of our
network arise from bands of dissipation rates that possess nontrivial
topological invariants, and the edge states of these topological phases exhibit
isolated dissipation rates that occur in the gaps between the bulk dissipation
bands. Our results showcase the ability of dissipative couplings to enable
time-reversal symmetry broken topological phases with nonzero Chern numbers,

compatible sphere-based intersection over-union loss function is introduced to
train the lung nodule detection network stably and efficiently. Second, we
empower the network anchor-free by designing a positive center-points selection
and matching process, which naturally discards pre-determined anchor boxes. An
online hard example mining and re-focal loss subsequently enable the CPM
process to be more robust, resulting in more accurate point assignment and
mitigation of class imbalance. In addition, to better capture spatial
information and 3D context for the detection, we propose to fuse multi-level
spatial coordinate maps with the feature extractor and combine them with 3D
squeeze-and-excitation attention modules. Experimental results on the LUNA16
dataset showed that our proposed framework achieves superior performance
compared with existing anchor-based and anchor-free methods for lung nodule
detection.

First, we present a context-knowledge interaction learning framework,
Knowledge-aware Neural Network (KNN), which learns the QA sentence
representations by considering a tight interaction with the external knowledge
from KG and the textual information. Then, we develop two kinds of
knowledge-aware attention mechanism to summarize both the context-based and

proposed to improve the computational efficiency of a DNN. Augmenting the

However, simplification of DNN operators invariably comes at the cost of lower
accuracy, especially on complex processing tasks. Our proposed ENOS framework
allows an optimal layer-wise integration of inference operators and computing
modes to achieve the desired balance of energy and accuracy. The search in ENOS
is formulated as a continuous optimization problem, solvable using typical
gradient descent methods, thereby scalable to larger DNNs with minimal increase
in training cost. We characterize ENOS under two settings. In the first
setting, for digital accelerators, we discuss ENOS on multiply-accumulate (MAC)
cores that can be reconfigured to different operators. ENOS training methods
with single and bi-level optimization objectives are discussed and compared. We
also discuss a sequential operator assignment strategy in ENOS that only learns
the assignment for one layer in one training step, enabling greater flexibility
in converging towards the optimal operator allocations. Furthermore, following
Bayesian principles, a sampling-based variational mode of ENOS is also
presented. ENOS is characterized on popular DNNs ShuffleNet and SqueezeNet on
CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.

provided coherent qubits can be constructed in large arrays. The key premise is
that physical errors can remain both small and sufficiently uncorrelated as
devices scale, so that logical error rates can be exponentially suppressed.
However, energetic impacts from cosmic rays and latent radioactivity violate
both of these assumptions. An impinging particle ionizes the substrate,
radiating high energy phonons that induce a burst of quasiparticles, destroying
qubit coherence throughout the device. High-energy radiation has been
identified as a source of error in pilot superconducting quantum devices, but
lacking a measurement technique able to resolve a single event in detail, the
effect on large scale algorithms and error correction in particular remains an
open question. Elucidating the physics involved requires operating large
numbers of qubits at the same rapid timescales as in error correction, exposing
the event's evolution in time and spread in space. Here, we directly observe
high-energy rays impacting a large-scale quantum processor. We introduce a
rapid space and time-multiplexed measurement method and identify large bursts
of quasiparticles that simultaneously and severely limit the energy coherence
of all qubits, causing chip-wide failure. We track the events from their
initial localised impact to high error rates across the chip. Our results
provide direct insights into the scale and dynamics of these damaging error
bursts in large-scale devices, and highlight the necessity of mitigation to
enable quantum computing to scale.

sought-after for Majorana-based quantum computing. However, there is no causal
relationship between the two, since superconductivity is a many-body effect due
to electron-electron interaction while topology is a single-particle
manifestation of electron band structure. Here, we demonstrate a novel form of
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing, induced by topological Weyl
nodal lines in Ising Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (IBCS) superconductors. Based on
first-principles calculations and analyses, we predict that the nonmagnetic

${\alpha}_1$-TaSi$_2$N$_4$, ${\alpha}_1$-NbSi$_2$P$_4$,
${\alpha}_2$-TaGe$_2$P$_4$, and ${\alpha}_2$-NbGe$_2$P$_4$ monolayers, are all

non-centrosymmetric systems, the extrinsic FFLO pairing is revealed to be
evoked by the Weyl nodal lines under magnetic field, facilitating the formation
of Cooper pairs with nonzero momentum in their vicinity. Moreover, we show that
the IBCS pairing alone will enhance the in-plane critical field $B_c$ to ~10-50
times of Pauli paramagnetic limit $B_p$, and additional FFLO pairing can
further triple the $B_c/B_p$ ratio. It therefore affords an effective approach
to enhance the robustness of superconductivity. Also, the topology induced

In particular, we show that for nonequilibrium states such as heat transport

is valid even when the exact form of the steady state distribution is unknown.
The obtained theoretical results enable us to construct a data-driven nanoscale

message passing to such edgeless nodes having no connections is impossible. To
tackle this challenge, we propose Edgeless-GNN, a novel inductive framework
that enables GNNs to generate node embeddings even for edgeless nodes through
unsupervised learning. Specifically, we start by constructing a proxy graph

model parameters, whereas a topology-aware loss function is established in such

positive, negative, and second-order relations between nodes. For the edgeless

systematic uncertainty to control in lattice QCD calculations of nucleon matrix
elements and form factors: early time separations are contaminated by excited
states and late times suffer from an exponentially bad signal-to-noise problem.
High-statistics calculations at large time separations $\gtrsim1$ fm are
commonly used to combat these issues. In this work, focusing on $g_A$, we
explore the alternative strategy of utilizing a large number of relatively
low-statistics calculations at short to medium time separations (0.2--1 fm),
combined with a multi-state analysis. On an ensemble with a pion mass of
approximately 310 MeV and a lattice spacing of approximately 0.09 fm, we find
this provides a more robust and economical method of quantifying and
controlling the excited state systematic uncertainty. A quantitative separation
of various types of excited states enables the identification of the transition
matrix elements as the dominant contamination. The excited state contamination
of the Feynman-Hellmann correlation function is found to reduce to the 1% level
at approximately 1 fm while for the more standard three-point functions, this
does not occur until after 2 fm. Critical to our findings is the use of a
global minimization, rather than fixing the spectrum from the two-point
functions and using them as input to the three-point analysis. We find that the
ground state parameters determined in such a global analysis are stable against
variations in the excited state model, the number of excited states, and the
truncation of early-time or late-time numerical data.

enforce the result \(s_w\rightarrow0\) as \(P_w\rightarrow 0\), which is the
Pasinetti's description about behavior of the workers. We find that the
Pasinetti's claim, of long run worker's propensity to save as not influencing
the distribution of income between profits and the wage can not be generalized.
This claim is found to be valid only when \(W>>P_w\) or \(P_w=0\) with
\(W\ne0\). In practice, the Pasinetti's condition imposes a restriction on the
actual savings by one of the agents to a lower level compared to its full
saving capacity. An implied relationship between the propensities to save by
workers and capitalists shows that the Passineti's condition can be practiced
only through a contract for a constant value of \(R=s_w/s_c\), to be agreed
upon between the workers and the capitalists. It is showed that the Passineti's

that the precession direction reverses when the axial magnetic field direction

successfully predicts the zeroth-order magnetoprecession dynamics. Our TEMC
magnetoprecession model hinges on thermoelectric current loops at the top and
bottom boundaries, which create Lorentz forces that generate horizontal torques

  Neighborhood",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Attributed network representation learning aims at learning node embeddings
by integrating network structure and attribute information. It is a challenge
to fully capture the microscopic structure and the attribute semantics
simultaneously, where the microscopic structure includes the one-step, two-step
and multi-step relations, indicating the first-order, second-order and
high-order proximity of nodes, respectively. In this paper, we propose a deep
attributed network representation learning via attribute enhanced neighborhood
(DANRL-ANE) model to improve the robustness and effectiveness of node
representations. The DANRL-ANE model adopts the idea of the autoencoder, and
expands the decoder component to three branches to capture different order
proximity. We linearly combine the adjacency matrix with the attribute
similarity matrix as the input of our model, where the attribute similarity
matrix is calculated by the cosine similarity between the attributes based on
the social homophily. In this way, we preserve the second-order proximity to
enhance the robustness of DANRL-ANE model on sparse networks, and deal with the
topological and attribute information simultaneously. Moreover, the sigmoid
cross-entropy loss function is extended to capture the neighborhood character,
so that the first-order proximity is better preserved. We compare our model
with the state-of-the-art models on five real-world datasets and two network
analysis tasks, i.e., link prediction and node classification. The DANRL-ANE
model performs well on various networks, even on sparse networks or networks
with isolated nodes given the attribute information is sufficient.

of this study is to classify MRI images of every single subject into one of the
spectrums of the FTD in a hierarchical order by applying data-driven techniques

computed by FreeSurfer software. We used the Smallest Univalue Segment

$N_{OO}<N<N_{C}$, the scaling of ring sizes $R\sim N^{2/5}$ results from
balancing non-concatenation with weak compression of rings. For

These site testing campaigns conducted were mainly focused on fundamental
performances of the site, such as cloud coverage, seeing, temperature, etc.
With increasing interests in sodium laser guide star adaptive optics for these
new telescopes in the Chinese astronomical community, it is interesting to
investigate the performance of the laser guide star at these sites, especially
considering that the sodium laser guide star's on-sky performance is
significantly influenced by sites' local performances, such as geomagnetic

studied sodium laser guide star's performance of a 20W class Quasi-CW pulsed

segmentation deep neural network (DNN) during online operation, i.e., during
inference, which is of high importance in safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving. Here, many high-level decisions rely on such DNNs, which
are usually evaluated offline, while their performance in online operation
remains unknown. To solve this problem, we propose an improved online
performance prediction scheme, building on a recently proposed concept of
predicting the primary semantic segmentation task's performance. This can be
achieved by evaluating the auxiliary task of monocular depth estimation with a
measurement supplied by a LiDAR sensor and a subsequent regression to the
semantic segmentation performance. In particular, we propose (i) sequential
training methods for both tasks in a multi-task training setup, (ii) to share
the encoder as well as parts of the decoder between both task's networks for
improved efficiency, and (iii) a temporal statistics aggregation method, which
significantly reduces the performance prediction error at the cost of a small
algorithmic latency. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset shows that all three
aspects improve the performance prediction compared to previous approaches.

Additionally, anatomical knowledge is incorporated by training the system to
predict lung and heart segmentation, as well as spatial knowledge labels. To

into one-stage methods and twostage ones. One-stage models are more efficient
due to their straightforward architectures, but the two-stage models are still
advantageous in accuracy. Existing one-stage models usually begin by detecting
predefined interaction areas or points, and then attend to these areas only for
interaction prediction; therefore, they lack reasoning steps that dynamically
search for discriminative cues. In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage
method, namely Glance and Gaze Network (GGNet), which adaptively models a set
of actionaware points (ActPoints) via glance and gaze steps. The glance step
quickly determines whether each pixel in the feature maps is an interaction
point. The gaze step leverages feature maps produced by the glance step to
adaptively infer ActPoints around each pixel in a progressive manner. Features
of the refined ActPoints are aggregated for interaction prediction. Moreover,
we design an actionaware approach that effectively matches each detected
interaction with its associated human-object pair, along with a novel hard
negative attentive loss to improve the optimization of GGNet. All the above
operations are conducted simultaneously and efficiently for all pixels in the
feature maps. Finally, GGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by

as radiation. On one hand, we show that if the Fermi gas starts relativistic,
it could stay relativistic. On the other hand, if the fermions are initially
non-relativistic, they remain non-relativistic for all practical purposes. We
find that in both cases the energy density of the fermions and the scalar field

oscillating and decaying effective mass. Such background dynamics questions
whether there is a substantial enhancement of the fermion density fluctuations

He$n{\alpha}$, and C$n{\alpha}$ ($n = 164 - 186$), respectively. This, combined
with its unparalleled collecting area, makes FAST the most powerful telescope
to detect weak RRLs. In this pilot survey, we use FAST to observe nine HII

total, 21 RRLs for H$n{\alpha}$ and C$n{\alpha}$ at $1.0 - 1.5$ GHz have been

prices in the context of the outbreak of the new coronavirus crisis.
Specifically, we assess to what extent the uncertainty induced by COVID-19
affects the interaction between oil and the United States (US) stock markets.
To this end, we use a wavelet approach and daily data from February 18, 2020 to
August 15, 2020. We identify the lead-lag relationship between oil and stock
prices, and the intensity of this relationship at different frequency cycles
and moments in time. Our unique findings show that co-movements between oil and
stock prices manifest at 3-5-day cycle and are stronger in the first part of
March and the second part of April 2020, when oil prices are leading stock
prices. The partial wavelet coherence analysis, controlling for the effect of
COVID-19 and US economic policy-induced uncertainty, reveals that the
coronavirus crisis amplifies the shock propagation between oil and stock
prices.

natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Research in word representation shows
that isotropic embeddings can significantly improve performance on downstream
tasks. However, we measure and analyze the geometry of pre-trained BERT
embedding and find that it is far from isotropic. We find that the word vectors
are not centered around the origin, and the average cosine similarity between
two random words is much higher than zero, which indicates that the word
vectors are distributed in a narrow cone and deteriorate the representation
capacity of word embedding. We propose a simple, and yet effective method to
fix this problem: remove several dominant directions of BERT embedding with a
set of learnable weights. We train the weights on word similarity tasks and
show that processed embedding is more isotropic. Our method is evaluated on
three standardized tasks: word similarity, word analogy, and semantic textual
similarity. In all tasks, the word embedding processed by our method
consistently outperforms the original embedding (with average improvement of
13% on word analogy and 16% on semantic textual similarity) and two baseline
methods. Our method is also proven to be more robust to changes of
hyperparameter.

behaviour, when we allow for whistling of both descending and ascending
frequency types, and when we study the more general case of oblique propagation
to the background magnetic field. We show how the general theory recovers all
known approximate group speed expressions for both classical whistlers and ion
cyclotron whistlers, which we here extend to include ion contributions and
deviations from parallel propagation. At oblique angles and at perpendicular
propagation, whistlers are investigated using exact numerical evaluations of
the two-fluid dispersion relation and their group speeds under Earth's
magnetosphere conditions. This approach allows for a complete overview of all
whistling behaviour and we quantify the typical frequency ranges where they
must be observable. We use the generality of the theory to show that pair
plasmas in pulsar magnetospheres also feature whistling behaviour, although not
of the classical type at parallel propagation. Whistling of the high frequency
modes is discussed as well, and we give the extension of the Appleton-Hartree
relation for cold plasmas, to include the effect of a non-zero thermal electron
velocity. We use it to quantify the Faraday rotation effect at all angles, and
compare its predictions between the cold and warm Appleton-Hartree equation.

of classification, each item to be classified corresponds to a different
initial datum for the control problem of the NODE, to be classified, all of
them by the same common control, to the location (a subdomain of the euclidean

dynamics of NODEs under consideration plays a key role in our proofs, since it
allows deforming half of the phase space while the other half remains
invariant, a property that classical models in mechanics do not fulfill. This
very property allows to build elementary controls inducing specific dynamics
and transformations whose concatenation, along with properly chosen
hyperplanes, allows achieving our goals in finitely many steps. The
nonlinearity of the dynamics is assumed to be Lipschitz. Therefore, our results

the key observation that a feature representation learned with instance

a new training method, referred to as Class-Balanced Distillation (CBD), that

the feature representation to evolve in the second training stage, guided by
the teacher learned in the first stage. The second stage uses class-balanced
sampling, in order to focus on under-represented classes. This framework can
naturally accommodate the usage of multiple teachers, unlocking the information

parameter, number of iterations, generality of the mathematical formulation,
limits of applicability (degeneracies, domain of the parameter, special cases

transactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually
exploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved.
  In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum
attacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) specially crafted for use in the
blockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful
exploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a
model for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that
mirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we
compare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their
effectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for
investigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that
coarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit
transactions with less computation; however, they are contract-specific and

feedback, which contains $N$ arms with features. The learner is allowed to
query subsets of size $K$ and receives feedback in the form of a noisy winner.
The goal of the learner is to identify the best arm efficiently using as few
queries as possible. This setting is relevant in various online decision-making
scenarios involving human feedback such as online retailing, streaming
services, news feed, and online advertising; since it is easier and more
reliable for people to choose a preferred item from a subset than to assign a
likability score to an item in isolation. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that considers the subset-wise preference feedback model in a
structured setting, which allows for potentially infinite set of arms. We
present two algorithms that guarantee the detection of the best-arm in
$\tilde{O} (\frac{d^2}{K \Delta^2})$ samples with probability at least $1 -
\delta$, where $d$ is the dimension of the arm-features and $\Delta$ is the
appropriate notion of utility gap among the arms. We also derive an
instance-dependent lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{d}{\Delta^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta})$ which matches our upper bound on a worst-case instance.
Finally, we run extensive experiments to corroborate our theoretical findings,
and observe that our adaptive algorithm stops and requires up to 12x fewer
samples than a non-adaptive algorithm.

intra-class uncertainty following Gaussian distribution. Specifically, in our
framework, the features extracted by deep networks of each class are
characterized by independent Gaussian distribution. The parameters of
distribution are learned with a likelihood regularization along with other
network parameters. The means of the Gaussian play a similar role as the center
anchor in existing methods, and the variance describes the uncertainty of
different classes. In addition, similar to the inter-class margin in
traditional loss functions, we introduce a margin to intra-class uncertainty to
make each cluster more compact and reduce the imbalance of feature distribution
from different categories. Based on MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, and Long-tailed
CIFAR analyses, the proposed approach shows improved classification

This extends the existing notion from Hilbert spaces, where $\alpha$-firmly

our more general setting, we show that $\alpha$-averaged operators form a
subset of $\alpha$-firmly nonexpansive operators. We develop some basic
calculus rules for (quasi) $\alpha$-firmly nonexpansive operators. In
particular, we show that their compositions and convex combinations are again
(quasi) $\alpha$-firmly nonexpansive. Moreover, we will see that quasi
$\alpha$-firmly nonexpansive operators enjoy the asymptotic regularity
property. Then, based on Browder's demiclosedness principle, we prove for
$r$-uniformly convex Banach spaces that the weak cluster points of the iterates
$x_{n+1}:=Tx_{n}$ belong to the fixed point set $\text{Fix} T$ whenever the
operator $T$ is nonexpansive and quasi $\alpha$-firmly. If additionally the
space has a Fr\'echet differentiable norm or satisfies Opial's property then
these iterates converge weakly to some element in $\text{Fix} T$. Further, the
projections $P_{\text{Fix} T}x_n$ converge strongly to this weak limit point.
Finally, we give three illustrative examples, where our theory can be applied,
namely from infinite dimensional neural networks, semigroup theory, and
contractive projections in $L_p$, $p \in (1,\infty) \backslash \{2\}$ spaces on

designing and describing autonomous vehicle platooning manoeuvres. Although a
large body of research has been formulating platooning manoeuvres, it is still
challenging to design, describe, read, and understand them. This difficulty
largely arises from missing formalisation. To fill this gap, we analysed
existing ways of describing manoeuvres, derived the causes of difficulty, and
designed a framework that simplifies the manoeuvre design process. Alongside, a
Manoeuvre Design Language was developed to structurally describe manoeuvres in
a machine-readable format. Unlike state-of-the-art manoeuvre descriptions that
require one state machine for every participating vehicle, the SEAD framework
allows describing any manoeuvre from the single perspective of the platoon
leader. %As a proof of concept, the proposed framework was implemented in the
mixed traffic simulation environment BEHAVE for an autonomous highway scenario.
Using this framework, we implemented several manoeuvres as they were described
in literature. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, an experiment
was performed to evaluate the execution time performance of multiple
alternatives of the Join-Middle manoeuvre. This proof-of-concept experiment
revealed that the manoeuvre execution time can be reduced by 28 \% through
parallelising various steps without considerable secondary effects. We hope
that the SEAD framework will pave the way for further research in the area of
new manoeuvre design and optimisation by largely simplifying and unifying
platooning manoeuvre representation.

tremendous popularity in industry in the last decade because of its low energy
consumption, non-volatile nature and high I/O speed. But these cache systems
have a worse write performance than the read performance because of the
asymmetric I/O costs and the the internal GC mechanism. In addition to the
performance issues, since the NAND flash is a type of EEPROM device, the
lifespan is also limited by the Program/Erase (P/E) cycles. So how to improve
the performance and the lifespan of flash-based caches in write-intensive
scenarios has always been a hot issue. Benefiting from Open-Channel SSDs
(OCSSDs), we propose a write-friendly flash-based disk cache system, which is
called WLFC (Write Less in the Flash-based Cache). In WLFC, a strictly
sequential writing method is used to minimize the write amplification. A new
replacement algorithm for the write buffer is designed to minimize the erase
count caused by the evicting. And a new data layout strategy is designed to
minimize the metadata size persisted in SSDs. As a result, the Over-Provisioned
(OP) space is completely removed, the erase count of the flash is greatly
reduced, and the metadata size is 1/10 or less than that in BCache. Even with a
small amount of metadata, the data consistency after the crash is still
guaranteed. Compared with the existing mechanism, WLFC brings a 7%-80%
reduction in write latency, a 1.07*-4.5* increment in write throughput, and a
50%-88.9% reduction in erase count, with a moderate overhead in read
performance.

part of the physics program of $BABAR$ experiment, aimed to improve the
calculation of the hadronic contribution to the muon $g-2$ and to study the
intermediate dynamics of the processes. We present the most recent results
obtained by using the full data set of about 470\,fb$^{-1}$ collected by the
BABAR detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ collider at a center-of-mass energy of
about 10.6 GeV. In particular, we report the results on $e^+e^-$ annihilation
into six- and seven-pion final states. The study of the very rich dynamics of
these processes can help to understand the difference seen between the QCD
prediction and the sum of exclusive cross sections in the energy region around
2 GeV, thus improving the precision on the total hadronic cross section and of
the $g-2$ calculation.
  Additionally, we report the results on a dedicated study to shed light on the
resonant states production in the energy region around 2.2 GeV, which is
presently rather unclear. We measure the reaction $e^+e^-\to K_SK_L$ with data
collected with the $BABAR$ detector and analyse these data in conjunction with
published BESIII data on $e^+e^-\to K^+K^-$ and $BABAR$ data on $e^+e^-\to
K^+K^-$, $\pi^+\pi^-$, $\pi^+\pi^-\eta$, $\pi^+\pi^-\omega$. This study
supports the existence of an isovector resonance $\rho(2230)$ consistent with

incorporating the long-distance structured information captured by dependency

captured by the dependency trees may complement each other. However, existing
approaches largely focused on stacking the LSTM and graph neural networks such
as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for building improved NER models, where
the exact interaction mechanism between the two types of features is not very
clear, and the performance gain does not appear to be significant. In this
work, we propose a simple and robust solution to incorporate both types of
features with our Synergized-LSTM (Syn-LSTM), which clearly captures how the
two types of features interact. We conduct extensive experiments on several
standard datasets across four languages. The results demonstrate that the
proposed model achieves better performance than previous approaches while
requiring fewer parameters. Our further analysis demonstrates that our model

a new operating model for an integrated EV-grid system that incorporates a set

news assume to have enough propagation information for large labeled tweets --
which may not be an ideal setting for cases like COVID-19 where both aspects
are largely absent. In this work, we present ENDEMIC, a novel early detection
model which leverages exogenous and endogenous signals related to tweets, while

validate early detection. We build a heterogeneous graph with
follower-followee, user-tweet, and tweet-retweet connections and train a graph
embedding model to aggregate propagation information. Graph embeddings and
contextual features constitute endogenous, while time-relative web-scraped
information constitutes exogenous signals. ENDEMIC is trained in a
semi-supervised fashion, overcoming the challenge of limited labeled data. We
propose a co-attention mechanism to fuse signal representations optimally.
Experimental results on ECTF, PolitiFact, and GossipCop show that ENDEMIC is
highly reliable in detecting early fake tweets, outperforming nine

inclusions are bone fragments in meat products, plastic and metal debris in
fish, fruit infestations. This article presents a processing methodology for
unsupervised foreign object detection based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry

the food product and enhance contrast where the foreign object is present. In
this way, the segmentation of the foreign object is more robust to noise and
lack of contrast. The proposed methodology was applied to a dataset of 488
samples of meat products. The samples were acquired from a conveyor belt in a
food processing factory. Approximately 60\% of the samples contain foreign
objects of different types and sizes, while the rest of the samples are void of
foreign objects. The results show that samples without foreign objects are

perform sediment transport laboratory experiments in a closed-circuit wind

show that Martian conditions belong to a previously unexplored saltation
regime. The threshold wind speed required to initiate saltation is only
quantitatively predicted by state-of-the art models up to a density ratio

is continuously observed on the granular bed over the whole pressure range
investigated, display a characteristic wavelength and propagation velocity
essentially independent of pressure. A comparison of these findings with
existing models suggests that sediment transport at low Reynolds number but
high grain-to-fluid density ratio may be dominated by collective effects
associated with grain inertia in the granular collisional layer.

paper, we propose the Dual-Octave Convolution (Dual-OctConv), which is capable
of learning multi-scale spatial-frequency features from both real and imaginary
components, for fast parallel MR image reconstruction. By reformulating the
complex operations using octave convolutions, our model shows a strong ability
to capture richer representations of MR images, while at the same time greatly
reducing the spatial redundancy. More specifically, the input feature maps and
convolutional kernels are first split into two components (i.e., real and
imaginary), which are then divided into four groups according to their spatial
frequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intra-group information updating
and inter-group information exchange to aggregate the contextual information
across different groups. Our framework provides two appealing benefits: (i) it
encourages interactions between real and imaginary components at various
spatial frequencies to achieve richer representational capacity, and (ii) it
enlarges the receptive field by learning multiple spatial-frequency features of
both the real and imaginary components. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed model on the acceleration of multi-coil MR image reconstruction.
Extensive experiments are conducted on an {in vivo} knee dataset under
different undersampling patterns and acceleration factors. The experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our model in accelerated parallel MR

likely to be affected by tidal dissipation in their host star. To get a
complete picture of the evolution of star-planet systems one needs to consider
the impact of tides within both stellar radiative and convective zones. We aim
to provide a general formalism to assess tidal dissipation in stellar radiative
zones for all spectral types, allowing for the study of the dynamics of a given
system throughout stellar evolution. We investigate the influence of stellar
structure and evolution on tidal dissipation in the radiative core of low-mass
stars. From the study of adiabatic oscillations throughout the star, we compute
the energy flux transported by progressive internal gravity waves and the
induced tidal torque. We then study the influence of stellar structure and
evolution on tidal dissipation of solar-type stars from the pre-main sequence
(PMS) to the red giant branch (RGB). For a given star-planet system, tidal
dissipation reaches a maximum value on the pre-main sequence for all stellar
masses. On the main sequence (MS), it decreases to become almost constant. The
dissipation is then several orders of magnitude smaller for F-type stars than
for G and K-type stars. During the Sub-Giant phase and the RGB, tidal
dissipation increases by several orders of magnitude, along with the expansion
of the stellar envelope. We show that the dissipation of the dynamical tide in
the convective zone dominates the evolution of the system during most of the
PMS and the beginning of the main sequence. Tidal dissipation in the radiative
zone then becomes the strongest contribution during the Sub-Giant phase and the
RGB. We also find that the dissipation of a metal-poor star is stronger than
the dissipation of a metal-rich star during the PMS, the Sub-Giant phase and
the RGB.

  to contact",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When a volatile drop impacts on a superheated solid, air drainage and vapor
generation conspire to create an intermediate gas layer that delays or even
prevents contact between the liquid and the solid. In this article, we use
high-speed synchronized reflection interference and total internal reflection
imaging to measure the short-time dynamics of the intermediate gas film and to
probe the transition between levitation and contact. We observe that the
substrate temperature strongly affects the vertical position of the liquid-gas
interface and that the dynamic Leidenfrost transition is influenced by both air
and vapor drainage (\emph{i.e}, gas drainage), and evaporation, the later
giving rise to hitherto unreported vertical oscillations of the gas film that
can trigger liquid-solid contact. We first derive scaling relations for the
height of the gas film trapped under the drop's centerline, called the dimple
height, and the minimum film thickness at short times. The former is set by a
competition between gas drainage and liquid inertia, similarly as for
isothermal impacts, while the later strongly depends on the vapor production.
The gas pressure, at the location where the minimum thickness is reached, is
determined by liquid inertia and vapor production and ultimately balanced by
the increasing interfacial curvature, determining the minimum thickness. We
show that, in the low impact velocity limit, the transient stability of the
draining gas film remarkably makes dynamic levitation less demanding than
static levitation. We characterise the vertical gas film oscillations by
measuring their frequency and monitoring their occurrence in the parameter
space spanned by surface temperature and impact velocity. Finally, we model the
occurrence of these oscillations and account for their frequency through an
hydrodynamic mechanism.

density profiles for satellite galaxies as a function of the projected
distance, $r_p$, to isolated central galaxies (ICGs) selected from SDSS/DR7
spectroscopic galaxies at $z\sim0.1$. By stacking HSC images, we also measure
the projected stellar mass density profiles for ICGs and their stellar halos.
The total mass distributions are further measured from HSC weak lensing
signals. ICGs dominate within $\sim$0.15 times the halo virial radius
($0.15R_{200}$). The stellar mass versus total mass fractions drop with the
increase in $r_p$ up to $\sim0.15R_{200}$, beyond which they are less than 1\%
while stay almost constant, indicating the radial distribution of satellites
trace dark matter. The total stellar mass in satellites is proportional to the
virial mass of the host halo, $M_{200}$, for ICGs more massive than
$10^{10.5}M_\odot$, i.e., $M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}} \propto M_{200}$, whereas the
relation between the stellar mass of ICGs $+$ stellar halos and $M_{200}$ is
close to $M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG+diffuse}}\propto M_{200}^{1/2}$. Below
$10^{10.5}M_\odot$, the change in $M_{200}$ is much slower with the decrease in
$M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG+diffuse}}$. At fixed stellar mass, red ICGs are hosted by
more massive dark matter halos and have more satellites. At
$M_{200}\sim10^{12.7}M_\odot$, both $M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}$ and the fraction of
stellar mass in satellites versus total stellar mass, $f_\mathrm{sat}$, tend to
be slightly higher around blue ICGs, perhaps implying the late formation of
blue galaxies. $f_\mathrm{sat}$ increases with the increase in both
$M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG+diffuse}}$ and $M_{200}$, and scales more linearly with
$M_{200}$. We provide best-fitting formulas for these scaling relations and for
red and blue ICGs separately.

We can use them to model binary relations, but also to model groups of
entities, as well as the intersections between these groups or the contained
subgroups. In previous work, we explored the usage of hypergraphs as an
indexing data structure, in particular one that was capable of seamlessly
integrating text, entities and their relations to support entity-oriented
search tasks. As more information is added to the hypergraph, however, it not
only increases in size, but it also becomes denser, making the task of
efficiently ranking nodes or hyperedges more complex. Random walks can
effectively capture network structure, without compromising performance, or at
least providing a tunable balance between efficiency and effectiveness, within
a nondeterministic universe. For a higher effectiveness, a higher number of
random walks is usually required, which often results in lower efficiency.
Inspired by von Neumann and the neuron in the brain, we propose and study the
usage of node and hyperedge fatigue as a way to temporarily constrict random
walks during keyword-based ad hoc retrieval. We found that we were able to
improve search time by a factor of 32, but also worsen MAP by a factor of 8.
Moreover, by distinguishing between fatigue in nodes and hyperedges, we are
able to find that, for hyperedge ranking tasks, we consistently obtained lower
MAP scores when increasing fatigue for nodes. On the other hand, the overall
impact of hyperedge fatigue was slightly positive, although it also slightly
worsened efficiency.

synthesis obtain clear progress on multi-view stereo (MVS). However, existing
methods rely on the assumption that the corresponding points among different
views share the same color, which may not always be true in practice. This may
lead to unreliable self-supervised signal and harm the final reconstruction
performance. To address the issue, we propose a framework integrated with more
reliable supervision guided by semantic co-segmentation and data-augmentation.
Specially, we excavate mutual semantic from multi-view images to guide the
semantic consistency. And we devise effective data-augmentation mechanism which
ensures the transformation robustness by treating the prediction of regular
samples as pseudo ground truth to regularize the prediction of augmented
samples. Experimental results on DTU dataset show that our proposed methods
achieve the state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, and even
compete on par with supervised methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments on
Tanks&Temples dataset demonstrate the effective generalization ability of the
proposed method.

the frequency distribution using a double log function. We then propose a
variety of other improvements, provide top lists of the most significant CWEs

a content image. Currently, optimization-based methods have achieved great
stylization quality, but expensive time cost restricts their practical
applications. Meanwhile, feed-forward methods still fail to synthesize complex
style, especially when holistic global and local patterns exist. Inspired by
the common painting process of drawing a draft and revising the details, we
introduce a novel feed-forward method named Laplacian Pyramid Network
(LapStyle). LapStyle first transfers global style patterns in low-resolution
via a Drafting Network. It then revises the local details in high-resolution
via a Revision Network, which hallucinates a residual image according to the
draft and the image textures extracted by Laplacian filtering. Higher
resolution details can be easily generated by stacking Revision Networks with
multiple Laplacian pyramid levels. The final stylized image is obtained by
aggregating outputs of all pyramid levels. %We also introduce a patch
discriminator to better learn local patterns adversarially. Experiments
demonstrate that our method can synthesize high quality stylized images in real
time, where holistic style patterns are properly transferred.

ASR architectures. We investigate the effect of varying pre-processing, the

internal language model subtraction for the first time, resulting in up to 38%
relative improvement. We compare the AED results to a state-of-the-art hybrid

the Bernstein-gamma functions are applicable in different settings especially
through their asymptotic behaviour in the complex plane. As an application we
have derived the asymptotic of the density and its derivatives for all

neural networks which can be well applied on edge devices for computer vision
tasks. However, almost all top-performing knowledge distillation methods need
to access the original training data, which usually has a huge size and is
often unavailable. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel data-free
approach in this paper, named Dual Discriminator Adversarial Distillation
(DDAD) to distill a neural network without any training data or meta-data. To
be specific, we use a generator to create samples through dual discriminator
adversarial distillation, which mimics the original training data. The
generator not only uses the pre-trained teacher's intrinsic statistics in
existing batch normalization layers but also obtains the maximum discrepancy
from the student model. Then the generated samples are used to train the
compact student network under the supervision of the teacher. The proposed
method obtains an efficient student network which closely approximates its
teacher network, despite using no original training data. Extensive experiments
are conducted to to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Caltech101 datasets for classification tasks. Moreover,
we extend our method to semantic segmentation tasks on several public datasets
such as CamVid and NYUv2. All experiments show that our method outperforms all

clusters (z<0.05), identified through 120-168 MHz radio continuum from the
LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). From a parent sample of 29 X-ray-detected
SDSS galaxy clusters and their spectroscopic members, we visually identify 95
star-forming, LoTSS jellyfish galaxies with 144 MHz radio tails. Star formation
rates (SFRs) and stellar masses are obtained for all galaxies from SED fits.
For each jellyfish galaxy we determine the tail orientation with respect to the
cluster centre and quantify the prominence of the radio tails with the 144 MHz
shape asymmetry. After carefully accounting for redshift-dependent selection
effects, we find that the frequency of jellyfish galaxies is relatively
constant from cluster to cluster. LoTSS jellyfish galaxies are preferentially
found at small clustercentric radius and large velocity offsets within their
host clusters and have radio tails that are oriented away from the cluster
centre. These galaxies also show enhanced star formation, relative to both
'normal' cluster galaxies and isolated field galaxies, but generally fall
within the scatter of the L144MHz - SFR relation. The properties of the LoTSS
jellyfish galaxies identified in this work are fully consistent with
expectations from ram pressure stripping. This large sample of jellyfish
galaxies will be valuable for further constraining ram pressure stripping and
star formation quenching in nearby galaxy clusters. We show that LOFAR is a
powerful instrument for identifying ram pressure stripped galaxies across
extremely wide fields. Moving forward we will push the search for jellyfish
galaxies beyond this initial cluster sample, including a comprehensive survey
of the galaxy group regime.

spatially extended line emission at two additional sites in the field of view

characters. In particular, with the focus on the transport mechanisms, we
uncover that their combination exhibits dichotomic effects. On the one hand,
the critical Zeeman field $B_c$, responsible for triggering the band-insulating

presence of the electronic interaction and quenched disorder. On the other

of the fermions, facilitating the onset of Mott or Anderson insulating phases.

channel address these challenges due to their linear switching and low noise.
ECRAMs using two-dimensional (2D) materials and metal oxides suffer from slow
ion kinetics, whereas organic ECRAMs enable high-speed operation but face
significant challenges towards on-chip integration due to poor temperature
stability of polymers. Here, we demonstrate ECRAMs using 2D titanium carbide
(Ti3C2Tx) MXene that combines the high speed of organics and the integration
compatibility of inorganic materials in a single high-performance device. Our
ECRAMs combine the speed, linearity, write noise, switching energy and
endurance metrics essential for parallel acceleration of ANNs, and importantly,
they are stable after heat treatment needed for back-end-of-line integration
with Si electronics. The high speed and performance of these ECRAMs introduces
MXenes, a large family of 2D carbides and nitrides with more than 30
compositions synthesized to date, as very promising candidates for devices
operating at the nexus of electrochemistry and electronics.

Previous studies have shown that the laboratory-scale friction is well
described by an empirical law stated in terms of the slip velocity and the
state variable. The state variable represents the detailed physicochemical
state of the sliding interface. Despite some theoretical attempts to derive
this friction law, there has been no unique equation for time evolution of the
state variable. Major equations known to date have their own merits and
drawbacks. To shed light on this problem from a new aspect, here we investigate
the feasibility of periodic motion without the help of radiation damping.
Assuming a patch on which the slip velocity is perturbed from the rest of the
sliding interface, we prove analytically that three major evolution laws fail
to reproduce stable periodic motion without radiation damping. Furthermore, we
propose two new evolution equations that can produce stable periodic motion
without radiation damping. These two equations are scrutinized from the
viewpoint of experimental validity and the relevance to slow earthquakes.

real-valued input into spike trains for processing with spiking neural
networks. The proposed method mimics the adaptive behaviour of retinal ganglion
cells and allows input neurons to adapt their response to changes in the
statistics of the input. Thus, rather than passively receiving values and
forwarding them to the hidden and output layers, the input layer acts as a
self-regulating filter which emphasises deviations from the average while
allowing the input neurons to become effectively desensitised to the average
itself. Another merit of the proposed method is that it requires only one input
neuron per variable, rather than an entire population of neurons as in the case
of the commonly used conversion method based on Gaussian receptive fields. In
addition, since the statistics of the input emerge naturally over time, it
becomes unnecessary to pre-process the data before feeding it to the network.
This enables spiking neural networks to process raw, non-normalised streaming
data. A proof-of-concept experiment is performed to demonstrate that the
proposed method operates as expected.

Experiments on several image classification benchmarks demonstrate that the
crossover operator is sufficiently robust to produce increasingly performant

postulating properties the lifted order should have. Well-known impossibility
results by Kannai and Peleg and by Barber\`a and Pattanaik tell us that some
desirable axioms - namely dominance and (strict) independence - are not jointly
satisfiable for any linear order on the objects if all non-empty sets of
objects are to be ordered. On the other hand, if not all non-empty sets of
objects are to be ordered, the axioms are jointly satisfiable for all linear
orders on the objects for some families of sets. Such families are very
important for applications as they allow for the use of lifted orders, for
example, in combinatorial voting. In this paper, we determine the computational
complexity of recognizing such families. We show that it is $\Pi_2^p$-complete

dominance and strict independence are jointly satisfiable for all linear orders
on the objects if the lifted order needs to be total. Furthermore, we show that

actor model in the following characteristics: (1) Concurrency: all actors
execute concurrently; (2) Asynchrony: an actor receives and sends messages
asynchronously; (3) Uniqueness: an actor has a unique name and the associate
unique mail box name; (4) Concentration: an actor focuses on the processing
messages, including some local computations, creations of some new actors, and
sending some messages to other actors; (5) Communication Dependency: the only
way of affecting an actor is sending a message to it; (6) Abstraction: except
for the receiving and sending message, and creating new actors, the local
computations are abstracted; (7) Persistence: an actor does not disappear after
processing a message. Truly concurrent process algebra has rich expressive
ability to model the above characteristics of actors, and more importantly,
they are models for true concurrency, Comparing with other models of actors,
the truly concurrent process algebra based model has the following advantages:
(1) The truly concurrent process algebra has rich expressive abilities to
describe almost all characteristics of actors, especially for asynchronous
communication, actor creation, recursion, abstraction, etc; (2) The truly
concurrent process algebra and actors are all models for true concurrency, and
have inborn intimacy; (3) The truly concurrent process algebra has a firm
semantics foundation and a powerful proof theory, the correctness of an actor
system can be proven easily.

clustering optimization model in which units are characterized by both

(2017) under the name of Connected Partitioning Problem, shows that the
combination of the two data types improves the clustering quality in comparison
with other methodologies. Nevertheless, the resulting optimization problem is
difficult to solve; only small-sized instances can be solved exactly,
large-sized instances require the application of heuristic algorithms. In this
paper we improve the exact and the heuristic algorithms previously proposed.
Here, we provide a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation, that
solves larger instances, but at the cost of using an exponential number of
variables. In order to limit the number of variables necessary to calculate the
optimum, the new ILP formulation is solved implementing a branch-and-price
algorithm. The resulting pricing problem is itself a new combinatorial model:
the Maximum-weighted Graph-Connected Single-Clique problem (MGCSC), that we
solve testing various Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations and
proposing a new fast ""random shrink"" heuristic. In this way, we are able to
improve the previous algorithms: The branch-and-price method outperforms the
computational times of the previous MILP algorithms and the new random shrink
heuristic, when applied to GCCP, is both faster and more accurate than the
previous heuristic methods. Moreover, the combination of column generation and
random shrink is itself a new MILP-relaxed matheuristic that can be applied to
large instances too. Its main advantage is that all heuristic local optima are
combined together in a restricted MILP, consisting in the application of the
exact branch-and-price method but solving heuristically the pricing problem.

framework for assessing hypergraph robustness and we characterize the critical

framework builds on the formulation of the random multiplex hypergraph ensemble

result in concrete consequences for instances to be classified in the
discrepancy zone, since the final decision will be based on the selected
classification pattern. Besides the arbitrary nature of the result, a bad
choice could have further negative consequences such as loss of opportunity or
lack of fairness. This paper proposes to address this question by analyzing the
prediction discrepancies in a pool of best-performing models trained on the
same data. A model-agnostic algorithm, DIG, is proposed to capture and explain
discrepancies locally, to enable the practitioner to make the best educated
decision when selecting a model by anticipating its potential undesired
consequences. All the code to reproduce the experiments is available.

modifications of the scalar and twist-2 gluon condensates, which are obtained
in the nuclear medium, from the medium change of a scalar dilaton field, $\chi$
within a chiral effective model. The in-medium masses of the bottomonium ground

observed to have more appreciable mass-shifts than the S-wave states. In the
present investigation, the effects of spin-mixing between 1S bottomonium
states, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\eta_b$ are taking into account in presence of an
external magnetic field. The contribution of magnetic fields are seen to be
dominant via spin-magnetic field interaction effects, which leads to an
appreciable rise and drop in the in-medium masses of the longitudinal component
of vector $1S$ state ($\Upsilon$) and pseudoscalar state ($\eta_b$)
respectively. For zero magnetic field, the effects of baryon density on the
bottomonium ground states in isospin asymmetric nuclear medium are observed to
be quite appreciable. These should have observable consequences for the
production of the open and hidden bottom meson states resulting from high
energy asymmetric nuclear collisions in facilities which probe high density
baryonic matter. There is observed to be large contributions to the masses of
the longitudinal component of the vector bottomonium state, $\Upsilon (1S)$ and
pesudoscalar state $\eta_b$ in strong magnetic fields.

accounting for initial and final state ion--ion interactions, and nuclear
matrix elements. A broad space is given to the construction of nuclear DSCE
response functions on the basis of polarization propagator theory. The nuclear
response tensors resemble the nuclear matrix elements of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay
in structure but contain in general a considerable more complex multipole and
spin structure. The QRPA theory is used to derive explicit expressions for
nuclear matrix elements (NMEs). The differences between the NME of the first

two-nucleon system. To do so we calculate ground-state properties of the
$^{16}$O nucleus in the Hartree--Fock approach in a basis made up of plane
waves confined in a cube. We find that regularization cutoff effects manifest
themselves in two distinct ways: a strong sensitivity to the the counter-terms
in attractive singular partial waves (related to the sign of the corresponding
low-energy constant) and to the correction for spurious deeply bound states
(for high enough cutoffs). In fact the latter happens to deprive the
Hartree--Fock approximation of yielding bound solutions in nuclei. We conclude
that, when using a leading-order chiral potential in the Nogga--Timmermans--van
Kolck's power counting (with a regularization cutoff higher than the nucleon
mass), one cannot produce a selfconsistent mean field free of spurious
bound-state effects that can serve as a reference state for beyond-mean-field

contact potential, one can at best incorporate in the mean-field solution a
partial correction for spurious bound states. Then the remaining correction has
to be added to the residual interaction in a treatment beyond the Hartree--Fock

phase-cohesiveness in two types of networks is studied. First, we consider
oscillators coupled with periodic odd functions over underlying undirected
graphs subject to both multiplicative and additive stochastic uncertainties. We
prove stochastic phase-cohesiveness of the network with respect to two specific
sets by deriving sufficient coupling conditions. We show the dependency of
these conditions on the size of the mean values of additive and multiplicative
uncertainties, as well as the sign of the mean values of multiplicative
uncertainties. Furthermore, we discuss the results under a relaxation of the
odd property of the coupling function. Second, we study an uncertain network in
which the multiplicative uncertainties are governed by the Bernoulli process
representing the well-known Erdos-Renyi network. We assume constant exogenous
frequencies and derive sufficient conditions for achieving both stochastic
phase-cohesive and phase-locked solutions, i.e., the stochastic
phase-cohesiveness with respect to the origin. For the latter case, where
identical exogenous frequencies are assumed, we prove that any positive
probability of connection will lead to phase-locking.

With access to multiple microphones, prior studies have attempted to improve
the noise robustness of VAD by creating multi-channel VAD (MVAD) methods.
However, MVAD is relatively new compared to single-channel VAD (SVAD), which
has been thoroughly developed in the past. It might therefore be advantageous
to improve SVAD methods with pre-processing to obtain superior VAD, which is
under-explored. This paper improves SVAD through two pre-processing methods, a
beamformer and a spatial target speaker detector. The spatial detector sets
signal frames to zero when no potential speaker is present within a target
direction. The detector may be implemented as a filter, meaning the input
signal for the SVAD is filtered according to the detector's output; or it may
be implemented as a spatial VAD to be combined with the SVAD output. The
evaluation is made on a noisy reverberant speech database, with clean speech
from the Aurora 2 database and with white and babble noise. The results show
that SVAD algorithms are significantly improved by the presented pre-processing
methods, especially the spatial detector, across all signal-to-noise ratios.
The SVAD algorithms with pre-processing significantly outperform a baseline
MVAD in challenging noise conditions.

regularizes these representations differently to better constrain the knowledge
required to generalize. We also introduce two simple auxiliary tasks: next
sentence prediction and task-id prediction, for learning better generic and
specific representation spaces. Experiments conducted on large-scale benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in continual text classification
tasks with various sequences and lengths over state-of-the-art baselines. We

in software engineering practice. In reality, the CI/CD pipeline execution is
not yet reliably continuous because it is often interrupted by Docker build
failures. However, the existing trial-and-error practice to detect faults is
time-consuming. To timely detect Dockerfile faults, we propose a context-based
pre-build analysis approach, named DockerMock, through mocking the execution of
common Dockerfile instructions. A Dockerfile fault is declared when an
instruction conflicts with the approximated and accumulated running context. By
explicitly keeping track of whether the context is fuzzy, DockerMock strikes a
good balance of detection precision and recall. We evaluated DockerMock with 53
faults in 41 Dockerfiles from open source projects on GitHub and 130 faults in
105 Dockerfiles from student course projects. On average, DockerMock detected
68.0% Dockerfile faults in these two datasets. While baseline hadolint detected
6.5%, and baseline BuildKit detected 60.5% without instruction execution. In
the GitHub dataset, DockerMock reduces the number of builds to 47,
outperforming that of hadolint (73) and BuildKit (74).

cost of running cloud applications compared to Infrastructure-as-a-Service
(IaaS). FaaS follows a serverless 'pay-as-you-go' computing model; it comes at
a higher cost per unit of execution time but typically application functions
experience lower provisioning time (startup delay). IaaS requires the
provisioning of Virtual Machines, which typically suffer from longer cold-start
delays that cause higher queuing delays and higher request drop rates. We
present LIBRA, a balanced (hybrid) approach that leverages both VM-based and
serverless resources to efficiently manage cloud resources for the
applications. LIBRA closely monitors the application demand and provisions
appropriate VM and serverless resources such that the running cost is minimized
and Service-Level Agreements are met. Unlike state of the art, LIBRA not only
hides VM cold-start delays, and hence reduces response time, by leveraging
serverless, but also directs a low-rate bursty portion of the demand to
serverless where it would be less costly than spinning up new VMs. We evaluate
LIBRA on real traces in a simulated environment as well as on the AWS
commercial cloud. Our results show that LIBRA outperforms other
resource-provisioning policies, including a recent hybrid approach - LIBRA
achieves more than 85% reduction in SLA violations and up to 53% cost savings.

seen unprecedented success at semantic segmentation tasks, they are known to
struggle on out-of-distribution data. Markov random fields (MRFs) on the other
hand, encode simpler distributions over labels that, although less flexible
than UNets, are less prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose to fuse
both strategies by computing the product of distributions of a UNet and an MRF.
As this product is intractable, we solve for an approximate distribution using
an iterative mean-field approach. The resulting MRF-UNet is trained jointly by
back-propagation. Compared to other works using conditional random fields
(CRFs), the MRF has no dependency on the imaging data, which should allow for
less over-fitting. We show on 3D neuroimaging data that this novel network
improves generalisation to out-of-distribution samples. Furthermore, it allows
the overall number of parameters to be reduced while preserving high accuracy.
These results suggest that a classic MRF smoothness prior can allow for less
over-fitting when principally integrated into a CNN model. Our implementation

networks. So far their use has mostly been implicit or seemingly coincidental.
  We undertake a systematic study of the role that symmetry plays. In
particular, we clarify how symmetry interacts with the learning algorithm. The
key ingredient in our study is played by Noether's celebrated theorem which,
informally speaking, states that symmetry leads to conserved quantities (e.g.,
conservation of energy or conservation of momentum). In the realm of neural
networks under gradient descent, model symmetries imply restrictions on the
gradient path. E.g., we show that symmetry of activation functions leads to
boundedness of weight matrices, for the specific case of linear activations it
leads to balance equations of consecutive layers, data augmentation leads to
gradient paths that have ""momentum""-type restrictions, and time symmetry leads
to a version of the Neural Tangent Kernel.
  Symmetry alone does not specify the optimization path, but the more
symmetries are contained in the model the more restrictions are imposed on the
path. Since symmetry also implies over-parametrization, this in effect implies
that some part of this over-parametrization is cancelled out by the existence
of the conserved quantities.
  Symmetry can therefore be thought of as one further important tool in
understanding the performance of neural networks under gradient descent.

crises, when rapid identification of effective treatments is critical.
Leveraging short-term surrogates in real-world data (RWD) can guide
policymakers evaluating new treatments. In this paper, we develop novel
estimators for the proportion of treatment effect (PTE) on the true outcome
explained by a surrogate in RWD settings. We propose inverse probability
weighted and doubly robust (DR) estimators of an optimal transformation of the
surrogate and PTE by semi-nonparametrically modeling the relationship between
the true outcome and surrogate given baseline covariates. We show that our
estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and the DR estimator is
consistent when either the propensity score model or outcome regression model
is correctly specified. We compare our proposed estimators to existing
estimators and show a reduction in bias and gains in efficiency through
simulations. We illustrate the utility of our method in obtaining an
interpretable PTE by conducting a cross-trial comparison of two biologic
therapies for ulcerative colitis.

data that is often expensive to obtain or not available for many tasks. Weak
supervision in the form of domain-specific rules has been shown to be useful in
such settings to automatically generate weakly labeled training data. However,
learning with weak rules is challenging due to their inherent heuristic and
noisy nature. An additional challenge is rule coverage and overlap, where prior
work on weak supervision only considers instances that are covered by weak
rules, thus leaving valuable unlabeled data behind.
  In this work, we develop a weak supervision framework (ASTRA) that leverages
all the available data for a given task. To this end, we leverage task-specific
unlabeled data through self-training with a model (student) that considers
contextualized representations and predicts pseudo-labels for instances that
may not be covered by weak rules. We further develop a rule attention network
(teacher) that learns how to aggregate student pseudo-labels with weak rule
labels, conditioned on their fidelity and the underlying context of an
instance. Finally, we construct a semi-supervised learning objective for
end-to-end training with unlabeled data, domain-specific rules, and a small
amount of labeled data. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets for
text classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with
significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

Adversarial Networks (GANs) has gone from somewhat reasonable to almost perfect
largely by increasing the complexity of the networks, e.g., adding layers,
intermediate latent spaces, style-transfer parameters, etc. This trajectory has
led many of the state-of-the-art GANs to be inaccessibly large, disengaging
many without large computational resources. Recognizing this, we explore a
method for squeezing additional performance from existing, low-complexity GANs.
Formally, we present an unsupervised method to find a direction in the latent
space that aligns with improved photo-realism. Our approach leaves the network
unchanged while enhancing the fidelity of the generated image. We use a simple
generator inversion to find the direction in the latent space that results in
the smallest change in the image space. Leveraging the learned structure of the
latent space, we find moving in this direction corrects many image artifacts
and brings the image into greater realism. We verify our findings qualitatively
and quantitatively, showing an improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
exists along our trajectory which surpasses the original GAN and other
approaches including a supervised method. We expand further and provide an
optimization method to automatically select latent vectors along the path that
balance the variation and realism of samples. We apply our method to several
diverse datasets and three architectures of varying complexity to illustrate
the generalizability of our approach. By expanding the utility of
low-complexity and existing networks, we hope to encourage the democratization

multimedia and computer vision communities. However, most of the existing
image-based virtual try-on methods directly put both person and the in-shop
clothing representations together, without considering the mutual correlation
between them. What is more, the long-range information, which is crucial for
generating globally consistent results, is also hard to be established via the
regular convolution operation. To alleviate these two problems, in this paper
we propose a novel two-stage Cloth Interactive Transformer (CIT) for virtual
try-on. In the first stage, we design a CIT matching block, aiming to perform a
learnable thin-plate spline transformation that can capture more reasonable
long-range relation. As a result, the warped in-shop clothing looks more
natural. In the second stage, we propose a novel CIT reasoning block for
establishing the global mutual interactive dependence. Based on this mutual
dependence, the significant region within the input data can be highlighted,
and consequently, the try-on results can become more realistic. Extensive
experiments on a public fashion dataset demonstrate that our CIT can achieve
the new state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both qualitatively and
quantitatively. The source code and trained models are available at

query processing. The new paradigm of ""learned index"" has significantly changed
the way of designing index structures in DBMS. The key insight is that indexes
could be regarded as learned models that predict the position of a lookup key
in the dataset. While such studies show promising results in both lookup time
and index size, they cannot efficiently support update operations. Although
recent studies have proposed some preliminary approaches to support update,
they are at the cost of scarifying the lookup performance as they suffer from
the overheads brought by imprecise predictions in the leaf nodes.
  In this paper, we propose LIPP, a brand new framework of learned index to
address such issues. Similar with state-of-the-art learned index structures,
LIPP is able to support all kinds of index operations, namely lookup query,
range query, insert, delete, update and bulkload. Meanwhile, we overcome the
limitations of previous studies by properly extending the tree structure when
dealing with update operations so as to eliminate the deviation of location
predicted by the models in the leaf nodes. Moreover, we further propose a
dynamic adjustment strategy to ensure that the height of the tree index is
tightly bounded and provide comprehensive theoretical analysis to illustrate
it. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on several real-life and
synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving by up to 4x for a broader

self-consistently coupled to its environment via the sampling of reduced
density matrices. We analyze the viability of current generation quantum
devices to provide the required fidelity of these objects for a robust and
efficient optimization of this subspace. We show that with a simple error
mitigation strategy and optimization of compact tensor product bases to
minimize the number of terms to sample, these self-consistent algorithms are
indeed highly robust, even in the presence of significant noises on quantum
hardware. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of these density matrices for the
sampling of non-energetic properties, including dipole moments and Fermi liquid

prospect for routine self-consistency to improve the choice of correlated
subspaces in hybrid quantum-classical approaches to electronic structure for
large systems in this multiscale fashion.

remains a fundamental security flaw. Via attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown,
an attacker can trick a victim, in an otherwise entirely correct program, into
leaking its secrets through the effects of misspeculated execution, in a way
that is entirely invisible to the programmer's model. This has serious
implications for application sandboxing and inter-process communication.
  Designing efficient mitigations, that preserve the performance of
out-of-order execution, has been a challenge. The speculation-hiding techniques
in the literature have been shown to not close such channels comprehensively,
allowing adversaries to redesign attacks. Strong, precise guarantees are
necessary, but at the same time mitigations must achieve high performance to be
adopted. We present Strictness Ordering, a new constraint system that shows how
we can comprehensively eliminate transient side channel attacks, while still
allowing complex speculation and data forwarding between speculative
instructions. We then present GhostMinion, a cache modification built using a
variety of new techniques designed to provide Strictness Order at only 2.5%
overhead.

to monitor the performance of heart segmentation models in the absence of

allows flagging suspicious results. We propose two different types of quality
measures, a global score and a pixel-wise map. We demonstrate their use by
reproducing the final rankings of a cardiac segmentation challenge in the

Banach space contains an isomorphic copy of $\ell_1$ if and only if there

equivalent to the existence of an equivalent renorming with $L$-orthogonals in

every $L$-orthogonal sequence contains $L$-orthogonal elements in its
weak*-closure. We provide an affirmative answer whenever the ambient space has
small density character. Nevertheless, we show that, surprisingly, the general
answer is independent of the usual axioms of set theory. We also prove that,
even though the set of $L$-orthogonals is not a vector space, this set contains
infinite-dimensional Banach spaces when the surrounding space is separable.

revived as an important alternative to the established, density-based methods
because it can represent the microstructural design at a much finer
length-scale than the computational grid. The optimal microstructure for a
single load case is an orthogonal rank-3 laminate. A rank-3 laminate can be
described in terms of frame fields, which are also an important tool for mesh
generation in both 2D and 3D.
  We propose a method for generating multi-laminar structures from frame
fields. Rather than relying on integrative approaches that find a
parametrization based on the frame field, we find stream surfaces, represented
as point clouds aligned with frame vectors, and we solve an optimization
problem to find well-spaced collections of such stream surfaces. The stream
surface tracing is unaffected by the presence of singularities outside the
region of interest. Neither stream surface tracing nor selecting well-spaced
surface rely on combed frame fields.
  In addition to stream surface tracing and selection, we provide two methods
for generating structures from stream surface collections. One of these methods
produces volumetric solids by summing basis functions associated with each
point of the stream surface collection. The other method reinterprets point
sampled stream surfaces as a spatial twist continuum and produces a
hexahedralization by dualizing a graph representing the structure.
  We demonstrate our methods on several frame fields produced using the
homogenization approach for topology optimization, boundary-aligned, algebraic
frame fields, and frame fields computed from closed-form expressions.

demonstrate that high entropy oxides present an unexplored route to designing
quantum materials in which the presence of strong local compositional disorder

Heisenberg model is found to be sufficient to describe how compositionally
disordered systems can paradoxically host long-range magnetic uniformity and
demonstrates that balancing the populating elements based on their discrete
quantum parameters can be used to give continuous control over ordering types
and critical temperatures. Theory-guided experiments show that composite
exchange values derived from the complex mix of microstate interactions can be
used to design the required compositional parameters for a desired response.
These predicted materials are synthesized and found to possess an incipient
quantum critical point when magnetic ordering types are designed to be in
direct competition; this leads to highly controllable exchange bias sensitivity

Particularly, in the mobile games industry, the churn rate is often pronounced
due to the high competition and cost in customer acquisition; therefore, the
process of minimizing the churn rate is crucial. This needs churn prediction,
predicting users who will be churning within a given time period. Accurate
churn prediction can enable the businesses to devise and engage strategic
remediations to maintain a low churn rate. The paper presents our highly

of superconductivity and charge-density-wave (CDW) with many exotic properties.
Here, we report the detailed characterization of the CDW gap in high-quality
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals using high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. We find that the CDW gap is strongly momentum
dependent. While gapped around the $M$ point, the electronic states remain
gapless around the $\Gamma$ point and along the $\Gamma$-$K$ direction. Such
momentum dependence indicates that the CDW is driven by the scattering of
electrons between neighboring $M$ points, where the band structure hosts
multiple saddle points and the density of state diverges near the Fermi level.
Our observations of the partially gapped Fermi surface and strongly
momentum-dependent CDW gap not only provide a foundation for uncovering the
mechanism of CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but also shed light on the understanding of
how the CDW coexists with superconductivity in this topological Kagome
superconductor.

non-terminating computations. This is a strong limitation as it makes very
difficult to reason about properties involving infinite computations, such as
type soundness, which cannot even be expressed. We show that this issue is only
apparent: the distinction between stuck and diverging computations is implicit
in any big-step semantics and it just needs to be uncovered. To achieve this
goal, we develop a systematic study of big-step semantics: we introduce an
abstract definition of what a big-step semantics is, we define a notion of
computation by formalising the evaluation algorithm implicitly associated with
any big-step semantics, and we show how to canonically extend a big-step
semantics to characterise stuck and diverging computations. Building on these
notions, we describe a general proof technique to show that a predicate is
sound, that is, it prevents stuck computation, with respect to a big-step
semantics. One needs to check three properties relating the predicate and the
semantics and, if they hold, the predicate is sound. The extended semantics are
essential to establish this meta-logical result, but are of no concerns to the
user, who only needs to prove the three properties of the initial big-step
semantics. Finally, we illustrate the technique by several examples, showing
that it is applicable also in cases where subject reduction does not hold,
hence the standard technique for small-step semantics cannot be used.

have been conducted to study the climate of such planets, using in particular
3-D Global Climate Models (GCM). One of the biggest challenges in simulating
such an extreme environment is to properly represent the effects of sub-grid
convection. Most GCMs use either a simplistic convective-adjustment
parametrization or sophisticated (e.g., mass flux scheme) Earth-tuned
parametrizations. One way to improve the representation of convection is to
study convection using Convection Resolving numerical Models (CRMs), with an
fine spatial resolution . In this study, we developed a CRM coupling the
non-hydrostatic dynamical core WRF with the radiative transfer and
cloud/precipitation models of the LMD-Generic climate model to study convection
and clouds on tidally-locked planets, with a focus on Proxima b. Simulations
were performed for a set of 3 surface temperatures (corresponding to three
different incident fluxes) and 2 rotation rates, assuming an Earth-like
atmosphere. The main result of our study is that while we recover the
prediction of GCMs that (low-altitude) cloud albedo increases with increasing
stellar flux, the cloud feedback is much weaker due to transient aggregation of
convection leading to low partial cloud cover.

wildtype SARS-CoV-2 variants.
  Design: Retrospective cohort, analysed using stratified Cox regression.
  Setting: Community-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked
with hospitalisation data.
  Participants: 839,278 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, of whom 36,233
had been hospitalised within 14 days, tested between 23rd November 2020 and
31st January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay
that enables assessment of S-gene target failure (SGTF). SGTF is a proxy test
for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age, sex, ethnicity,
deprivation, region of residence, and date of positive test.
  Main outcome measures: Hospitalisation between 1 and 14 days after the first
positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
  Results: 27,710 of 592,409 SGTF patients (4.7%) and 8,523 of 246,869 non-SGTF
patients (3.5%) had been hospitalised within 1-14 days. The stratum-adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) of hospitalisation was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]
1.47 to 1.57) for COVID-19 patients infected with SGTF variants, compared to
those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age
(P<0.001), with HRs of 0.93-1.21 for SGTF compared to non-SGTF patients below
age 20 years, 1.29 in those aged 20-29, and 1.45-1.65 in age groups 30 years or
older.
  Conclusions: The results suggest that the risk of hospitalisation is higher
for individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared to wildtype
SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting a more severe disease. The higher severity may be
specific to adults above the age of 30.

the [O I] 6300 and [S II] 6716, 6731 LV narrow component (NC) is offset along
the same position angle (PA) as the HVC but with a different velocity gradient
than the jet, in that displacement from the stellar position along the rotation
axis is decreasing with increasing velocity. From the LVC NC PA and velocity
gradient, it is inferred that the NC is tracing a wide angled MHD disk wind. A
photoevaporative wind is ruled out. This is supported by a comparison with a
previous spectro-astrometric study of the CO fundamental line. The decrease in
offset with increasing velocity is interpreted as tracing an increase in the

to the non-linear nature of the theories (which is analogous to the extra
degree of freedom in $f(R)$ theories), and the sector that manifestly shows the
dynamics arising from the breaking of local symmetries. This frame is then used
to study the theories around the Minkowski background, and we show how all the
non-linear extensions share the same quadratic action around Minkowski. As a
matter of fact, we find that the gauge symmetries that are lost by going to the
non-linear generalisations of the teleparallel General Relativity equivalents
arise as accidental symmetries in the linear theory around Minkowski.
Remarkably, we also find that the conformal mode can be absorbed into a Weyl
rescaling of the metric at this order and, consequently, it disappears from the
linear spectrum so only the usual massless spin 2 perturbation propagates.
These findings unify in a common framework the known fact that no additional
modes propagate on Minkowski backgrounds, and we can trace it back to the
existence of accidental gauge symmetries of such a background.

subjectivity in labels is a fundamental problem in medical imaging analysis. To
address this challenge, we introduce auto-decoded deep latent embeddings
(ADDLE), which explicitly models the tendencies of each rater using an
auto-decoder framework. After a simple linear transformation, the latent
variables can be injected into any backbone at any and multiple points,
allowing the model to account for rater-specific effects on the diagnosis.
Importantly, ADDLE does not expect multiple raters per image in training,
meaning it can readily learn from data mined from hospital archives. Moreover,
the complexity of training ADDLE does not increase as more raters are added.
During inference each rater can be simulated and a 'mean' or 'greedy' virtual
rating can be produced. We test ADDLE on the problem of liver steatosis

clinical US diagnoses originating from 65 different raters. We evaluated

magnetic geometries in chemically peculiar (CP) stars, Zeeman Doppler mapping
(ZDM) has become the method of choice. Comparisons between abundance maps
obtained for CP stars and predictions from numerical simulations of atomic
diffusion have always proved unsatisfactory, with the blame routinely put on
theory. Expanding a previous study aimed at clarifying the question of the
uniqueness of ZDM maps, this paper inverts the roles between observational
modeling and time-dependent diffusion results, casting a cold eye on essential
assumptions and algorithms underlying ZDM, in particular the Tikhonov-style
regularization functionals, from 1D to 3D. We show that these have been
established solely for mathematical convenience, but that they in no way
reflect the physical reality in the atmospheres of magnetic CP stars.
Recognizing that the observed strong magnetic fields in most well-mapped stars
require the field geometry to be force-free, we demonstrate that many published
maps do not meet this condition. There follows a discussion of the frequent
changes in magnetic and abundance maps of well observed stars and a caveat
concerning the use of least squares deconvolution in ZDM analyses. It emerges
that because of the complexity and non-linearity of the field-dependent
chemical stratifications, Tikhonov based ZDM inversions cannot recover the true
abundance and magnetic geometries. As our findings additionally show, there is
no way to define a physically meaningful 3D regularization functional instead.
ZDM remains dysfunctional and does not provide any observational constraints
for the modeling of atomic diffusion.

main selection and routing operation. However efficient, this strategy is only
vaguely compatible with the way that attention is implemented in biological
brains: as a separate and unified network of attentional selection regions,

system that can improve the performance of standard convolutional networks,
with relatively few additional parameters. Each spatial position in each layer

strongly elliptic, these spaces are the solution spaces for the homogeneous
Dirichlet problem for $P$, leading to regularity results with a factor $x_n^\mu

sufficient to establish an integration by parts formula over $R^n_+$ for $P$

developed as a result of the need to understand the impact of Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS) on humans and vice versa. This paradigm shift from CPS to CPSS
was mainly attributed to the increasing use of sensor-enabled smart devices and
the tight link with the users. The concept of CPSS has been around for over a
decade and it has gained increasing attention over the past few years. The
evolution to incorporate human aspects in the CPS research has unlocked a
number of research challenges. Particularly human dynamics brings additional
complexity that is yet to be explored. The exploration to conceptualise the
notion of CPSS has been partially addressed in few scientific literatures.
Although its conceptualisation has always been use-case dependent. Thus, there
is a lack of generic view as most works focus on specific domains. Furthermore,
the systemic core and design principles linking it with the theory of systems
are loose. This work aims at addressing these issues by first exploring and
analysing scientific literature to understand the complete spectrum of CPSS
through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Thereby identifying the
state-of-the-art perspectives on CPSS regarding definitions, underlining
principles and application areas. Subsequently, based on the findings of the
SLR, we propose a domain-independent definition and a meta-model for CPSS,
grounded in the Theory of Systems. Finally, a discussion on feasible future
research directions is presented based on the systemic notion and the proposed
meta-models.

Covid-19 epidemic. But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand
well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by
their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they
taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some
quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the
well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a
pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple
and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff
between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming
a given number of phases for the epidemic and a desired tradeoff between health
and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of
each phase and the optimal severity level for each of them. The numerical
analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be
applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that
being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in
France would have led to 1.05 million infected people and a GDP loss of 231
billion euro instead of 6.88 million of infected and a loss of 241 billion
euro. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the
effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically,
whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health
impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been
more severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier. Due to the
natural tendency of people to deviate from the official rules, updating
measures every month over the whole epidemic episode seems to be more
appropriate.

using a relatively small and mixed dataset. Methods: we proposed a DNN to
perform lung segmentation and classification, stacking a segmentation module
(U-Net), an original intermediate module and a classification module
(DenseNet201). To evaluate generalization, we tested the DNN with an external
dataset (from distinct localities) and used Bayesian inference to estimate
probability distributions of performance metrics. Results: our DNN achieved

0.906. Bayesian inference indicated mean accuracy of 76.1% and [0.695, 0.826]

uses LRP and Brixia scores, we discovered that areas where radiologists found
strong Covid-19 symptoms are the most important for the stacked DNN
classification. External validation showed smaller accuracies than internal,
indicating difficulty in generalization, which is positively affected by

applications that require remote collection of data on environmental
conditions. In particular dense WSNs are emerging as an important sensing
platforms for the Internet of Things (IoT). WSNs are able to generate huge
volumes of raw data, which require network structuring and efficient
collaboration between nodes to ensure efficient transmission. In order to
reduce the amount of data carried in the network, data aggregation is used in
WSNs to define a policy of data fusion and compression. In this paper, we
investigate a model for data aggregation in a dense {WSN} with a single sink.
The model divides a circular coverage region centered at the sink into patches
which are intersections of sectors of concentric rings, and data in each patch
is aggregated at a single node before transmission. Nodes only communicate with
other nodes in the same sector. Based on these assumptions, we formulate a
linear programming problem to maximize system lifetime by minimizing the
maximum proportionate energy consumption over all nodes. Under a wide variety
of conditions, the optimal solution employs two transmissions mechanisms:
direct transmission, in which nodes send information directly to the sink; and
stepwise transmission, in which nodes transmit information to adjacent nodes.
An exact formula is given for the proportionate energy consumption rate of the
network. Asymptotic forms of this exact solution are also derived, and are
verified to agree with the linear programming solution. We investigate three
strategies for improving system lifetime: nonuniform energy and information
density; iterated compression; and modifications of rings. We conclude that
iterated compression has the biggest effect in increasing system lifetime.

engine thrusts (descent and ascent values for Altair), horizontal and vertical

scaling of erosion with respect to the various physical parameters (gravity,
grain size, gas velocity, gas density, grain density, etc.), and because they
provide a data set for benchmarking numerical flow codes. We have performed
experiments varying the physical parameters listed above (e.g., gravity was
varied in reduced gravity aircraft flights). In all these experiments, a
subsonic jet of gas impinges vertically on a bed of sand or lunar soil simulant
forming a localized scour hole beneath the jet. Videography captures the
erosion and scour hole formation processes, and analysis of these videos
post-test identifies the scaling of these processes. This has produced
important new insights into the physics of erosion. Based on these insights, we
have developed an erosion rate model that can be applied to generalized
situations, such as the erosion of soil beneath a horizontal gas flow on a
planetary surface. This is important to lunar exploration because the rate of
erosion beneath the rocket exhaust plume of a landing spacecraft will determine
the amount of sand-blasting damage that can be inflicted upon surrounding
hardware. Although the rocket exhaust plume at the exit of the nozzle is
supersonic, the boundary layer on the lunar surface where erosion occurs is
subsonic. The model has been benchmarked through comparison with the Apollo
landing videos, which show the blowing lunar soil, and computational fluid
dynamics simulations of those landings.

Kandemir and Anand Sivasubramaniam","GraphGuess: Approximate Graph Processing System with Adaptive Correction",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph-based data structures have drawn great attention in recent years. The
large and rapidly growing trend on developing graph processing systems focuses
mostly on improving the performance by preprocessing the input graph and
modifying its layout. These systems usually take several hours to days to
complete processing a single graph on high-end machines, let alone the overhead
of pre-processing which most of the time can be dominant. Yet for most graph
applications the exact answer is not always crucial, and providing a rough
estimate of the final result is adequate. Approximate computing is introduced
to trade off accuracy of results for computation or energy savings that could
not be achieved by conventional techniques alone. In this work, we design,
implement and evaluate GraphGuess, inspired from the domain of approximate
graph theory and extend it to a general, practical graph processing system.
GraphGuess is essentially an approximate graph processing technique with
adaptive correction, which can be implemented on top of any graph processing
system. We build a vertex-centric processing system based on GraphGuess, where
it allows the user to trade off accuracy for better performance. Our
experimental studies show that using GraphGuess can significantly reduce the
processing time for large scale graphs while maintaining high accuracy.

hexaborides have been successfully fabricated into dense bulk pellets (>98.5%
in relative densities). The specimens are prepared from elemental precursors
via in-situ metal-boron reactive spark plasma sintering. The sintered bulk
pellets are determined to be single-phase without any detectable oxides or
other secondary phases. The homogenous elemental distributions have been
confirmed at both microscale and nanoscale. The Vickers microhardness are
measured to be 16-18 GPa at a standard indentation load of 9.8 N. The
nanoindentation hardness and Young's moduli have been measured to be 19-22 GPa
and 190-250 GPa, respectively, by nanoindentation test using a maximum load of
500 mN. The material work functions are determined to be 3.7-4.0 eV by
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations, which are
significantly higher than that of LaB6.

  Compositionally Complex Rare-Earth Niobates and Tantalates",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rare-earth niobates and tantalates possess low thermal conductivities, which
can be further reduced in high-entropy compositions. Here, a large number of 40
compositions are synthesized to investigate the origin of low thermal
conductivity. Amongst, 29 possess single (nominally cubic) fluorite phases and
most of them are new compositionally complex (medium- or high-entropy)
compositions. One new finding is that doping 2 % of light element cations can
further reduce thermal conductivity. This large data set enables the discovery
of a negative correlation between the thermal conductivity and averaged radius
ratio of the 3+/5+ cations. While this ratio is still below the threshold for
forming long-range ordered weberite phases, this correlation suggests the
reduced thermal conductivity is related to short-range weberite order, which is
indeed revealed by diffuse scattering in X-ray and neutron diffraction.
Specifically, neutron diffraction is used characterize five selected specimens.
A better fit to a weberite structure is found at nanoscale (~1 nm). The
characteristic length (domain size) is smaller but with stronger short-range
ordering in more insulative materials. As it approaches the Ioffe-Regel limit,
the phonon limit breaks down and ""diffusons"" give rise to the observed
amorphous-like thermal conductivity. Disordered oxygen sublattices are also
confirmed by neutron diffraction.

algorithm (AACA) for high-resolution image scaling. The difference between the
proposed algorithm and the previously proposed optimization of bilinear
interpolation based on ant colony algorithm (OBACA) is that AACA uses global
weighting, whereas OBACA uses a local weighting scheme. The strength of the
proposed global weighting of the AACA algorithm depends on employing solely the
pheromone matrix information present on any group of four adjacent pixels to
decide which case deserves a maximum global weight value or not. Experimental
results are further provided to show the higher performance of the proposed
AACA algorithm with reference to the algorithms mentioned in this paper.

area and a single display plane, here we propose and design an augmented
reality (AR) HUD system with multi-plane, large area, high diffraction
efficiency and a single picture generation unit (PGU) based on holographic
optical elements (HOEs). Since volume HOEs have excellent angle selectivity and
wavelength selectivity, HOEs of different wavelengths can be designed to
display images in different planes. Experimental and simulated results verify
the feasibility of this method. Experimental results show that the diffraction
efficiencies of the red, green and blue HOEs are 75.2%, 73.1% and 67.5%. And
the size of HOEs is 20cm*15cm. Moreover, the three HOEs of red, green and blue
display images at different depths of 150cm, 500cm and 1000cm, respectively. In
addition, the field of view (FOV) and eye-box (EB) of the system are
12{\deg}*10{\deg} and 9.5cm*11.2cm. Furthermore, the light transmittance of the
system has reached 60%. It is believed that this technique can be applied to
the augmented reality navigation display of vehicles and aviation.

  Quantum Mind, And Qualia",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.AI physics.bio-ph physics.hist-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We approach the question ""What is Consciousness?"" in a new way, not as
Descartes' ""systematic doubt"", but as how organisms find their way in their
world. Finding one's way involves finding possible uses of features of the
world that might be beneficial or avoiding those that might be harmful.
""Possible uses of X to accomplish Y"" are ""Affordances"". The number of uses of X
is indefinite (or unknown), the different uses are unordered, are not listable,
and are not deducible from one another. All biological adaptations are either
affordances seized by heritable variation and selection or, far faster, by the
organism acting in its world finding uses of X to accomplish Y. Based on this,
we reach rather astonishing conclusions: (1) Artificial general intelligence
based on universal Turing machines (UTMs) is not possible, since UTMs cannot
""find"" novel affordances. (2) Brain-mind is not purely classical physics for no
classical physics system can be an analogue computer whose dynamical behaviour
can be isomorphic to ""possible uses"". (3) Brain mind must be partly
quantum-supported by increasing evidence at 6.0 sigma to 7.3 sigma. (4) Based
on Heisenberg's interpretation of the quantum state as ""potentia"" converted to
""actuals"" by measurement, where this interpretation is not a substance dualism,
a natural hypothesis is that mind actualizes potentia. This is supported at 5.2
sigma. Then mind's actualizations of entangled brain-mind-world states are
experienced as qualia and allow ""seeing"" or ""perceiving"" of uses of X to
accomplish Y. We can and do jury-rig. Computers cannot. (5) Beyond familiar
quantum computers, we discuss the potentialities of trans-Turing-systems.
