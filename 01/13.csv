fluid in a finite space region of length $L$. Particles interact among
themselves by multi-particle collisions and are in contact with two
thermal-wall heat reservoirs, located at the boundaries of the region. After an
initial ballistic regime, we find a crossover from a normal (kinetic) transport
regime to an anomalous (hydrodynamic) one, above a characteristic size $L_*$.
We argue that $L_*$ is proportional to the cube of the collision time among
particles. Motivated by the physics of emissive divertors in fusion plasma, we
consider the more general case of thermal walls injecting particles with given
average (non-thermal) velocity. For fast and relatively cold particles, short
systems fail to establish local equilibrium and display non-Maxwellian
distributions of velocities.

The refinement utilizes superpixel pooling for feature extraction and a novel
superpixel classifier to determine if a high precision superpixel belongs to an
object or not. Our experiments show an improvement of up to 26.0% in terms of
average recall compared to original AttentionMask. Furthermore, qualitative and

self-propelled agents -- is a fascinating emergent behavior exhibited by active
matter that has key functional implications for biological systems. Extensive
studies have elucidated the different ways in which this phenomenon may arise.
Nevertheless, how collective migration can persist when a population is
confronted with perturbations, which inevitably arise in complex settings, is
poorly understood. Here, by combining experiments and simulations, we describe
a mechanism by which collectively migrating populations smooth out large-scale
perturbations in their overall morphology, enabling their constituents to
continue to migrate together. We focus on the canonical example of chemotactic
migration of Escherichia coli, in which fronts of cells move via directed
motion, or chemotaxis, in response to a self-generated nutrient gradient. We
identify two distinct modes in which chemotaxis influences the morphology of
the population: cells in different locations along a front migrate at different
velocities due to spatial variations in (i) the local nutrient gradient and in
(ii) the ability of cells to sense and respond to the local nutrient gradient.
While the first mode is destabilizing, the second mode is stabilizing and
dominates, ultimately driving smoothing of the overall population and enabling
continued collective migration. This process is autonomous, arising without any
external intervention; instead, it is a population-scale consequence of the
manner in which individual cells transduce external signals. Our findings thus
provide insights to predict, and potentially control, the collective migration
and morphology of cell populations and diverse other forms of active matter.

In the small time-step limit, this is equivalent to the McLachlan's variational

linear scaling with the total number of variational parameters. Furthermore, it
is global in the sense that it uses the variational principle to optimize all

extends the scope of existing efficient variational methods, that instead
typically rely on the iterative optimization of a restricted subset of

ergodic through mixing, to Bernoulli systems that are ""as random as a
coin-toss"". Dual-unitary circuits have been recently introduced as solvable
models of many-body nonintegrable quantum chaotic systems having a hierarchy of
ergodic properties. We extend this to include the apex of a putative quantum
ergodic hierarchy which is Bernoulli, in the sense that correlations of single
and two-particle observables vanish at space-time separated points. We derive a
condition based on the entangling power $e_p(U)$ of the basic two-particle
unitary building block, $U$, of the circuit, that guarantees mixing, and when
maximized, corresponds to Bernoulli circuits. Additionally we show, both
analytically and numerically, how local-averaging over random realizations of
the single-particle unitaries, $u_i$ and $v_i$ such that the building block is
$U^\prime = (u_1 \otimes u_2 ) U (v_1 \otimes v_2 )$ leads to an identification
of the average mixing rate as being determined predominantly by the entangling
power $e_p(U)$. Finally we provide several, both analytical and numerical, ways
to construct dual-unitary operators covering the entire possible range of
entangling power. We construct a coupled quantum cat map which is dual-unitary
for all local dimensions and a 2-unitary or perfect tensor for odd local
dimensions, and can be used to build Bernoulli circuits.

negative temperatures, are widely accepted, we will show scenarios which
apparently at a first glance are inconsistent with our normal notion of
thermodynamics. This is shown in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics for
special geometrical frustrated systems (GFSs), which have maximum entropy at
its ground state and constant negative temperature. For two GFSs in weak
thermal contact and at same temperature, all energetic constellations are equal
probable. A hot and a cool GFS in contact is driven by entropic forces via heat
transfer to a most probable state in which the hot GFS is in its ground state.
The same holds for a GFS in contact with a gas. As this is not a local maximum
of entropy both subsystems maintain different temperatures here.
Re-parametrization can transform these non-local into local maxima with
corresponding equivalence of re-defined temperatures. However, these
temperatures cannot be assigned solely to a subsystem but describe combinations
of both.The non-local maxima of entropy restrict the naive application of the
zeroth law of thermodynamics. Reformulated this law is still valid with the
consequence that a GFS at constant negative temperature can measure positive
temperatures. A GFS combined with a polarized paramagnetic spin gas may have a
local or non-local maxima of entropy, with equivalent or non-equivalent
temperatures, respectively. In case of a local maximum the spin gas can measure
the temperature of the GFS, however, it does not reveal information about its
energetic state.

theory. Historically, perturbative analysis of gravitational-wave sources has
largely focused on post-Newtonian theory. However, strong-field perturbation
theory is essential in many cases such as the quasinormal ringdown following
the merger of a binary system, tidally perturbed compact objects, and
extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In this review, motivated primarily by
small-mass-ratio binaries but not limited to them, we provide an overview of
essential methods in (i) black hole perturbation theory, (ii) orbital mechanics
in Kerr spacetime, and (iii) gravitational self-force theory. Our treatment of
black hole perturbation theory covers most common methods, including the
Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, methods of metric
reconstruction, and Lorenz-gauge formulations, presenting them in a new
consistent and self-contained form. Our treatment of orbital mechanics covers
quasi-Keplerian and action-angle descriptions of bound geodesics and
accelerated orbits, osculating geodesics, near-identity averaging
transformations, multiscale expansions, and orbital resonances. Our summary of
self-force theory's foundations is brief, covering the main ideas and results
of matched asymptotic expansions, local expansion methods, puncture schemes,
and point particle descriptions. We conclude by combining the above methods in
a multiscale expansion of the perturbative Einstein equations, leading to
adiabatic and post-adiabatic evolution schemes. Our presentation is intended
primarily as a reference for practitioners but includes a variety of new
results. In particular, we present the first complete post-adiabatic
waveform-generation framework for generic (nonresonant) orbits in Kerr.

electronic structure of target systems. As state-of-the-art many-body
perturbation theory calculations are too expensive for large-scale material
screening, density functional theory offers the best compromise between
accuracy and computational feasibility. The quality of the obtained results,
however, crucially depends on the choice of the exchange-correlation potential,
$v_{xc}$. To address this essential point, we systematically analyze the
performance of three popular approximations of $v_{xc}$ (PBE, SCAN, and HSE06)
on the structural and electronic properties of bulk Cs$_3$Sb and Cs$_2$Te, two
representative materials of Cs-based semiconductors employed in photocathode

largest discrepancies from the target: the unit cell volume is overestimated
compared to the experimental value, while the band gap is severely
underestimated. On the other hand, both SCAN and HSE06 perform remarkably well
in reproducing both structural and electronic properties. Spin-orbit coupling,
which mainly impacts the valence region of both materials inducing a band
splitting and, consequently, a band-gap reduction of the order of 0.2 eV, is
equally captured by all functionals. Our results indicate SCAN as the best
trade-off between accuracy and computational costs, outperforming the

release at a two-dimensional current sheet. Here we develop the theory further
by extending it to an axisymmetric current sheet in three dimensions without
resorting to complex variable theory. Methods. We analytically study
reconnection and treat the current sheet as a three-dimensional structure. We
apply the theory to the cancellation of two fragments of equal but opposite
flux that approach each another and are located in an overlying horizontal
magnetic field. Results. The energy release occurs in two phases. During Phase
1, a separator is formed and reconnection is driven at it as it rises to a
maximum height and then moves back down to the photosphere, heating the plasma
and accelerating a plasma jet as it does so. During Phase 2 the fluxes cancel
in the photosphere and accelerate a mixture of cool and hot plasma upwards.

soils does not yield satisfactory results when Coulomb's theory of shear
strength of soils is assumed, and the yield function derived accordingly is
used to define both the stress state and the direction of plastic flow. The
limitation mainly stems from the fact that Coulomb's theory (and its
derivatives) is a simplification that intentionally ignores deformation
characteristics that manifest from the particulate nature of such materials. It
is thus customary to apply a branch of plasticity called non-associated
plasticity for soils and similar materials. In the non-associated plasticity
framework, yield functions and plastic potential functions are different. The
former defines the mobilization of the stress state while the later defines the
direction of plastic flow. For soils, stress-dilatancy theories have become
central in the formulation of non-associated flow rules. In this paper, cyclic
stress-dilatancy relations are derived based on complementarity hypothesis of
stress-dilatancy conjugates. Both loading and unloading are explicitly
considered. Then, yield functions are derived based on the resulting
stress-dilatancy relations. In so doing, the resulting yield functions are
rendered with a quality to be used for the modelling of deformation behavior of
soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The newly derived
yield functions are called Associated Cyclic Stress Dilatancy yield functions
for which the abbreviation ACStD is used. The theoretical framework is
established first for special cases of deformation modes-plane strain and
axisymmetric. The framework is generalized for considering Lode angle
dependency of the yield function and extending the Matusoka-Nakai criterion.

possible candidate is the acetyl cation, CH3CO+, which is the most stable
product resulting from the protonation of ketene. We have produced this species
in the laboratory and observed its rotational transitions Ju = 10 up to Ju =
27. Hence, we report the discovery of CH3CO+ in space based on our

rotational and distortion constants allow us to predict the spectrum of CH3CO+
with high accuracy up to 500 GHz. We derive an abundance ratio
N(H2CCO)/N(CH3CO+) = 44. The high abundance of the protonated form of H2CCO is
due to the high proton affinity of the neutral species. The other isomer,
H2CCOH+, is found to be 178.9 kJ/mol above CH3CO+. The observed intensity ratio

at $x$ when the disorder is smaller than $\varepsilon_x$ and disagree when its

concentrations in a wall-bounded turbulent flow. While it may be thought that
settling can be ignored when the settling parameter $Sv\equiv v_s/u_\tau$ is
small ($v_s$ - Stokes settling velocity, $u_\tau$ - fluid friction velocity),
we show that even in this regime the settling may make a leading order
contribution to the concentration profiles. This is because the importance of
settling is determined, not by the size of $v_s$ compared with $u_\tau$ or any
other fluid velocity scale, but by the size of $v_s$ relative to the other
mechanisms that control the vertical particle velocity and concentration
profile. We explain this in the context of the particle mean-momentum equation,
and show that in general, there always exists a region in the boundary layer
where settling cannot be neglected, no matter how small $Sv$ is (provided it is
finite). Direct numerical simulations confirm the arguments, and show that the
near-wall concentration is highly dependent on $Sv$ even when $Sv\ll 1$, and
can reduce by an order of magnitude when $Sv$ is increased from $O(10^{-4})$
and $O(10^{-2})$. The results also show that the preferential sampling of
ejection events in the boundary layer by inertial particles when $Sv=0$ is
profoundly altered as $Sv$ is increased, and is replaced by a preferential
sampling of sweep events due to the onset of the preferential sweeping
mechanism.

optimal content moderation strategy differs for platforms with different
revenue models, advertising or subscription. We also show that a platform's
content moderation strategy depends on its technical sophistication. Because of
imperfect technology, a platform may optimally throw away the moderate content
more than the extreme content. Therefore, one cannot judge how extreme a
platform is by just looking at its content moderation strategy. Furthermore, we
show that a platform under advertising does not necessarily benefit from a
better technology for content moderation, but one under subscription does. This
means that platforms under different revenue models can have different

  We present STScript, a toolchain that generates TypeScript APIs for
communication-safe web development over WebSockets, and RouST, a new session
type theory that supports multiparty communications with routing mechanisms.
STScript provides developers with TypeScript APIs generated from a
communication protocol specification based on RouST. The generated APIs build
upon TypeScript concurrency practices, complement the event-driven style of
programming in full-stack web development, and are compatible with the Node.js
runtime for server-side endpoints and the React.js framework for browser-side
endpoints.
  RouST can express multiparty interactions routed via an intermediate
participant. It supports peer-to-peer communication between browser-side
endpoints by routing communication via the server in a way that avoids
excessive serialisation. RouST guarantees communication safety for endpoint web
applications written using STScript APIs.
  We evaluate the expressiveness of STScript for modern web programming using
several production-ready case studies deployed as web applications.

  by a superlens",,,,,"physics.class-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The amplification of evanescent waves by flat superlens requires a
near-resonance coupling which has been linked to resonant surface plasmons. A
subtle interplay has been proposed to exist between the excitation of
well-defined resonant surface plasmons and the focusing capability of a
superlens. To gain insights into these resonant modes and their contributions
to the amplification and recovery of evanescent waves, we performed simple but
robust full-wave FDTD simulations on causal negative index Lorentz models. We
found that well-defined pair of resonant surface plasmons is excited whenever a
coupling of a diverging transmitted beam and a converging refracted beam occurs
at the second interface. The resonant coupling of these modes at the interface
led to the excitation of a single interface resonance predicted by the theory.
The physical consequence of this resonance is that incident wave energy is
pumped into the negative-index material medium and beyond it. These phenomena
contribute substantially to the amplification and recovery of the near-fields
in the image plane. It is noteworthy that, for evanescent wave refocusing to be
achieved in a flat superlens, its thickness, and the source-to-superlens
distance should be optimized. This optimization is critical in that an optimal
thickness alongside optimal source-to-superlens distance will allow evanescent
wave refocusing to dominate material lost. The FDTD simulated result showed an
image of the point source inside the superlens and beyond it when its thickness
was optimized. The resolution of the image beyond the superlens was
$\sim.58\lambda$ and this superlens behaves like a near-perfect lens. Overall,
these numerically simulated results could serve as useful approximations to the
degree of resonant amplification and refocusing of near-fields that can be
achieved by flat superlens in near-fields experimental imaging setups.

application domains such as cloud computing and computer networks. This metric
is particularly important in tandem service systems, where the end-to-end
service is provided through a chain of services. Service-rate control is a
common mechanism for providing QoS guarantees in service systems. In this
paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) service-rate
controller that provides probabilistic upper-bounds on the end-to-end delay of
the system, while preventing the overuse of service resources. In order to have
a general framework, we use queueing theory to model the service systems.
However, we adopt an RL-based approach to avoid the limitations of
queueing-theoretic methods. In particular, we use Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) to learn the service rates (action) as a function of the queue
lengths (state) in tandem service systems. In contrast to existing RL-based
methods that quantify their performance by the achieved overall reward, which
could be hard to interpret or even misleading, our proposed controller provides
explicit probabilistic guarantees on the end-to-end delay of the system. The
evaluations are presented for a tandem queueing system with non-exponential
inter-arrival and service times, the results of which validate our controller's
capability in meeting QoS constraints.

novel denoising networks were designed for real images coming from different

reducing epistemic uncertainty while using only a single pretrained network. We
achieve this by tapping into the epistemic uncertainty through augmented and

propose an ensemble method with two decoupled attention paths, over the pixel

widths due to open meson-meson channels. This calculation does not involve any
new free parameter, so comparison of our predictions with existing data
provides a direct test of our approach. Further mass corrections are also
estimated and good agreement with the measured masses comes out. As for the
calculated widths, overall reasonable, they point out to the need of some
refinement of our current bound state approximation for an accurate description
of data. These results give additional support to the diabatic approach in QCD
as an adequate framework for a complete unified description of conventional and
unconventional charmoniumlike resonances. In this respect, the experimental
discovery of a predicted $2^{++}$ resonance with a mass around $4$ GeV would be
of special relevance.

analyze the impact of each dimension on downstream reasoning tasks that require

often the result of isolated one-dimensional (or at least highly anisotropic)

the velocities of the Earth, ISM, and pulsar along the primary axis of the
lens. As a result, measuring variations in the curvature over the course of a
year, or the orbital period for pulsars in binaries, can constrain properties
of the screen and pulsar. In particular the pulsar distance and orbital
inclination for binary systems can be found for multiple screens or systems
with prior information on $\sin(i)$. By mapping the conjugate spectra into a
space where the main arc and inverted arclets are straight lines, we are able
to make use of the full information content from the inverted arclet
curvatures, amplitudes, and phases using eigenvectors to uniquely and optimally

tools like linear and convex programming for the design of control systems.
Nevertheless, the capability of linear and convex programming is limited and is
not adequate to reason about general nonlinear polynomials constraints that
arise naturally in the design of nonlinear systems. This limitation calls for
new solvers that are capable of utilizing the power of linear and convex
programming to reason about general multivariate polynomials. In this paper, we
propose PolyAR, a highly parallelizable solver for polynomial inequality
constraints. PolyAR provides several key contributions. First, it uses convex
relaxations of the problem to accelerate the process of finding a solution to
the set of the non-convex multivariate polynomials. Second, it utilizes an
iterative convex abstraction refinement process which aims to prune the search
space and identify regions for which the convex relaxation fails to solve the
problem. Third, it allows for a highly parallelizable usage of off-the-shelf
solvers to analyze the regions in which the convex relaxation failed to provide
solutions. We compared the scalability of PolyAR against Z3 8.9 and Yices 2.6

dissipation of tides in either body is very sensitive to its structure and to
its dynamics, like differential rotation which exists in the outer convective
enveloppe of solar-like stars and giant gaseous planets. In particular, tidal
waves may strongly interact with zonal flows at the so-called corotation
resonances, where the wave's Doppler-shifted frequency cancels out. We aim to
provide a deep physical understanding of the dynamics of tidal inertial waves
at corotation resonances, in the presence of differential rotation profiles
typical of low-mass stars and giant planets. By developping an inclined
shearing box, we investigate the propagation and the transmission of free
inertial waves at corotation, and more generally at critical levels, which are
singularities in the governing wave differential equation. Through the
construction of an invariant called the wave action flux, we identify different
regimes of wave transmission at critical levels, which are confirmed with a
one-dimensional three-layer numerical model. We find that inertial waves can be
either fully transmitted, strongly damped, or even amplified after crossing a
critical level. The occurrence of these regimes depends on the assumed profile
of differential rotation, on the nature as well as the latitude of the critical
level, and on wave parameters such as the inertial frequency and the
longitudinal and vertical wavenumbers. Waves can thus either deposit their
action flux to the fluid when damped at critical levels, or they can extract
action flux to the fluid when amplified at critical levels. Both situations
could lead to significant angular momentum exchange between the tidally
interacting bodies.

$M_V=-3.39\pm0.09$ for the M19 star. This is in close agreement with the $M_V$
values found for yellow PAGB stars in the GCs omega Cen, NGC 5986, and M79,

brighter than RR Lyrae variables, and they can largely avoid the issues of

broad-band photometric redshift point estimates (photo-$z$s) have been
superseded by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs) that encapsulate
their nontrivial uncertainties. Initial applications of photo-$z$ PDFs in weak
gravitational lensing studies of cosmology have obtained the redshift
distribution function $\mathcal{N}(z)$ by employing computationally
straightforward stacking methodologies that violate the laws of probability. In
response, mathematically self-consistent models of varying complexity have been
proposed in an effort to answer the question, ""What is the right way to obtain

addressing the contrapositive of the more common presentation of such models,

analyzed. These solutions of Einstein-Klein-Gordon (EKG) equations arise from
considering the interaction of a real scalar field with matter. We assume that
the inclusion of the scalar field in addition with matter, allows to justify
that stability implies that the total mass of the solution should grow when the
initial condition for the density of matter at the origin is also increased.
Employing numerical values for the static boson star based on a linear relation
between the source and the energy density and between this and the pressure, we
found the relation that linked the the scalar field at the origin with the
matter energy density (MED) in the same point. We also determine the behavior
of the total mass (TM) with the matter energy density in the origin, by also
obtaining through this and the weak energy condition, two possible ranges for
stable solutions of static boson stars.

find that these two parameters are tightly correlated, exhibiting smaller
scatter and strong correlation in comparison to other star-forming scaling
relations. A power-law, with a slightly sub-linear index, is a good
representation of this relation. Locally, the residuals of this correlation
show a significant anti-correlation with both the stellar age and metallicity

$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ - P$_{\rm h}$ relation. For our sample of active
star-forming regions (i.e., regions with large values of H$\alpha$ equivalent
width), we find that the effective feedback momentum per unit stellar mass
($p_\ast/m_\ast$),measured from the P$_{\rm h}$ / $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ ratio
increases with P$_{\rm h}$. The median value of this ratio for all the sampled
regions is larger than the expected momentum just from supernovae explosions.
Morphology of the galaxies, including bars, does not seem to have a significant
impact in the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ - P$_{\rm h}$ relation. Our analysis suggests
that self regulation of the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at kpc scales comes mainly from
momentum injection to the interstellar medium from supernovae explosions.
However, other mechanism in disk galaxies may also play a significant role in
shaping the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at local scales. Our results also suggest that
P$_{\rm h}$ can be considered as the main parameter that modulates star
formation at kpc scales, rather than individual components of the baryonic

the hot halos that they are moving through suggests that thermal conduction
could play an important role in the circumgalactic medium. However, thermal
conduction in the presence of a magnetic field is highly anisotropic, being
strongly suppressed in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines.
This is commonly modelled by using a simple prescription that assumes that
thermal conduction is isotropic at a certain efficiency $f<1$, but its precise
value is largely unconstrained. We investigate the efficiency of thermal
conduction by comparing the evolution of 3D hydrodynamical (HD) simulations of
cold clouds moving through a hot medium, using artificially suppressed
isotropic thermal conduction (with $f$), against 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)
simulations with (true) anisotropic thermal conduction. Our main diagnostic is
the time evolution of the amount of cold gas in conditions representative of
the lower (close to the disc) circumgalactic medium of a Milky Way-like galaxy.
We find that in almost every HD and MHD run, the amount of cold gas increases
with time, indicating that hot gas condensation is an important phenomenon that
can contribute to gas accretion onto galaxies. For the most realistic
orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the cloud motion we find
that $f$ is in the range 0.03 -- 0.15. Thermal conduction is thus always highly
suppressed, but its effect on the cloud evolution is generally not negligible.

physical properties. We investigate the influence of the dynamical state and
the formation history on both the morphology and local connectivity of about
2400 groups and clusters of galaxies from the large hydrodynamical simulation
IllustrisTNG at z=0. We find that the mass of groups and clusters mainly
influences the geometry of the matter distribution: massive halos are
significantly more elliptical, and more connected to the cosmic web than
low-mass ones. Beyond the mass-driven effect, ellipticity and connectivity are
correlated and are imprints of the growth rate of groups and clusters. Both
anisotropy measures appear to trace different dynamical states, such that
unrelaxed groups and clusters are more elliptical and more connected than
relaxed ones. This relation between matter anisotropies and dynamical state is
the sign of different accretion histories. Relaxed groups and clusters are
mostly formed long time ago, and slowly accreting matter at the present time.
They are rather spherical and weakly connected to their environment, mostly
because they had enough time to relax and, hence, lost the connection with
their preferential directions of accretion and merging. In contrast,
late-formed unrelaxed objects are highly anisotropic with large connectivities
and ellipticities. These groups and clusters are in formation phase and must be
strongly affected by the infalling of materials from filaments.

have developed {\sc mirkwood}: a user-friendly tool comprising of an ensemble
of supervised machine learning-based models capable of non-linearly mapping
galaxy fluxes to their properties. By stacking multiple models, we marginalize
against any individual model's poor performance in a given region of the

performance over traditional techniques by training it on a combined data set
of mock photometry of z=0 galaxies from the \textsc{Simba}, \textsc{EAGLE} and
\textsc{IllustrisTNG} cosmological simulations, and comparing the derived

\textsc{mirkwood} is also able to account for uncertainties arising both from
intrinsic noise in observations, and from finite training data and incorrect
modeling assumptions. To increase the added value to the observational
community, we use Shapley value explanations (SHAP) to fairly evaluate the
relative importance of different bands to understand why particular predictions

observations of galaxies as compared to traditional SED fitting.

the extents, kinetic energies and momentum fluxes of the ionized outflows in
the quasars host galaxies. For the ERQs, the galactic-scale outflows are likely
driven by radiation pressure in a high column density environment or due to an
adiabatic shock. For the type-2 quasar, the outflow is driven by radiation
pressure in a low column density environment or due to a radiative shock. The
outflows in the ERQs carry a significant amount of energy ranging from
0.05-5$\%$ of the quasar's bolometric luminosity, powerful enough to have a
significant impact on the quasar host galaxies. However, the outflows are
likely only impacting the inner few kpc of each host galaxy. The observed
outflow sizes are generally smaller than other ionized outflows observed at
high redshift. The high ratio between the momentum flux of the ionized outflow
and the photon momentum flux from the quasar accretion disk and high nuclear
obscuration makes these ERQs great candidates for transitional objects where
the outflows are likely responsible for clearing material in the inner regions
of each galaxy, unveiling the quasar accretion disk at optical wavelengths.

two state transitions between them. These appear remarkably similar to the

(power-law dominated) spectral state around L$_{\rm bol} \sim $few $ \times
10^{-2}$ L$_{\rm Edd}$, and the strengthening of the corona over time
$\sim$100--200 days after the UV/optical peak. Contemporaneously, the spectral
energy distribution (in particular, the UV-to-X-ray spectral slope
$\alpha_{ox}$) shows a pronounced softening as the outburst progresses. The
X-ray timing properties also show a marked change, initially dominated by
variability at long ($>$day) timescales while a high frequency ($\sim$10$^{-3}$

the hard into the quiescent state, as identified by the sudden collapse of the

findings illustrate that TDEs can be used to study the scale (in)variance of

Galactic center region is one of the most intriguing mysteries in Astroparticle
Physics. This Galactic center excess (GCE), has been measured with respect to
different interstellar emission models (IEMs), source catalogs, data selections
and techniques. Although several proposed interpretations have appeared in the
literature, there are not firm conclusions as to its origin. The main
difficulty in solving this puzzle lies in modeling a region of such complexity
and thus precisely measuring the characteristics of the GCE. In this paper, we
use 11 years of Fermi-LAT data, state of the art IEMs, and the newest 4FGL
source catalog to provide precise measurements of the energy spectrum, spatial
morphology, position, and sphericity of the GCE. We find that the GCE has a
spectrum which is peaked at a few GeV and is well fit with a log-parabola. The
normalization of the spectrum changes by roughly $60\%$ when using different
IEMs, data selections and analysis techniques. The spatial distribution of the
GCE is compatible with a dark matter (DM) template produced with a generalized
NFW density profile with slope $\gamma = 1.2-1.3$. No energy evolution is
measured for the GCE morphology between $0.6-30$ GeV at a level larger than
$10\%$ of the $\gamma$ average value, which is 1.25. The analysis of the GCE
modeled with a DM template divided into quadrants shows that the spectrum and
spatial morphology of the GCE is similar in different regions around the
Galactic center. Finally, the GCE centroid is compatible with the Galactic
center, with best-fit position between
$l=[-0.3^{\circ},0.0^{\circ}],b=[-0.1^{\circ},0.0^{\circ}]$, and it is
compatible with a spherical symmetric morphology. In particular, fitting the DM
spatial profile with an ellipsoid gives a major-to-minor axis ratio between
0.8-1.2.

mass-ratio microlensing planet found to date (q = 1.2--1.6 x 10^{-5} at
1-sigma). Although there is substantial uncertainty in the satellite parallax
measured by Spitzer, the measurement of the annual parallax effect combined
with the finite source effect allows us to determine the mass of the host star
(M_L = 0.3--0.6 M_Sun), the mass of its planet (m_p = 1.4--3.1 M_Earth), the
projected separation between the host and planet (a_perp = 1.2--2.3 au), and
the distance to the lens system (D_L = 0.6--1.2 kpc). The lens is plausibly the
blend, which could be checked with adaptive optics observations. As the
smallest planet clearly below the break in the mass-ratio function (Suzuki et
al. 2016; Jung et al. 2019), it demonstrates that current experiments are
powerful enough to robustly measure the slope of the mass-ratio function below
that break. We find that the cross-section for detecting small planets is
maximized for planets with separations just outside of the boundary for
resonant caustics and that sensitivity to such planets can be maximized by
intensively monitoring events whenever they are magnified by a factor A > 5.
Finally, an empirical investigation demonstrates that most planets showing a
degeneracy between (s > 1) and (s < 1) solutions are not in the regime (|log s|
>> 0) for which the ""close""/""wide"" degeneracy was derived. This investigation
suggests a link between the ""close""/""wide"" and ""inner/outer"" degeneracies and
also that the symmetry in the lens equation goes much deeper than symmetries
uncovered for the limiting cases.

cloud mass distributions in each galaxy. The physical properties of clouds vary
among galaxies, both as a function of galactocentric radius and as a function
of dynamical environment. Overall, the clouds in our target galaxies are
well-described by approximate energy equipartition, although clouds in stellar
bars and galaxy centres show elevated line widths and virial parameters. The
mass distribution of clouds in spiral arms has a typical mass scale that is
2.5x larger than interarm clouds and spiral arms clouds show slightly lower
median virial parameters compared to interarm clouds (1.2 versus 1.4).

criteria for kernel elimination in a layer-by-layer fashion. During the
process, a CNN model is retrained only when the current layer is entirely
simplified, by adjusting the weights from the next layer to the first one and
preserving weights of subsequent layers not involved in the process. We call
this strategy \emph{progressive retraining}, differently from kernel pruning
methods that usually retrain the entire model after each simplification action
-- e.g., the elimination of one or a few kernels. Our subjective relevance
criterion exploits the ability of humans in recognizing visual patterns and
improves the designer's understanding of the simplification process. The
combination of suitable relevance criteria and progressive retraining shows
that our methods can increase effectiveness with considerable model
simplification. We also demonstrate that our methods can provide better results

(mid- to far-IR and sub-millimetre to radio) stacking ensembles of

find that the dust to stellar mass ratio (Md/M*) rises steeply as a function of
redshift up to z~1.0 and then remains flat at least out to z = 2.0. Using Md as
a proxy of gas mass (Mgas), we find a similar trend for the evolution of the
gas mass fraction (fgas) with z > 1.0 QGs having fgas ~ 7.0% (for solar
metallicity). This fgas is 3 - 10 times lower than that of normal star forming
galaxies (SFGs) at their corresponding redshift but ~3 and ~10 times larger
compared to that of z = 0.5 and local QGs. Furthermore, the inferred gas
depletion time scales are comparable to that of local SFGs and systematically
longer than that of main sequence galaxies at their corresponding redshifts.
Our analysis also reveals that the average dust temperature (Td) of massive QGs
remains roughly constant (< Td > = 21.0 \pm 2.0K) at least out to z ~ 2.0 and
is substantially colder (~ 10K) compared to that of z > 0 SFGs. This motivated
us to construct and release a redshift-invariant template IR SED, that we use
to make predictions for ALMA observations and to explore systematic effects in
the Mgas estimates of massive, high-z QGs. Finally, we discuss how a simple
model that considers progenitor-bias can effectively reproduce the observed
evolution of Md/M* and fgas. Our results indicate universal initial
interstellar medium conditions for quenched galaxies and a large degree of

models of dust evolution, but in dense gas, where the timescale is short enough
for accretion to be effective, material is accreted in the form of ice mantles
rather than adding to the refractory grain mass. It has been suggested that
negatively-charged small grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) can
accrete efficiently due to the Coulomb attraction of positively-charged ions,
avoiding this issue. We show that this inevitably results in the growth of the
small-grain radii until they become positively charged, at which point further
growth is effectively halted. The resulting gas-phase depletions under diffuse
ISM conditions are significantly overestimated when a constant grain size
distribution is assumed. While observed depletions can be reproduced by
changing the initial size distribution or assuming highly efficient grain
shattering, both options result in unrealistic levels of far-ultraviolet
extinction. We suggest that the observed elemental depletions in the diffuse

inefficient dust destruction by supernovae at moderate ($n_{\rm H} \sim 30 {\rm

show that both systems stay in spin polarized, $C_{3z}$-broken insulator states
with zero Chern number at 1/2 filling of the flat bands under finite
displacement fields. In some cases these spin polarized, nematic insulator
states are in the quantum valley Hall phase by virtue of the nontrivial band
topology of the systems. The spin polarized insulator state is quasi-degenerate
with the valley polarized state if only the dominant intra-valley Coulomb
interaction is included. Such quasi-degeneracy can be split by atomic on-site
interactions such that the spin polarized, nematic state become the unique
ground state. Such a scenario applies to various twisted multilayer graphene
systems at 1/2 filling, thus can be considered as a universal mechanism.
Moreover, under vertical magnetic fields, the orbital Zeeman splittings and the
field-induced change of charge density in twisted multilayer graphene systems
would compete with the atomic Hubbard interactions, which can drive transitions

during low-latency operations because electromagnetic follow-up of candidate
detections requires accurate, rapid sky localization and inference of
astrophysical sources. NNETFIX is a machine learning-based algorithm designed
to remove glitches detected in coincidence with transient gravitational-wave
signals. NNETFIX uses artificial neural networks to estimate the portion of the

the sky localization of the astrophysical signal. The sky localization of the

obtained from the original data or by removing the portion of the data impacted

in latent space as the supervision signal by contrasting positive and negative
images directly or indirectly. Although the utility of self-supervised
algorithms has improved recently, there are still bottlenecks hindering their
widespread use, such as the compute needed. In this paper, we propose a module
that serves as an additional objective in the self-supervised contrastive
learning paradigm. We show how the inclusion of this module to regress the
parameters of an affine transformation or homography, in addition to the
original contrastive objective, improves both performance and learning speed.
Importantly, we ensure that this module does not enforce invariance to the
various components of the affine transform, as this is not always ideal. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional objective on two recent,
popular self-supervised algorithms. We perform an extensive experimental
analysis of the proposed method and show an improvement in performance for all
considered datasets. Further, we find that although both the general homography
and affine transformation are sufficient to improve performance and
convergence, the affine transformation performs better in all cases.

variables having large correlations or partial correlations in high dimension.
Recently there has been progress in the ultra-high dimensional setting when the
sample size $n$ is fixed and the dimension $p$ tends to infinity. Despite these
advances, the correlation screening framework suffers from practical,
methodological and theoretical deficiencies. For instance, previous correlation
screening theory requires that the population covariance matrix be sparse and
block diagonal. This block sparsity assumption is however restrictive in
practical applications. As a second example, correlation and partial
correlation screening requires the estimation of dependence measures, which can
be computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a unifying approach
to correlation and partial correlation mining that is not restricted to block
diagonal correlation structure, thus yielding a methodology that is suitable
for modern applications. By making connections to random geometric graphs, the
number of highly correlated or partial correlated variables are shown to have
compound Poisson finite-sample characterizations, which hold for both the
finite $p$ case and when $p$ tends to infinity. The unifying framework also
demonstrates a duality between correlation and partial correlation screening
with theoretical and practical consequences.

necessitates reasoning using both domain-specific knowledge (e.g.,

reverse engineers often use toolkits (such as IDA Pro or Ghidra) that allow
them to interactively explicate properties of binaries. We argue that deductive

visualization-based binary analysis tools and high-performance logical
inference engines that compute facts about binaries. In this paper, we present
a vision for the future in which reverse engineers use a visualization-based
tool to understand binaries while simultaneously querying a logical-inference
engine to perform arbitrarily-complex deductive inference tasks. We call our
vision declarative demand-driven reverse engineering (D^3RE for short), and
sketch a formal semantics whose goal is to mediate interaction between a
logical-inference engine (such Souffle) and a reverse engineering tool. We
describe aprototype tool, d3re, which are using to explore the D^3RE vision.
While still a prototype, we have used d3re to reimplement several common
querying tasks on binaries. Our evaluation demonstrates that d3re enables both
better performance and more succinct implementation of these common RE tasks.

accurate location of microseismic events from recorded seismograms and the

these microseismic events, which is necessary to perform Bayesian source
inversion, can be prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources.
A viable solution is to train a surrogate model based on machine learning
techniques, to emulate the forward model and thus accelerate Bayesian
inference. In this paper, we substantially enhance previous work, which
considered only sources with isotropic moment tensors. We train a machine
learning algorithm on the power spectrum of the recorded pressure wave and show
that the trained emulator allows complete and fast event locations for
$\textit{any}$ source mechanism. Moreover, we show that our approach is
computationally inexpensive, as it can be run in less than 1 hour on a
commercial laptop, while yielding accurate results using less than $10^4$
training seismograms. We additionally demonstrate how the trained emulators can
be used to identify the source mechanism through the estimation of the Bayesian
evidence. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is robust to real noise as
measured in field data. This work lays the foundations for efficient, accurate

uncertainties, which are ultimately key for accurately characterising

(MORA) survey, the largest ALMA contiguous blank-field survey to-date with a
total area of 184 sq. arcmin and the only at 2mm to search for dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We use the 13 sources detected above 5sigma to
estimate the first ALMA galaxy number counts at this wavelength. These number
counts are then combined with the state-of-the-art galaxy number counts at
1.2mm and 3mm and with a backward evolution model to place constraints on the
evolution of the IR luminosity function and dust-obscured star formation in the
last 13 billion years. Our results suggest a steep redshift evolution on the
space density of DSFGs and confirm the flattening of the IR luminosity function
at faint luminosities, with a slope of $\alpha_{LF} = -0.42^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$.
We conclude that the dust-obscured component, which peaks at z=2-2.5, has
dominated the cosmic history of star formation for the past ~12 billion years,
back to z~4. At z=5, the dust-obscured star formation is estimated to be ~35%
of the total star formation rate density and decreases to 25%-20% at z=6-7,
implying a minor contribution of dust-enshrouded star formation in the first
billion years of the Universe. With the dust-obscured star formation history
constrained up to the end of the epoch of reionization, our results provide a
benchmark to test galaxy formation models, to study the galaxy mass assembly
history, and to understand the dust and metal enrichment of the Universe at
early times.

challenging dynamic task of learning to hit a ball off a tee, where a kinematic
plan based on treating the scene as static is insufficient to solve the task,
but sufficient to bootstrap a more dynamic policy. In all three cases, our
method is competitive with human-demonstrated initialization, and significantly
outperforms starting with a random policy. This approach enables robots to to

the extended horizon used for the terminal penalty. The main practical benefit
of the considered finite-tail cost MPC formulation is the simpler offline
design in combination with typically significantly less restrictive bounds on
the prediction horizon to ensure stability. We demonstrate the benefits of the

environments. A partially observable environment is an environment whose state
is not completely visible to the program, but from which the program receives
partial observations. Developers typically deal with partial observability by
writing a state estimator that, given observations, attempts to deduce the
hidden state of the environment. In safety-critical domains, to formally verify
safety properties developers may write an environment model. The model captures
the relationship between observations and hidden states and is used to prove
the software correct.
  In this paper, we present a new methodology for writing and verifying
programs in partially observable environments. We present belief programming, a
programming methodology where developers write an environment model that the
program runtime automatically uses to perform state estimation. A belief
program dynamically updates and queries a belief state that captures the
possible states the environment could be in. To enable verification, we present
Epistemic Hoare Logic that reasons about the possible belief states of a belief
program the same way that classical Hoare logic reasons about the possible
states of a program. We develop these concepts by defining a semantics and a
program logic for a simple core language called BLIMP. In a case study, we show
how belief programming could be used to write and verify a controller for the
Mars Polar Lander in BLIMP. We present an implementation of BLIMP called CBLIMP
and evaluate it to determine the feasibility of belief programming.

radiation is crucial to the understanding and design of radiative thermal
energy converters. Charge carrier dynamics in semiconductors are well-described
by the Poisson-drift-diffusion equations, and thermal radiation in
emitter/absorber structures can be computed using multilayer fluctuational
electrodynamics. These two types of energy flows interact through radiation
absorption/luminescence and charge carrier generation/recombination. However,
past research has typically only assumed limited interaction, with thermal
radiation absorption as an input for charge carrier models to predict device
performance. To examine this assumption, we develop a fully-coupled iterative
model of charge and radiation transport in semiconductor devices, and we use
our model to analyze near-field and far-field GaSb thermophotovoltaic and
thermoradiative systems. By comparing our results to past methods that do not
consider cross-influences between charge and radiation transport, we find that
a fully-coupled approach is necessary to accurately model photon recycling and
near-field enhancement of external luminescence. Because these effects can
substantially alter device performance, our modeling approach can aid in the
design of efficient thermophotovoltaic and thermoradiative systems.

meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method that is able to extrapolate well
to out-of-distribution tasks without the need to reuse data from training, and
adapt almost instantaneously with the need of only a few samples during
testing. FLAP builds upon the idea of learning a shared linear representation
of the policy so that when adapting to a new task, it suffices to predict a set
of linear weights. A separate adapter network is trained simultaneously with
the policy such that during adaptation, we can directly use the adapter network
to predict these linear weights instead of updating a meta-policy via gradient
descent, such as in prior meta-RL methods like MAML, to obtain the new policy.
The application of the separate feed-forward network not only speeds up the
adaptation run-time significantly, but also generalizes extremely well to very
different tasks that prior Meta-RL methods fail to generalize to. Experiments
on standard continuous-control meta-RL benchmarks show FLAP presenting
significantly stronger performance on out-of-distribution tasks with up to
double the average return and up to 8X faster adaptation run-time speeds when

finding the best $k$ edges to insert to maximally reduce the structural bias.

hybrid systems. The first algorithm aims at hybrid systems exhibiting sliding
modes. The first algorithm has several features which distinguishes it from the
other algorithms for problems described by hybrid systems. First of all, it can
cope with hybrid systems which exhibit sliding modes. Secondly, the systems
motion on the switching surface is described by index 2 differential--algebraic
equations and that guarantees accurate tracking of the sliding motion surface.
Thirdly, the gradients of the problems functionals are evaluated with the help
of adjoint equations. The adjoint equations presented in the paper take into
account sliding motion and exhibit jump conditions at transition times. We
state optimality conditions in the form of the weak maximum principle for
optimal control problems with hybrid systems exhibiting sliding modes and with
piecewise differentiable controls. The second algorithm is for optimal control
problems with hybrid systems which do not exhibit sliding motion. In the case
of this algorithm we assume that control functions are measurable functions.
For each algorithm, we show that every accumulation point of the sequence
generated by the algorithm satisfies the weak maximum principle.

therefore, the presentation attack detection (PAD) has received significant
attention from research communities and has become a major field of research.
Researchers have tackled the problem with various methods, from exploiting
conventional texture feature extraction such as LBP, BSIF, and LPQ to using
deep neural networks with different architectures. Despite the results each of
these techniques has achieved for a certain attack scenario or dataset, most of
them still failed to generalized the problem for unseen conditions, as the
efficiency of each is limited to certain type of presentation attacks and
instruments (PAI). In this paper, instead of completely extracting hand-crafted
texture features or relying only on deep neural networks, we address the
problem via fusing both wide and deep features in a unified neural
architecture. The main idea is to take advantage of the strength of both
methods to derive well-generalized solution for the problem. We also evaluated
the effectiveness of our method by comparing the results with each of the

computationally intensive simulations to explore the possible design space.
Usually, such design relies on the prior definition of design parameters and
places restrictions on synthesizing novel shapes. In this work, we propose a
data-driven shape encoding and generating method, which automatically learns
representations from existing airfoils and uses the learned representations to
generate new airfoils. The representations are then used in the optimization of
synthesized airfoil shapes based on their aerodynamic performance. Our model is
built upon VAEGAN, a neural network that combines Variational Autoencoder with
Generative Adversarial Network and is trained by the gradient-based technique.
Our model can (1) encode the existing airfoil into a latent vector and
reconstruct the airfoil from that, (2) generate novel airfoils by randomly
sampling the latent vectors and mapping the vectors to the airfoil coordinate
domain, and (3) synthesize airfoils with desired aerodynamic properties by
optimizing learned features via a genetic algorithm. Our experiments show that
the learned features encode shape information thoroughly and comprehensively
without predefined design parameters. By interpolating/extrapolating feature
vectors or sampling from Gaussian noises, the model can automatically
synthesize novel airfoil shapes, some of which possess competitive or even
better aerodynamic properties comparing with training airfoils. By optimizing
shape on learned features via a genetic algorithm, synthesized airfoils can
evolve to have specific aerodynamic properties, which can guide designing
aerodynamic products effectively and efficiently.

planetesimals from cosmic dust. This process must overcome barriers to simple
collisional growth, for which the Streaming Instability (SI) is often invoked.
Dust evolution is still required to create particles large enough to undergo
vigorous instability. The SI has been studied primarily with single size dust,
and the role of the full evolved dust distribution is largely unexplored. We
survey the Polydispserse Streaming Instability (PSI) with physical parameters
corresponding to plausible conditions in protoplanetary discs. We consider a
full range of particle stopping times, generalized dust size distributions, and
the effect of turbulence. We find that, while the PSI grows in many cases more
slowly with a interstellar power-law dust distribution than with a single size,
reasonable collisional dust evolution, producing an enhancement of the largest
dust sizes, produces instability behaviour similar to the monodisperse case.
Considering turbulent diffusion the trend is similar. We conclude that if fast
linear growth of PSI is required for planet formation, then dust evolution
producing a distribution with peak stopping times on the order of 0.1 orbits
and an enhancement of the largest dust significantly above the single power-law
distribution produced by a fragmentation cascade is sufficient, along with
local enhancement of the dust to gas volume mass density ratio to order unity.

ranging from smart home control to payments using digital assistants. The input
to such services is often captured via an open voice channel, e.g., using a
microphone, in an unsupervised setting. One of the key operational security
requirements in such setting is the freshness of the input speech. We present
AEOLUS, a security overlay that proactively embeds a dynamic acoustic nonce at
the time of user interaction, and detects the presence of the embedded nonce in
the recorded speech to ensure freshness. We demonstrate that acoustic nonce can
(i) be reliably embedded and retrieved, and (ii) be non-disruptive (and even
imperceptible) to a VDS user. Optimal parameters (acoustic nonce's operating
frequency, amplitude, and bitrate) are determined for (i) and (ii) from a
practical perspective. Experimental results show that AEOLUS yields 0.5% FRR at
0% FAR for speech re-use prevention upto a distance of 4 meters in three
real-world environments with different background noise levels. We also conduct
a user study with 120 participants, which shows that the acoustic nonce does
not degrade overall user experience for 94.16% of speech samples, on average,

speech re-use and ensure the freshness of speech input.

how to construct a multi-attribute decision support system for choosing between
countermeasure strategies, such as lockdowns, designed to mitigate the effects

many novel elements to it: the pervasive uncertainty of the science; the
necessary dynamic shifts between regimes within each candidate suite of
countermeasures; and the fast moving stochastic development of the underlying
threat all present new challenges to this domain. Our methodology is
illustrated by demonstrating in a simplified example how the efficacy of
various strategies can be formally compared through balancing impacts of
countermeasures, not only on the short term (e.g. COVID-19 deaths) but the
medium to long term effects on the population (e.g increased poverty).

uncalibrated camera. However, regressing TTC for each pixel is not
straightforward, and most existing methods make over-simplifying assumptions

observer will collide with an obstacle within a certain time, which is often
more critical than knowing exact, per-pixel TTC. For such scenarios, our method
offers a temporal geofence in 6.4 ms -- over 25x faster than existing methods.

(i.e., Classical T Tauri stars; CTTS) have revealed different categories of
variability. Several of these classifications have been linked to changes in
$\dot{M}$. To test how accretion variability conditions lead to different
light-curve morphologies, we used 1D hydrodynamic simulations of accretion
along a magnetic field line coupled with radiative transfer models and a simple
treatment of rotation to generate synthetic light curves. We adopted previously
developed metrics in order to classify observations to facilitate comparisons
between observations and our models. We found that stellar mass, magnetic field
geometry, corotation radius, inclination, and turbulence all play roles in
producing the observed light curves and that no single parameter is entirely
dominant in controlling the observed variability. While the periodic behavior
of the light curve is most strongly affected by the inclination, it is also a
function of the magnetic field geometry and inner disk turbulence. Objects with
either pure dipole fields, strong aligned octupole components, or high
turbulence in the inner disk all tend to display accretion bursts. Objects with
anti-aligned octupole components or aligned, weaker octupole components tend to
show light curves with slightly fewer bursts. We did not find clear monotonic
trends between the stellar mass and empirical classification. This work
establishes the groundwork for more detailed characterization of well-studied
targets as more light curves of CTTS become available through missions such as
the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).

Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star coalescences can

behaviour of the neutron-star equation of state. In this study, we use
finite-entropy equations of state to show that a post-merger remnant can spin
up due to cooling. The magnitude of the spin-up depends on the neutron-star
equation of state. If hyperons are present, the post-merger spin-up changes the
peak gravitational-wave frequency by $\sim 540$ Hz, when the entropy per baryon
drops from $s=2$ $k_B$ to $s=0$ $k_B$. If hyperons are not present, the

environments, host galaxies, intervening galaxies along their lines-of-sight,
the intergalactic medium, and the Milky Way. The relative contributions of
these different media depend on their geometric configuration and the internal
properties of the gas. When these relative contributions are well understood,
FRB scattering is a powerful probe of density fluctuations along the
line-of-sight. The precise scattering measurements for FRB 121102 and FRB
180916 allow us to place an upper limit on the amount of scattering contributed
by the Milky Way halo to these FRBs. The scattering time $\tau\propto(\tilde{F}
\times {\rm DM}^2) A_\tau$, where ${\rm DM}$ is the dispersion measure,
$\tilde{F}$ quantifies electron density variations with $\tilde{F}=0$ for a
smooth medium, and the dimensionless constant $A_\tau$ quantifies the
difference between the mean scattering delay and the $1/e$ scattering time
typically measured. A likelihood analysis of the observed scattering and halo
DM constraints finds that $\tilde{F}$ is at least an order of magnitude smaller
in the halo than in the Galactic disk. The maximum pulse broadening from the
halo is $\tau\lesssim12$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz. We compare our analysis of the Milky
Way halo with other galaxy haloes by placing limits on the scattering

simulations of these processes require quantum mechanical (QM) information in

between the electronic and atomistic length scales is effected through an
ensemble density functional theory formulation of the embedded atom method

terms of ensembles of ionic states basis densities of individual atoms, and
charge polarization, in terms of atomic excited state basis densities. This
provides a highly compact yet general representation of the force field,

the field of medical image computing. Without a sufficient number of training
samples, deep learning based models are very likely to suffer from over-fitting
problem. The common solution is image manipulation such as image rotation,
cropping, or resizing. Those methods can help relieve the over-fitting problem
as more training samples are introduced. However, they do not really introduce
new images with additional information and may lead to data leakage as the test
set may contain similar samples which appear in the training set. To address
this challenge, we propose to generate diverse images with generative
adversarial network. In this paper, we develop a novel generative method named
generative adversarial U-Net , which utilizes both generative adversarial
network and U-Net. Different from existing approaches, our newly designed model
is domain-free and generalizable to various medical images. Extensive
experiments are conducted over eight diverse datasets including computed
tomography (CT) scan, pathology, X-ray, etc. The visualization and quantitative
results demonstrate the efficacy and good generalization of the proposed method

layer shapes and sizes, the research community has been investigating
flexible/reconfigurable accelerator substrates. This line of research has
opened up two challenges. The first is to determine the appropriate amount of
flexibility within an accelerator array that that can trade-off the performance
benefits versus the area overheads of the reconfigurability. The second is
being able to determine the right configuration of the array for the current
DNN model and/or layer and reconfigure the accelerator at runtime. This work
introduces a new class of accelerators that we call Self Adaptive
Reconfigurable Array (SARA). SARA architectures comprise of both a
reconfigurable array and a hardware unit capable of determining an optimized
configuration for the array at runtime. We demonstrate an instance of SARA with
an accelerator we call SAGAR, which introduces a novel reconfigurable systolic
array that can be configured to work as a distributed collection of smaller
arrays of various sizes or as a single array with flexible aspect ratios. We
also develop a novel recommendation neural network called ADAPTNET which
recommends an array configuration and dataflow for the current layer
parameters. ADAPTNET runs on an integrated custom hardware ADAPTNETX that runs
ADAPTNET at runtime and reconfigures the array, making the entire accelerator
self-sufficient. SAGAR is capable of providing the same mapping flexibility as
a collection of 1024 4x4 arrays working as a distributed system while achieving
3.5x more power efficiency and 3.2x higher compute density Furthermore, the
runtime achieved on the recommended parameters from ADAPTNET is 99.93% of the

one computer or a shared database, which raises data privacy and
confidentiality concerns. Therefore, limiting central access is important,
especially in healthcare settings, where data regulations are strict. A
potential approach to tackling this is Federated Learning (FL), which enables
multiple parties to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model by using
parameters of locally trained models while keeping raw training data locally.
In the context of AI-assisted pain-monitoring, we wish to enable
confidentiality-preserving and unobtrusive pain estimation for long-term
pain-monitoring and reduce the burden on the nursing staff who perform frequent
routine check-ups. To this end, we propose a novel Personalized Federated Deep
Learning (PFDL) approach for pain estimation from face images. PFDL performs
collaborative training of a deep model, implemented using a lightweight CNN
architecture, across different clients (i.e., subjects) without sharing their
face images. Instead of sharing all parameters of the model, as in standard FL,
PFDL retains the last layer locally (used to personalize the pain estimates).
This (i) adds another layer of data confidentiality, making it difficult for an
adversary to infer pain levels of the target subject, while (ii) personalizing
the pain estimation to each subject through local parameter tuning. We show
using a publicly available dataset of face videos of pain (UNBC-McMaster
Shoulder Pain Database), that PFDL performs comparably or better than the
standard centralized and FL algorithms, while further enhancing data privacy.
This, has the potential to improve traditional pain monitoring by making it
more secure, computationally efficient, and scalable to a large number of
individuals (e.g., for in-home pain monitoring), providing timely and
unobtrusive pain measurement.

multi-antenna NOMA literature. Instead of contrasting NOMA with OMA, we
contrast NOMA with two other baselines. The first is conventional Multi-User
Linear Precoding (MULP). The second is Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)
based on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) and SIC. We show that there is some
confusion about the benefits of NOMA, and we dispel the associated
misconceptions. First, we highlight why NOMA is inefficient in multi-antenna
settings based on basic multiplexing gain analysis. We stress that the issue
lies in how the NOMA literature has been hastily applied to multi-antenna
setups, resulting in a misuse of spatial dimensions and therefore loss in
multiplexing gains and rate. Second, we show that NOMA incurs a severe
multiplexing gain loss despite an increased receiver complexity due to an
inefficient use of SIC receivers. Third, we emphasize that much of the merits
of NOMA are due to the constant comparison to OMA instead of comparing it to
MULP and RS baselines. We then expose the pivotal design constraint that
multi-antenna NOMA requires one user to fully decode the messages of the other
users. This design constraint is responsible for the multiplexing gain erosion,
rate loss, and inefficient use of SIC receivers in multi-antenna settings. Our
results confirm that NOMA should not be applied blindly to multi-antenna
settings, highlight the scenarios where MULP outperforms NOMA and vice versa,
and demonstrate the inefficiency, performance loss and complexity disadvantages
of NOMA compared to RS. The first takeaway message is that, while NOMA is not
beneficial in most multi-antenna deployments. The second takeaway message is
that other non-orthogonal transmission frameworks, such as RS, exist which
fully exploit the multiplexing gain and the benefits of SIC to boost the rate
in multi-antenna settings.

establish and apply one-to-one-mapping between the equality of vectors

of projection pursuit, employing only a few of the infinitely many linear
combinations of observed vectors components. The displayed distribution-free
strategy is employed in retrospective and group sequential manners. The
asymptotic consistency of the proposed technique is shown. Monte Carlo studies
demonstrate that the proposed procedures exhibit extremely high and stable

model with unreliable links due to channel fading. Packets that are not
successfully delivered within their deadlines are of no value. We consider
traffic (packet arrival and deadline) and fading (link reliability) processes
that evolve as an unknown finite-state Markov chain. The performance metric is
efficiency ratio which is the fraction of packets of each link which are
delivered within their deadlines compared to that under the optimal (unknown)
policy. We first show a conversion result that shows classical non-real-time
scheduling algorithms can be ported to the real-time setting and yield a
constant efficiency ratio, in particular, Max-Weight Scheduling (MWS) yields an
efficiency ratio of 1/2. We then propose randomized algorithms that achieve
efficiency ratios strictly higher than 1/2, by carefully randomizing over the
maximal schedules. We further propose low-complexity and myopic distributed
randomized algorithms, and characterize their efficiency ratio. Simulation

nested data types. Rather than representing nested types via their Church
encodings in a higher-kinded or dependently typed extension of System F, we
adopt a functional programming perspective and design a Hindley-Milner-style
calculus with primitives for constructing nested types directly as fixpoints.
Our calculus can express all nested types appearing in the literature,
including truly nested types. At the level of terms, it supports primitive
pattern matching, map functions, and fold combinators for nested types. Our
main contribution is the construction of a parametric model for our calculus.
This is both delicate and challenging. In particular, to ensure the existence
of semantic fixpoints interpreting nested types, and thus to establish a
suitable Identity Extension Lemma for our calculus, our type system must
explicitly track functoriality of types, and cocontinuity conditions on the
functors interpreting them must be appropriately threaded throughout the model
construction. We also prove that our model satisfies an appropriate Abstraction
Theorem, as well as that it verifies all standard consequences of parametricity
in the presence of primitive nested types. We give several concrete examples
illustrating how our model can be used to derive useful free theorems,
including a short cut fusion transformation, for programs over nested types.
Finally, we consider generalizing our results to GADTs, and argue that no
extension of our parametric model for nested types can give a functorial
interpretation of GADTs in terms of left Kan extensions and still be
parametric.

(SCI), which captures high-speed videos using a low-speed 2D sensor (detector).
The underlying principle of SCI is to modulate sequential high-speed frames
with different masks and then these encoded frames are integrated into a
snapshot on the sensor and thus the sensor can be of low-speed. On one hand,
video SCI enjoys the advantages of low-bandwidth, low-power and low-cost. On
the other hand, applying SCI to large-scale problems (HD or UHD videos) in our
daily life is still challenging and one of the bottlenecks lies in the
reconstruction algorithm. Exiting algorithms are either too slow (iterative
optimization algorithms) or not flexible to the encoding process (deep learning
based end-to-end networks). In this paper, we develop fast and flexible
algorithms for SCI based on the plug-and-play (PnP) framework. In addition to
the PnP-ADMM method, we further propose the PnP-GAP (generalized alternating
projection) algorithm with a lower computational workload. We first employ the
image deep denoising priors to show that PnP can recover a UHD color video with
30 frames from a snapshot measurement. Since videos have strong temporal
correlation, by employing the video deep denoising priors, we achieve a
significant improvement in the results. Furthermore, we extend the proposed PnP
algorithms to the color SCI system using mosaic sensors, where each pixel only
captures the red, green or blue channels. A joint reconstruction and
demosaicing paradigm is developed for flexible and high quality reconstruction
of color video SCI systems. Extensive results on both simulation and real

the vulnerability to adversarial examples hinders their deployment in
safety-critical systems. Many studies have shown that attacks are also possible
even in a black-box setting where an adversary cannot access the target model's
internal information. Most black-box attacks are based on queries, each of
which obtains the target model's output for an input, and many recent studies
focus on reducing the number of required queries. In this paper, we pay
attention to an implicit assumption of query-based black-box adversarial
attacks that the target model's output exactly corresponds to the query input.
If some randomness is introduced into the model, it can break the assumption,
and thus, query-based attacks may have tremendous difficulty in both gradient
estimation and local search, which are the core of their attack process. From
this motivation, we observe even a small additive input noise can neutralize
most query-based attacks and name this simple yet effective approach Small
Noise Defense (SND). We analyze how SND can defend against query-based
black-box attacks and demonstrate its effectiveness against eight
state-of-the-art attacks with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Even with strong
defense ability, SND almost maintains the original classification accuracy and
computational speed. SND is readily applicable to pre-trained models by adding

orbits with the consequent high inbound velocities, but unlike comets, Manxes
display very little to no activity even near perihelion. This suggests that
they may have formed in circumstances different from typical LPCs; moreover,
this lack of significant activity also renders them difficult to detect at
large distances. Thus, analyzing their physical properties can help constrain
models of solar system formation as well as sharpen detection methods for those
classified as NEOs. Here, we focus on the Manx candidate A/2018 V3 as part of a
larger effort to characterize Manxes as a whole. This particular object was
observed to be inactive even at its perihelion at $q$ = 1.34 au in 2019
September. Its spectral reflectivity is consistent with typical organic-rich
comet surfaces with colors of $g'-r'= 0.67\pm0.02$, $r'-i' = 0.26\pm0.02$, and
$r'-z' = 0.45\pm0.02$, corresponding to a spectral reflectivity slope of
$10.6\pm 0.9$ %/100nm. A least-squares fit of our constructed light curve to
the observational data yields an average nucleus radius of $\approx$2 km
assuming an albedo of 0.04. This is consistent with the value measured from
NEOWISE. A surface brightness analysis for data taken 2020 July 13 indicated
possible low activity ($\lesssim0.68$ g $\rm s^{-1}$), but not enough to lift
optically significant amounts of dust. Finally, we discuss Manxes as a

that its direct integration can usher unique high-performance nanostructured

semiconductors has been reported recently, laser cooling of indirect bandgap
semiconductors such as group IV silicon and germanium remains a major
challenge. Here we report on the anomalous observation of dominant anti-Stokes

confluence of ultra-high purity nanocrystal germanium, generation of high
density of electron-hole plasma, the inherent degeneracy of longitudinal and
transverse optical phonons in non-polar indirect bandgap semiconductors, and
commensurate spatial confinement effects. At high laser intensities, laser
cooling with lattice temperature as low as ~50K is inferred.

the code reading and analytical skills of a reviewer. While several studies

anticipate potential issues given their limited experience in software

difficult to extract the subtle facial changes of micro-expressions. Recently,
several approaches proposed several expression-shared features algorithms for
micro-expression recognition. However, they do not reveal the specific
discriminative characteristics, which lead to sub-optimal performance. This
paper proposes a novel Feature Refinement ({FR}) with expression-specific
feature learning and fusion for micro-expression recognition. It aims to obtain
salient and discriminative features for specific expressions and also predict
expression by fusing the expression-specific features. FR consists of an
expression proposal module with attention mechanism and a classification
branch. First, an inception module is designed based on optical flow to obtain
expression-shared features. Second, in order to extract salient and
discriminative features for specific expression, expression-shared features are
fed into an expression proposal module with attention factors and proposal
loss. Last, in the classification branch, labels of categories are predicted by
a fusion of the expression-specific features. Experiments on three publicly
available databases validate the effectiveness of FR under different protocol.
Results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our FR provides salient and
discriminative information for micro-expression recognition. The results also
show our FR achieves better or competitive performance with the existing
state-of-the-art methods on micro-expression recognition.

For NEL, commercial systems struggle to link rare entities and lag their

as more content and services become available and users struggle to identify

methods have proved effective in user preference modeling, they violate the
triangle inequality and fail to capture fine-grained preference information. To
tackle this, we develop a distance-based recommendation model with several
novel aspects: (i) each user and item are parameterized by Gaussian
distributions to capture the learning uncertainties; (ii) an adaptive margin
generation scheme is proposed to generate the margins regarding different
training triplets; (iii) explicit user-user/item-item similarity modeling is
incorporated in the objective function. The Wasserstein distance is employed to
determine preferences because it obeys the triangle inequality and can measure
the distance between probabilistic distributions. Via a comparison using five
real-world datasets with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model
outperforms the best existing models by 4-22% in terms of recall@K on Top-K
recommendation.

  E-commerce Search",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Result relevance prediction is an essential task of e-commerce search engines
to boost the utility of search engines and ensure smooth user experience. The
last few years eyewitnessed a flurry of research on the use of
Transformer-style models and deep text-match models to improve relevance.
However, these two types of models ignored the inherent bipartite network
structures that are ubiquitous in e-commerce search logs, making these models
ineffective. We propose in this paper a novel Second-order Relevance, which is
fundamentally different from the previous First-order Relevance, to improve
result relevance prediction. We design, for the first time, an end-to-end
First-and-Second-order Relevance prediction model for e-commerce item
relevance. The model is augmented by the neighborhood structures of bipartite
networks that are built using the information of user behavioral feedback,
including clicks and purchases. To ensure that edges accurately encode
relevance information, we introduce external knowledge generated from BERT to
refine the network of user behaviors. This allows the new model to integrate
information from neighboring items and queries, which are highly relevant to
the focus query-item pair under consideration. Results of offline experiments
showed that the new model significantly improved the prediction accuracy in
terms of human relevance judgment. An ablation study showed that the
First-and-Second-order model gained a 4.3% average gain over the First-order
model. Results of an online A/B test revealed that the new model derived more
commercial benefits compared to the base model.

better understanding of the origin of HESS J1858+020, we further investigate
the association between SNR cosmic rays (CRs) and the clouds through the
Fermi-LAT analysis and hadronic modeling. Methods: We performed the Fermi-LAT
analysis to explore the GeV emission in and around the SNR. We explored the SNR
physics with previously observed multi-wavelength data. We built a hadronic
model using runaway CRs of the SNR to explain the GeV-TeV observation. Results:
We found a hard GeV source (SrcX2) that is spatially coincident with both HESS
J1858+020 and a molecular cloud complex at 3.6 kpc. In addition, a soft GeV
source (SrcX1) was found at the northern edge of the SNR. The GeV spectrum of
SrcX2 connects well with the TeV spectrum of HESS J1858+020. The entire
{\gamma}-ray spectrum ranges from several GeV up to tens of TeV and it follows
a power-law with an index of ~2.15. We discuss several pieces of observational
evidence to support the middle-aged SNR argument. Using runaway CRs from the
SNR, our hadronic model explains the GeV-TeV emission at HESS J1858+020, with a
diffusion coefficient that is much lower than the Galactic value.

  Distribution Prediction",,,"10.1002/mp.15025",,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Purpose: Radiation therapy treatment planning is a trial-and-error, often
time-consuming process. An optimal dose distribution based on a specific
anatomy can be predicted by pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. However,
dose distributions are often optimized based on not only patient-specific
anatomy but also physician preferred trade-offs between planning target volume
(PTV) coverage and organ at risk (OAR) sparing. Therefore, it is desirable to
allow physicians to fine-tune the dose distribution predicted based on patient
anatomy. In this work, we developed a DL model to predict the individualized 3D
dose distributions by using not only the anatomy but also the desired PTV/OAR
trade-offs, as represented by a dose volume histogram (DVH), as inputs.
Methods: The desired DVH, fine-tuned by physicians from the initially predicted
DVH, is first projected onto the Pareto surface, then converted into a vector,
and then concatenated with mask feature maps. The network output for training
is the dose distribution corresponding to the Pareto optimal DVH. The
training/validation datasets contain 77 prostate cancer patients, and the
testing dataset has 20 patients. Results: The trained model can predict a 3D
dose distribution that is approximately Pareto optimal. We calculated the
difference between the predicted and the optimized dose distribution for the
PTV and all OARs as a quantitative evaluation. The largest average error in
mean dose was about 1.6% of the prescription dose, and the largest average
error in the maximum dose was about 1.8%. Conclusions: In this feasibility
study, we have developed a 3D U-Net model with the anatomy and desired DVH as
inputs to predict an individualized 3D dose distribution. The predicted dose
distributions can be used as references for dosimetrists and physicians to
rapidly develop a clinically acceptable treatment plan.

remain open for time dependent problems as the contrast affects the time

new types of applications. CNNs are powerful machine learning models that
highlight features from grid data to make predictions (regression and
classification). The grid data object can be represented as vectors (in 1D),
matrices (in 2D), or tensors (in 3D or higher dimensions) and can incorporate
multiple channels (thus providing high flexibility in the input data
representation). CNNs highlight features from the grid data by performing
convolution operations with different types of operators. The operators
highlight different types of features (e.g., patterns, gradients, geometrical
features) and are learned by using optimization techniques. In other words,
CNNs seek to identify optimal operators that best map the input data to the
output data. A common misconception is that CNNs are only capable of processing
image or video data but their application scope is much wider; specifically,
datasets encountered in diverse applications can be expressed as grid data.
Here, we show how to apply CNNs to new types of applications such as optimal

entailed in such phenomena. Since the SARS outbreak in 2002, Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been one of the main tools scientists used to
investigate AT of respiratory viruses. Now, CFD simulations produce intuitive
and physically plausible colour-coded results that help scientists understand

requirements, for any CFD model to be of epistemic value to the scientific

investigated SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in different scenarios using CFD.
Here, I systematically review the published CFD studies of COVID-19 and discuss
their reproducibility criteria with respect to the CFD modeling process. Using
a Weighted Scoring Model (WSM), I propose a novel reproducibility index for CFD
simulations of SARS-CoV-2 AT. The proposed index $(0 \leq R^{CFD}_j \leq 1)$
relies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10 elements that represent
the possibility of a CFD study (j) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only 3 of

Without reproducible models, the scientific benefit of CFD simulations will

the paradigmatic Berk-Breizman cubic equation for the nonlinear mode evolution
reduces to a much simpler differential equation, dubbed the time-local cubic
equation, which can be solved directly. It is found that in addition to
increasing the saturation amplitude, drag introduces a shift in the apparent
oscillation frequency by modulating the saturated wave envelope. Excellent
agreement is found between the analytic solution for the mode evolution and
both the numerically integrated Berk-Breizman cubic equation and fully
nonlinear 1D Vlasov simulations. Experimentally isolating the contribution of
drag to the saturated mode amplitude for verification purposes is explored but
complicated by the reality that the amount of drag can not be varied
independently of other key parameters in realistic scenarios. While the effect
of drag is modest when the ratio of drag to scattering $\alpha/\nu$ is very
small, it can become substantial when $\alpha/\nu \gtrsim 0.5$, suggesting that
drag should be accounted for in quantitative models of fast-ion-driven
instabilities in fusion plasmas.

of PDEs using state of the art discretization techniques remains an expensive
proposition. In this work, a new physics-constrained neural network (NN)
approach is proposed to solve PDEs without labels, with a view to enabling
high-throughput solutions in support of design and decision-making. Distinct
from existing physics-informed NN approaches, where the strong form or weak
form of PDEs are used to construct the loss function, we write the loss
function of NNs based on the discretized residual of PDEs through an efficient,
convolutional operator-based, and vectorized implementation. We explore an
encoder-decoder NN structure for both deterministic and probabilistic models,
with Bayesian NNs (BNNs) for the latter, which allow us to quantify both
epistemic uncertainty from model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from
noise in the data. For BNNs, the discretized residual is used to construct the
likelihood function. In our approach, both deterministic and probabilistic
convolutional layers are used to learn the applied boundary conditions (BCs)
and to detect the problem domain. As both Dirichlet and Neumann BCs are
specified as inputs to NNs, a single NN can solve for similar physics, but with
different BCs and on a number of problem domains. The trained surrogate PDE
solvers can also make interpolating and extrapolating (to a certain extent)
predictions for BCs that they were not exposed to during training. Such
surrogate models are of particular importance for problems, where similar types
of PDEs need to be repeatedly solved for many times with slight variations. We
demonstrate the capability and performance of the proposed framework by
applying it to steady-state diffusion, linear elasticity, and nonlinear
elasticity.

Despite its mathematical simplicity, the relation is able to capture some of

elemental diversity in high entropy ceramics broadens the compositional space
but imposes great challenges in composition selection and property
investigation. We have utilized the valence electron concentration (VEC)
descriptor to design and predict properties of high entropy carbides. The VEC
regulates the Fermi energy and systematically alters the bonding
characteristics of materials. As a result, mechanical properties evolve as
function of the VEC. At VEC 8.4, the strong {\sigma} bonding states stem from
filled overlapping metal d and carbon p orbitals, which results in maximum
resistance to shear deformation and highest hardness. Beyond or below the
optimum VEC point of 8.4, mechanical response degrades due to filling or
emptying of energy orbitals that facilitates shear deformation. Furthermore,
the optimum VEC point can shift based on the constituent metals that formulate
the high entropy carbide. Our analyses demonstrate strong correlation between
calculated hardness and shear modulus. As an experimental complement, a set of
high entropy carbides are synthesized, and mechanical properties investigated.
The measured hardness follows theoretical predictions and the highest hardness
of ~30 GPa is achieved at VEC 8.4. In contrast, hardness decreases by 50% when
VEC is 9.4. Designing high entropy carbides based on VEC and understanding
mechanical properties at an electronic level enables one to manipulate the
composition spectrum to procure a desired mechanical response from a chemically
disordered crystal.

in a substantial increase in the 2Pr value (64 uC/cm2). However, the leakage
current increased considerably, which can affect the performance of
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) devices. To reduce the leakage current while
maintaining the mechanical stress during thermal annealing, a 10 nm Pt layer
was inserted between the W/HZO bottom interface. This resulted in a ~ 20-fold
decrease in the leakage current while the 2Pr value remained almost constant (~
60 uC/cm2). The increase in barrier height at the Pt/HZO interface compared to
that of the W/HZO interface coupled with the suppression of the formation of
interfacial oxides (WOx) by the introduction of a Pt/HZO interface serves to
decrease the leakage current.

their capability in producing high prediction accuracy. But model
interpretability is posing challenges to their widespread application in
security and safety-critical application domains. This paper aims for designing
an Interpretable Ensemble learning approach for image-based Malware Detection
(IEMD). We first propose a Selective Deep Ensemble Learning-based (SDEL)
detector and then design an Ensemble Deep Taylor Decomposition (EDTD) approach,
which can give the pixel-level explanation to SDEL detector outputs.
Furthermore, we develop formulas for calculating fidelity, robustness and
expressiveness on pixel-level heatmaps in order to assess the quality of EDTD
explanation. With EDTD explanation, we develop a novel Interpretable Dropout
approach (IDrop), which establishes IEMD by training SDEL detector. Experiment
results exhibit the better explanation of our EDTD than the previous
explanation methods for image-based malware detection. Besides, experiment
results indicate that IEMD achieves a higher detection accuracy up to 99.87%
while exhibiting interpretability with high quality of prediction results.
Moreover, experiment results indicate that IEMD interpretability increases with
the increasing detection accuracy during the construction of IEMD. This
consistency suggests that IDrop can mitigate the tradeoff between model
interpretability and detection accuracy.

likewise, instrumentation capable of achieving spatially-resolved field

was limited. With the improvement of instruments over the last five years,
hundreds of new FRBs have been discovered. The field is now undergoing a

restoration efforts of wild oysters are often unsuccessful, in that they do not
produce a robust population of oysters that are able to successfully reproduce.
Furthermore, the dynamics of wild oyster fertilization is not yet well
understood. Through conducting an experiment predicated on quantifying the
influence of elementary aspects of fertilization kinetics--sperm concentration,
gamete age, and success rate--we found that, as stochastic as the mating
process may seem, there are correlations which fundamentally serve as the
framework for assessing long-term sustainability, reef structure, and
hydrodynamic parameters in relation to fertilization. We then focused on
mathematically defining a procedure which simulated a concentration
distribution of a single sperm and egg release where there existed conditions
necessary for breeding to take place. We found a very significant impact of
both gamete age and sperm concentration on fertilization rate ($p < 0.0001$).
Our hydrodynamic model demonstrates that distance can also drastically
influence broadcast spawning. This could be used as a foundation for developing
a flexible model for wild oyster fertilization based on placement, initial
seawater conditions, and size of the starting population. The results of this
research could be implemented into a more user-friendly program which would
accept multiple variables as inputs and output the probability of fertilization
given arbitrary values. By accounting for environmental deviations, this
generalization would increase its compatibility with the public and actualize
the project's intended purpose: enhance the planning of oyster reef restoration
projects.

resources, making rapid and accurate triage of patients presenting to emergency

deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient
deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e.,
transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased
oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of
COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on
related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the
pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use
self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the
pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for
downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration
prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event
within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of
0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours

formation by their spinning motion. This mechanism has been discussed as
rotational disruption for the interstellar dust grains. We theoretically
calculate whether porous dust aggregates can be disrupted by their spinning
motion and if it prohibits dust growth in protoplanetary disks. We assume
radiative torque and gas-flow torque as driving sources of the spinning motion,
assume that dust aggregates reach a steady-state rigid rotation, and compare
the obtained tensile stress due to the centrifugal force with their tensile
strength. We model the irregularly-shaped dust aggregates by introducing a
parameter, $\gamma_\mathrm{ft}$, that mimics the conversion efficiency from
force to torque. As a result, we find that porous dust aggregates are
rotationally disrupted by their spinning motion induced by gas flow when their
mass is larger than $\sim10^8$ g and their volume filling factor is smaller
than $\sim 0.01$ in our fiducial model, while relatively compact dust
aggregates with volume filling factor more than 0.01 do not face this problem.
If we assume the dust porosity evolution, we find that dust aggregates whose
Stokes number is $\sim0.1$ can be rotationally disrupted in their growth and
compression process. Our results suggest that the growth of dust aggregates may
be halted due to rotational disruption or that other compression mechanisms are
needed to avoid it. We also note that dust aggregates are not rotationally
disrupted when $\gamma_\mathrm{ft}\leq0.02$ in our fiducial model and the
modeling of irregularly-shaped dust aggregates is essential in future work.

to obstacles in the virtual environment as closely as possible. To quantify a
controller's performance in complex environments, we introduce a new metric,
Complexity Ratio (CR), to measure the relative environment complexity and

but it is largely unknown how they affect sunspot waves and oscillations. It is
also under debate as to whether the flare-induced photospheric changes are due
to the momentum conservation with coronal mass ejections or due to magnetic
reconnection. To shed light on the so-called ""back reaction"" of solar
eruptions, we investigated how running penumbral waves (RPWs) at one foot of an
erupting magnetic flux rope (MFR) responds to the rope buildup and subsequent
erosion. During the rope-buildup stage, the western foot of the rope, which is
completely enclosed by a hooked ribbon, expands rapidly and consequently
overlaps a sunspot penumbra. This converts the original penumbral field into
the rope field, which is associated with a transient increase in electric
currents flowing through the ribbon-swept penumbral region. During the
rope-erosion stage, the rope foot shrinks as the eastern section of the hooked
ribbon slowly sweeps the same penumbral region, where the rope field is
converted into flare loops. This conversion induces mixed effects on the
photospheric field inclination but heats up the low atmosphere at the
footpoints of these flare loops to transition-region temperatures, therefore
resulting in the post-eruption RPWs with an enhanced contrast in the 1600A
passband and an extended bandwidth to low frequencies at 3-5 mHz, compared with
the pre-eruption RPWs that peak at 6 mHz. This observation clearly demonstrates
that it is the magnetic reconnection in the corona that impacts the low
atmosphere and leads to the changing behaviors of RPWs, which, in turn, offer a
new window to diagnose flare reconnections.

Structural characterizations revealed that the crystallinity, in terms of the

Despite the large Ru deficiency (30%), the SrRu0.7O3 films showed metallic

fascinating phenomenon of Weyl fermion transport was not observed for the

action seconds before it is performed for egocentric videos. Previous
approaches focus on summarizing the observed content and directly predicting
future action based on past observations. We believe it would benefit the
action anticipation if we could mine some cues to compensate for the missing
information of the unobserved frames. We then propose to decompose the action
anticipation into a series of future feature predictions. We imagine how the
visual feature changes in the near future and then predicts future action
labels based on these imagined representations. Differently, our ImagineRNN is
optimized in a contrastive learning way instead of feature regression. We
utilize a proxy task to train the ImagineRNN, i.e., selecting the correct
future states from distractors. We further improve ImagineRNN by residual
anticipation, i.e., changing its target to predicting the feature difference of
adjacent frames instead of the frame content. This promotes the network to
focus on our target, i.e., the future action, as the difference between
adjacent frame features is more important for forecasting the future. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale egocentric action datasets validate the
effectiveness of our method. Our method significantly outperforms previous
methods on both the seen test set and the unseen test set of the EPIC Kitchens
Action Anticipation Challenge.

annihilation and decay of WIMPs over the entire electromagnetic spectrum has
become a matter of interest for the last few decades. WIMP annihilation to
Standard Model particles gives rise to a possibility of detection of this
signal at low radio frequencies via synchrotron radiation. Dwarf Spheroidal
Galaxies (dSphs) are expected to contain a huge amount of dark matter which
makes them promising targets to search for such large scale diffuse radio
emission. In this work, we present a stacking analysis of 23 dSph galaxies
observed at low frequency (147.5MHz) as part of the TIFR-GMRT Sky Survey
(TGSS). The non-detection of any signal from these stacking exercises put very
tight constraints on the dark matter parameters. The best limit comes from the
novel method of stacking after scaling the radio images of the individual dSph
galaxy fields after scaling them by the respective half-light radius. The
constraint on the thermally averaged cross-section is below the thermal relic
cross-section value over a range of WIMP mass for reasonable choices of
relevant astrophysical parameters. Such analysis using future deeper
observation of individual targets as well as stacking can potentially reveal
more about the WIMP dark matter properties.

many real-world applications. A special case arises when anomalies are occluded
in a small set of attributes, typically referred to as a subspace, and not
necessarily over the entire data space. In this paper, we propose a new
subspace analysis approach named Agglomerative Attribute Grouping (AAG) that
aims to address this challenge by searching for subspaces that are comprised of
highly correlative attributes. Such correlations among attributes represent a
systematic interaction among the attributes that can better reflect the
behavior of normal observations and hence can be used to improve the
identification of two particularly interesting types of abnormal data samples:
anomalies that are occluded in relatively small subsets of the attributes and
anomalies that represent a new data class. AAG relies on a novel
multi-attribute measure, which is derived from information theory measures of
partitions, for evaluating the ""information distance"" between groups of data
attributes. To determine the set of subspaces to use, AAG applies a variation
of the well-known agglomerative clustering algorithm with the proposed
multi-attribute measure as the underlying distance function. Finally, the set
of subspaces is used in an ensemble for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluation
demonstrates that, in the vast majority of cases, the proposed AAG method (i)
outperforms classical and state-of-the-art subspace analysis methods when used
in anomaly detection ensembles, and (ii) generates fewer subspaces with a fewer
number of attributes each (on average), thus resulting in a faster training
time for the anomaly detection ensemble. Furthermore, in contrast to existing
methods, the proposed AAG method does not require any tuning of parameters.

model compression. To obtain a highly compact model, most methods first perform
network pruning and then conduct network quantization based on the pruned
model. However, this strategy may ignore that they would affect each other and
thus performing them separately may lead to sub-optimal performance. To address
this, performing pruning and quantization jointly is essential. Nevertheless,
how to make a trade-off between pruning and quantization is non-trivial.
Moreover, existing compression methods often rely on some pre-defined
compression configurations. Some attempts have been made to search for optimal
configurations, which however may take unbearable optimization cost. To address
the above issues, we devise a simple yet effective method named Single-path Bit
Sharing (SBS). Specifically, we first consider network pruning as a special
case of quantization, which provides a unified view for pruning and
quantization. We then introduce a single-path model to encode all candidate
compression configurations. In this way, the configuration search problem is
transformed into a subset selection problem, which significantly reduces the
number of parameters, computational cost and optimization difficulty. Relying
on the single-path model, we further introduce learnable binary gates to encode
the choice of bitwidth. By jointly training the binary gates in conjunction
with network parameters, the compression configurations of each layer can be
automatically determined. Extensive experiments on both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
show that SBS is able to significantly reduce computational cost while
achieving promising performance. For example, our SBS compressed MobileNetV2
achieves 22.6x Bit-Operation (BOP) reduction with only 0.1% drop in the Top-1
accuracy.

for analysing silent and anisotropic big bang singularities. The results of the
present article concern the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to linear systems
of wave equations on the corresponding backgrounds. The main features are the
following: The assumptions do not involve any symmetry requirements and are
weak enough to be consistent with most big bang singularities for which the
asymptotic geometry is understood. The asymptotic rate of growth/decay of
solutions to linear systems of wave equations along causal curves going into
the singularity is determined by model systems of ODE's (depending on the
causal curve). Moreover, the model systems are essentially obtained by dropping
spatial derivatives and localising the coefficients along the causal curve.
This is in accordance with the BKL proposal. Note, however, that we here prove
this statement, we do not assume it. If the coefficients of the unknown and its
expansion normalised normal derivatives converge sufficiently quickly along a
causal curve, we obtain leading order asymptotics (along the causal curve) and
prove that the localised energy estimate (along the causal curve) is optimal.
In this setting, it is also possible to specify the leading order asymptotics
of solutions along the causal curve. On the other hand, the localised energy
estimate typically entails a substantial loss of derivatives.
  In the companion article, we deduce geometric conclusions by combining the
framework with Einstein's equations. In particular, the combination reproduces
the Kasner map and yields partial bootstrap arguments.

heralded distribution of two-party entanglement between two remote nodes has
only been realized with built-in-type quantum memories. These schemes suffer
from the trade-off between multiplexing capacity and deterministic properties
and hence hinder the development of efficient quantum repeaters. Quantum
repeaters based on absorptive quantum memories can overcome such limitations
because they separate the quantum memories and the quantum light sources. Here
we present an experimental demonstration of heralded entanglement between
absorptive quantum memories. We build two nodes separated by 3.5 metres, each
containing a polarization-entangled photon-pair source and a solid-state
quantum memory with bandwidth up to 1 gigahertz. A joint Bell-state measurement
in the middle station heralds the successful distribution of maximally
entangled states between the two quantum memories with a fidelity of 80.4 $\pm$
2.2 per cent ($\pm$1 standard deviation). The quantum nodes and channels
demonstrated here can serve as an elementary link of a quantum repeater.
Moreover, the wideband absorptive quantum memories used in the nodes are
compatible with deterministic entanglement sources and can simultaneously
support multiplexing, which paves the way for the construction of practical
solid-state quantum repeaters and high-speed quantum networks.

is particularly prevalent with control systems' log analysis in the form of
continuous signals. In this situation, an execution trace amounts to a
multivariate time-series of input and output signals, where different states of
the system correspond to different `phases` in the time-series. The main
challenge is to detect when these phase changes take place. Unfortunately, most
existing solutions are either univariate, make assumptions on the data

deep neural network that accepts as input a multivariate time series and
applies a set of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the non-linear
correlations between signals and the patterns over time.We show how this
approach can be used to accurately detect state changes, and how the inferred
models can be successfully applied to transfer-learning scenarios, to
accurately process traces from different products with similar execution
characteristics. Our experimental results on two UAV autopilot case studies
indicate that our approach is highly accurate (over 90% F1 score for state
classification) and significantly improves baselines (by up to 102% for change
point detection).Using transfer learning we also show that up to 90% of the
maximum achievable F1 scores in the open-source case study can be achieved by
reusing the trained models from the industrial case and only fine tuning them

framework with Einstein's equations. The main features of the results are the
following: The assumptions do not involve any symmetry requirements and are
weak enough to be consistent with most big bang singularities for which the
asymptotic geometry is understood. The framework gives a clear picture of the
asymptotic geometry. It also reproduces the Kasner map, conjectured in the
physics literature to constitute the essence of the asymptotic dynamics for
vacuum solutions to Einstein's equations. When combined with Einstein's
equations, the framework yields partial improvements of the assumptions
concerning, e.g., the expansion normalised Weingarten map $\mathcal{K}$ (one of
the central objects of the framework, defined as the Weingarten map of the
leaves of the foliation divided by the mean curvature). For example, the
expansion normalised normal derivative of $\mathcal{K}$ can, under suitable
assumptions concerning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$, be demonstrated to
decay exponentially and $\mathcal{K}$ can be demonstrated to converge
exponentially, even though we initially only impose weighted bounds on these
quantities. Finally, the framework gives a unified perspective on the existing
results. Moreover, in $3+1$-dimensions, the only parameters necessary to
interpret the results are the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$ and an additional
scalar function determined by the geometry induced on the leaves of the
foliation.
  In the companion article, we obtain conclusions concerning the asymptotic
behaviour of solutions to linear systems of wave equations on the backgrounds
consistent with the framework.

the Gross-Pitaevski and Poisson (GPP) equations. In the free-field (fuzzy)
limit of SFDM (FDM), structure is inhibited below the de Broglie wavelength
$\lambda_{\text{deB}}$, but resembles CDM on larger scales. Virialized haloes
have solitonic cores of radius $\sim \lambda_{\text{deB}}$ that follow the
ground-state attractor solution of GPP, surrounded by CDM-like envelopes. As
superfluid, SFDM is irrotational (vorticity-free) but can be unstable to vortex
formation. We previously showed this can happen in halo cores, from angular
momentum arising during structure formation, when repulsive self-interaction
(SI) is present to support them out to a second length scale
$\lambda_{\text{SI}}$ with $\lambda_{\text{SI}} > \lambda_{\text{deB}}$ (the
Thomas-Fermi regime), but only if SI is strong enough. This suggested FDM cores
(without SI) would not form vortices. FDM simulations later found vortices, but
only outside halo cores, consistent with our previous suggestion based upon
TF-regime analysis. We extend that analysis now to FDM, to show explicitly that
vortices should not arise in solitonic cores from angular momentum, modelling
them as either Gaussian spheres or compressible, ($n = 2$)-polytropic,
irrotational Riemann-S ellipsoids. We find that, for typical halo spin
parameters, angular momentum per particle is below $\hbar$, the minimum
required even for one singly-quantized vortex in the centre. Even for larger

resonant tunneling scenario. At the single-particle level of resonant
tunneling, particles tunnel under the barrier from, typically, the ground-state
in the left well to an excited state in the right well, i.e., states of
different shapes and properties are coupled when their one-particle energies
coincide. In two spatial dimensions, two types of resonant tunneling processes
are possible, to which we refer to as longitudinal and transversal resonant
tunneling. Longitudinal resonant tunneling implies that the state in the right
well is longitudinally-excited with respect to the state in the left well,
whereas transversal resonant tunneling implies that the former is
transversely-excited with respect to the latter. We show that interaction
between bosons makes resonant tunneling phenomena in two spatial dimensions
profoundly rich, and analyze these phenomena in terms of the loss of coherence
of the junction and development of fragmentation, and coupling between
transverse and longitudinal degrees-of-freedom and excitations. To this end, a
detailed analysis of the tunneling dynamics is performed by exploring the time
evolution of a few physical quantities, namely, the survival probability,
occupation numbers of the reduced one-particle density matrix, and the
many-particle position, momentum, and angular-momentum variances. In general,
we display the impact of the transversal and longitudinal degrees-of-freedom in

astrophysical observational data. This machinery works only if wormhole
evidences have been detected. Indeed, in our previous paper we showed how the
Poynting-Robertson critical hypersurfaces can be located in regions of strong
gravitational field and become valuable astrophysical probe to observationally
search for wormholes' existence. As examples, we apply our method to selected
wormhole solutions in different extended theories of gravity by producing

Finally, we discuss the obtained results and draw the conclusions.

improving average estimation error, but not all estimates matter equally. Since
learned models inevitably make mistakes, the goal should be to improve the

loss function, Flow-Loss, that explicitly optimizes for better query plans by
approximating the optimizer's cost model and dynamic programming search
algorithm with analytical functions. At the heart of Flow-Loss is a reduction
of query optimization to a flow routing problem on a certain plan graph in
which paths correspond to different query plans. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce the Cardinality Estimation Benchmark, which contains the ground truth
cardinalities for sub-plans of over 16K queries from 21 templates with up to 15
joins. We show that across different architectures and databases, a model
trained with Flow-Loss improves the cost of plans (using the PostgreSQL cost
model) and query runtimes despite having worse estimation accuracy than a model
trained with Q-Error. When the test set queries closely match the training
queries, both models improve performance significantly over PostgreSQL and are
close to the optimal performance (using true cardinalities). However, the
Q-Error trained model degrades significantly when evaluated on queries that are
slightly different (e.g., similar but not identical query templates), while the
Flow-Loss trained model generalizes better to such situations. For example, the
Flow-Loss model achieves up to 1.5x better runtimes on unseen templates
compared to the Q-Error model, despite leveraging the same model architecture

distractors. Both methods boost model performance on the Choice of Plausible

However, the corresponding mass-loss rates are rather uncertain. To improve
this, we calculated global line-driven wind models for Galactic B supergiants.
Our models predict radial wind structure directly from basic stellar
parameters. The hydrodynamic structure of the flow is consistently determined
from the photosphere in nearly hydrostatic equilibrium to supersonically
expanding wind. The radiative force is derived from the solution of the
radiative transfer equation in the comoving frame. We provide a simple formula
that predicts theoretical mass-loss rates as a function of stellar luminosity
and effective temperature. The mass-loss rate of B supergiants slightly
decreases with temperature down to about 22.5 kK, where the region of
recombination of Fe IV to Fe III starts to appear. In this region, which is
about 5 kK wide, the mass-loss rate gradually increases by a factor of about 6.
The increase of the mass-loss rate is associated with a gradual decrease of
terminal velocities by a factor of about 2. We compared the predicted wind
parameters with observations. While the observed wind terminal velocities are
reasonably reproduced by the models, the situation with mass-loss rates is less
clear. The mass-loss rates derived from observations that are uncorrected for
clumping are by a factor of 3 to 9 higher than our predictions on cool and hot
sides of the studied sample, respectively. These observations can be reconciled
with theory assuming a temperature-dependent clumping factor. On the other
hand, the mass-loss rate estimates that are not sensitive to clumping agree
with our predictions much better. Our predictions are by a factor of about 10
lower than the values currently used in evolutionary models appealing for
reconsideration of the role of winds in the stellar evolution.

system consists of two loops: an inner and an outer loop. A fractional
proportional-integral-derivative filter is used to achieve finite-time
convergence for position tracking errors at the outer loop. A fractional-order
sliding mode controller acts as a centralized controller at the inner-loop,
ensuring the finite-time stability of the velocity tracking error. In this
loop, the undesired effects of unknown external disturbance and parameter
uncertainties are compensated using estimators. Two disturbance estimators are
envisioned. The former is designed using fractional calculus. The latter is an
adaptive estimator, and it is constructed using the general dynamic of biped
robots. Stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system is finite-time

boundary tearing was observed locally due to He bubble segregation. However,
the tears did not result in transgranular crack propagation. The intensity of

Above 700 {\deg}C this was not observed, indicating damage recovery at the high

Telescope SPT-SZ survey. Of the 1005 redMaPPer selected clusters with measured
richness $\hat\lambda>40$ in the joint footprint, 207 are confirmed by SPT-SZ.
Using the mass information from the SZE signal, we calibrate the richness--mass
relation using a Bayesian cluster population model. We find a mass trend
$\lambda\propto M^{B}$ consistent with a linear relation ($B\sim1$), no
significant redshift evolution and an intrinsic scatter in richness of
$\sigma_{\lambda} = 0.22\pm0.06$. At low richness SPT-SZ confirms fewer
redMaPPer clusters than expected. We interpret this richness dependent deficit
in confirmed systems as due to the increased presence at low richness of low
mass objects not correctly accounted for by our richness-mass scatter model,
which we call contaminants. At a richness $\hat \lambda=40$, this population
makes up $>$12$\%$ (97.5 percentile) of the total population. Extrapolating
this to a measured richness $\hat \lambda=20$ yields $>$22$\%$ (97.5
percentile). With these contamination fractions, the predicted redMaPPer number
counts in different plausible cosmologies are compatible with the measured
abundance. The presence of such a population is also a plausible explanation
for the different mass trends ($B\sim0.75$) obtained from mass calibration
using purely optically selected clusters. The mean mass from stacked weak
lensing (WL) measurements suggests that these low mass contaminants are galaxy
groups with masses $\sim3$-$5\times 10^{13} $ M$_\odot$ which are beyond the

play an important role in information theory. They play a key role in
establishing concentration inequalities and in obtaining quantitative estimates
on the convergence to equilibrium of Markov processes. More recently, deep
links have been established between logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and strong
data processing inequalities. In this paper we study logarithmic Sobolev
inequalities from a computational point of view. We describe a hierarchy of
semidefinite programming relaxations which give certified lower bounds on the
logarithmic Sobolev constant of a finite Markov operator, and we prove that the
optimal values of these semidefinite programs converge to the logarithmic
Sobolev constant. Numerical experiments show that these relaxations are often
very close to the true constant even for low levels of the hierarchy. Finally,
we exploit our relaxation to obtain a sum-of-squares proof that the logarithmic
Sobolev constant is equal to half the Poincar\'e constant for the specific case
of a simple random walk on the odd $n$-cycle, with $n\in\{5,7,\dots,21\}$.

characterized by eosinophil accumulation in the esophageal mucosa. EoE
diagnosis includes a manual assessment of eosinophil levels in mucosal biopsies
- a time-consuming, laborious task that is difficult to standardize. One of the
main challenges in automating this process, like many other biopsy-based
diagnostics, is detecting features that are small relative to the size of the
biopsy. Results: In this work, we utilized hematoxylin- and eosin-stained
slides from esophageal biopsies from patients with active EoE and control
subjects to develop a platform based on a deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) that can classify esophageal biopsies with an accuracy of 85%,
sensitivity of 82.5%, and specificity of 87%. Moreover, by combining several
downscaling and cropping strategies, we show that some of the features
contributing to the correct classification are global rather than specific,
local features. Conclusions: We report the ability of artificial intelligence
to identify EoE using computer vision analysis of esophageal biopsy slides.
Further, the DCNN features associated with EoE are based on not only local
eosinophils but also global histologic changes. Our approach can be used for
other conditions that rely on biopsy-based histologic diagnostics.

by the recent success of hyperbolic embeddings in capturing hierarchical
relations, we propose to jointly learn the classifier parameters as well as the

advantage: i) the classifier generalizes better as it leverages the prior
knowledge of existence of a hierarchy over the labels, and ii) in addition to
the label co-occurrence information, the label-embedding may benefit from the
manifold structure of the input datapoints, leading to embeddings that are more
faithful to the label hierarchy. We propose a novel formulation for the joint
learning and empirically evaluate its efficacy. The results show that the joint
learning improves over the baseline that employs label co-occurrence based
pre-trained hyperbolic embeddings. Moreover, the proposed classifiers achieve
state-of-the-art generalization on standard benchmarks. We also present
evaluation of the hyperbolic embeddings obtained by joint learning and show
that they represent the hierarchy more accurately than the other alternatives.

etc., there is an emerging need of detecting online posts that can go against
the community acceptance standards. The hostility detection task has been well
explored for resource-rich languages like English, but is unexplored for
resource-constrained languages like Hindidue to the unavailability of large
suitable data. We view this hostility detection as a multi-label multi-class
classification problem. We propose an effective neural network-based technique
for hostility detection in Hindi posts. We leverage pre-trained multilingual
Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformer (mBERT) to obtain the
contextual representations of Hindi posts. We have performed extensive
experiments including different pre-processing techniques, pre-trained models,
neural architectures, hybrid strategies, etc. Our best performing neural
classifier model includes One-vs-the-Rest approach where we obtained 92.60%,
81.14%,69.59%, 75.29% and 73.01% F1 scores for hostile, fake, hate, offensive,
and defamation labels respectively. The proposed model outperformed the
existing baseline models and emerged as the state-of-the-art model for
detecting hostility in the Hindi posts.

for arithmetic box spaces of the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups $BS(1,m)$

upper triangular matrices in $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}[1/m])$ and intersecting with a
family $M_{N_k}$ of congruence subgroups of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}[1/m])$, where the
levels $N_k$ are coprime with $m$ and $N_k|N_{k+1}$. We prove:
  - if an arithmetic box space has $D_\alpha$, then $\alpha\le\frac{1}{2}$~;
  - if the family $(N_k)_k$ of levels is supported on finitely many primes, the
corresponding arithmetic box space has $D_{1/2}$~;
  - if the family $(N_k)_k$ of levels is supported on a family of primes with

  Moreover, we prove that if we embed $BS(1,m)$ in the group of invertible
upper-triangular matrices $T_n(\mathbb{Z}[1/m])$, then every finite index
subgroup of the embedding contains a congruence subgroup. This is a version of
the congruence subgroup property (CSP).

sample of major merging systems at 0.3<z<2.5. Galaxies in this merger sample
have projected separations between 3 to 15 kpc and are selected from the
CANDELS/3D-HST catalogs using a peak-finding algorithm. AGNs in mergers and
non-mergers are identified on the basis of their X-ray emission, optical lines,
mid-infrared colors, and radio emission. Among galaxies with adequate
measurements to find potential AGNs, we find a similar fraction of AGNs in
mergers (16.4%) compared to the fraction found in non-merging galaxies (15.4%).
In mergers, this fraction is obtained by assuming that, in unresolved
observations, only one of the merging galaxies is the AGN source. The
similarity between the fractions is possibly due to the higher availability of
cold gas at high redshifts, where the excess of nuclear activity as a result of
merging is less important than at lower redshifts. Star-forming galaxies have a
higher incidence of AGNs than quiescent galaxies. In particular, starbursts in
mergers are the most common sites of AGN activity since they present higher AGN
fractions and black hole accretion rates. We find no clear correlation between
the black hole accretion rate and the galaxy properties (i.e., star-formation
rate, stellar mass) in mergers and non-mergers. However, mergers seem to have a
higher correlation with star formation than non-mergers, which possibly
indicates that the merging process is starting to influence the star formation
and AGN activity even at this pre-coalescence stage.

play a significant role in biological systems. Accordingly, in recent years
there has been increased interest in the role of sulfur in astrochemical
reactions and planetary geology and geochemistry. Among the many avenues of
research currently being explored is the laboratory processing of astrophysical
ice analogues. Such research involves the synthesis of an ice of specific
morphology and chemical composition at temperatures and pressures relevant to a
selected astrophysical setting (such as the interstellar medium or the surfaces
of icy moons). Subsequent processing of the ice under conditions that simulate
the selected astrophysical setting commonly involves radiolysis, photolysis,
thermal processing, neutral-neutral fragment chemistry, or any combination of
these, and has been the subject of several studies. The in-situ changes in ice
morphology and chemistry occurring during such processing has been monitored
via spectroscopic or spectrometric techniques. In this paper, we have reviewed
the results of laboratory investigations concerned with sulfur chemistry in
several astrophysical ice analogues. Specifically, we review (i) the
spectroscopy of sulfur-containing astrochemical molecules in the condensed
phase, (ii) atom and radical addition reactions, (iii) the thermal processing
of sulfur-bearing ices, (iv) photochemical experiments, (v) the non-reactive
charged particle radiolysis of sulfur-bearing ices, and (vi) sulfur ion

Despite these improvements, DNA sequencers output hundreds or thousands of

techniques have not kept the pace with rapidly improving sequencing

the complexity associated with biological data. Modern computer architectures

synergistic use of knowledge from both domains, (i.e, DNA sequence analysis and

examined for algorithmic components that cause performance bottlenecks.
Identified bottlenecks are resolved through architecture-aware optimisations at

various such predictors, based on both observational data (WSO magnetograms,
MWO polar faculae counts and Pulkovo $A(t)$ index) and outputs (polar cap
magnetic flux and global dipole moment) of various existing flux transport
dynamo models.We calculate Pearson correlation coefficients ($r$) of the
predictors with the next cycle amplitude as a function of time measured from
several solar cycle landmarks: setting $r= 0.8$ as a lower limit for acceptable
predictions, we find that observations and models alike indicate that the
earliest time when the polar predictor can be safely used is 4 years after
polar field reversal. This is typically 2--3 years before solar minimum and
about 7~years before the predicted maximum, considerably extending the {usual}
temporal scope of the polar precursor method. Re-evaluating the predictors
another 3 years later, at the time of solar minimum, further increases the
correlation level to $r\ga 0.9$. As an illustration of the result, we determine
the predicted amplitude of Cycle 25 based on the value of the WSO polar field
at the now official minimum date of December 2019 as $126\pm 3$. A forecast
based on the value in early 2017, 4~years after polar reversal would have only

theory of phonons as Goldstone bosons in crystals, glasses and liquids based on
non-affine displacements and the consequent Goldstones phase relaxation. We
relate the conservation, or lack thereof, of specific higher-form currents with
properties of the underlying deformation field -- non-affinity -- which
dictates how molecules move under an applied stress or deformation. In
particular, the single-valuedness of the deformation field is associated with
conservation of higher-form charges that count the number of topological
defects. Our formalism predicts, from first principles, the presence of
propagating shear waves above a critical wave-vector in liquids, thus giving
the first formal derivation of the phenomenon in terms of fundamental
symmetries. The same picture provides also a theoretical explanation of the
corresponding ""positive sound dispersion"" phenomenon for longitudinal sound.
Importantly, accordingly to our theory, the main collective relaxation
timescale of a liquid or a glass (known as the $\alpha$ relaxation for the
latter) is given by the phase relaxation time, which is not necessarily related
to the Maxwell time. Finally, we build a non-equilibrium effective action using
the in-in formalism defined on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, that further
supports the emerging picture. In summary, our work suggests that the
fundamental difference between solids, fluids and glasses has to be identified
with the associated generalized higher-from global symmetries and their
topological structure, and that the Burgers vector for the displacement fields

from the direction of Andromeda. The emission is centered on the galaxy, and
extends for $\sim 100-200$ kpc away from its center. Explaining the extended
$\gamma-$ray emission within the framework of standard scenarios for the escape
of cosmic rays injected in the galactic disk or in the galactic center is
problematic. In this paper, we argue that a cosmic ray origin (either leptonic
or hadronic) of the $\gamma$-ray emission is possible in the framework of non
standard cosmic ray propagation scenarios or in the case of particle
acceleration taking place in the galaxy's halo. It would imply the existence of
a giant cosmic ray halo surrounding M31, possibly powered by the galaxy nuclear
activity, or by accretion of intergalactic gas. Remarkably, if cosmic ray
halos, as the one observed around M31, are a common feature of galaxies,
including our own, the interactions between cosmic ray protons and the Milky
Way circumgalactic gas could also explain the isotropic diffuse flux of
neutrinos observed by Icecube.

training on a large number of annotated images. However, a meta-learning
challenge known as a low-shot image recognition task comes when only a few
images with annotations are available for learning a recognition model for one
category. The objects in testing/query and training/support images are likely
to be different in size, location, style, and so on. Our method, called
Cascaded Feature Matching Network (CFMN), is proposed to solve this problem. We
train the meta-learner to learn a more fine-grained and adaptive deep distance
metric by focusing more on the features that have high correlations between
compared images by the feature matching block which can align associated
features together and naturally ignore those non-discriminative features. By
applying the proposed feature matching block in different layers of the
few-shot recognition network, multi-scale information among the compared images
can be incorporated into the final cascaded matching feature, which boosts the
recognition performance further and generalizes better by learning on
relationships. The experiments for few-shot learning on two standard datasets,
\emph{mini}ImageNet and Omniglot, have confirmed the effectiveness of our
method. Besides, the multi-label few-shot task is first studied on a new data
split of COCO which further shows the superiority of the proposed feature
matching network when performing few-shot learning in complex images. The code

but it is also the one with a significant level of label noise. Recent studies
have shown that many samples contain multiple classes, despite being assumed to
be a single-label benchmark. They have thus proposed to turn ImageNet
evaluation into a multi-label task, with exhaustive multi-label annotations per
image. However, they have not fixed the training set, presumably because of a
formidable annotation cost. We argue that the mismatch between single-label
annotations and effectively multi-label images is equally, if not more,
problematic in the training setup, where random crops are applied. With the
single-label annotations, a random crop of an image may contain an entirely
different object from the ground truth, introducing noisy or even incorrect
supervision during training. We thus re-label the ImageNet training set with
multi-labels. We address the annotation cost barrier by letting a strong image
classifier, trained on an extra source of data, generate the multi-labels. We
utilize the pixel-wise multi-label predictions before the final pooling layer,
in order to exploit the additional location-specific supervision signals.
Training on the re-labeled samples results in improved model performances
across the board. ResNet-50 attains the top-1 classification accuracy of 78.9%
on ImageNet with our localized multi-labels, which can be further boosted to
80.2% with the CutMix regularization. We show that the models trained with

the task. We measure participants' gaze patterns with a wearable eye-tracker
and gauge their perception of the robot and engagement with it and the joint

chat is an indicator of a robot's uncanniness and that the more people gaze at
the robot in a joint task, the worse they perform. In contrast with most HRI
literature, our results show that gaze towards an object of shared attention,
rather than gaze towards a robotic partner, is the most meaningful predictor of
engagement in a joint task. Furthermore, the analyses of gaze patterns in
repeated interactions disclose that people's mutual gaze in a social chat
develops congruently with their perceptions of the robot over time. These are
key findings for the HRI community as they entail that gaze behavior can be
used as an implicit measure of people's perception of robots in a social chat

deployment of deep object detectors in safety-critical tasks. In this work, we
focus on estimating predictive distributions for bounding box regression output
with variance networks. We show that in the context of object detection,
training variance networks with negative log likelihood (NLL) can lead to high
entropy predictive distributions regardless of the correctness of the output
mean. We propose to use the energy score as a non-local proper scoring rule and
find that when used for training, the energy score leads to better calibrated
and lower entropy predictive distributions than NLL. We also address the
widespread use of non-proper scoring metrics for evaluating predictive
distributions from deep object detectors by proposing an alternate evaluation
approach founded on proper scoring rules. Using the proposed evaluation tools,
we show that although variance networks can be used to produce high quality
predictive distributions, ad-hoc approaches used by seminal object detectors
for choosing regression targets during training do not provide wide enough data
support for reliable variance learning. We hope that our work helps shift
evaluation in probabilistic object detection to better align with predictive
uncertainty evaluation in other machine learning domains. Code for all models,

future, will help reduce systematic errors in gravitational waveform
extraction. We also study a setup with truncation error matching. Our
SBP-Stable scheme guarantees energy-balance for a class of linear wave
equations at the semidiscrete level. We develop also specialized dissipation
operators. The whole construction is made at second order accuracy in spherical
symmetry, but could be straightforwardly generalized to higher order or
spectral accuracy without symmetry. In a practical implementation we evolve
first a scalar field obeying the linear wave equation and observe, as expected,
long term stability and norm convergence. We obtain similar results with a
potential term. To examine the limitations of the approach we consider a
massive field, whose equations of motion do not regularize, and whose dynamics
near null infinity, which involve excited incoming pulses that can not be
resolved by the code, is very different to that in the massless setting. We
still observe excellent energy conservation, but convergence is not
satisfactory. Overall our results suggest that compactified hyperboloidal
slices are likely to be provably effective whenever the asymptotic solution

this article. A novel integral sliding-mode parallel control (ISMPC) approach
is developed, where an uncertain piecewise affine system (PWA) is constructed
to model a nonaffine continuous-time nonlinear system equivalently on a compact
region containing the origin. A piecewise sliding-mode parallel controller is
designed to globally stabilize the PALM and, consequently, to semiglobally
stabilize the original nonlinear system. The proposed scheme enjoys three
favorable features: (i) some restrictions on the system input channel are
eliminated, thus the developed method is more relaxed compared with the
published approaches; (ii) it is convenient to be used to deal with both
matched and unmatched uncertainties of the system; and (iii) the proposed
piecewise parallel controller generates smooth control signals even around the
boundaries between different subspaces, which makes the developed control
strategy more implementable and reliable. Moreover, we provide discussions
about the universality analysis of the developed control strategy for two kinds
of typical nonlinear systems. Simulation results from two numerical examples
further demonstrate the performance of the developed control approach.

NFAs. A partial DFA is called synchronizing if it has a word (called a reset
word) whose action brings a non-empty subset of states to a unique state and is
undefined for all other states. While in the general case the problem of
checking whether a partial DFA is synchronizing is PSPACE-complete, we show
that in the strongly connected case this problem can be efficiently reduced to
the same problem for a complete DFA. Using combinatorial, algebraic, and formal
languages methods, we develop techniques that relate main synchronization
problems for strongly connected partial DFAs with the same problems for
complete DFAs. In particular, this includes the \v{C}ern\'{y} and the rank
conjectures, the problem of finding a reset word, and upper bounds on the
length of the shortest reset words of literal automata of finite prefix codes.
We conclude that solving fundamental synchronization problems is equally hard
in both models, as an essential improvement of the results for one model
implies an improvement for the other.

result in fractional electric charges localized to the hinges and corners of

a collinear antiferromagnet with spin $S$ defined on a $d$-dimensional cubic
lattice features fractionally quantized magnetization $M_{\text{c}}^z=S/2^d$ at
the corners. We find that the quantization is robust even in the presence of
gapless excitations originating from the spontaneous formation of the N\'eel
order, although the localization length diverges, suggesting a power-law
localization of the corner magnetization. When the spin rotational symmetry
about the $z$ axis is explicitly broken, the corner magnetization is no longer
sharply quantized. Even in this case, we numerically find that the deviation
from the quantized value is negligibly small based on quantum Monte Carlo
simulations.

Here, we expose for the first time that the topological nodal gimbal phonons,

recently realized new allotrope of carbon. At about 15.2 THz, we find that
there exist three mutually intersecting nodal loops (named as nodal gimbal
phonons) around {\Gamma} point, and two pairs of type-I Weyl phonons on the
boundary of Brillouin zone around each X point. In addition, there exist three
pairs of type-II Weyl phonons at about 14.5 THz around each L point. It is
shown that these exotic topological phonons are protected by corresponding
symmetries, and lead to topologically nontrivial surface states. Our findings
not only afford plenty of intriguing topological phonon states in a simple
material like T-carbon but also provide a new platform to study novel
properties of topological phonons, which would facilitate further both
experimental and theoretical works in future.

eigenvectors corresponding to simple and well-separated eigenvalues. In the
non-symmetric case, the solution of shifted Hessenberg systems is a central
step. Existing inverse iteration solvers approach the solution of the shifted
Hessenberg systems with either RQ or LU factorizations and, once factored,
solve the corresponding systems. This approach has limited level-3 BLAS
potential since distinct shifts have distinct factorizations. This paper
rearranges the RQ approach such that data shared between distinct shifts is
exposed. Thereby the backward substitution with the triangular R factor can be
expressed mostly with matrix-matrix multiplications (level-3 BLAS). The
resulting algorithm computes eigenvectors in a tiled, overflow-free, and
task-parallel fashion. The numerical experiments show that the new algorithm
outperforms existing inverse iteration solvers for the computation of both real

from multiple modalities, typically from the vision and the language domains.
For images and their captions, the multiplicity of the correspondences makes
the task particularly challenging. Given an image (respectively a caption),
there are multiple captions (respectively images) that equally make sense. In
this paper, we argue that deterministic functions are not sufficiently powerful
to capture such one-to-many correspondences. Instead, we propose to use
Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embedding (PCME), where samples from the different
modalities are represented as probabilistic distributions in the common
embedding space. Since common benchmarks such as COCO suffer from
non-exhaustive annotations for cross-modal matches, we propose to additionally
evaluate retrieval on the CUB dataset, a smaller yet clean database where all
possible image-caption pairs are annotated. We extensively ablate PCME and
demonstrate that it not only improves the retrieval performance over its
deterministic counterpart but also provides uncertainty estimates that render
the embeddings more interpretable. Code is available at

of a hole with an off-center, self-gravitating distribution of scalar matter.
Some of these traits are incompatible with the thin disk approach, thus we
identify and map out various regions in the parameter space respectively. All
the solutions for which the stable circular orbital velocity (and angular
momentum) curve is continuous are used for building thin and optically thick
disks around them, from which we extract the radiant energy fluxes,
luminosities and efficiencies. We compare the results in batches with the same
spin parameter $j$ but different normalized charges, and the profiles are
richly diverse. Because of the existence of a conserved scalar charge, $Q$,
these solutions are non-unique in the $(M, J)$ parameter space. Furthermore,
$Q$ cannot be extracted asymptotically from the metric functions. Nevertheless,
by constraining the parameters through different observations, the luminosity
profile could in turn be used to constrain the Noether charge and characterize
the spacetime, should KBHsSH exist.

some of the nodes may behave maliciously. The approach is to equip all nodes
with a scheme to detect neighboring nodes when they behave in an abnormal

information regarding their neighbor nodes. Such two-hop communication has long
been studied in fault-tolerant algorithms in computer science. We propose two
distributed schemes for detection of malicious nodes and resilient consensus
with different requirements on resources for communication and the structures
of the networks. In particular, the detection schemes become effective under
certain connectivity properties in the network so that the non-malicious nodes
can share enough information about their neighbors. It is shown that the
requirements are however less stringent than those for conventional algorithms.

concept of two mesh adaptation approaches: (1) The virtual ring shear-slip mesh

research efforts mainly focus on key elements, adopter categories, and the
process of innovation diffusion. However, most of them only consider single
innovations. With the development of modern technology, recurrent innovations
gradually come into vogue. In order to reveal the characteristics of recurrent
innovations, we present the first large-scale analysis of the adoption of
recurrent innovations in the context of mobile app updates. Our analysis
reveals the adoption behavior and new adopter categories of recurrent
innovations as well as the features that have impact on the process of
adoption.

smaller secondary droplets detach from the main droplet during impact. While
droplet splashing on smooth surfaces is by now well understood, the surface
roughness also affects at which impact velocity a droplet splashes. In this
study, the influence of the surface roughness on droplet splashing is
investigated. By changing the root mean square roughness of the impacted
surface, we show that the droplet splashing velocity is only affected when the
droplet roughness is large enough to disrupt the spreading droplet lamella and
change the droplet splashing mechanism from corona to prompt splashing.
Finally, using Weber and Ohnesorge number scaling models, we also show that the
measured splashing velocity for both water and ethanol on surfaces with
different roughness and water-ethanol mixtures collapse onto a single curve,
showing that the droplet splashing velocity on rough surfaces scales with the
Ohnesorge number defined with the surface roughness length scale.

half of the observed electron distributions have features consistent with an

with narrowband waves. A comparison of the wave power in the whistler-mode
frequency band to pitch angle width and a measure of anisotropy provides
additional evidence for the electron scattering by whistler-mode waves. The
pitch angle broadening occurs in over an energy range comparable to that
obtained for the n=1 (co-streaming) resonance for the observed wave and plasma

Dirac and Majorana neutrinos relativistically by using the Dirac equation. We
present various oscillation probabilities for including wrong-helicity
neutrinos, right-handed neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. We summarize the
relations between these probabilities. As neutrinos have finite mass, there are
two components for each chirality corresponding to positive and negative
helicities. We show that the probability is different for each component even
if neutrinos have the same chirality. The probabilities derived by the
relativistic equation depend on not only the mass squared differences but also
the absolute masses of neutrinos. Besides, the new CP phases appear in the
probabilities of oscillations with chirality-flip. These new CP phases are
equivalent to the Majorana CP phases in the case of Majorana neutrinos. We
investigate the CP dependence of oscillation probabilities in vacuum. There are
no direct CP violation in $\nu_{\alpha}\leftrightarrow \nu_{\beta}^c$
oscillations even if the flavors, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are different as in the
same as two generations. In other words, the difference between the
CP-conjugate probabilities vanishes. However, in three generations or more, the
sine terms of new CP phases appear in the probabilities in addition to the
cosine terms. This is different from the result obtained in two generations.
Furthermore, the zero-distance effect does not appear in our formulation.

rare giant flares of gamma-rays, the most luminous astrophysical phenomena in
our Galaxy. The detection of these flares from outside the Local Group of
galaxies has been predicted, with just two candidates so far. Here we report on
the extremely bright gamma-ray flare GRB 200415A of April 15, 2020, which we
localize, using the Interplanetary Network, to a tiny (20 sq. arcmin) area on
the celestial sphere, that overlaps the central region of the Sculptor galaxy
at 3.5 Mpc from the Milky Way. From the Konus-Wind detections, we find a
striking similarity between GRB 200415A and GRB 051103, the even more energetic
flare that presumably originated from the M81/M82 group of galaxies at nearly
the same distance (3.6 Mpc). Both bursts display a sharp, millisecond-scale,
hard-spectrum initial pulse, followed by an approximately 0.2 s long steadily
fading and softening tail. Apart from the huge initial pulses of magnetar giant
flares, no astrophysical signal with this combination of temporal and spectral
properties and implied energy has been reported previously. At the inferred
distances, the energy released in both flares is on par with that of the
December 27, 2004 superflare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1806-20, but with a
higher peak luminosity. Taken all together, this makes GRB 200415A and its twin
GRB 051103 the most significant candidates for extragalactic magnetar giant
flares, both a factor of five more luminous than the brightest Galactic
magnetar flare observed previously, thus providing an important step towards a
better understanding of this fascinating phenomenon.

by simulating many giant impacts using a smoothed particle hydrodynamical code

collision. Using an $N$-body code, we simulate the spatial evolution of the
vapour generated dust post-impact.
  We show that impacts release vapour anisotropically not isotropically as has
been assumed previously and that the distribution of the resulting generated
dust is dependent on the mass ratio and impact angle of the collision. In
addition, we show that the anisotropic distribution of post-collision dust can
cause the formation or lack of formation of the short-term variation in flux
depending on the orientation of the collision with respect to the orbit around
the central star. Finally, our results suggest that there is a narrow region of
semi-major axis where a vapour generated disk would be observable for any
significant amount of time implying that giant impacts where most of the
escaping mass is in vapour would not be observed often but this does not mean
that the collisions are not occurring.

space agencies, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), are looking for
automated solutions for the assessment of software testing activities, which
play a crucial role in this context.
  Over the years, mutation analysis has shown to be a promising solution for
the automated assessment of test suites; it consists of measuring the quality
of a test suite in terms of the percentage of injected faults leading to a test
failure. A number of optimization techniques, addressing scalability and
accuracy problems, have been proposed to facilitate the industrial adoption of
mutation analysis. However, to date, two major problems prevent space agencies
from enforcing mutation analysis in space software development.
  In this paper, we enhance mutation analysis optimization techniques to enable
their applicability to embedded software and propose a pipeline that
successfully integrates them to address scalability and accuracy issues in this
context, as described above. Further, we report on the largest study involving
embedded software systems in the mutation analysis literature. Our research is
part of a research project funded by ESA ESTEC involving private companies
(GomSpace Luxembourg and LuxSpace) in the space sector. These industry partners
provided the case studies reported in this paper; they include an on-board
software system managing a microsatellite currently on-orbit, a set of
libraries used in deployed cubesats, and a mathematical library certified by
ESA.

matrix factorization are provably solved by simple gradient descent algorithms
with strong computational and statistical guarantees. However, when the
low-rank matrices are asymmetric, existing approaches rely on adding a
regularization term to balance the scale of the two matrix factors which in
practice can be removed safely without hurting the performance when initialized
via the spectral method. In this paper, we provide a theoretical justification
to this for the matrix sensing problem, which aims to recover a low-rank matrix
from a small number of linear measurements. As long as the measurement ensemble
satisfies the restricted isometry property, gradient descent -- in conjunction
with spectral initialization -- converges linearly without the need of
explicitly promoting balancedness of the factors; in fact, the factors stay
balanced automatically throughout the execution of the algorithm. Our analysis
is based on analyzing the evolution of a new distance metric that directly
accounts for the ambiguity due to invertible transforms, and might be of
independent interest.

hybrid 1D nanoobject with alternating double chains and polycyclic regions
under electron irradiation in HRTEM. A scheme of synthesis of such a nanoribbon
using Ullmann coupling and dehydrogenation reactions is proposed. The reactive
REBO-1990EVC potential is adapted for simulations of carbon-hydrogen systems
and is used in combination with the CompuTEM algorithm for modeling of electron
irradiation effects. The atomistic mechanism of formation of the new hybrid 1D
nanoobject is found to be the following. Firstly hydrogen is removed by
electron impacts. Then spontaneous breaking of bonds between carbon atoms leads
to decomposition of narrow regions of the graphene nanoribbon into double
chains. Simultaneously thermally activated growth of polycyclic regions occurs.
Density functional theory calculations give barriers along the growth path of
polycyclic regions consistent with this mechanism. Electronic properties of the
new 1D nanoobject are shown to be strongly affected by the edge magnetism and
make this nanostructure promising nanoelectronic and spintronic applications.
The way of synthesis the 1D nanoobject proposed here can be considered as an
example of the general three-stage strategy of production of nanoobjects and
macromolecules. 1) precursors are synthesized by traditional chemical method,
2) precursors are placed in HRTEM with the electron energy that is sufficient
only to remove hydrogen atoms, 3) as a result of hydrogen removal, the
precursors become unstable or metastable and transform into new nanoobjects or
macromolecules.

quasiparticle states inside the gap. This feature gives a lower backflow spin
current from the superconductor as compared to a normal metal. Furthermore, in

function definitions that capture the \textit{risk} associated with unwanted
system behavior in the presence of uncertainties. The paper proposes two
notions of certifiability. The first is based on accounting for the magnitude
of failure to ensure data-informed conservativeness. The second is the ability
to provide optimization convergence guarantees by preserving convexity.
Satisfying these notions leads to \textit{certifiable} risk-based design

superquantile (a.k.a.\ conditional value-at-risk) and buffered probability of
failure are analyzed. CRiBDO is contrasted with reliability-based design
optimization (RBDO), where uncertainties are accounted for via the probability
of failure, through a structural and a thermal design problem. A reformulation
of the short column structural design problem leading to a convex CRiBDO
problem is presented. The CRiBDO formulations capture more information about

optimization convergence by preserving properties of underlying functions, and

of diseases with medical imaging data, but the performance is often limited by
the number of training datasets and memory requirements. In addition, many deep

adoption in clinical applications. To address this, we present a successive
subspace learning model, termed VoxelHop, for accurate classification of
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using T2-weighted structural MRI data.
Compared with popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures,
VoxelHop has modular and transparent structures with fewer parameters without
any backpropagation, so it is well-suited to small dataset size and 3D imaging
data. Our VoxelHop has four key components, including (1) sequential expansion
of near-to-far neighborhood for multi-channel 3D data; (2) subspace
approximation for unsupervised dimension reduction; (3) label-assisted
regression for supervised dimension reduction; and (4) concatenation of
features and classification between controls and patients. Our experimental
results demonstrate that our framework using a total of 20 controls and 26
patients achieves an accuracy of 93.48$\%$ and an AUC score of 0.9394 in
differentiating patients from controls, even with a relatively small number of
datasets, showing its robustness and effectiveness. Our thorough evaluations
also show its validity and superiority to the state-of-the-art 3D CNN
classification methods. Our framework can easily be generalized to other

Multicast messages contain important information about the roles of actors in
the network, which is needed for better understanding social interaction
dynamics. In this paper a multiplicative latent factor model is proposed to
analyze such relational data. For a given message, all potential receiver
actors are placed on a suitability scale, and the actors are included in the
receiver set whose suitability score exceeds a threshold value. Unobserved
heterogeneity in the social interaction behavior is captured using a
multiplicative latent factor structure with latent variables for actors (which
differ for actors as senders and receivers) and latent variables for individual
messages. A Bayesian computational algorithm, which relies on Gibbs sampling,
is proposed for model fitting. Model assessment is done using posterior
predictive checks. Based on our analyses of the Enron email data, a mc-amen

receiver sets for commonly observed messages. Moreover the results show that
actors have a comparable (but not identical) role as a sender and as a receiver

probabilistic assumptions on exogenous variables, and functional assignments.
Specifying such models can be extremely difficult in practice. The process

many application domains, such as molecular biology, are rich in structured
causal knowledge that is qualitative in nature. This manuscript proposes a
general approach for querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and
converting the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model
that can learn from data to answer the question. We demonstrate the
feasibility, accuracy and versatility of this approach using two case studies

the versatility of the approach by querying a knowledge base for the molecular

essential in breaking the degeneracy in the ejecta model for the neutron star

jet afterglows by using semi-analytic models of laterally spreading or
non-spreading jets. The image centroid initially moves away from the explosion
point in the sky with apparent superlumianal velocity. After reaching a maximum
displacement its motion is reversed. This behavior is in line with that found
in full hydrodynamics simulations. We show that the evolution of the centroid
shift and image size are significantly different when lateral spreading is
considered. For Gaussian jet models with plausible model parameters, the
morphology of the laterally spreading jet images is much closer to circular.
The maximum displacement of the centroid shift and its occurrence time are
smaller/earlier by a factor of a few for spreading jets. Our results indicate
that it is crucial to include lateral spreading effects when analyzing radio
images of neutron star merger jets. We also obtain the viewing angle
$\theta_{\rm obs}$ by using the centroid shift of radio images provided the
ratio of the jet core size $\theta_{c}$ and $\theta_{\rm obs}$ is determined by
afterglow light curves. We show that a simple method based on a point-source
approximation provides reasonable angular estimates ($10-20\%$ errors at most).
By taking a sample of laterally spreading structured Gaussian jets, we obtain
$\theta_{\rm obs} \sim 0.32$ for GW 170817, consistent with previous studies.

the interface separating the $+$ and $-$ phase in the Ising model. The planar
solid-on-solid model thus corresponds to the three-dimensional Ising model.
Delocalisation of this model at high temperature and at zero slope was first
derived by Fr\""ohlich and Spencer, in parallel to proving the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition. The first main result of this
article consists of a simple, alternative proof of delocalisation of the
solid-on-solid model. In fact, the argument is more general: it works on any
planar graph -- not just the square lattice -- and implies that the interface
delocalises at any slope rather than exclusively at the zero slope. The second
main result, proved independently, is that the absolute value of the height
function in this model satisfies the FKG lattice condition. This property is
believed to be intimately linked to the (quantitative) understanding of
delocalisation, given the recent successes in the context of the square ice and
(more generally) the six-vertex model, and it has already been used elsewhere
in a new proof of the BKT transition. The new FKG inequality is shown to hold
true for both the solid-on-solid model as well as for the discrete Gaussian

Gibbs measures, coincide.

fields ($10^{13-15}$ G), episodically emitting $\sim100$ ms long X-ray bursts
with energies of $\sim10^{40-41}$ erg. Rarely, they produce extremely bright,
energetic giant flares that begin with a short ($\sim0.2$ s), intense flash,
followed by fainter, longer lasting emission modulated by the magnetar spin
period (typically 2-12 s), thus confirming their origin. Over the last 40
years, only three such flares have been observed in our local group; they all
suffered from instrumental saturation due to their extreme intensity. It has
been proposed that extra-galactic giant flares likely constitute a subset of
short gamma-ray bursts, noting that the sensitivity of current instrumentation
prevents us from detecting the pulsating tail, while the initial bright flash
is readily observable out to distances $\sim 10-20$ Mpc. Here, we report X- and
gamma-ray observations of GRB 200415A, which exhibits a rapid onset, very fast
time variability, flat spectra and significant sub-millisecond spectral
evolution. These attributes match well with those expected for a giant flare
from an extra-galactic magnetar, noting that GRB 200415A is directionally
associated with the galaxy NGC 253 ($\sim$3.5 Mpc away). The detection of
$\sim3$ MeV photons provides definitive evidence for relativistic motion of the
emitting plasma. The observed rapid spectral evolution can naturally be
generated by radiation emanating from such rapidly-moving gas in a rotating

functions. Yet it oftentimes struggles in high dimensions where the computation
could be prohibitively heavy. To alleviate this problem, we introduce
Coordinate backoff Bayesian Optimization (CobBO) with two-stage kernels. During
each round, the first stage uses a simple coarse kernel that sacrifices the
approximation accuracy for computational efficiency. It captures the global
landscape by purposely smoothing away local fluctuations. Then, in the second
stage of the same round, past observed points in the full space are projected
to the selected subspace to form virtual points. These virtual points, along
with the means and variances of their unknown function values estimated using
the simple kernel of the first stage, are fitted to a more sophisticated kernel
model in the second stage. Within the selected low dimensional subspace, the
computational cost of conducting Bayesian optimization therein becomes
affordable. To further enhance the performance, a sequence of consecutive
observations in the same subspace are collected, which can effectively refine
the approximation of the function. This refinement lasts until a stopping rule
is met determining when to back off from a certain subspace and switch to
another. This decoupling significantly reduces the computational burden in high
dimensions, which fully leverages the observations in the whole space rather
than only relying on observations in each coordinate subspace. Extensive
evaluations show that CobBO finds solutions comparable to or better than other

driven by an external vibration depends on the input energy. Our focus is on
the dependence of the granular behavior on two main parameters: frequency and
vibration amplitude. We find that there exists an optimal forcing frequency, at
which the system reaches the maximal kinetic energy: if the input energy is
increased beyond such a threshold, the system dissipates more and more energy
and recovers a colder and more viscous state. Quite surprisingly, the
nonmonotonic behavior is found for vibration amplitudes which are sufficiently
small to keep the system always in contact with the driving oscillating plate.
Studying dissipative properties of the system, we unveil a striking difference
between this nonmonotonic behavior and a standard resonance mechanism. This
feature is also observed at the microscopic scale of the single-grain dynamics
and can be interpreted as an instance of negative specific heat. An
analytically solvable model based on a generalized forced-damped oscillator
well reproduces the observed phenomenology, illustrating the role of the
competing effects of forcing and dissipation.

mechanisms, laying theoretical foundation for future porosity control. Current
porosity analysis models use machine setting parameters, such as laser angle

they often do not transfer to analysis of porosity for a different machine. To
address the first problem, a physics-informed, data-driven model (PIM), which
instead of directly using machine setting parameters to predict porosity levels
of printed parts, it first interprets machine settings into physical effects,
such as laser energy density and laser radiation pressure. Then, these
physical, machine independent effects are used to predict porosity levels
according to pass, flag, fail categories instead of focusing on quantitative
pore size prediction. With six learning methods evaluation, PIM proved to
achieve good performances with prediction error of 10$\sim$26%. Finally,
pore-encouraging influence and pore-suppressing influence were analyzed for

in machine learning. Conventional sensor signal processing pipelines with hand
engineered feature extraction often involve huge computational cost with high
dimensional data. Deep recurrent neural networks have shown promise in
automated feature learning for improved time-series processing. However,
generic deep recurrent models grow in scale and depth with increased complexity
of the data. This is particularly challenging in presence of high dimensional
data with temporal and spatial characteristics. Consequently, this work
proposes a novel deep cellular recurrent neural network (DCRNN) architecture to
efficiently process complex multi-dimensional time series data with spatial
information. The cellular recurrent architecture in the proposed model allows
for location-aware synchronous processing of time series data from spatially
distributed sensor signal sources. Extensive trainable parameter sharing due to
cellularity in the proposed architecture ensures efficiency in the use of
recurrent processing units with high-dimensional inputs. This study also
investigates the versatility of the proposed DCRNN model for classification of
multi-class time series data from different application domains. Consequently,
the proposed DCRNN architecture is evaluated using two time-series datasets: a
multichannel scalp EEG dataset for seizure detection, and a machine fault
detection dataset obtained in-house. The results suggest that the proposed
architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while utilizing
substantially less trainable parameters when compared to comparable methods in
the literature.

specifically tailored for an individual sample and require addition of an

calculates a special imperceptible noise which can be added to any sample of

we know a mathematical model of a real system, a simulator is useful because it
predicates behaviors of the real system using the mathematical model with a
given system parameter vector. We can collect many experiences more efficiently
than interactions with the real system. However, it is difficult to identify
the system parameter vector accurately. If we have an identification error,
experiences obtained by the simulator may degrade the performance of the

stages. At the first stage, we choose multiple system parameter vectors. Then,
we have a mathematical model for each system parameter vector, which is called
a virtual system. We obtain optimal Q-functions for multiple virtual systems
using the continuous deep Q-learning algorithm. At the second stage, we
represent a Q-function for the real system by a linear approximated function

place. Considering the occasional requirements and fragmentation usage pattern
of mobile users, temporal recommendation techniques are proposed to improve the
efficiency of information retrieval on mobile devices by means of accurately
recommending items via learning temporal interests with short-term user
interaction behaviors. However, the enforcement of privacy-preserving laws and
regulations, such as GDPR, may overshadow the successful practice of temporal
recommendation. The reason is that state-of-the-art recommendation systems
require to gather and process the user data in centralized servers but the
interaction behaviors data used for temporal recommendation are usually
non-transactional data that are not allowed to gather without the explicit
permission of users according to GDPR. As a result, if users do not permit
services to gather their interaction behaviors data, the temporal
recommendation fails to work. To realize the temporal recommendation in the
post-GDPR era, this paper proposes $C^3DRec$, a cloud-client cooperative deep
learning framework of mining interaction behaviors for recommendation while
preserving user privacy. $C^3DRec$ constructs a global recommendation model on
centralized servers using data collected before GDPR and fine-tunes the model
directly on individual local devices using data collected after GDPR. We design
two modes to accomplish the recommendation, i.e. pull mode where candidate
items are pulled down onto the devices and fed into the local model to get
recommended items, and push mode where the output of the local model is pushed
onto the server and combined with candidate items to get recommended ones.
Evaluation results show that $C^3DRec$ achieves comparable recommendation
accuracy to the centralized approaches, with minimal privacy concern.

original upwind conservative FD schemes, which effectively leads to a
reformulated dissipation. It is convenient to implement this method, as it does
not require to modify the original forms of the upwind schemes. In addition,
the proposed method removes the constraint in the traditional FP conservative
FD schemes that require a consistent discretization of the mesh metrics and the
fluxes. With this, the proposed method is more flexible in simulating the
engineering problems which usually require a low-order scheme for their
low-quality mesh, while the high-order schemes can be applied to approximate
the flow states to improve the resolution. After demonstrating the strict FP
property and the order of accuracy by two simple test cases, we consider
various validation cases, including the supersonic flow around the cylinder,
the subsonic flow past the three-element airfoil, and the transonic flow around
the ONERA M6 wing, etc., to show that the method is suitable for a wide range
of fluid dynamic problems containing complex geometries. Moreover, these test
cases also indicate that the discretization order of the metrics have no
significant influences on the numerical results if the mesh resolution is not

estimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked
in the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the
benefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions.
This is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the
generated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system
as before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be
small in relative value. In this paper, we cast the problem as counterfactual
prediction of unobserved revenue. The impact on revenue is then the difference

lies in the innovative application of econometric methods proposed for
macroeconomic applications to a new problem setting. Broadly applicable, the
approach benefits from only requiring revenue data observed for
origin-destination pairs in the network of the airline at each day, before and

intelligent surface (RIS) has been recently proposed as an innovative new
technology to achieve energy efficiency and coverage enhancement by
establishing favorable signal propagation environments, thereby improving data
transmission in massive connectivity. Nevertheless, the BS needs to detect
active devices and estimate channels to support data transmission in
RIS-assisted massive access systems, which yields unique challenges. This paper
shall consider an RIS-assisted uplink IoT network and aims to solve the
RIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem, where the BS
detects the active devices and estimates the separated channels of the
RIS-to-device link and the RIS-to-BS link. Due to limited scattering between
the RIS and the BS, we model the RIS-to-BS channel as a sparse channel. As a
result, by simultaneously exploiting both the sparsity of sporadic transmission
in massive connectivity and the RIS-to-BS channels, we formulate the
RIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem as a sparse
matrix factorization problem. Furthermore, we develop an approximate message

brain network connectivity. We investigate whether large-scale Extended Granger
Causality (lsXGC) can capture such alterations using resting-state fMRI data.
Our method utilizes dimension reduction combined with the augmentation of
source time-series in a predictive time-series model for estimating directed
causal relationships among fMRI time-series. The lsXGC is a multivariate
approach since it identifies the relationship of the underlying dynamic system
in the presence of all other time-series. Here lsXGC serves as a biomarker for
classifying schizophrenia patients from typical controls using a subset of 62
subjects from the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) data
repository. We use brain connections estimated by lsXGC as features for
classification. After feature extraction, we perform feature selection by
Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient followed by classification using a
support vector machine. As a reference method, we compare our results with
cross-correlation, typically used in the literature as a standard measure of
functional connectivity. We cross-validate 100 different training/test
(90%/10%) data split to obtain mean accuracy and a mean Area Under the receiver
operating characteristic Curve (AUC) across all tested numbers of features for
lsXGC. Our results demonstrate a mean accuracy range of [0.767, 0.940] and a
mean AUC range of [0.861, 0.983] for lsXGC. The result of lsXGC is
significantly higher than the results obtained with the cross-correlation,
namely mean accuracy of [0.721, 0.751] and mean AUC of [0.744, 0.860]. Our
results suggest the applicability of lsXGC as a potential biomarker for
schizophrenia.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the area of geographic information processing. There are few researches on
geographic text classification. However, the application of this task in
Chinese is relatively rare. In our work, we intend to implement a method to
extract text containing geographical entities from a large number of network
text. The geographic information in these texts is of great practical
significance to transportation, urban and rural planning, disaster relief and
other fields. We use the method of graph convolutional neural network with
attention mechanism to achieve this function. Graph attention networks is an
improvement of graph convolutional neural networks. Compared with GCN, the
advantage of GAT is that the attention mechanism is proposed to weight the sum
of the characteristics of adjacent nodes. In addition, We construct a Chinese
dataset containing geographical classification from multiple datasets of
Chinese text classification. The Macro-F Score of the geoGAT we used reached
95\% on the new Chinese dataset.

internet (both velocity and volume), it has become challenging to filter out
truthful information from fake ones. The research community is now faced with
the task of automatic detection of fake news, which carries real-world
socio-political impact. One such research contribution came in the form of the
Constraint@AAA12021 Shared Task on COVID19 Fake News Detection in English. In
this paper, we shed light on a novel method we proposed as a part of this
shared task. Our team introduced an approach to combine topical distributions
from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with contextualized representations from
XLNet. We also compared our method with existing baselines to show that XLNet +
Topic Distributions outperforms other approaches by attaining an F1-score of
0.967.
