the quasiparticle gap and exciton binding energies in low-dimensional

spin-singlet and spin-triplet exciton states is less understood. A prominent
effect is the renormalization of the exciton binding energy and optical
strength (and hence the optical spectrum) through additional screening of the
direct Coulomb term describing the attractive electron-hole interaction in the
kernel of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The repulsive exchange interaction
responsible for the singlet-triplet slitting, on the other hand, is unscreened
within formal many-body perturbation theory. However, Loren Benedict argued
that in practical calculations restricted to a subspace of the full Hilbert
space, the exchange interaction should be appropriately screened by states
outside of the subspace, the so-called $S$ approximation \cite{Benedict2002}.
Here, we systematically explore the accuracy of the $S$ approximation for
different confined systems, including a molecule and heterostructures of
semiconducting and metallic layered materials. We show that the $S$
approximation is actually exact in the limit of small exciton binding energies
(i.e., small direct term) and can be used to significantly accelerate
convergence of the exciton energies with respect to the number of empty states,
provided that a particular effective screening consistent with the conventional
Tamm-Dancoff approximation is employed. We further find that the
singlet-triplet splitting in the energy of the excitons is largely unaffected
by the external dielectric environment for most quasi-two-dimensional

oscillation dips and valleys in reconstructed muon observables, at a detector

NSI parameter $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$, which has the maximum impact on the muon
survival probability in these experiments. We show that non-zero
$\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ shifts the oscillation dip locations in $L/E$
distributions of the up/down event ratios of reconstructed $\mu^-$ and $\mu^+$
in opposite directions. We introduce a new variable $\Delta d$ representing the
difference of dip locations in $\mu^-$ and $\mu^+$, which is sensitive to the
magnitude as well as the sign of $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$, and is independent of
the value of $\Delta m^2_{32}$. We further note that the oscillation valley in
the ($E$, $\cos \theta$) plane of the reconstructed muon observables bends in
the presence of NSI, its curvature having opposite signs for $\mu^-$ and
$\mu^+$. We demonstrate the identification of NSI with this curvature, which is
feasible for detectors like ICAL having excellent muon energy and direction
resolutions. We illustrate how the measurement of contrast in the curvatures of
valleys in $\mu^-$ and $\mu^+$ can be used to estimate $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$.
Using these proposed oscillation dip and valley measurements, the achievable
precision on $|\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}|$ at 90% C.L. is about 2% with 500
kt$\cdot$yr exposure. The effects of statistical fluctuations, systematic
errors, and uncertainties in oscillation parameters have been incorporated
using multiple sets of simulated data. Our method would provide a direct and
robust measurement of $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ in the multi-GeV energy range.

suited to the analysis of hierarchical data such as, for instance, sequential

regression is a well-known predictive modelling problem used in fields as
diverse as psychometry to deep neural network based voice modelling. Their
specificity lies in the properties of their outcome variable, typically
considered as a categorical variable with natural ordering properties,
typically allowing comparisons between different states (""a little"" is less

This article investigates the application of sequence-to-sequence learning
methods provided by the deep learning framework in ordinal regression, by
formulating the ordinal regression problem as a sequential binary search. A
method for visualizing the model's explanatory variables according to the
ordinal target variable is proposed, that bears some similarities to linear
discriminant analysis. The method is compared to traditional ordinal regression
methods on a number of benchmark dataset, and is shown to have comparable or

plane occurs through the propagation of atomic steps, a process called
step-flow growth. In some instances, the steps tend to form close groups (or
bunches), a phenomenon termed step bunching, which corresponds to an
instability of the equal-spacing step propagation. Over the last fifty years,
various mechanisms have been proposed to explain step bunching, the most
prominent of which are the inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect (i.e., the
asymmetry which favors the attachment of adatoms from the upper terrace),
elastically mediated interactions between steps (in heteroepitaxy), step
permeability (in electromigration-controlled growth), and the chemical effect
(which couples the diffusion fields on all terraces). Beyond the discussion of
the influence of each of these mechanisms taken independently on the propensity
to bunching, we propose a unified treatment of the effect of these mechanisms
on the onset of the bunching instability, which also accounts for their
interplay. This is done in the setting of the so-called quasistatic
approximation, which by permitting mostly analytical treatment, offers a clear
view of the influence on stability of the combined mechanisms. In particular,
we find that the Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect, elastic step-interactions and the
chemical effect combine in a quasi-additive fashion, whereas step permeability
is neither stabilizing nor destabilizing per se but changes the relative
influence of the three aforementioned mechanisms. In a companion paper, we
demonstrate and discuss the importance of another mechanism, which we call the
dynamics effect, that emerges when relaxing the simplifying but questionable
quasistatic approximation.

Schwarzschild spacetime. Such static observers in effect define the rest frame
of the collapsed source. The gain in tidal energy is due to local spacetime
curvature. Previous work in this direction in connection with astrophysical
jets involved geodesic motion along the Kerr rotation axis where outward moving
particles could be tidally accelerated to almost the speed of light if their
initial speed, as measured by the reference observer, is above a certain
threshold escape velocity. We focus here for simplicity on the exterior
Schwarzschild spacetime and show that the effective tidal acceleration to near
the speed of light can occur for geodesic motion in certain radially outward
directions. The implications of these results for the physics of
gravitationally collapsed systems are briefly discussed.

fields on adjacent terraces. In this second part, we present a stability
analysis of the general problem without recourse to the quasistatic
approximation. This analysis reveals the existence of a supplementary
mechanism, which we label the ""dynamics effect"" as it follows from accounting
for all the convective and transient terms in the governing equations. This
effect can be stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the ratio of step
attachment/detachment kinetics to terrace diffusion kinetics. Further, we find
that this dynamics effect remains significant in the slow
deposition/evaporation regime, thereby invalidating the classical postulate
underlying the quasistatic approximation. Finally, revisiting experiments of
crystal growth on Si(111)-7x7 and GaAs(001), our analysis provides an
alternative explanation of the observed step bunching, one that does not

describes an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for automatic detection of
outlier galaxy images, and its application to several Hubble Space Telescope
fields. The algorithm does not require training, and therefore is not dependent
on the preparation of clean training sets. The application of the algorithm to
a large collection of galaxies detected a variety of outlier galaxy images. The
algorithm is not perfect in the sense that not all objects detected by the
algorithm are indeed considered outliers, but it reduces the dataset by two
orders of magnitude to allow practical manual identification. The catalogue
contains 147 objects that would be very difficult to identify without using
automation.

numerical optimization problems. Many of these problems involve nonconvex
objective functions with multiple saddle points, which necessitates an
understanding of the behavior of discrete trajectories of first-order methods
within the geometrical landscape of these functions. This paper concerns
convergence of first-order discrete methods to a local minimum of nonconvex
optimization problems that comprise strict-saddle points within the geometrical
landscape. To this end, it focuses on analysis of discrete gradient
trajectories around saddle neighborhoods, derives sufficient conditions under
which these trajectories can escape strict-saddle neighborhoods in linear time,
explores the contractive and expansive dynamics of these trajectories in
neighborhoods of strict-saddle points that are characterized by gradients of
moderate magnitude, characterizes the non-curving nature of these trajectories,
and highlights the inability of these trajectories to re-enter the
neighborhoods around strict-saddle points after exiting them. Based on these
insights and analyses, the paper then proposes a simple variant of the vanilla
gradient descent algorithm, termed Curvature Conditioned Regularized Gradient
Descent (CCRGD) algorithm, which utilizes a check for an initial boundary
condition to ensure its trajectories can escape strict-saddle neighborhoods in
linear time. Convergence analysis of the CCRGD algorithm, which includes its
rate of convergence to a local minimum, is also presented in the paper.
Numerical experiments are then provided on a test function as well as a

system, where the control arises as the velocity field in the advection term.
Such a problem is generally challenging from both theoretical analysis and
algorithmic design perspectives mainly because the state variable depends
nonlinearly on the control variable and an additional divergence-free
constraint on the control is coupled together with the state equation.
  Mathematically, the proof of the existence of optimal solutions is delicate,
and up to now, only some results are known for a few special cases where
additional restrictions are imposed on the space dimension and the regularity
of the control. We prove the existence of optimal controls and derive the
first-order optimality conditions in general settings without any extra
assumption. Computationally, the well-known conjugate gradient (CG) method can
be applied conceptually. However, due to the additional divergence-free
constraint on the control variable and the nonlinear relation between the state
and control variables, it is challenging to compute the gradient and the
optimal stepsize at each CG iteration, and thus nontrivial to implement the CG
method. To address these issues, we advocate a fast inner preconditioned CG
method to ensure the divergence-free constraint and an efficient inexactness
strategy to determine an appropriate stepsize. An easily implementable nested
CG method is thus proposed for solving such a complicated problem. For the
numerical discretization, we combine finite difference methods for the time
discretization and finite element methods for the space discretization.
Efficiency of the proposed nested CG method is promisingly validated by the
results of some preliminary numerical experiments.

critical component for quantifying users' characteristics in the human mobility
modeling pipeline. Human mobility is a sequential decision-making process
dependent on the users' dynamic interests. With accurate user profiles, the
predictive model can perfectly reproduce users' mobility trajectories. In the
reverse direction, once the predictive model can imitate users' mobility
patterns, the learned user profiles are also optimal. Such intuition motivates
us to propose an imitation-based mobile user profiling framework by exploiting
reinforcement learning, in which the agent is trained to precisely imitate
users' mobility patterns for optimal user profiles. Specifically, the proposed
framework includes two modules: (1) representation module, which produces state
combining user profiles and spatio-temporal context in real-time; (2) imitation
module, where Deep Q-network (DQN) imitates the user behavior (action) based on
the state that is produced by the representation module. However, there are two
challenges in running the framework effectively. First, epsilon-greedy strategy
in DQN makes use of the exploration-exploitation trade-off by randomly pick
actions with the epsilon probability. Such randomness feeds back to the
representation module, causing the learned user profiles unstable. To solve the
problem, we propose an adversarial training strategy to guarantee the
robustness of the representation module. Second, the representation module
updates users' profiles in an incremental manner, requiring integrating the
temporal effects of user profiles. Inspired by Long-short Term Memory (LSTM),
we introduce a gated mechanism to incorporate new and old user characteristics
into the user profile.

contemporaneous SPIRou, NARVAL, and TESS data obtained over two months in late
2018, when the activity of the star was reported to be in a non-cyclic phase.
We first recover the fundamental parameters of the target from both visible and
nIR spectral fitting. The large-scale magnetic field is investigated from
polarimetric data. From unpolarized spectra, we estimate the total magnetic
flux through Zeeman broadening of magnetically sensitive nIR lines and the
chromospheric emission using the CaII H & K lines. The TESS photometric
monitoring is modeled with pseudo-periodic Gaussian Process Regression.
Fundamental parameters of $\epsilon$ Eridani derived from visible and
near-infrared wavelengths provide us with consistent results, also in agreement
with published values. We report a progressive increase of macroturbulence
towards larger nIR wavelengths. Zeeman broadening of individual lines
highlights an unsigned surface magnetic field $B_{\rm mono} = 1.90 \pm 0.13$
kG, with a filling factor $f = 12.5 \pm 1.7$% (unsigned magnetic flux $Bf = 237
\pm 36$ G). The large-scale magnetic field geometry, chromospheric emission,
and broadband photometry display clear signs of non-rotational evolution over
the course of data collection. Characteristic decay times deduced from the
light curve and longitudinal field measurements fall in the range 30-40 d,
while the characteristic timescale of surface differential rotation, as derived
through the evolution of the magnetic geometry, is equal to $57 \pm 5$ d. The

interested information in various web services such as Amazon, YouTube, and
Google News. Various recommender systems, ranging from neighborhood-based,
association-rule-based, matrix-factorization-based, to deep learning based,
have been developed and deployed in industry. Among them, deep learning based
recommender systems become increasingly popular due to their superior
performance.
  In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on data poisoning attacks
to deep learning based recommender systems. An attacker's goal is to manipulate
a recommender system such that the attacker-chosen target items are recommended
to many users. To achieve this goal, our attack injects fake users with
carefully crafted ratings to a recommender system. Specifically, we formulate
our attack as an optimization problem, such that the injected ratings would
maximize the number of normal users to whom the target items are recommended.
However, it is challenging to solve the optimization problem because it is a
non-convex integer programming problem. To address the challenge, we develop
multiple techniques to approximately solve the optimization problem. Our
experimental results on three real-world datasets, including small and large
datasets, show that our attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks.
Moreover, we attempt to detect fake users via statistical analysis of the
rating patterns of normal and fake users. Our results show that our attack is
still effective and outperforms existing attacks even if such a detector is
deployed.

consequence, social navigation models can replicate, promote, and amplify
societal unfairness such as discrimination and segregation. In this work, we
investigate a framework for diminishing bias in social robot navigation models
so that robots are equipped with the capability to plan as well as adapt their

consists of two components: \textit{learning} which incorporates social context
into the learning process to account for safety and comfort, and
\textit{relearning} to detect and correct potentially harmful outcomes before
the onset. We provide both technological and societal analysis using three
diverse case studies in different social scenarios of interaction. Moreover, we
present ethical implications of deploying robots in social environments and
propose potential solutions. Through this study, we highlight the importance

computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations has emerged as a promising
technique for reducing the computational cost associated with engine design
optimization. However, such methods still suffer from drawbacks. One main
disadvantage of is that the default machine learning (ML) hyperparameters are
often severely suboptimal for a given problem. This has often been addressed by
manually trying out different hyperparameter settings, but this solution is
ineffective in a high-dimensional hyperparameter space. Besides this problem,
the amount of data needed for training is also not known a priori. In response
to these issues that need to be addressed, the present work describes and
validates an automated active learning approach, AutoML-GA, for surrogate-based
optimization of internal combustion engines. In this approach, a Bayesian
optimization technique is used to find the best machine learning
hyperparameters based on an initial dataset obtained from a small number of CFD
simulations. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is employed to locate the design
optimum on the ML surrogate surface. In the vicinity of the design optimum, the
solution is refined by repeatedly running CFD simulations at the projected
optimum and adding the newly obtained data to the training dataset. It is
demonstrated that AutoML-GA leads to a better optimum with a lower number of
CFD simulations, compared to the use of default hyperparameters. The proposed
framework offers the advantage of being a more hands-off approach that can be
readily utilized by researchers and engineers in industry who do not have
extensive machine learning expertise.

and W51 Main SFRs. Given their upper level energies of 225 K, they were thought
to arise in dense, hot molecular cores near newly formed stars. However, this
has not been confirmed by further observations of these lines and their origin
has remained unclear. Generally, there is a scarcity of observational data for
CH2 and, while it is an important compound in the astrochemical context, its
actual occurrence in astronomical sources is poorly constrained. The present
study, along with other recent observations of the Orion region we report, rule
out the possibility of an association with gas that is both hot and dense. We
find that the distribution of the CH2 emission closely follows that of the
[CII] 158 um emission, while CH2 is undetected toward the hot core itself. The
observations suggest, rather, that its extended emission arises from hot but
dilute layers of PDRs and not from the denser parts of such regions as in the
case of the Orion Bar. This hypothesis was corroborated by comparisons of the
observed CH2 line profiles with those of CRRLs, well-known PDR tracers. In
addition, we report the detection of the 70 GHz fine- and hfs lines of o-CH2
toward the W51E, W51M, W51N, W49N, W43, W75N, DR21, and S140 SFRs, and three of
the fine- and hfs lines between 68-71 GHz toward W3 IRS5. Furthermore, using a
non-LTE radiative transfer analysis, we can constrain the gas temperatures and
H2 density to 163 K and 3.4e3 cm^-3, respectively. This analysis confirms our
hypothesis that CH2 originates in warm and dilute PDR layers. Our analysis
suggests that for the excitation conditions under the physical conditions that
prevail in such regions, these lines are masering, with weak level inversion.
The resulting amplification of the lines' spontaneous emission greatly aids in
their detection.

against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as

authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the
first attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum

Prony method for exponential interpolation and employs the Positive Real Lemma
from model reduction theory to extract the associated Markov model. We
demonstrate the potential of this approach for the test case of anomalous

velocity autocorrelation data of molecular dynamics simulations of a colloid in
a Lennard-Jones fluid. In both cases, the VACF and the memory kernel can be

should also exhibit high values of thermal conductivity at low temperatures.
The thermal conductivity of KTaO$_3$ calculated ignoring the
temperature-dependent phonon softening of low-frequency modes give
high-temperature values similar that of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. However, the
calculated thermal conductivity of KTaO$_3$ does not increase as steeply as
that of the binary compounds at low temperatures, which results in KTaO$_3$
having the lowest low-temperature thermal conductivity despite having acoustic
phonon velocities larger than that of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and
$\beta$-In$_2$O$_3$. I attribute this to the fact that the acoustic phonon
velocities at low frequencies in KTaO$_3$ is less uniformly distributed because
its acoustic phonon branches are more dispersive compared to the binary oxides,
which causes enhanced momentum loss even during the normal phonon-phonon
scattering processes. I also calculate thermal diffusivity using the
theoretically obtained thermal conductivity and heat capacity and find that all
four materials exhibit the expected $T^{-1}$ behavior at high temperatures.
Additionally, the calculated ratio of the average phonon scattering time to
Planckian time is larger than the lower bound of 1 that has been observed
empirically in numerous other materials.

implying that decades of experimental IR research used potentially improper
methods, which may have produced questionable results. However, it was unclear
if and to what extent these findings apply to actual evaluations and this
opened a debate in the community with researchers standing on opposite
positions about whether this should be considered an issue (or not) and to what
extent.
  In this paper, we first give an introduction to the representational
measurement theory explaining why certain operations and significance tests are
permissible only with scales of a certain level. For that, we introduce the
notion of meaningfulness specifying the conditions under which the truth (or
falsity) of a statement is invariant under permissible transformations of a
scale. Furthermore, we show how the recall base and the length of the run may
make comparison and aggregation across topics problematic.
  Then we propose a straightforward and powerful approach for turning an
evaluation measure into an interval scale, and describe an experimental
evaluation of the differences between using the original measures and the
interval-scaled ones.
  For all the regarded measures - namely Precision, Recall, Average Precision,
(Normalized) Discounted Cumulative Gain, Rank-Biased Precision and Reciprocal
Rank - we observe substantial effects, both on the order of average values and
on the outcome of significance tests. For the latter, previously significant
differences turn out to be insignificant, while insignificant ones become
significant. The effect varies remarkably between the tests considered but
overall, on average, we observed a 25% change in the decision about which
systems are significantly different and which are not.

improvement over strong baseline models of up to 1.5 3D AP while simultaneously
reducing their parameter footprint and computational cost by 15-80% and 30-50%,

variant that samples a subset of the most representative features by learning
deformations over randomly sampled locations. This not only allows us to scale
explicit global contextual modeling to larger point-clouds, but also leads to
more discriminative and informative feature descriptors. Our method can be
flexibly applied to most state-of-the-art detectors with increased accuracy and

Generalized multi-user and low complexity single-user algorithms are derived
based on alternating optimization (AO) framework to maximize the weighted sum

beamforming phases unit modulus constraints. The input signal waveform and IRS
passive beamforming phase shifts are jointly designed as a function of users'
individual frequency-selective channel state information (CSI). The energy
harvester nonlinearity is explored and two IRS deployment schemes, namely
frequency selective IRS (FS-IRS) and frequency flat IRS (FF-IRS), are modeled
and analyzed. This paper highlights the fact that IRS can provide an extra
passive beamforming gain on output DC power over conventional WPT designs and
significantly influence the waveform design by leveraging the benefit of
passive beamforming, frequency diversity and energy harvester nonlinearity.
Even though FF-IRS exhibits lower output DC current than FS-IRS, it still
achieves substantially increased DC power over conventional WPT designs.
Performance evaluations confirm the significant benefits of a joint waveform

Hall effect is typically a smooth cosine function because only the out-of-plane
projection of the field generates the in-plane transverse motion of electrons.
Here, we report the observation of an abrupt switching of the Hall effect by
field rotation in a non-magnetic material, ZrTe5. The angular dependence of the
Hall resistivity approaches a signum function, persisting down to an extremely
low field of 0.03 T. By varying the carrier density of ZrTe5 over three orders
of magnitude, we show that this singular behavior is due to the anomalous Hall
effect generated by the ultra-dilute massive Dirac carriers in the quantum
limit of Pauli paramagnetism when the Zeeman energy exceeds the Fermi energy.
Our results elucidate the origin of the anomalous Hall effect in ZrTe5, arising
owing to the spin-polarized massive Dirac electrons rather than the separation
of Weyl nodes.

resources with which they can develop and realize their ideas. Besides helping
to secure capital, crowdfunding also connects creators with engaged early
supporters who provide public feedback. But does this process foster truly
innovative outcomes? Does the proliferation of crowdfunding in an industry make
it more innovative overall? Prior studies investigating the link between
crowdfunding and innovation do not compare traditional and crowdfunded products
and so while claims that crowdfunding supports innovation are theoretically
sound, they lack empirical backing. We address this gap using a unique dataset
of board games, an industry with significant crowdfunding activity in recent
years. Each game is described by how it combines fundamental mechanisms such as
dice-rolling, negotiation, and resource-management, from which we develop
quantitative measures of innovation in game design. Using these measures to
compare games, we find that crowdfunded games tend to be more distinctive from
previous games than their traditionally published counterparts. They are also
significantly more likely to implement novel combinations of mechanisms.
Crowdfunded games are not just transient experiments: subsequent games imitate
their novel ideas. These results hold in regression models controlling for game
and designer-level confounders. Our findings demonstrate that the innovative
potential of crowdfunding goes beyond individual products to entire industries,
as new ideas spill over to traditionally funded products.

arranged in a regular pattern, giving rise to a large number of `redundant'
baselines with the same length and orientation. Since identical baselines
should see an identical sky signal, this provides a way of finding a relative
gain/bandpass calibration without needing an explicit sky model. In reality,
there are many reasons why baselines will not be exactly identical, giving rise
to a host of effects that spoil the redundancy of the array and induce spurious
structure in the calibration solutions if not accounted for. In this paper, we
seek to build an understanding of how differences in the primary beam response
between antennas affect redundantly-calibrated interferometric visibilities and
their resulting frequency (delay-space) power spectra. We use simulations to
study several generic types of primary beam variation, including differences in
the width of the main lobe, the angular and frequency structure of the
sidelobes, and the beam ellipticity and orientation. For all of these types, we
find that additional temporal structure is induced in the gain solutions,
particularly when bright point sources pass through the beam. In comparison,
only a low level of additional spectral structure is induced. The temporal
structure modulates the cosmological 21cm power spectrum, but only at the level
of a few percent in our simulations. We also investigate the possibility of
signal loss due to decoherence effects when non-redundant visibilities are
averaged together, finding that the decoherence is worst when bright point
sources pass through the beam, and that its magnitude varies significantly
between baseline groups and types of primary beam variation. Redundant
calibration absorbs some of the decoherence effect however, reducing its impact
compared to if the visibilities were perfectly calibrated.

important phenomena to characterize the hot and dense medium produced in such
collisions. The study of medium-induced modifications to the substructure of
inclusive charged jets indicates a redistribution of energy inside the jet cone
and provides insight into the energy loss mechanisms of jets in the medium. We
investigate the in-medium modification to two jet shape observables i.e., the
differential jet shape ($\rho$(r)) and the angularity (g) in the most central
$Pb-Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} ~=~ 2.76 $ TeV using two commonly used
event generators i.e., JEWEL (recoil OFF) and EPOS-3 in the jet-p$_T$ range of
20-40 GeV/c. JEWEL with recoil OFF has been used primarily as a reference
system as that has been found to explain the global jet observables
satisfactorily but lacks in jet-shape variables at higher jet-radii. EPOS-3
that explains the bulk properties in such collisions quite well takes into
account a hydrodynamically evolving bulk matter, jets and hard-soft
interactions. A comparison between the results from these models shows that
while JEWEL (recoil OFF) does not explain the distribution of lost energy at
higher radii with respect to the jet-axis, EPOS-3 explains the effect quite
well. However, in EPOS-3, the partonic energy loss mechanism and secondary
hard-soft interactions during hadronization and hadronic cascade phase are
different from the conventional jet energy loss models. The current study can,
therefore, provide important new insights on mechanisms regarding the modeling
of the medium and hard-soft interactions in heavy ion collisions.

asks for the instability and ensuing disappearance of Cauchy horizons. As an
encore, an appendix by Erik Curiel reviews the early history of the definition

simulations predict dwarf galaxies should inhabit dark matter haloes with a
centrally diverging density `cusp'. This is in conflict with observations that
typically favour a constant density `core'. We investigate this `cusp-core
problem' in `ultra-faint' dwarf galaxies simulated as part of the `Engineering
Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge' (EDGE) project. We find, similarly to
previous work, that gravitational potential fluctuations within the central
region of the simulated dwarfs kinematically heat the dark matter particles,
lowering the dwarfs' central dark matter density. However, these fluctuations
are not exclusively caused by gas inflow/outflow, but also by impulsive heating
from minor mergers. We use the genetic modification approach on one of our
dwarf's initial conditions to show how a delayed assembly history leads to more
late minor mergers and, correspondingly, more dark matter heating. This
provides a mechanism by which even ultra-faint dwarfs ($M_* <
10^5\,\text{M}_{\odot}$), in which star formation was fully quenched at high
redshift, can have their central dark matter density lowered over time. In
contrast, we find that late major mergers can regenerate a central dark matter
cusp, if the merging galaxy had sufficiently little star formation. The
combination of these effects leads us to predict significant stochasticity in
the central dark matter density slopes of the smallest dwarfs, driven by their
unique star formation and mass assembly histories.

$^{40}$K p-wave Feshbach resonance through a combination of measurements,
numerical calculations, and modeling. Dimer spectroscopy employs both
radio-frequency spin-flip association in the MHz band and resonant association
in the kHz band. Systematic uncertainty in the measured binding energy is
reduced by a model that includes both the Franck-Condon overlap amplitude and
inhomogeneous broadening. Coupled-channels calculations based on mass-scaled
$^{39}$K potentials compare well to the observed binding energies and also
reveal a low-energy p-wave shape resonance in the open channel. Contrary to
conventional expectation, we observe a nonlinear variation of the binding
energy with magnetic field, and explain how this arises from the interplay of
the closed-channel ramping state with the near-threshold shape resonance in the
open channel. We develop an analytic two-channel model that includes both
resonances as well as the dipole-dipole interactions which, we show, become
important at low energy. Using this parameterization of the energy dependence
of the scattering phase, we can classify the studied $^{40}$K resonance as
broad. Throughout the paper, we compare to the well understood s-wave case, and
discuss the significant role played by van der Waals physics. The resulting
understanding of the dimer physics of p-wave resonances provides a solid
foundation for future exploration of few- and many-body orbital physics.

research. However, reviewers may be biased by authors' prestige or other
characteristics. Double-blind peer review, in which the authors' identities are
masked from the reviewers, has been proposed as a way to reduce reviewer bias.
Although intuitive, evidence for the effectiveness of double-blind peer review
in reducing bias is limited and mixed. Here, we examine the effects of
double-blind peer review on prestige bias by analyzing the peer review files of
5027 papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning
Representations (ICLR), a top computer science conference that changed its
reviewing policy from single-blind peer review to double-blind peer review in
2018. We find that after switching to double-blind review, the scores given to
the most prestigious authors significantly decreased. However, because many of
these papers were above the threshold for acceptance, the change did not affect
paper acceptance decisions significantly. Nevertheless, we show that
double-blind peer review may have improved the quality of the selections by
limiting other (non-author-prestige) biases. Specifically, papers rejected in
the single-blind format are cited more than those rejected under the
double-blind format, suggesting that double-blind review better identifies
poorer quality papers. Interestingly, an apparently unrelated change - the
change of rating scale from 10 to 4 points - likely reduced prestige bias
significantly, to an extent that affected papers' acceptance. These results
provide some support for the effectiveness of double-blind review in reducing
prestige bias, while opening new research directions on the impact of peer
review formats.

Children use both software that has been explicitly developed for them and
software for general users. While they obtain clear benefits from software,
such as access to creativity tools and learning resources, children are also
exposed to several risks and disadvantages, such as privacy violation,
inactivity, or safety risks that can even lead to death. The research and
development community is addressing and investigating positive and negative
impacts of software for children one by one, but no comprehensive model exists
that relates software engineering and children as stakeholders in their own
right. Aims: The final objective of this line of research is to propose
effective ways in which children can be involved in Software Engineering
activities as stakeholders. Specifically, in this paper, we investigate the
quality aspects that are of interest for children, as quality is a crucial
aspect in the development of any kind of software, especially for stakeholders
like children. Method: Our contribution is based mainly on an analysis of
studies at the intersection between Software Engineering (especially software
quality) and Child Computer Interaction. Results: We identify a set of
qualities and a preliminary set of guidelines that can be used by researchers
and practitioners in understanding the complex interrelations between Software
Engineering and children. Based on the qualities and the guidelines,
researchers can design empirical investigations to obtain deeper insights into

assumed, and instead appear to follow a ""heart-shaped"" distribution that is
symmetrical about the plane of the pulsar wind torus. Conspicuous restrictions
in the bulk distribution of gas consistent with constrained expansion coincide
with positions of the dark bays and east-west band of He-rich filaments, which
may be associated with interaction with a pre-existing circumstellar disk. The
distribution of filaments follows an intricate honeycomb-like arrangement with
straight and rounded boundaries at large and small scales that are
anti-correlated with distance from the center of expansion. The distribution is
not unlike the large-scale rings observed in supernova remnants 3C 58 and
Cassiopeia A, where it has been attributed to turbulent mixing processes that
encouraged outwardly expanding plumes of radioactive 56Ni-rich ejecta. These
characteristics reflect critical details of the original supernova of 1054 CE
and its progenitor star, and may favour a low-energy explosion of an iron-core
progenitor. We demonstrate that our main findings are robust despite regions of
non-homologous expansion driven by acceleration of material by the pulsar wind

molecular clouds is to map their line emission.
  $Aims.$ We aim to test and apply a stratified random sampling technique that
can characterize the line emission from molecular clouds more efficiently than
mapping.
  $Methods.$ We sampled the molecular emission from the Perseus cloud using the
H2 column density as a proxy. We divided the cloud into ten logarithmically
spaced column density bins, and we randomly selected ten positions from each
bin. The resulting 100 cloud positions were observed with the IRAM 30m
telescope, covering the 3mm-wavelength band and parts of the 2 and 1mm bands.
  $Results.$ We focus our analysis on 11 molecular species detected toward most
column density bins. In all cases, the line intensity is tightly correlated
with the H2 column density. For the CO isotopologs, the trend is relatively
flat, while for high-dipole moment species such as HCN, CS, and HCO+ the trend
is approximately linear. We reproduce this behavior with a cloud model in which
the gas density increases with column density, and where most species have
abundance profiles characterized by an outer photodissociation edge and an
inner freeze-out drop. The intensity behavior of the high-dipole moment species
arises from a combination of excitation effects and molecular freeze out, with
some modulation from optical depth. This quasi-linear dependence with the H2
column density makes the gas at low column densities dominate the
cloud-integrated emission. It also makes the emission from most high-dipole
moment species proportional to the cloud mass inside the photodissociation
edge.
  $Conclusions.$ Stratified random sampling is an efficient technique for
characterizing the emission from whole molecular clouds. It shows that despite
the complex appearance of Perseus, its molecular emission follows a relatively
simple pattern.

study we propose an empirical relation between $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and the

spatially-resolved properties of the MaNGA survey - the largest sample of

Furthermore, we derive an empirical relation between the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and
a second degree polynomial of $\Sigma_{\rm b}$ yielding a one-to-one relation
between these two observables. Both, $\Sigma_{\rm b}$ and its polynomial form
show a stronger correlation and smaller scatter with respect to $\Sigma_{\rm

mass due to a weakening of gravity associated to neutrino emission by the
protoneutron star. This mechanism yields observable transients and sets an
upper limit to the mass of the black hole (BH) remnant. Previous global
simulations of this mechanism have included neutrino losses parametrically,
however, with direct implications for the ejecta mass and energy. Here we
evolve the inner supernova core with a spherically-symmetric,
general-relativistic neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic code until BH formation.
We then use the result in a Newtonian code that follows the response of the
outer layers of the star to the change in gravity and resolves the surface
pressure scale height. We find that the dense-matter equation of state (EOS)
can introduce a factor $\sim 2$ variation in gravitational mass lost to
neutrinos, with a stiff EOS matching previous parametric results, and a soft
EOS yielding lower ejecta masses and energies by a factor of several. This
difference is caused primarily by the longer time to BH formation in stiffer
EOSs. With a soft EOS, our red and yellow supergiant progenitors fail to unbind
mass if hydrogen recombination energy is not included. Using a linear ramp in
time for mass-energy lost to neutrinos (with suitable parameters) yields a
stellar response within $\sim 10\%$ of that obtained using the detailed history

modifications to previous predictions for shock breakout, plateau emission, and

nuclei as a result of galaxy mergers. At sub-parsec separations, binaries
become strong sources of low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), targeted by
Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). We used recent upper limits on continuous GWs from
the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav)
11yr dataset to place constraints on putative SMBHBs in nearby massive
galaxies. We compiled a comprehensive catalog of ~44,000 galaxies in the local
universe (up to redshift ~0.05) and populated them with hypothetical binaries,
assuming that the total mass of the binary is equal to the SMBH mass derived
from global scaling relations. Assuming circular equal-mass binaries emitting
at NANOGrav's most sensitive frequency of 8nHz, we found that 216 galaxies are
within NANOGrav's sensitivity volume. We ranked the potential SMBHBs based on
GW detectability by calculating the total signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) such
binaries would induce within the NANOGrav array. We placed constraints on the
chirp mass and mass ratio of the 216 hypothetical binaries. For 19 galaxies,
only very unequal-mass binaries are allowed, with the mass of the secondary
less than 10 percent that of the primary, roughly comparable to constraints on
a SMBHB in the Milky Way. Additionally, we were able to exclude binaries
delivered by major mergers (mass ratio of at least 1/4) for several of these
galaxies. We also derived the first limit on the density of binaries delivered
by major mergers purely based on GW data.

number of properties of the density and tidal environment of their host halos.
The host halo of each central galaxy is also `baryonified' with realistic
spatial distributions of stars as well as hot and cold gas, along with the
corresponding rotation curve. Our default HOD assumes that galaxy properties
are a function of group halo mass alone, and can optionally include effects
such as galactic conformity and colour-dependent galaxy assembly bias. The
mocks predict the relation between the stellar mass and HI mass of massive HI
galaxies, as well as the 2-point cross-correlation function of spatially
co-located optical and HI-selected samples. They enable novel null tests for

system-environment correlations or changes in the environmental state. We show
that this interpretation can be substantiated also for a class of entropic
quantifiers. We exploit a suitably regularized version of Umegaki's quantum
relative entropy, known as telescopic relative entropy, that is tightly
connected to the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. In particular, we derive
general upper bounds on the telescopic relative entropy revivals conditioned

seemingly infinite plasticity in storing and retrieving data - as well as
dynamically creating/updating the associations between data and corresponding

extend the conditional mean equation of classic autoregressive conditional

investigate the effect of a dynamic change in the electric field for different

situations, but overcorrects for equilibrium properties where SIE is
insignificant. This overcorrection is often reduced by LSIC, local scaling of
the PZ-SIC to the local spin density approximation(LSDA). Here we propose a new
scaling factor to use in an LSIC-like approach that satisfies an additional
important constraint: the correct coefficient of atomic number Z in the
asymptotic expansion of the exchange-correlation(xc) energy for atoms. LSIC and
LSIC+ are scaled by functions of the iso-orbital indicator z{\sigma}, which
distinguishes one-electron regions from many-electron regions. LSIC+ applied to
LSDA works better for many equilibrium properties than LSDA-LSIC and the
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof(PBE) generalized gradient approximation(GGA), and
almost as well as the strongly constrained and appropriately normed(SCAN)
meta-GGA. LSDA-LSIC and LSDA-LSIC+, however, both fail to predict interaction
energies involving weaker bonds, in sharp contrast to their earlier successes.
It is found that more than one set of localized SIC orbitals can yield a nearly
degenerate energetic description of the same multiple covalent bond, suggesting
that a consistent chemical interpretation of the localized orbitals requires a
new way to choose their Fermi orbital descriptors. To make a locally
scaled-down SIC to functionals beyond LSDA requires a gauge transformation of
the functional's energy density. The resulting SCAN-sdSIC, evaluated on
SCAN-SIC total and localized orbital densities, leads to an acceptable
description of many equilibrium properties including the dissociation energies

stability analysis. Finally, we vary the number density, flux magnitude, and
flux direction of the neutrinos and antineutrinos and demonstrate that these
factors modify both the growth rate and post-saturation neutrino flavor

produce both slow growth of the instability and little difference between the

the same number of neutrinos and antineutrinos change flavor, making the least

present results from observational programs at two Indian observatories, 2 m
Himalayan Chandra Telescope at the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle (HCT)
and 1.2 m telescope at the Mount Abu Infrared Observatory (MIRO). Two epochs of
imaging and spectroscopy were carried out at the HCT and three epochs of
imaging at MIRO. We found CN to be the dominant molecular emission on both
epochs, 31/11/2019 and 22/12/2019, at distances of r$_H$ = 2.013 and 2.031 AU
respectively. The comet was inferred to be relatively depleted in Carbon
bearing molecules on the basis of low $C_2$ and $C_3$ abundances. We find the
production rate ratio, Q($C_2$)/Q(CN) = 0.54 $\pm$ 0.18, pre-perihelion and
Q($C_2$)/Q(CN) = 0.34 $\pm$ 0.12 post-perihelion. This classifies the comet as
being moderately depleted in carbon chain molecules. Using the results from
spectroscopic observations, we believe the comet to have a chemically
heterogeneous surface having variation in abundance of carbon chain molecules.
From imaging observations we infer a dust-to-gas ratio similar to carbon chain
depleted comets of the Solar system. We also compute the nucleus size to be in
the range $0.18\leq r \leq 3.1$ Km. Our observations show that 2I/Borisov's
behaviour is analogous to that of the Solar system comets.

double charge exchange (DCE) processes,which is a natural extension of the
$pn$-QRPA model for $\beta$-decay to $\beta\beta$-decay. Ergo, this model, in
addition to including the pairing correlations and having the same number of
free parameters, brings into play the $ppnn$-quasiparticle excitations and the
Pauli Principle, which are essential ingredients to correctly account for the
nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for $\beta\beta$-decays and nuclear reactions to
all $0^+$ and $2^+$ final states, including resonances, and not just to the
ground state as in $pn$-QRPA. In addition, it allows us to evaluate the
$Q_{\beta\beta}$-values, and the excitation energies in final nucleus, and to
work with a single-particle space large enough for the DCE sum rules to be
satisfied. So far it has been applied to the $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay, and here
we extend it to the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay. The model that comes closest in
terms of its advantages is the shell model. We describe here the DCE
observables in: i) $^{76}$Se, which have been recently measured in the GERDA
and MAJORANA Experiments, and ii) $^{124}$Te, for which has been reported
recently the first direct observation of $2\nu$ double electron capture with
the XENON1T Dark Matter detector. A good agreement with the data is obtained
for both the ground state and the excited states. We have found that the
reaction and $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay NMEs are of the same order of magnitude
even in the region of giant resonances.

(energy-resolved) images of the samples were acquired and the image signal was
mapped to equivalent thicknesses of two known reference materials, from which
x-ray attenuation as a function of energy can be derived. The spread in
attenuation between samples was relatively large, partly because of natural
variation. The variation of malignant and glandular tissue was similar, whereas
that of adipose tissue was lower. Formalin fixation slightly altered the
attenuation of malignant and glandular tissue, whereas the attenuation of
adipose tissue was not significantly affected. The difference in attenuation
between fresh tumour tissue and cyst fluid was smaller than has previously been
measured for fixed tissue, but the difference was still significant and
discrimination of these two tissue types is still possible. The difference
between glandular and malignant tissue was close-to significant; it is
reasonable to expect a significant difference with a larger set of samples.

evaluate a method for measuring the volumetric breast density using

With a minimum withdrawal constraint, the ARVA strategy runs the risk of
depleting the investment portfolio. We determine the dynamic asset allocation
strategy which maximizes a weighted combination of expected total withdrawals
(EW) and expected shortfall (ES), defined as the average of the worst five per
cent of the outcomes of real terminal wealth. We compare the performance of our
dynamic strategy to simpler alternatives which maintain constant asset
allocation weights over time accompanied by either our same modified ARVA
spending rule or withdrawals that are constant over time in real terms. Tests
are carried out using both a parametric model of historical asset returns as
well as bootstrap resampling of historical data. Consistent with previous
literature that has used different measures of reward and risk than EW and ES,
we find that allowing some variability in withdrawals leads to large
improvements in efficiency. However, unlike the prior literature, we also
demonstrate that further significant enhancements are possible through
incorporating a dynamic asset allocation strategy rather than simply keeping
asset allocation weights constant throughout retirement.

mass or luminosity to haloes produced in N-body simulations. The method works
by matching the cumulative number functions of the galaxy and halo properties,
and is therefore sensitive both to the precise definitions of those properties
and to the selection criteria used to define the samples. Further dependence
follows when SHAM parameters are calibrated with galaxy clustering, which is
known to depend strongly on the manner in which galaxies are selected. In this
paper we introduce a new parametrisation for SHAM and derive the best-fit SHAM
parameters as a function of various properties of the selection of the galaxy
sample and of the photometric definition, including S\'ersic vs Petrosian
magnitudes, stellar masses vs r-band magnitudes and optical (SDSS) vs HI
(ALFALFA) selection. In each case we calculate the models' goodness-of-fit to
measurements of the projected two-point galaxy correlation function. In the
optically-selected samples we find strong evidence that the scatter in the
galaxy-halo connection increases towards the faint end, and that AM performs
better with luminosity than stellar mass. The SHAM parameters of optically- and
HI-selected galaxies are mutually exclusive, with the latter suggesting the
importance of properties beyond halo mass. We provide best-fit parameters for
the SHAM galaxy-halo connection as a function of each of our input choices,
extending the domain of validity of the model while reducing potential

  AAMAS-21",,,,"cs.LG cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Active screening is a common approach in controlling the spread of recurring
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. In this approach,
health workers periodically select a subset of population for screening.
However, given the limited number of health workers, only a small subset of the
population can be visited in any given time period. Given the recurrent nature
of the disease and rapid spreading, the goal is to minimize the number of
infections over a long time horizon. Active screening can be formalized as a
sequential combinatorial optimization over the network of people and their
connections. The main computational challenges in this formalization arise from
i) the combinatorial nature of the problem, ii) the need of sequential planning
and iii) the uncertainties in the infectiousness states of the population.
  Previous works on active screening fail to scale to large time horizon while
fully considering the future effect of current interventions. In this paper, we
propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach based on Deep Q-Networks
(DQN), with several innovative adaptations that are designed to address the
above challenges. First, we use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to
represent the Q-function that exploit the node correlations of the underlying
contact network. Second, to avoid solving a combinatorial optimization problem
in each time period, we decompose the node set selection as a sub-sequence of
decisions, and further design a two-level RL framework that solves the problem
in a hierarchical way. Finally, to speed-up the slow convergence of RL which
arises from reward sparseness, we incorporate ideas from curriculum learning
into our hierarchical RL approach. We evaluate our RL algorithm on several
real-world networks.

providing insight on the use of pretrained CNN features for image clustering
(IC). First, extensive experiments are conducted and show that, for a given
dataset, the choice of the CNN architecture for feature extraction has a huge
impact on the final clustering. These experiments also demonstrate that proper
extractor selection for a given IC task is difficult. To solve this issue, we
propose to rephrase the IC problem as a multi-view clustering (MVC) problem
that considers features extracted from different architectures as different
""views"" of the same data. This approach is based on the assumption that
information contained in the different CNN may be complementary, even when
pretrained on the same data. We then propose a multi-input neural network
architecture that is trained end-to-end to solve the MVC problem effectively.
This approach is tested on nine natural image datasets, and produces
state-of-the-art results for IC.

extremely slow relaxation under a changing magnetic field. Consequently, both
low-temperature laboratory experiments and Monte Carlo simulations have shown
peculiar out-of-equilibrium magnetization curves, which arise from trapping in
metastable configurations. In this work we simulate this phenomenon in a
superconducting quantum annealing processor, allowing us to probe the impact of
quantum fluctuations on both equilibrium and dynamics of the system. Increasing
the quantum fluctuations with a transverse field reduces the impact of
metastable traps in out-of-equilibrium samples, and aids the development of
three-sublattice ferrimagnetic (up-up-down) long-range order. At equilibrium we
identify a finite-temperature shoulder in the 1/3-to-saturated phase
transition, promoted by quantum fluctuations but with entropic origin. This
work demonstrates the viability of dynamical as well as equilibrium studies of
frustrated magnetism using large-scale programmable quantum systems, and is
therefore an important step toward programmable simulation of dynamics in
materials using quantum hardware.

scattering (GIXS) in gas pressures as high as the multi-Torr regime, while also
recording mass spectrometry. Scattering patterns reflect near-surface sample
structures from the nano- to the meso-scale. The grazing incidence geometry
provides tunable depth sensitivity while scattered X-rays are detected across a
broad range of angles using a newly designed pivoting-UHV-manipulator for
detector positioning. At the same time, XPS and mass spectrometry can be
measured, all from the same sample spot and in ambient conditions. To
demonstrate the capabilities of this system, we measured the chemical state,
composition, and structure of Ag-behenate on a Si(001) wafer in vacuum and in
O$_2$ atmosphere at various temperatures. These simultaneous structural,
chemical, and gas phase product probes enable detailed insights into the
interplay between structure and chemical state for samples in gas phase
environments. The compact size of our pivoting-UHV-manipulator makes it
possible to retrofit this technique into existing spectroscopic instruments
installed at synchrotron beamlines. Because many synchrotron facilities are
planning or undergoing upgrades to diffraction limited storage rings with
transversely coherent beams, a newly emerging set of coherent X-ray scattering

computing services for resource-and-delay sensitive IoT applications via
computation offloading. Effective computation offloading strategies need to
comprehensively cope with several major issues, including the allocation of
dynamic communication and computational resources, the deadline constraints of
heterogeneous tasks, and the requirements for computationally inexpensive and
distributed algorithms. However, most of the existing works mainly focus on
part of these issues, which would not suffice to achieve expected performance
in complex and practical scenarios. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we
systematically study a distributed computation offloading problem with hard
delay constraints, where heterogeneous computational tasks require continually
offloading to a set of edge servers via a limiting number of stochastic
communication channels. The task offloading problem is then cast as a
delay-constrained long-term stochastic optimization problem under unknown
priori statistical knowledge. To resolve this problem, we first provide a
technical path to transform and decompose it into several slot-level
subproblems, then we develop a distributed online algorithm, namely TODG, to
efficiently allocate the resources and schedule the offloading tasks with delay
guarantees. Further, we present a comprehensive analysis for TODG, in terms of
the optimality gap, the delay guarantees, and the impact of system parameters.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
TODG.

complexity of a statistical model, and has found broad applications in machine
learning and statistical signal processing. In a high-dimensional learning
problem, the gauge function attempts to safeguard against overfitting by
promoting a sparse (concise) representation within the learning alphabet.
  In this work, within the context of linear inverse problems, we pinpoint the
source of its success, but also argue that the applicability of the gauge
function is inherently limited by its convexity, and showcase several learning
problems where the classical gauge function theory fails. We then introduce a
new notion of statistical complexity, gauge$_p$ function, which overcomes the
limitations of the gauge function. The gauge$_p$ function is a simple
generalization of the gauge function that can tightly control the sparsity of a
statistical model within the learning alphabet and, perhaps surprisingly, draws
further inspiration from the Burer-Monteiro factorization in computational
mathematics.
  We also propose a new learning machine, with the building block of gauge$_p$
function, and arm this machine with a number of statistical guarantees. The
potential of the proposed gauge$_p$ function theory is then studied for two
stylized applications. Finally, we discuss the computational aspects and, in

low-mass helium-core white dwarf stellar models experience a number of nuclear
flashes which greatly reduce their hydrogen envelopes. Just before the
occurrence of each flash, stable hydrogen burning may be able to drive global
pulsations that could be relevant to shed some light on the internal structure
of these stars through asteroseismology. We present a pulsational stability
analysis applied to low-mass helium-core stars on their early white-dwarf
cooling branches going through CNO flashes in order to study the possibility
that the $\varepsilon$ mechanism is able to excite gravity-mode pulsations. We
carried out a nonadiabatic pulsation analysis for low-mass helium-core
white-dwarf models going through CNO flashes during their early cooling phases.
We found that the $\varepsilon$ mechanism due to stable hydrogen burning can
excite low-order ($\ell= 1, 2$) gravity modes with periods between $\sim 80$
and $500\ $s, for stars with $0.2025 \lesssim M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \lesssim
0.3630$ located in an extended region of the $\log g - T_{\rm eff}$ diagram
with effective temperature and surface gravity in the ranges $15\,000 \lesssim
T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 38\,000\ $K and $5.8 \lesssim \log g \lesssim 7.1$,
respectively. Since the timescales required for these modes to reach amplitudes
large enough to be observable are shorter than their corresponding evolutionary
timescales, the detection of pulsations in these stars is feasible. If a
low-mass white dwarf star were found to pulsate with low-order gravity modes in
this region of instability, it would confirm our result that such pulsations
can be driven by the $\varepsilon$ mechanism. In addition, confirming a rapid
rate of period change in these pulsations would support that these stars
actually experience CNO flashes, as predicted by evolutionary calculations.

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) maintain a liquidity pool (LP) of two or more
assets constrained to maintain at all times a mathematical relation to each

constant-sum and constant-product AMMs. Existing systems however suffer from
several challenges. They require external arbitrageurs to restore the price of
tokens in the pool to match the market price. Such activities can potentially
drain resources from the liquidity pool. In particular, dramatic market price
changes can result in low liquidity with respect to one or more of the assets

constructing the AMM by proposing the idea of dynamic curves. It utilizes input
from a market price oracle to modify the mathematical relationship between the

identical to the market price. This approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities

researchers and used by practitioners. Constrained clustering formulations
exist for popular algorithms such as k-means, mixture models, and spectral
clustering but have several limitations. A fundamental strength of deep
learning is its flexibility, and here we explore a deep learning framework for
constrained clustering and in particular explore how it can extend the field of
constrained clustering. We show that our framework can not only handle standard
together/apart constraints (without the well documented negative effects
reported earlier) generated from labeled side information but more complex
constraints generated from new types of side information such as continuous
values and high-level domain knowledge. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
training paradigm that is generally applicable to these four types of
constraints. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by empirical results
on both image and text datasets. We also study the robustness of our framework

last two decades, a promising new class of emitters based on defect centers in

macroscopic systems, which advance next-generation technological applications.
Rotational tunneling that represents the quantum phenomenon of the librational
motion of molecules is ubiquitous in hydrogen-contained materials. However, its
direct manifestation in realizing macroscopic physical properties is elusive.
Here we report an observation of reentrant ferroelectricity under low pressure
that is mediated by the rotational tunneling of ammonium ions in molecule-based
(NH$_4$)$_2$FeCl$_5 \cdot$H$_2$O. Applying a small pressure leads to a
transition from spin-driven ferroelectricity to paraelectricity coinciding with
the stabilization of a collinear magnetic phase. Such a transition is
attributed to the hydrogen bond fluctuations via the rotational tunneling of
ammonium groups as supported by theoretical calculations. Higher pressure lifts
the quantum fluctuations and leads to a reentrant ferroelectric phase
concomitant with another incommensurate magnetic phase. These results
demonstrate that the rotational tunneling emerges as a new route to control
magnetic-related properties in soft magnets, opening avenues for designing
multi-functional materials and realizing potential quantum control.

characteristic changes in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and plasma
parameters. Known visual and semi-automated empirical methods of CS
identification are exact but do not allow a comprehensive statistical analysis
of CS properties. Existing automated methods partially solve this problem.
Meanwhile, these methods suggest an analysis of variations of the IMF and its
direction only. In our three-parameter empirical method, we employ both the

Derivatives of the IMF strength, the plasma beta and the ratio of the Alfv'en
speed VA to the solar wind speed V taken with the one-second cadence are used.
We find that the CS daily rate R correlates with the solar wind temperature T
rather than with V and is proportional to the sum of the kinetic and thermal
energy density ~ V2(N+5N')+10T(N+N'), where N'=2cm^-3 is the background level

penalization (VP) approach for imposing inhomogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions on embedded interfaces. The flux-based VP method modifies the
diffusion coefficient of the original elliptic (Poisson) equation and uses a
flux-forcing function as a source term in the equation to impose the Neumann
boundary conditions. As such, the flux-based VP method can be easily
incorporated into existing fictitious domain codes. Sakurai et al. relied on an
analytical construction of flux-forcing functions, which limits the
practicality of the approach. Because of the analytical approach taken in the
prior work, only (spatially) constant flux values on simple interfaces were
considered. In this paper, we present a numerical technique for constructing
flux-forcing functions for arbitrarily complex boundaries. The imposed flux
values are also allowed to vary spatially in our approach. Furthermore, the
flux-based VP method is extended to include (spatially varying) Robin boundary
conditions, which makes the flux-based VP method even more general. We consider
several two- and three-dimensional test examples to access the spatial accuracy
of the numerical solutions. The method is also used to simulate flux-driven
thermal convection in a concentric annular domain. We formally derive the
flux-based volume penalized Poisson equation satisfying Neumann/Robin boundary
condition in strong form; such a derivation was not presented in Sakurai et
al., where the equation first appeared for the Neumann problem. The derivation
reveals that the flux-based VP approach relies on a surface delta function to
impose inhomogeneous Neumann/Robin boundary conditions. However, explicit
construction of the delta function is not necessary for the flux-based VP
method, which makes it different from other diffuse domain equations presented
in the literature.

temperature (Tc,max) of hole-doped cuprates and suggest the explicit functional
form for Tc,max with the root-mean-square-error of 3.705 K and the coefficient
of determination R2 of 0.969. We employed two machine learning models; one is a
parametric brute force searching method and another is a non-parametric random

as the Bader charge of apical oxygen, the bond strength between apical atoms,
and the number of superconducting layers are important features to estimate
Tc,max. Furthermore, we predict the Tc,max of hypothetical cuprates generated
by replacing apical cations with other elements. When Ga is an apical cation,
the predicted Tc,max is the highest among the hypothetical structures with 71,
117, and 131 K for one, two, and three CuO2 layers, respectively. These
findings suggest that machine learning could guide the design of new high-Tc

However, due to current design choices, MTPPs often show poor predictive
performance at forecasting event arrivals in distant future. To ameliorate this

to long horizon event forecasting. DualTPP has two components. The first
component is an intensity free MTPP model, which captures microscopic or
granular level signals of the event dynamics by modeling the time of future
events. The second component takes a different dual perspective of modeling
aggregated counts of events in a given time-window, thus encapsulating
macroscopic event dynamics. Then we develop a novel inference framework jointly
over the two models % for efficiently forecasting long horizon events by
solving a sequence of constrained quadratic optimization problems. Experiments
with a diverse set of real datasets show that DualTPP outperforms existing MTPP
methods on long horizon forecasting by substantial margins, achieving almost an

structural properties due to the size contrast between Si and Te atoms. A
recent experiment shows that the material turns metallic under hydrostatic
pressure, while the lattice structure of the metallic phase remains to be
identified. In this paper, we propose two metallic phases, M1 and M2, of Si2Te3
using the evolution algorithm and first-principles density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. Unlike the presence of Si-Si dimers in the semiconducting
(SC) phase, both M1 and M2 phases have individual Si atoms, which play
important roles in the metallicity. Analysis of structural properties,
electronic properties, dynamical as well as thermal stability is performed. The
energies of these new structures are compared with the SC phase under the
subsequent hydrostatic pressure up to 12 GPa. The results show that M1 and M2
phases have lower energies under high pressure, thus elucidating the appearance
of the metallic phase of Si2Te3. In addition, the external pressure causes the
SC phase to have an indirect-direct-indirect bandgap transition. Analysis of
Raman spectra of the SC phase at a different pressure shows the shifting of the
major Raman peaks, and finally disappearing confirms the phase transition. The
results are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The
understanding of the insulator-metal phase transition increases the potential

Although there have been a few attempts in training an image denoising model
with only single noisy images, existing self-supervised denoising approaches
suffer from inefficient network training, loss of useful information, or
dependence on noise modeling. In this paper, we present a very simple yet
effective method named Neighbor2Neighbor to train an effective image denoising

proposed for the generation of training image pairs. In detail, input and
target used to train a network are images sub-sampled from the same noisy
image, satisfying the requirement that paired pixels of paired images are
neighbors and have very similar appearance with each other. Secondly, a
denoising network is trained on sub-sampled training pairs generated in the
first stage, with a proposed regularizer as additional loss for better
performance. The proposed Neighbor2Neighbor framework is able to enjoy the
progress of state-of-the-art supervised denoising networks in network
architecture design. Moreover, it avoids heavy dependence on the assumption of
the noise distribution. We explain our approach from a theoretical perspective

experiments with different noise distributions in sRGB space and real-world
experiments on a denoising benchmark dataset in raw-RGB space.

efficient testing environment for autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate AVs'
safety performance unbiasedly, the probability distributions of environment
statistics in the simulated naturalistic driving environment (NDE) need to be
consistent with those from the real-world driving environment. However,
although human driving behaviors have been extensively investigated in the
transportation engineering field, most existing models were developed for
traffic flow analysis without considering the distributional consistency of
driving behaviors, which could cause significant evaluation biasedness for AV
testing. To fill this research gap, a distributional consistent NDE modeling
framework is proposed in this paper. Using large-scale naturalistic driving
data, empirical distributions are obtained to construct the stochastic human
driving behavior models under different conditions. To address the error
accumulation problem during the simulation, an optimization-based method is
further designed to refine the empirical behavior models. Specifically, the
vehicle state evolution is modeled as a Markov chain and its stationary
distribution is twisted to match the distribution from the real-world driving
environment. The framework is evaluated in the case study of a multi-lane
highway driving simulation, where the distributional accuracy of the generated
NDE is validated and the safety performance of an AV model is effectively
evaluated.

be supported in this transition through an effective team onboarding program,

challenge of team onboarding in order to inform future onboarding design.
Method: We conducted an interview survey of eleven participants from eight
organisations to investigate what onboarding activities are common across Agile
software development teams. We also identify common goals of onboarding from a
synthesis of literature. A repertory grid instrument is used to map the
contributions of onboarding techniques to onboarding goals. Results: Our study
reveals that a broad range of team onboarding techniques, both formal and
informal, are used in practice. It also shows that particular techniques that
have high contributions to a given goal or set of goals. Conclusions: In
presenting a set of onboarding goals to consider and an evidence-based
mechanism for selecting techniques to achieve the desired goals it is expected
that this study will contribute to better-informed onboarding design and

computing technologies. The boom of Web services increases software developers'
selection burden in developing new service-based systems such as mashups.
Timely recommending appropriate component services for developers to build new
mashups has become a fundamental problem in service-oriented software
engineering. Existing service recommendation approaches are mainly designed for
mashup development in the single-round scenario. It is hard for them to
effectively update recommendation results according to developers' requirements
and behaviours (e.g. instant service selection). To address this issue, the
authors propose a service bundle recommendation framework based on deep
learning, DLISR, which aims to capture the interactions among the target mashup
to build, selected (component) services, and the following service to
recommend. Moreover, an attention mechanism is employed in DLISR to weigh
selected services when recommending a candidate service. The authors also
design two separate models for learning interactions from the perspectives of
content and invocation history, respectively, and a hybrid model called HISR.
Experiments on a real-world dataset indicate that HISR can outperform several
state-of-the-art service recommendation methods to develop new mashups
iteratively.

bouncing models that can be studied with great analytical ease and hence,
provide test-bed for investigating more profound problems in quantum cosmology

straightforward analytical calculations: (i) a convenient parametrization of
the minisuperspace of FRLW spacetimes and (ii) two distinct choices of the
effective perfect fluids that source the background geometry of the bouncing
universe. We study the quantum cosmology of these models using both the
Wheeler-de Witt equations and the path integral approach. In particular, we
found a bouncing model analogue of the no-boundary wavefunction and presented a
Lorentzian path integral representation for the same. We also discuss the

Field Units (IFUs) for astronomical applications requires careful treatment of

of fiber end face irregularity leads to better optical performance in terms of
the diminishing effect of focal ratio degradation. Polishing has typically been
performed using commercial rotary polishers with multiple gradually decreasing
grit sizes. These polishers generally lack the ability to carefully adjust
angular position and polishing force. Control of these parameters vastly help
in getting a repeatable and controllable polish over a variety of
glass/epoxy/metal matrices that make up integral filed units and fiber slits. A
polishing arm is developed to polish the fiber terminations (IFU, mini-bundles
and v-grooves) of the NIR Fiber System for the RSS spectrograph at SALT. The
polishing arm angular adjustments ensure the correct position and orientation
of each termination on the polishing surface during the polish. Various studies
have indicated that the fiber focal ratio also degrades if the fiber end face
comes under excessive stress. The polishing arm is fitted with a load cell to
enable control of the polishing force. We have explored the minimal applicable
end stress by applying different loads while polishing. The arm is modular to
hold a variety of fiber termination styles. The polishing arm is also designed
to access a fiber inspection microscope without removing the fiber termination
from the arm. This enables inspection of the finish quality at various stages
through polishing process.

a Gauss-Bonnet-dilatonic coupled term. It is generalized, since all the
parameters are treated as arbitrary functions of the scalar field. It is
interesting to explore the fact that instead of considering additional flow
parameters, an effective potential serves the purpose of finding inflationary
parameters. The dilaton stabilization issue appears here as a problem with
reheating. Addition of a cosmological constant term alleviates the problem, and
inflation is effectively driven by the vacuum energy density. Thus Gauss-Bonnet

such as Bin Packing, Multiprocessor Scheduling by allowing the jobs to be
$d$-dimensional vectors. While the approximability of the scalar problems is
well understood, there has been a significant gap between the approximation
algorithms and the hardness results for the multidimensional variants. In this
paper, we close this gap by giving almost tight hardness results for these
problems.
  1. We show that Vector Bin Packing has no polynomial time $\Omega( \log d)$
factor asymptotic approximation algorithm when $d$ is a large constant,
assuming $\textsf{P}\neq \textsf{NP}$. This matches the $\ln d + O(1)$ factor
approximation algorithms (Chekuri, Khanna SICOMP 2004, Bansal, Caprara,
Sviridenko SICOMP 2009, Bansal, Eli\'{a}s, Khan SODA 2016) upto constants.
  2. We show that Vector Scheduling has no polynomial time algorithm with an
approximation ratio of $\Omega\left( (\log d)^{1-\epsilon}\right)$ when $d$ is
part of the input, assuming $\textsf{NP}\nsubseteq \textsf{ZPTIME}\left(
n^{(\log n)^{O(1)}}\right)$. This almost matches the $O\left( \frac{\log
d}{\log \log d}\right)$ factor algorithms(Harris, Srinivasan JACM 2019, Im,
Kell, Kulkarni, Panigrahi SICOMP 2019). We also show that the problem is
NP-hard to approximate within $(\log \log d)^{\omega(1)}$.
  3. We show that Vector Bin Covering is NP-hard to approximate within
$\Omega\left( \frac{\log d}{\log \log d}\right)$ when $d$ is part of the input,
almost matching the $O(\log d)$ factor algorithm (Alon et al., Algorithmica

  Previously, no hardness results that grow with $d$ were known for Vector
Scheduling and Vector Bin Covering when $d$ is part of the input and for Vector
Bin Packing when $d$ is a fixed constant.

time required for a diffusing particle to cross a boundary. As such,
calculations of the distribution of first passage time, and in particular the
mean first passage time, is an active area of research relevant to many
disciplines. Exact results for the mean first passage time for diffusion on
simple geometries, such as lines, discs and spheres, are well--known. In
contrast, computational methods are often used to study the first passage time
for diffusion on more realistic geometries where closed--form solutions of the
governing elliptic boundary value problem are not available. Here, we develop a
perturbation solution to calculate the mean first passage time on irregular
domains formed by perturbing the boundary of a disc or an ellipse. Classical
perturbation expansion solutions are then constructed using the exact solutions
available on a disc and an ellipse. We apply the perturbation solutions to
compute the mean first exit time on two naturally--occurring irregular domains:
a map of Tasmania, an island state of Australia, and a map of Taiwan. Comparing
the perturbation solutions with numerical solutions of the elliptic boundary
value problem on these irregular domains confirms that we obtain a very
accurate solution with a few terms in the series only. Matlab software to
implement all calculations is available on GitHub.

proven. The SeaQuest experiment at FNAL is in an ideal kinematic region to
provide evidence of $J/\psi$ production by intrinsic charm. Purpose: $J/\psi$
production in the SeaQuest kinematics is calculated with a combination of
perturbative QCD and intrinsic charm to see whether the SeaQuest data can put
limits on an intrinsic charm contribution. Methods: $J/\psi$ production in
perturbative QCD is calculated to next-to-leading order in the cross section.
Cold nuclear matter effects include nuclear modification of the parton
densities, absorption by nucleons, and $p_T$ broadening by multiple scattering.
The $J/\psi$ contribution from intrinsic charm is calculated assuming
production from a $|uud c \overline c \rangle$ Fock state. Results: The nuclear
modification factor, $R_{pA}$, is calculated as a function of $x_F$ and $p_T$
for $p+$C, $p+$Fe, and $p+$W interactions relative to $p+$d. Conclusions: The

gained prominence for their low computational cost. However, their high energy
consumption poses a bottleneck to their deployment in energy-constrained
devices. To address this problem, approximate computing can be employed at the
cost of some tolerable accuracy loss. However, such small accuracy variations
may increase the sensitivity of DNNs towards undesired subtle disturbances,
such as permanent faults. The impact of permanent faults in accurate DNNs has
been thoroughly investigated in the literature. Conversely, the impact of
permanent faults in approximate DNN accelerators (AxDNNs) is yet
under-explored. The impact of such faults may vary with the fault bit
positions, activation functions and approximation errors in AxDNN layers. Such
dynamacity poses a considerable challenge to exploring the trade-off between
their energy efficiency and fault resilience in AxDNNs. Towards this, we
present an extensive layer-wise and bit-wise fault resilience and energy
analysis of different AxDNNs, using the state-of-the-art Evoapprox8b signed
multipliers. In particular, we vary the stuck-at-0, stuck-at-1 fault-bit
positions, and activation functions to study their impact using the most widely
used MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our quantitative analysis shows that the
permanent faults exacerbate the accuracy loss in AxDNNs when compared to the
accurate DNN accelerators. For instance, a permanent fault in AxDNNs can lead
up to 66\% accuracy loss, whereas the same faulty bit can lead to only 9\%
accuracy loss in an accurate DNN accelerator. Our results demonstrate that the
fault resilience in AxDNNs is orthogonal to the energy efficiency.

mechanism to mislead an attacker and thereby achieve attack failure. However,
most game-theoretic defensive deception approaches have assumed that players
maintain consistent views under uncertainty. They do not consider players'
possible, subjective beliefs formed due to asymmetric information given to
them. In this work, we formulate a hypergame between an attacker and a defender
where they can interpret the same game differently and accordingly choose their
best strategy based on their respective beliefs. This gives a chance for
defensive deception strategies to manipulate an attacker's belief, which is the
key to the attacker's decision making. We consider advanced persistent threat
(APT) attacks, which perform multiple attacks in the stages of the cyber kill
chain where both the attacker and the defender aim to select optimal strategies
based on their beliefs. Through extensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrated how effectively the defender can leverage defensive deception
techniques while dealing with multi-staged APT attacks in a hypergame in which
the imperfect information is reflected based on perceived uncertainty, cost,
and expected utilities of both attacker and defender, the system lifetime
(i.e., mean time to security failure), and improved false positive rates in

transmitters equipped with leaky-wave antennas send information to their

narrow beams and high antenna gains. The conventional large antenna arrays are
confronted with challenging issues such as scaling limits and path discovery in
the THz frequencies. Therefore, this work exploits the potential of leaky-wave
antennas in the dense THz networks, to establish low-complexity THz links. By
addressing the propagation angle-frequency coupling effects, the transmission
rate is analyzed. The results show that the leaky-wave antenna is efficient for
achieving the high-speed transmission rate. The co-channel interference
management is unnecessary when the THz transmitters with large subchannel

proposed, which enhances the transmission rate compared with the same number of
subchannels with the equal allocation of the frequency band. After subchannel
allocation, a low-complexity power allocation method is proposed to improve the

that seriously jeopardizes the health of human beings. Polysomnography (PSG),
the gold standard of detecting OSA, requires multiple specialized sensors for
signal collection, hence patients have to physically visit hospitals and bear
the costly treatment for a single detection. Recently, many single-sensor
alternatives have been proposed to improve the cost efficiency and convenience.
Among these methods, solutions based on RR-interval (i.e., the interval between
two consecutive pulses) signals reach a satisfactory balance among comfort,
portability and detection accuracy. In this paper, we advance RR-interval based
OSA detection by considering its real-world practicality from energy
perspectives. As photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse sensors are commonly equipped
on smart wrist-worn wearable devices (e.g., smart watches and wristbands), the
energy efficiency of the detection model is crucial to fully support an
overnight observation on patients. This creates challenges as the PPG sensors
are unable to keep collecting continuous signals due to the limited battery
capacity on smart wrist-worn devices. Therefore, we propose a novel Frequency
Extraction Network (FENet), which can extract features from different frequency
bands of the input RR-interval signals and generate continuous detection
results with downsampled, discontinuous RR-interval signals. With the help of
the one-to-multiple structure, FENet requires only one-third of the operation
time of the PPG sensor, thus sharply cutting down the energy consumption and
enabling overnight diagnosis. Experimental results on real OSA datasets reveal
the state-of-the-art performance of FENet.

interpretation about its operation. We look at this problem from a new
perspective where the interpretation of task solving is synthesized by
quantifying how much and what previously unused information is exploited in
addition to the information used to solve previous tasks. First, after learning
several tasks, the network acquires several information partitions related to
each task. We propose that the network, then, learns the minimal information
partition that supplements previously learned information partitions to more
accurately represent the input. This extra partition is associated with
un-conceptualized information that has not been used in previous tasks. We
manage to identify what un-conceptualized information is used and quantify the
amount. To interpret how the network solves a new task, we quantify as
meta-information how much information from each partition is extracted. We
implement this framework with the variational information bottleneck technique.
We test the framework with the MNIST and the CLEVR dataset. The framework is
shown to be able to compose information partitions and synthesize
experience-dependent interpretation in the form of meta-information. This
system progressively improves the resolution of interpretation upon new
experience by converting a part of the un-conceptualized information partition
to a task-related partition. It can also provide a visual interpretation by
imaging what is the part of previously un-conceptualized information that is
needed to solve a new task.

keep away from obstacles as soon as possible, once obstacles enter into the

neighboring slip-links or slip-springs, $N_{0}$, is an input parameter in these
models. To analyze experimental data, the characteristic number of segments in
entangled polymers $N_{e}$ estimated from the plateau modulus is used instead.
Both $N_{0}$ and $N_{e}$ characterize the topological constraints in entangled
polymers, and naively $N_{0}$ is considered to be the same as $N_{e}$. However,
earlier studies showed that $N_{0}$ and $N_{e}$ (or the plateau modulus) should
be considered as independent parameters. In this work, we show that due to the
fluctuations at the short time scale, $N_{e}$ deviates from $N_{0}$. This means
that the relation between $N_{0}$ and the plateau modulus is not simple as
naively expected. The plateau modulus (or $N_{e}$) depends on the
subchain-scale details of the employed model, as well as the average number of
segments $N_{0}$. This is due to the fact that the subchain-scale fluctuation
mechanisms depend on the model rather strongly. We theoretically calculate the
plateau moduli for several single-chain slip-link and slip-spring models. Our
results explicitly show that the relation between $N_{0}$ and $N_{e}$ is

Ultraviolet (XUV) have been detected around some exoplanets by the excess
absorption of Ly$\alpha$ in far ultraviolet band. In the optical band the
excess absorption of H$\alpha$ is also found by the ground-based instruments.
However, it is not certain so far if the escape of the atmosphere driven by XUV
can result in such absorption. Here we present the XUV driven hydrodynamic
simulation coupled with the calculation of detailed level population and the
process of radiative transfer for WASP-121b. Our fiducial model predicts a mass
loss rate of $\sim$1.28$\times$10$^{12}$g/s for WASP-121b. Due to the high
temperature and Ly$\alpha$ intensity predicted by the fiducial model, many
hydrogen atoms are populated into the first excited state. As a consequence,
the transmission spectrum of H$\alpha$ simulated by our model is broadly
consistent with the observation. Comparing with the absorption of H$\alpha$ at
different observation times, the stellar XUV emission varies in the range of
0.5-1.5 times fiducial value, which may reflect the variation of the stellar
activity. Finally, we find that the supersonic regions of the planetary wind
contribute a prominent portion to the absorption of H$\alpha$ by comparing the
equivalent width of H$\alpha$, which hints that a transonic outflow of the
upper atmosphere driven by XUV irradiation of the host star can be detected by

mV s-1 Vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 2 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte solution.
Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 shows only ~30% of capacitance degradation for a ten folds
increase in current densities. Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 also shows 16% capacitance
degradation after 800 cycles with excellent Columbic efficiency (~100%) @2 A

Rietveld refinement. Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 has provided good energy, and power density
of 1.128 Wh kg-1and 112.5 W kg-1 respectively. Furthermore, better diffusivity
of the Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 in KOH electrolyte (indicated using Randles-Sevcik

These insights presented here clearly indicate that Zr doping into CeO2 results
in a promising candidate material for electrochemical and supercapacitive

methods to develop this algorithm further by accelerating the original PPA
(OPPA)'s path-finding process. However, when does the PPA ascertain that the
shortest path has been found? Is there a point after which the PPA could
distinguish the shortest path from other paths? By innovatively proposing the
concept of the dominant path (D-Path), the exact moment, named the transition
point (T-Point), when the PPA finds the shortest path can be identified. Based
on the D-Path and T-Point, a newly accelerated PPA named OPPA-D using the

baseline algorithms according to the experiments conducted in this paper. The

this paper lies in using D-path and T-point to terminate the OPPA. The novel
termination criterion reveals the actual performance of this OPPA. This OPPA is
the fastest algorithm, outperforming some so-called accelerated OPPAs.
Furthermore, we explain why some existing works inappropriately claim to be

query processing is an effective way to increase the querying efficiency on big

difficult to provide sufficiently accurate estimations for all the groups.
Stratified sampling improves the accuracy compared with the uniform sampling,
but the samples chosen for some special queries cannot work for other queries.
Online sampling chooses samples for the given query at query time, but it
requires a long latency. Thus, it is a challenge to achieve both accuracy and

networks with the first-order method such as stochastic gradient descent will
obtain a series of iterates converging to different local optima owing to their
different gradients across training. To obviate this, we propose a quotient
manifold \emph{PSI manifold}, in which all the equivalent weights of the
network with BN are regarded as the same element. Next, we construct gradient

the network with BN. The two algorithms guarantee that every group of
equivalent weights (caused by positively re-scaling) converge to the equivalent
optima. Besides that, we give convergence rates of the proposed algorithms on
the PSI manifold. The results show that our methods accelerate training

were analyzed. Among them, only graphene with a single vacancy enables the
formation of SACs, which are stable in terms of aggregation and dissolution
under harsh conditions of electrocatalysis. Reactivity of models SACs was
probed using atomic (hydrogen and A = C, N, O and S) and molecular adsorbates
(AHx, x = 1, 2, 3 or 4, depending on A), giving nearly 600 different systems
included in this study. Scaling relations between adsorption energies of A and
AHx on model SACs were confirmed. However, the scaling is broken for the case
of CH3. There is also an evident scaling between adsorption energies of atomic
and molecular adsorbates on metals SAs supported by pristine, N-doped and
B-doped graphene, which originates from similar electronic structures of SAs on
these supports. Using the obtained data, we have analyzed the hydrogen
evolution on the model SACs. Only M@graphene vacancy systems (excluding Ag and

Additional interfacial effects are discussed and the need for proper

steeply as the applied stress crosses 1 GPa, showing that the appearance of 3D

effect we resolve the heat capacity anomaly at $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, and find that
it does not change drastically as the 3D CDW onsets, which shows that the

antimicrobial agent in a large range of commercial products. The origin of the
biocidal mechanism has been elucidated in the last decades, and most likely
originates from silver cation release due to oxidative dissolution followed by
cellular uptake of silver ions, a process that causes a severe disruption of
bacterial metabolism and eventually leads to eradication. Despite the large
number of works dealing with the effects of nanosilver shape/size on the
antibacterial mechanism and on the (bio)physical chemistry pathways that drive
bacterial eradication, little effort has been devoted to the investigation of
the silver NPs plasmon response upon interaction with bacteria. Here we present
a detailed investigation of the bacteria-induced changes of the plasmon
spectral and dynamical features after exposure to one of the most studied
bacterial models, Escherichia Coli. Ultrafast pump-probe measurements indicate
that the dramatic changes on particle size/shape and crystallinity, which stem
from a bacteria-induced oxidative dissolution process, translate into a clear
modification of the plasmon spectral and dynamical features. This study may
open innovative new avenues in the field of biophysics of bio-responsive
materials, with the aim of providing new and reliable biophysical signatures of
the interaction of these materials with complex biological environments.

composed of \emph{blocks} of rank higher than one, a scenario encountered in
numerous and diverse applications. Uniqueness conditions and fitting methods
have thus been thoroughly studied. Nevertheless, the challenging problem of
estimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms, $R$, and
their individual ranks, $L_r$, has only recently started to attract significant
attention, mainly through regularization-based approaches which entail the need
to tune the regularization parameter(s). In this work, we build on ideas of
sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) and put forward a fully automated Bayesian
approach. Through a suitably crafted multi-level \emph{hierarchical}
probabilistic model, which gives rise to heavy-tailed prior distributions for
the BTD factors, structured sparsity is \emph{jointly} imposed. Ranks are then
estimated from the numbers of blocks ($R$) and columns ($L_r$) of
non-negligible energy. Approximate posterior inference is implemented, within
the variational inference framework. The resulting iterative algorithm
completely avoids hyperparameter tuning, which is a significant defect of
regularization-based methods. Alternative probabilistic models are also
explored and the connections with their regularization-based counterparts are
brought to light with the aid of the associated maximum a-posteriori (MAP)
estimators. We report simulation results with both synthetic and real-word

solutions are uniformly distributed on the manifold structure in the
low-dimensional space. However, traditional evolutionary algorithms for solving
LSMOPs have some deficiencies in dealing with this structural manifold,
resulting in poor diversity, local optima, and inefficient searches. In this
work, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based manifold interpolation

performance. The main purpose of this paper, besides presenting the code and
some results, is to share interesting experiences with the power system
community, and thus stimulate wider use and further development. Two
interesting conclusions at the current stage of development are as follows:
First, the simulation code is fast enough to emulate real-time simulation for
small and medium-size grids with a time step of 5 ms, and allows for
interactive feedback from the user during the simulation. Second, the
simulation code can be uploaded to an online Python interpreter, edited, run

tool to determine astronomical distances. The common approach of estimating the
PLR is a two-step procedure that first estimates the Mira periods and then runs
a linear regression of magnitude on log period. When the light curves are
sparse and noisy, the accuracy of period estimation decreases and can suffer
from aliasing effects. Some methods improve accuracy by incorporating complex
model structures at the expense of significant computational costs. Another
drawback of existing methods is that they only provide point estimation without
proper estimation of uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we develop a
hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously models the quasi-periodic
variations for a collection of Mira light curves while estimating their common
PLR. By borrowing strengths through the PLR, our method automatically reduces
the aliasing effect, improves the accuracy of period estimation, and is capable
of characterizing the estimation uncertainty. We develop a scalable stochastic
variational inference algorithm for computation that can effectively deal with
the multimodal posterior of period. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through simulations, and an application to observations of Miras
in the Local Group galaxy M33. Without using ad-hoc period correction tricks,
our method achieves a distance estimate of M33 that is consistent with
published work. Our method also shows superior robustness to downsampling of
the light curves.

Contributions from three-nucleon forces are expected to be irrelevant at these

that for Fermi momenta between $\sim 0.25$ and $\sim 0.45$ fm$^{-1}$ the
energy, effective mass and quasiparticle residue of the impurity vary only
slightly, respectively, in the ranges $-0.604\,E_F < E_\downarrow < -0.635\,E_F

observable commonly used for the determination of the nuclear mass composition
of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Direct measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ are
performed using observations of the longitudinal shower development with
fluorescence telescopes. At the same time, several methods have been proposed
for an indirect estimation of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ from the characteristics of
the shower particles registered with surface detector arrays. In this paper, we
present a deep neural network (DNN) for the estimation of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.
The reconstruction relies on the signals induced by shower particles in the
ground based water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The
network architecture features recurrent long short-term memory layers to
process the temporal structure of signals and hexagonal convolutions to exploit
the symmetry of the surface detector array. We evaluate the performance of the
network using air showers simulated with three different hadronic interaction
models. Thereafter, we account for long-term detector effects and calibrate the
reconstructed $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ using fluorescence measurements. Finally, we
show that the event-by-event resolution in the reconstruction of the shower
maximum improves with increasing shower energy and reaches less than
$25~\mathrm{g/cm^{2}}$ at energies above $2\times 10^{19}~\mathrm{eV}$.

quantum state of the entire composite system is modeled using the multi-$\rm
D_2$ Ansatz in combination with the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational
principle. Applying a sinusoidal driving field to one of the qubits, this
device is an ideal platform to study the photon-assisted LZ transitions by
comparing the dynamics of the two qubits. A series of interfering
photon-assisted LZ transitions take place if the photon frequency is much
smaller than the driving amplitude. Once the two energy scales are comparable,
independent LZ transitions arise and a transition pathway is revealed using an
energy diagram. It is found that both adiabatic and nonadiabatic transitions
are involved in the dynamics. Used to model environmental effects on the LZ
transitions, the common phonon mode coupled to the qubits allows for more
available states to facilitate the LZ transitions. An analytical formula is
obtained to estimate the short-time phonon population and produces results in
reasonable agreement with numerical calculations. Equipped with the knowledge
of the photon-assisted LZ transitions in the system, we can precisely
manipulate the qubit state and successfully generate the qubit dynamics with a
square-wave pattern by applying driving fields to both qubits, opening up new

search for Earth-like exoplanets is one of the challenges of modern astronomy.
One of the current limitations are evolving non-common path aberrations (NCPA)
that originate from optics downstream of the main wavefront sensor. The
self-coherent camera (SCC) is an integrated coronagraph and focal-plane
wavefront sensor that generates wavefront information-encoding Fizeau fringes
in the focal plane by adding a reference hole (RH) in the Lyot stop. Here, we
aim to show that by featuring a polarizer in the RH and adding a polarizing
beamsplitter downstream of the Lyot stop, the RH can be placed right next to
the pupil. We refer to this new variant of the SCC as the polarization-encoded
self-coherent camera (PESCC). We study the performance of the PESCC
analytically and numerically, and compare it, where relevant, to the SCC. We
show analytically that the PESCC relaxes the requirements on the focal-plane
sampling and spectral resolution with respect to the SCC by a factor of 2 and
3.5, respectively. Furthermore, we find via our numerical simulations that the
PESCC has effectively access to $\sim$16 times more photons, which improves the
sensitivity of the wavefront sensing by a factor of $\sim4$. We also show that
without additional measurements, the RH point-spread function (PSF) can be
calibrated using PESCC images, enabling coherent differential imaging (CDI) as
a contrast-enhancing post-processing technique for every observation. In
idealized simulations (clear aperture, charge two vortex coronagraph, perfect
DM, no noise sources other than phase and amplitude aberrations) and in
circumstances similar to those of space-based systems, we show that WFSC
combined with CDI can achieve a $1\sigma$ raw contrast of $\sim3\cdot10^{-11}-
8 \cdot 10^{-11}$ between 1 and 18 $\lambda / D$.

spectrometer utilizing state-of-the-art radio-astronomical technologies is
developed. The spectrometer is equipped with a 200 cm glass cylinder cell, a
two sideband (2SB) Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) receiver in
the 230 GHz band, and wide-band auto-correlation digital spectrometers. By
using the four 2.5 GHz digital spectrometers, a total instantaneous bandwidth
of the 2SB SIS receiver of 8 GHz can be covered with a frequency resolution of
88.5 kHz. Spectroscopic measurements of CH$_3$CN and HDO are carried out in the
230 GHz band so as to examine frequency accuracy, stability, sensitivity, as
well as intensity calibration accuracy of our system. As for the result of
CH$_3$CN, we confirm that the frequency accuracy for lines detected with
sufficient signal to noise ratio is better than 1 kHz, when the high resolution
spectrometer having a channel resolution of 17.7 kHz is used. In addition, we
demonstrate the capability of this system by spectral scan measurement of
CH$_3$OH from 216 GHz to 264 GHz. We assign 242 transitions of CH$_3$OH, 51
transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, and 21 unidentified emission lines for 295
detected lines. Consequently, our spectrometer demonstrates sufficient
sensitivity, spectral resolution, and frequency accuracy for in-situ
experimental-based rest frequency measurements of spectral lines on various

Each graph contributes a unique coefficient as well as a proper combination of
color-ordered Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes. This expansion allows one to evaluate
EYM amplitudes through YM amplitudes, the latter have much simpler structures
in four dimensions than the former. In this paper, we classify the refined
graphs for the expansion of EYM amplitudes into $\text{N}^{\,k}$MHV sectors.
Amplitudes in four dimensions, which involve $k+2$ negative-helicity particles,
at most get non-vanishing contribution from graphs in $\text{N}^{\,k'(k'\leq
k)}$MHV sectors. By the help of this classification, we evaluate the
non-vanishing amplitudes with two negative-helicity particles in four
dimensions. We establish a correspondence between the refined graphs for
single-trace amplitudes with $(g^-_i,g^-_j)$ or $(h^-_i,g^-_j)$ configuration
and the spanning forests of the known Hodges determinant form. Inspired by this
correspondence, we further propose a symmetric formula of double-trace
amplitudes with $(g^-_i,g^-_j)$ configuration. By analyzing the cancellation
between refined graphs in four dimensions, we prove that any other tree

identically when ranking them. However, spatial objects often cover different
levels of spatial granularity and thereby are heterogeneous. For example, one
user may prefer to be recommended a region (say Manhattan), while another user
might prefer a venue (say a restaurant). Even for the same user, preferences
can change at different stages of data exploration. In this paper, we study how
to support top-k spatial object recommendations at varying levels of spatial
granularity, enabling spatial objects at varying granularity, such as a city,
suburb, or building, as a Point of Interest (POI). To solve this problem, we
propose the use of a POI tree, which captures spatial containment relationships
between POIs. We design a novel multi-task learning model called MPR (short for
Multi-level POI Recommendation), where each task aims to return the top-k POIs
at a certain spatial granularity level. Each task consists of two subtasks: (i)
attribute-based representation learning; (ii) interaction-based representation
learning. The first subtask learns the feature representations for both users
and POIs, capturing attributes directly from their profiles. The second subtask
incorporates user-POI interactions into the model. Additionally, MPR can
provide insights into why certain recommendations are being made to a user
based on three types of hints: user-aspect, POI-aspect, and interaction-aspect.
We empirically validate our approach using two real-life datasets, and show
promising performance improvements over several state-of-the-art methods.

work, we study the miscalibration of object detection models with respect to
image location and box scale. Our main contribution is to additionally consider
the impact of box selection methods like non-maximum suppression to
calibration. We investigate the default intrinsic calibration of object
detection models and how it is affected by these post-processing techniques.
For this purpose, we distinguish between black-box calibration with non-maximum
suppression and white-box calibration with raw network outputs. Our experiments
reveal that post-processing highly affects confidence calibration. We show that
non-maximum suppression has the potential to degrade initially well-calibrated

overdensity parameter as a function of distance within a radius of 5 arcmin
from the SMG. We validated this approach spectroscopically for those SMGs for
which spectroscopic redshift is available. As an additional test, we searched
for extended X-ray emission as a proxy for the hot intracluster medium,
performing an X-ray stacking analysis in the 0.5-2 keV band with a 32 arcsec

in our sample are located in a galactic dense environment; a fraction that is
similar to previous studies. The spectroscopic redshift is known for 15 of

mostly detectable when they are seen on-axis or very nearly on-axis. However,
GRBs can be seen from off-axis angles, and the recent detection of a short GRB
associated to a gravitational wave event has conclusively shown such a
scenario. The observer viewing angle plays an important role in the observable
spectral shape and the energetic of such events. We present a numerical model
which is based on the single-pulse approximation with emission from a top-hat
jet and has been developed to investigate the effects of the observer viewing
angle. We assume a conical jet parametrized by a radius $R_{\rm jet}$,
half-opening angle $\theta_{\rm jet}$, a comoving-frame emissivity law and an
observer viewing angle $\theta_{\rm obs}$, and then study the effects for the
conditions $\theta_{\rm obs} < \theta_{\rm jet}$ and $\theta_{\rm obs}
>\theta_{\rm jet}$. We present results considering a smoothly broken power-law
emissivity law in jet comoving frame, albeit the model implementation easily
allows to consider other emissivity laws. We find that the relation $E^{\rm
i}_{\rm p} \propto E_{\rm iso}^{0.5}$ (Amati relation) is naturally obtained
from pure relativistic kinematic when $\Gamma \gtrsim 10$ and $\theta_{\rm obs}
< \theta_{\rm jet}$; on the contrary, when $\theta_{\rm obs} > \theta_{\rm
jet}$ it results $E^{\rm i}_{\rm p} \propto E_{\rm iso}^{0.25}$. Using data
from literature for a class of well-know sub-energetic GRBs, we show that their
position in the $E^{\rm i}_{\rm p}-E_{\rm iso}$ plane is consistent with event
observed off-axis. The presented model is developed as a module to be

to model the governing equations of a system from data, without needing prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. In this work, we use sparse regression to
build an accurate and explainable model of the stellar mass of central galaxies
given properties of their host dark matter (DM) halo. Our data set comprises
9,521 central galaxies from the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation. By matching the
host halos to a DM-only simulation, we collect the halo mass and specific
angular momentum at present time and for their main progenitors in 10 redshift
bins from $z=0$ to $z=4$. The principal component of our governing equation is
a third-order polynomial of the host halo mass, which models the stellar-mass
halo-mass relation. The scatter about this relation is driven by the halo mass
evolution and is captured by second and third-order correlations of the halo
mass evolution with the present halo mass. An advantage of sparse regression
approaches is that unnecessary terms are removed. Although we include
information on halo specific angular momentum, these parameters are discarded
by our methodology. This suggests that halo angular momentum has little
connection to galaxy formation efficiency. Our model has a root mean square
error (RMSE) of $0.167 \log_{10}(M^*/M_\odot)$, and accurately reproduces both
the stellar mass function and central galaxy correlation function of EAGLE. The
methodology appears to be an encouraging approach for populating the halos of
DM-only simulations with galaxies, and we discuss the next steps that are
required.

the solutions of the associated harmonic differential model, and as a
consequence, a general harmonic framework for Linear Time Periodic (LTP)

interaction among qubits, which can be challenging for practical applications.
Here, we propose an entanglement-enhanced sensing scheme with an always-on

Ising chain as the probe system, making use of the so-called quantum domino

advantage that our scheme can be implemented without controlling the

galaxy through their broadband electromagnetic emission. These jets are
considered potential galactic neutrino sources. MQs can also have been formed
by the first generations of stars in the universe, i.e., Population III (Pop
III) stars, which are considered essential contributors to the ionization
processes that took place during the period of 'cosmic reionization'. In the
present work, we develop a model that accounts for the main particle processes
occurring within Pop III MQ jets, with the aim to obtain the diffuse neutrino
flux at the Earth [...] We find that, for a range of parameters suitable for
Pop III MQ jets, the most relevant site for neutrino production in the jets is
the base of the inner conical jet. Additionally, if protons accelerated at the
forward shock formed at terminal jet region can escape from the outer shell,
they would produce further neutrinos via $p{\gamma}$ interactions with the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). The latter contribution to the diffuse
neutrino flux turns out to be dominant in the range $10^7 {\rm GeV} \lesssim
E_{\nu} \lesssim 10^9 {\rm GeV}$, while the neutrinos produced in the inner jet
could only account for a small fraction of the IceCube flux for $E_{\nu}\sim
10^5$ GeV. The co-produced multiwavelength photon background is also computed
and it is checked to be in agreement with observations.

however, they often need to be transferred to arbitrary substrates for further

determining candidates for faulty code locations. If a human programmer has to

techniques of following dependencies along dynamic slices may be better suited.
In a large study of 457 bugs (369 single faults and 88 multiple faults) in 46
open source C programs, we compare the effectiveness of statistical fault
localization against dynamic slicing. For single faults, we find that dynamic
slicing was eight percentage points more effective than the best performing
statistical debugging formula; for 66% of the bugs, dynamic slicing finds the
fault earlier than the best performing statistical debugging formula. In our
evaluation, dynamic slicing is more effective for programs with single fault,
but statistical debugging performs better on multiple faults. Best results,
however, are obtained by a hybrid approach: If programmers first examine at
most the top five most suspicious locations from statistical debugging, and
then switch to dynamic slices, on average, they will need to examine 15% (30
lines) of the code. These findings hold for 18 most effective statistical
debugging formulas and our results are independent of the number of faults

system point of view by disentangling the residual dynamics from the output
activities before the classification stage. For a network with simple skip
connections between every successive layer, and for logistic activation
function, and shared weights between layers, we show analytically that there is
a cooperation and competition dynamics between residuals corresponding to each
input dimension. Interpreting these kind of networks as nonlinear filters, the
steady state value of the residuals in the case of attractor networks are
indicative of the common features between different input dimensions that the
network has observed during training, and has encoded in those components. In
cases where residuals do not converge to an attractor state, their internal
dynamics are separable for each input class, and the network can reliably
approximate the output. We bring analytical and empirical evidence that
residual networks classify inputs based on the integration of the transient
dynamics of the residuals, and will show how the network responds to input
perturbations. We compare the network dynamics for a ResNet and a Multi-Layer
Perceptron and show that the internal dynamics, and the noise evolution are
fundamentally different in these networks, and ResNets are more robust to noisy
inputs. Based on these findings, we also develop a new method to adjust the

logic functions at smaller CMOS footprints. Thermal-crosstalk during the write
operations is utilized to recrystallize the previously amorphized regions to
achieve toggle operations. Amorphized regions formed between different pairs of
write contacts are utilized to isolate read contacts. Typical expected
reduction in CMOS footprint is ~ 50% using the described approach for

the phase change devices are in the order of nanoseconds and are inherently

A Robinson
incomplete symmetric matrix is an incomplete symmetric matrix whose non-missing
entries do not decrease along rows and columns when moving toward the diagonal.
A Strong-Robinson incomplete symmetric matrix is an incomplete symmetric matrix
$A$ such that $a_{k,l} \geq a_{i,j}$ if $a_{i,j}$ and $a_{k,l}$ are two
non-missing entries of $A$ and $i\leq k \leq l \leq j$. On the other hand, an
incomplete symmetric matrix is Strong-Robinsonian if there is a simultaneous
reordering of its rows and columns that produces a Strong-Robinson matrix. In
this document, we first show that there is an incomplete Robinson matrix which
is not Strong-Robinsonian. Therefore, these two definitions are not equivalent.
Secondly, we study the recognition problem for Strong-Robinsonian incomplete
matrices. It is known that recognition of incomplete Robinsonian matrices is
NP-Complete. We show that the recognition of incomplete Strong-Robinsonian
matrices is also NP-Complete. However, we show that recognition of
Strong-Robinsonian matrices can be parametrized with respect to the number of

Strong-Robinsonian matrices, where $b$ is the number of missing entries, $n$ is
the size of the matrix, and $|w|$ is the number of different values in the

Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory, which is prompted by the classification of
general Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories. The gyromagnetic ratio of this black
hole is calculated, and it increases as the second free parameter $\beta$
increases, but decreases with the increasing parameter $\gamma\equiv \frac{2
\alpha^{2}}{1+\alpha^2}$. In the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) theory, the
parameter $\beta$ vanishes, but the free parameter $\alpha$ governing the
strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the Maxwell field remains. The
gyromagnetic ratio is always less than $2$, the well-known value for a
Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole as well as for a Dirac electron. Scalar hairs
reduce the magnetic dipole moment in dilaton theory, resulting in a drop in the
gyromagnetic ratio. However, we find that the gyromagnetic ratio of two can be
realized in this Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory by increasing $\beta$ and the
charge-to-mass ratio $Q/M$ simultaneously (recall that the gyromagnetic ratio
of KN black holes is independent of $Q/M$). The same situation also applies to
the angular velocity of a locally non-rotating observer. Moreover, we analyze
the period correction for circular orbits in terms of charge-to-mass ratio, as
well as the correction of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits.
It is found the correction increases with $\beta$ but decreases with $Q/M$.
Finally, the total radiative efficiency is investigated, and it can vanish once
the effect of rotation is considered.

Moreover, the inter-class variance of both pedestrian images and descriptions

clues across all scales. Most existing methods merely consider the local
alignment between images and texts within a single scale (e.g. only global
scale or only partial scale) then simply construct alignment at each scale
separately. To address this problem, we propose a method that is able to
adaptively align image and textual features across all scales, called NAFS
(i.e.Non-local Alignment over Full-Scale representations). Firstly, a novel
staircase network structure is proposed to extract full-scale image features
with better locality. Secondly, a BERT with locality-constrained attention is
proposed to obtain representations of descriptions at different scales. Then,
instead of separately aligning features at each scale, a novel contextual
non-local attention mechanism is applied to simultaneously discover latent
alignments across all scales. The experimental results show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 5.53% in terms of top-1 and 5.35%

fractionation by the ponderomotive force associated with magnetohydrodynamic

fractionation arises in order to better understand its relation to the usual
FIP Effect, i.e. the enhancement of coronal abundance of Fe, Mg, Si, etc. The
FIP Effect is generated by parallel propagating Alfv\'en waves, with either
photospheric, or more likely coronal, origins. The Inverse FIP Effect arises as
upward propagating fast mode waves with an origin in the photosphere or below,
refract back downwards in the chromosphere where the Alfv\'en speed is
increasing with altitude. We give a more physically motivated picture of the
FIP fractionation, based on the wave refraction around inhomogeneities in the

of heat transfer is monitored versus velocity, superfluid fraction and time.
The fluid is $^4$He helium with a superfluid fraction varied from 71% down to
0% and an imposed velocity up to 3 m/s, while the characteristic sizes of
heaters range from 1.3 $\mu$m up to few hundreds of microns. At low heat
fluxes, no velocity dependence is observed. In contrast, some velocity
dependence emerges at larger heat flux, as reported previously, and three
non-trivial properties of heat transfer are identified. First, at the largest
superfluid fraction (71%), a new heat transfer regime appears at non-null
velocities and it is typically 10% less conductive than at zero velocity.
Second, the velocity dependence of the mean heat transfer is compatible with
the square-root dependence observed in classical fluids. Surprisingly, the
prefactor to this dependence is maximum for an intermediate superfluid fraction
or temperature (around 2 K). Third, the heat transfer time series exhibit
highly conductive short-lived events. These \textit{cooling glitches} have a
velocity-dependent characteristic time, which manifest itself as a broad and
energetic peak in the spectrum of heat transfer time series, in the kHz range.
After showing that the velocity dependence can be attributed to the breaking of
superfluidity within a thin shell surrounding heaters, an analytical model of
forced heat transfer in a quantum flow is developed to account for the
properties reported above. We argue that large scale flow patterns must form
around the heater, having a size proportional to the heat flux (here two
decades larger than the heater diameter) and resulting in a turbulent wake. The
observed spectral peaking of heat transfer is quantitatively consistent with
the formation of a Von K\'arm\'an vortex street in the wake of a bluff body.

rough (irregular) functional that is a member of $W^{-1,p}(\Omega)$, though not
of $L^1(\Omega)$, but one strives for a regular approximation in $L^1(\Omega)$.
We focus on projections onto discrete finite element spaces $G_n$, and consider
both discontinuous as well as continuous piecewise-polynomial approximations.
  While the proposed method aims to compute the best approximation as measured
in the negative (dual) norm, for practical reasons, we will employ a
computable, discrete dual norm that supremizes over a discrete subspace $V_m$.
We show that this idea leads to a fully discrete method given by a mixed
problem on $V_m\times G_n$. We propose a discontinuous as well as a continuous
lowest-order pair, prove that they are compatible, and therefore obtain
quasi-optimally convergent methods.
  We present numerical experiments that compute finite element approximations
to Dirac delta's and line sources. We also present adaptively generate meshes,
obtained from an error representation that comes with the method. Finally, we
show how the presented projection method can be used to efficiently compute
numerical approximations to partial differential equations with rough data.

simulation of lightning strike on aircraft. Due to the complexities of species
ionisation and interaction, although phenomenological curve fitting of
thermodynamic properties is possible, these curves are intractable for
practical numerical simulation. The large difference in size of the parameters
(many orders of magnitude) and complexity of the equations means they are not
straightforward to invert for conversion between thermodynamic variables. The
approach of this paper is to take an accurate 19-species phenomenological
model, and use this to generate a tabulated data set. Coupled with a suitable
interpolation procedure this offers an accurate and computationally efficient
technique for simulating partially ionised air plasma. The equation of state is
implemented within a multiphysics methodology which can solve for two-way
coupling between a plasma arc and an elastoplastic material substrate. The
implementation is validated against experimental results, both for a single
material plasma, and an arc coupled to a substrate. It is demonstrated that
accurate, oscillation-free thermodynamic profiles can be obtained, with good
results even close to material surfaces.

the horizontal plates into three distinct regions, and we observe that the
local thermal BL thicknesses in the plume-ejection region are larger than those

this study due to their proximity to Earth. We have obtained XMM-Newton
phase-resolved X-ray and ultraviolet observations of the two objects for

much brighter than SDSS J103533.02+055158.3 at X-ray and ultraviolet
wavelengths and the eclipse could be studied in some detail. An updated eclipse
ephemeris was derived. The X-rays were shown to originate close to the white
dwarf, the boundary layer, with significant absorption affecting its spectrum.
There was no absorption in SDSS J103533.02+055158.3, despite being observed at
the same inclination indicating different shapes of the disk and the disk rim.
The white-dwarf temperature was re-determined for both objects: the white dwarf
in OV Boo was still hot (23,000 K) five months after a dwarf nova outburst, and
the white dwarf in SDSS J103533.02+055158.3 hotter than assumed previously
(Teff = 11,500 K). All three cataclysmic variables with degenerate donors
studied so far in X-rays, including SDSS J121209.31+013627.7, were clearly
discovered in X-rays and revealed mass accretion rates dot(M) >= 8 x 10^(-15)
Msun/ yr. If their X-ray behavior is representative of the subpopulation of
period bouncers, the all-sky X-ray surveys with eROSITA together with
comprehensive follow-up will uncover new objects in sufficient number to

(TLG) structures connected to a heat source, and is produced by changes of the
electronic density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level when external gate
fields are applied on the outer graphene layers. We demonstrate the AAA-stacked

potential strength. We reveal otherwise the TLG with Bernal-ABA stacking
geometry generates both the inverse and direct EC response in the same sample,
associated with a gate-dependent electronic entropy transition at finite
temperature. By varying the chemical potential to different Fermi levels, we
find maxima and minima of the DOS are located near the extremes of the
electronic entropy, which are correlated with sign changes in the differential
entropy per particle, giving a particular experimentally measurable electronic
entropy spectrum for each TLG geometry. The EC effect in quantum

to the existence of a morphotropic phase region (MPR) containing an

and tetragonal ($T$) BCT phases. However, there is ambiguity regarding the
morphotropic phase transition in BZCT at room temperature - while some
experiments suggest a single $O$ phase within the MPR, others indicate
coexistence of three polar phases ($T+R+O$). Therefore, to understand the
thermodynamic stability of polar phases and its relation to electromechanical
switching during morphotropic phase transition in BZCT, we develop a Landau
potential based on the theory of polar anisotropy. Since intrinsic
electrostrictive anisotropy changes as a function of electromechanical
processing, we establish a correlation between the parameters of our potential
and the coefficients of electrostriction. We also conducted phase-field
simulations based on this potential to demonstrate changes in domain
configuration from single-phase $O$ to three-phase $T+R+O$ at the equimolar
composition with the increase in electrostrictive anisotropy. Diffusionless
phase diagrams and the corresponding piezoelectric coefficients obtained from
our model compare well with the experimental findings. Increase in
electrostrictive anisotropy increases the degeneracy of the free energy at
ambient temperature and pressure leading to decreasing polar anisotropy,
although there is an accompanying increase in the electromechanical anisotropy
manifested by an increase in the difference between effective longitudinal and
transverse piezo-coefficients, $d_{33}$ and $d_{31}$.

researchers value about their research, in particular research quality, and
what metrics measure. The existence of evaluation gaps can give rise to
questions about the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to
perform research, i.e. how field-specific notions of quality compete with
notions captured via evaluation metrics, and consequently how researchers
manage the balancing act between intrinsic values and requirements of
evaluation procedures. This study analyses the evaluation gap from a rational
choice point of view for the case of observational astronomers, based on a
literature review and 19 semi-structured interviews with international
astronomers. By taking a close look at the role of institutional norms and
different forms of capital - such as funding, publication rates and granted
telescope time - at play in astronomy, light can be shed on the workings of the
balance act and its consequences on research quality in astronomy. We find that
astronomers experience an anomie; they want to follow their intrinsic
motivation to pursue science in order to push knowledge forward, while at the

interventions in the face of an uncertain and rapidly changing knowledge
landscape and the subsequent use of scientific information in public debates
related to the policy interventions. Our approach is to combine scientific
information from journal articles and preprints with their appearance in the
popular media, including social media. First, we provide a picture of the
different scientific areas and approaches, by which the effects of COVID-19 on
children are being studied. Second, we identify news media and social media
attention around the COVID-19 scientific output related to children and
schools. We focus on policies and media responses in three countries: Spain,
South Africa and the Netherlands. These countries have followed very different
policy actions with regard to the reopening of schools and represent very
different policy approaches to the same problem. We analyse the activity in
(social) media around the debate between COVID-19, children and school closures
by focusing on the use of references to scientific information in the debate.
Finally, we analyse the dominant topics that emerge in the news outlets and the
online debates. We draw attention to illustrative cases of miscommunication
related to scientific output and conclude the chapter by discussing how
information from scientific publication, the media and policy actions shape the
public discussion in the context of a global health pandemic.

to date, no theoretical model has succeeded in explaining the origins of these
objects' winds. This strongly limits our understanding of red supergiant
evolution and Type II-P and II-L supernova progenitor properties.
  Aims. We examine the role that vigorous atmospheric turbulence may play in
initiating and determining the mass-loss rates of red supergiant stars.
  Methods. We analytically and numerically solve the equations of conservation
of mass and momentum, which we later couple to an atmospheric temperature
structure, to obtain theoretically motivated mass-loss rates. We then compare
these to state-of-the-art empirical mass-loss rate scaling formulae as well as
observationally inferred mass-loss rates of red supergiants.
  Results. We find that the pressure due to the characteristic turbulent
velocities inferred for red supergiants is sufficient to explain the mass-loss
rates of these objects in the absence of the normally employed opacity from
circumstellar dust. Motivated by this initial success, we provide a first
theoretical and fully analytic mass-loss rate prescription for red supergiants.
We conclude by highlighting some intriguing possible implications of these
rates for future studies of stellar evolution, especially in light of the lack
of a direct dependence on metallicity.

proposed to learn profitable investment strategies. The rules learned by these
models outperform the previous strategies specially in high frequency trading
environments. However, it is shown that the quality of the extracted features
from a long-term sequence of raw prices of the instruments greatly affects the
performance of the trading rules learned by these models. Employing a neural
encoder-decoder structure to extract informative features from complex input
time-series has proved very effective in other popular tasks like neural
machine translation and video captioning in which the models face a similar
problem. The encoder-decoder framework extracts highly informative features
from a long sequence of prices along with learning how to generate outputs
based on the extracted features. In this paper, a novel end-to-end model based
on the neural encoder-decoder framework combined with DRL is proposed to learn
single instrument trading strategies from a long sequence of raw prices of the
instrument. The proposed model consists of an encoder which is a neural
structure responsible for learning informative features from the input
sequence, and a decoder which is a DRL model responsible for learning
profitable strategies based on the features extracted by the encoder. The
parameters of the encoder and the decoder structures are learned jointly, which
enables the encoder to extract features fitted to the task of the decoder DRL.
In addition, the effects of different structures for the encoder and various
forms of the input sequences on the performance of the learned strategies are
investigated. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperforms
other state-of-the-art models in highly dynamic environments.

implementation is based entirely on a Plumed collective variable developed for
this purpose, the fine tuning of Gromacs input parameters, modified forcefields
and custom non-bonded interactions. We demonstrate this implementation on
Alanine Dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and on the 12-residue Alanine
Polypeptide in water and compare the results with a standard multiple-replica
technique such as Parallel Tempering. In all the considered cases this
comparison is consistent and the results with Dimer Metadynamics are smoother
and require shorter simulations, thus proving the consistency and effectiveness
of this Gromacs implementation.

  Communication Systems","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Huge overhead of beam training imposes a significant challenge in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communications. To address this issue, in
this paper, we propose a wide beam based training approach to calibrate the
narrow beam direction according to the channel power leakage. To handle the
complex nonlinear properties of the channel power leakage, deep learning is
utilized to predict the optimal narrow beam directly. Specifically, three deep
learning assisted calibrated beam training schemes are proposed. The first
scheme adopts convolution neural network to implement the prediction based on
the instantaneous received signals of wide beam training. We also perform the
additional narrow beam training based on the predicted probabilities for
further beam direction calibrations. However, the first scheme only depends on
one wide beam training, which lacks the robustness to noise. To tackle this
problem, the second scheme adopts long-short term memory (LSTM) network for
tracking the movement of users and calibrating the beam direction according to
the received signals of prior beam training, in order to enhance the robustness
to noise. To further reduce the overhead of wide beam training, our third
scheme, an adaptive beam training strategy, selects partial wide beams to be
trained based on the prior received signals. Two criteria, namely, optimal
neighboring criterion and maximum probability criterion, are designed for the
selection. Furthermore, to handle mobile scenarios, auxiliary LSTM is
introduced to calibrate the directions of the selected wide beams more
precisely. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve
significantly higher beamforming gain with smaller beam training overhead
compared with the conventional and existing deep-learning based counterparts.

prediction, which can be generally categorized as convolutional (CNNs) or graph
neural networks (GNNs). CNNs are preferable for region-wise traffic prediction
by taking advantage of localized spatial correlations, whilst GNNs achieves
better performance for graph-structured traffic data. When applied to
region-wise traffic prediction, CNNs typically partition an underlying
territory into grid-like spatial units, and employ standard convolutions to
learn spatial dependence among the units. However, standard convolutions with
fixed geometric structures cannot fully model the nonstationary characteristics
of local traffic flows. To overcome the deficiency, we introduce deformable
convolution that augments the spatial sampling locations with additional
offsets, to enhance the modeling capability of spatial nonstationarity. On this
basis, we design a deep deformable convolutional residual network, namely
DeFlow-Net, that can effectively model global spatial dependence, local spatial
nonstationarity, and temporal periodicity of traffic flows. Furthermore, to
better fit with convolutions, we suggest to first aggregate traffic flows
according to pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions based on traffic
flows, then dispose to sequentially organized raster images for network input.
Extensive experiments on real-world traffic flows demonstrate that DeFlow-Net
outperforms GNNs and existing CNNs using standard convolutions, and spatial
partition by pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions further enhances
the performance. We also demonstrate the advantage of DeFlow-Net in maintaining
spatial autocorrelation, and reveal the impacts of partition shapes and scales
on deep traffic flow prediction.

Bayesian statistics. Confusion and mistakes are produced in the presentation of
the Bayesian results. Some key statistics, such as Bayesian credible intervals,
are mislabeled and stated as confidence intervals. Posterior probabilities of
the vaccine efficacy are not reported as the main results. We illustrate the
main differences in the reporting of Bayesian analysis results for a clinical
trial and provide four recommendations. We argue that statistical evidence from
a Bayesian trial, when presented properly, is easier to interpret and directly
addresses the main clinical questions, thereby better supporting regulatory
decision making. We also recommend using abbreviation ""BI"" to represent
Bayesian credible intervals as a differentiation to ""CI"" which stands for
confidence interval.

delay function over frequency bandwidth. In this paper, the idea of trapping
the electromagnetic waves in a feedback loop is proposed to achieve higher
group delay swing. The proposed structure includes two transmission lines and
two junctions that act as power divider/combiner. The transmission lines can be
either dispersive or non-dispersive. The group delay in the proposed
configuration is proportional to the injected power into the feedback loop. So,
an increase in the group delay swing can be done by improving the junctions or
by adding more feedback loops to the structure. Based on this configuration, a
novel DDS, using the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) transmission line, is
introduced. According to the experimental results, the proposed device with a
relatively compact size creates high group delay swings (9 ns), and its
insertion loss is about 7 dB.
