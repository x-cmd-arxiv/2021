contact information for mid-air interactions with virtual objects. In
particular, we propose the use of electrotactile feedback to render the
interpenetration distance between the user's finger and the virtual content is
touched. Our approach consists of modulating the perceived intensity (frequency
and pulse width modulation) of the electrotactile stimuli according to the
registered interpenetration distance. In a user study (N=21), we assessed the
performance of four different interpenetration feedback approaches:
electrotactile-only, visual-only, electrotactile and visual, and no
interpenetration feedback. First, the results showed that contact precision and
accuracy were significantly improved when using interpenetration feedback.
Second, and more interestingly, there were no significant differences between
visual and electrotactile feedback when the calibration was optimized and the
user was familiarized with electrotactile feedback. Taken together, these
results suggest that electrotactile feedback could be an efficient replacement
of visual feedback for enhancing contact information in virtual reality
avoiding the need of active visual focus and the rendering of additional visual
artefacts.

specifying temporality in the conceptual modeling of software and database
systems. In the database field, various proposals and products address temporal
data. The difficulty with most of the current approaches to modeling
temporality is that they represent and record time as just another type of data
(e.g., values of a bank balance or amounts of money), instead of appreciating
that time and its values are unique, in comparison to typical data attributes.
Time is an engulfing phenomenon that lifts a system s entire model from
staticity to dynamism and beyond. In this paper, we propose a conceptualization
of temporality involving the construction of a multilevel modeling method that
progresses from static representation to system compositions that form regions
of dynamism. Then, a chronology of events is used to define the system s
behavior. Lastly, the events are viewed as data sources with which to build a
temporal model. A case-study model of a temporal banking-management system
database that extends UML and the object-constraint language is re-modeled
using thinging machine (TM) modeling. The resultant TM diagrammatic
specification delivers a new approach to temporality that can be extended to be
a holistic monitoring system for historic data and events.

electromagnetic field of such an electron, we employ a generalized
surface-current method, applicable for a wide range of parameters. The radiated
energy contains contributions from the charge, from the magnetic moment, and
from the electric quadrupole moment, as well as from their interference. The
quadrupole contribution grows as the packet spreads while propagating, and it
is enhanced for large $\ell$. In contrast to the linear growth of the radiation
intensity from the charge with a number of strips $N$, the quadrupole
contribution reveals an $N^3$ dependence, which puts a limit on the maximal
grating length for which the radiation losses stay small. We study
spectral-angular distributions of the Smith-Purcell radiation both analytically

detectable effects for non-relativistic and moderately relativistic electrons.

non-Gaussian packet with a quadrupole moment -- such as the vortex electron, an
Airy beam, a Schr\""odinger cat state, and so on -- one can achieve quantum

objective-measures of image quality (IQ) that quantify the performance of an
observer at specific tasks. Variation in the objects to-be-imaged is an
important source of variability that can significantly limit observer
performance. This object variability can be described by stochastic object
models (SOMs). In order to establish SOMs that can accurately model realistic
object variability, it is desirable to use experimental data. To achieve this,
an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture called
AmbientGAN has been developed and investigated. However, AmbientGANs cannot be
immediately trained by use of advanced GAN training methods such as the
progressive growing of GANs (ProGANs). Therefore, the ability of AmbientGANs to
establish realistic object models is limited. To circumvent this, a
progressively-growing AmbientGAN (ProAmGAN) has been proposed. However,
ProAmGANs are designed for generating two-dimensional (2D) images while medical
imaging modalities are commonly employed for imaging three-dimensional (3D)
objects. Moreover, ProAmGANs that employ traditional generator architectures
lack the ability to control specific image features such as fine-scale textures
that are frequently considered when optimizing imaging systems. In this study,
we address these limitations by proposing two advanced AmbientGAN
architectures: 3D ProAmGANs and Style-AmbientGANs (StyAmGANs). Stylized
numerical studies involving magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems are
conducted. The ability of 3D ProAmGANs to learn 3D SOMs from imaging
measurements and the ability of StyAmGANs to control fine-scale textures of
synthesized objects are demonstrated.

social groups and knowledge domains, leading to differences even in the
monolingual scenario. Such variation in word usage is often called lexical
semantic change (LSC). The goal of LSC is to characterize and quantify language
variations with respect to word meaning, to measure how distinct two language
sources are (that is, people or language models). Because there is hardly any
data available for such a task, most solutions involve unsupervised methods to
align two embeddings and predict semantic change with respect to a distance
measure. To that end, we propose a self-supervised approach to model lexical
semantic change by generating training samples by introducing perturbations of
word vectors in the input corpora. We show that our method can be used for the
detection of semantic change with any alignment method. Furthermore, it can be
used to choose the landmark words to use in alignment and can lead to
substantial improvements over the existing techniques for alignment.
  We illustrate the utility of our techniques using experimental results on
three different datasets, involving words with the same or different meanings.
Our methods not only provide significant improvements but also can lead to
novel findings for the LSC problem.

from a political regime where educated people have more voting power than the
uneducated or less educated. The algorithm is a self-adaptive, and
multi-population optimizer in which the evolution process takes place in
parallel for many populations led by a council of leaders. To avoid stagnation
in poor local optima and to prevent a premature convergence, the algorithm
employs multiple mechanisms such as dynamic and adaptive leadership based on
gravitational force, dynamic population allocation and diversification,
variance-based step-size determination, and regression-based leadership
adjustment. The algorithm uses a stratified sampling method called Latin
Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to distribute the initial population more evenly for
exploration of the search space and exploitation of the accumulated knowledge.
To investigate the performance and evaluate the reliability of the algorithm,
we have used a set of multimodal benchmark functions, and then applied the
algorithm to the MNIST dataset to further verify the accuracy, scalability, and
robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the Epistocracy
algorithm outperforms the tested state-of-the-art evolutionary and swarm

accurate and precise optical frequency measurements in a compact and deployable

tailoring the microresonator's geometric dispersion. However, geometric
dispersion engineering alone may be insufficient for sustaining bandwidths well
beyond an octave. Here, we introduce the novel concept of synthetic dispersion,
in which a second pump laser effectively alters the dispersion landscape to
create Kerr soliton microcombs that extend far beyond the anomalous geometric
dispersion region. Through detailed numerical simulations, we show that the
synthetic dispersion model captures the system's key physical behavior, in
which the second pump enables non-degenerate four-wave mixing that produces new
dispersive waves on both sides of the spectrum. We experimentally demonstrate
these concepts by pumping a silicon nitride microring resonator at 1060 nm and
1550 nm to generate a single soliton microcomb whose bandwidth approaches two

  Experiences","ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (Accepted), 2021",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) is an enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT)
technology that supports long-range, low-power, and low-cost connectivity to
numerous devices. To avoid the crowd in the limited ISM band (where most LPWANs
operate) and cost of licensed band, the recently proposed SNOW (Sensor Network
over White Spaces) is a promising LPWAN platform that operates over the TV
white spaces. As it is a very recent technology and is still in its infancy,
the current SNOW implementation uses the USRP devices as LPWAN nodes, which has
high costs (~$750 USD per device) and large form-factors, hindering its
applicability in practical deployment. In this paper, we implement SNOW using
low-cost, low form-factor, low-power, and widely available commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) devices to enable its practical and large-scale
deployment. Our choice of the COTS device (TI CC13x0: CC1310 or CC1350)
consequently brings down the cost and form-factor of a SNOW node by 25x and
10x, respectively. Such implementation of SNOW on the CC13x0 devices, however,
faces a number of challenges to enable link reliability and communication
range. Our implementation addresses these challenges by handling
peak-to-average power ratio problem, channel state information estimation,
carrier frequency offset estimation, and near-far power problem. Our deployment
in the city of Detroit, Michigan demonstrates that CC13x0-based SNOW can
achieve uplink and downlink throughputs of 11.2kbps and 4.8kbps per node,
respectively, over a distance of 1km. Also, the overall throughput in the
uplink increases linearly with the increase in the number of SNOW nodes.

We apply our method to the parity task, a challenging benchmark problem that
highlights inversion and permutation symmetries, and to a chaotic system
inference task that presents an inversion symmetry rule. For the parity task,
our symmetry-aware RC obtains zero error using an exponentially reduced neural
network and training data, greatly speeding up the time to result and
outperforming hand crafted artificial neural networks. When both symmetries are
respected, we find that the network size $N$ necessary to obtain zero error for
50 different RC instances scales linearly with the parity-order $n$. Moreover,
some symmetry-aware RC instances perform a zero error classification with only
$N=1$ for $n\leq7$. Furthermore, we show that a symmetry-aware RC only needs a
training data set with size on the order of $(n+n/2)$ to obtain such
performance, an exponential reduction in comparison to a regular RC which
requires a training data set with size on the order of $n2^n$ to contain all
$2^n$ possible $n-$bit-long sequences. For the inference task, we show that a
symmetry-aware RC presents a normalized root-mean-square error three
orders-of-magnitude smaller than regular RCs. For both tasks, our RC approach
respects the symmetries by adjusting only the input and the output layers, and
not by problem-based modifications to the neural network. We anticipate that

understand how the size and depth of the network affect its ability to
approximate real functions. However, not all functions are interesting from a
practical viewpoint: functions of interest usually have a polynomially-bounded
Lipschitz constant, and can be computed efficiently. We call functions that
satisfy these conditions ""benign"", and explore the benefits of size and depth
for approximation of benign functions with ReLU networks. As we show, this
problem is more challenging than the corresponding problem for non-benign
functions. We give barriers to showing depth-lower-bounds: Proving existence of
a benign function that cannot be approximated by polynomial-size networks of
depth $4$ would settle longstanding open problems in computational complexity.
It implies that beyond depth $4$ there is a barrier to showing depth-separation
for benign functions, even between networks of constant depth and networks of
nonconstant depth. We also study size-separation, namely, whether there are
benign functions that can be approximated with networks of size $O(s(d))$, but
not with networks of size $O(s'(d))$. We show a complexity-theoretic barrier to
proving such results beyond size $O(d\log^2(d))$, but also show an explicit
benign function, that can be approximated with networks of size $O(d)$ and not
with networks of size $o(d/\log d)$. For approximation in $L_\infty$ we achieve
such separation already between size $O(d)$ and size $o(d)$. Moreover, we show
superpolynomial size lower bounds and barriers to such lower bounds, depending
on the assumptions on the function. Our size-separation results rely on an
analysis of size lower bounds for Boolean functions, which is of independent
interest: We show linear size lower bounds for computing explicit Boolean
functions with neural networks and threshold circuits.

calculations of the cross-sections and rates of the different collisional and

the electron-impact excitation (EIE) cross-sections in the Plane Wave Born

EIE cross-section is expressed in terms of integrals, involving spherical
Bessel functions, which can be calculated analytically. In order to remedy the
fact that the PWB approximation is not correct at low energy (near threshold),
we consider different correcting factors (Elwert-Sommerfeld, Cowan-Robb,
Kilcrease-Brookes). We also investigate the role of plasma density effects such
as Coulomb screening and quantum degeneracy on the EIE rate. This requires to
integrate the collision strength multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac distribution and
the Pauli blocking factor. We show that, using an analytical fit often used in
collisional-radiative models, the EIE rate can be calculated accurately without
any numerical integration, and compare our expression with a correction factor

several attempts have been made to harness CNNs to extract insights from

this work, we consider a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) scenario where
both input data and model parameters are secured using FHE. Using the CKKS
scheme available in the open-source HElib library, we show that operational

intrusive contact devices such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest straps, and
pulse oximeters that require the patient or the health provider to manually

need for specialized heart and blood pressure monitoring equipment. Non-contact
methods can have additional advantages since they are scalable with any
environment where video can be captured, can be used for continuous
measurements, and can be used on patients with varying levels of dexterity and
independence, from people with physical impairments to infants (e.g., baby
camera). In this paper, we used a non-contact method that only requires face
videos recorded using commercially-available webcams. These videos were
exploited to predict the health attributes like pulse rate and variance in
pulse rate. The proposed approach used facial recognition to detect the face in
each frame of the video using facial landmarks, followed by supervised learning
using deep neural networks to train the machine learning model. The videos
captured subjects performing different physical activities that result in
varying cardiovascular responses. The proposed method did not require training
data from every individual and thus the prediction can be obtained for the new
individuals for which there is no prior data; critical in approach
generalization. The approach was also evaluated on a dataset of people with
different ethnicity. The proposed approach had less than a 4.6\% error in
predicting the pulse rate.

  MRI Restoration using Deep Learning","18 pages, 10 figures",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  22. Shortening acquisition time and reducing the motion-artifact are two of
the most critical issues in MRI. As a promising solution, high-quality MRI
image restoration provides a new approach to achieve higher resolution without
costing additional acquisition time or modification on the pulse sequences.
Recently, as to the rise of deep learning, convolutional neural networks have
been proposed for super-resolution (SR) image generation and motion-artifact
reduction (MAR) for MRI. Recent studies suggest that using perceptual feature
space loss and k space loss to capture the perceptual information and
high-frequency information of images, respectively. However, the quality of
reconstructed SR and MAR MR images is limited because the most important
details of the informative area in the MR image, the edges and the structure,
cannot be very well restored. Besides, lots of the SR approaches are trained by
using low-resolution images generated by applying bicubic or blur-downscale
degradation, which cannot represent the real process of MRI measurement. Such
inconsistencies lead to performance degradation in the reconstruction of SR
images as well. This study reveals that using the L1 loss of SSIM and gradient
map edge quality loss could force the deep learning model to focus on studying
the features of edges and structure details of MR images, thus generating SR
images with more accurate, fruitful information and reduced motion-artifact. We
employed a state-of-the-art model, RCAN, as the network framework in both SR
and MAR tasks, trained the model by using low-resolution images and
motion-artifact affected images which were generated by emulating how they are
measured in the real MRI measurement to ensure the model can be easily applied
in the practical clinic environment, and verified the trained model could work
fairly well.

Monte Carlo simulations the correlation function along the chain and the force
in the tweezers are obtained as a function of temperature and density of

regimes: an initial very fast decay of order the monomer-monomer spacing and a
power law in the long distance regime. The power law exponent has a minimum at
a temperature $T_{min}$ for any non zero density of magnetic particles

that the radiation pressure acting on dusty clouds is strong enough to lead to
dynamical outflow from the AD surface, so the BLR has a dynamical character of
(mostly failed) outflow. The dynamics strongly depend on the Eddington ratio of
the source. Large Eddington ratio sources show a complex velocity field and
large vertical velocities with respect to the AD surface, while for lower

especially because it is possible to prepare large-scale qubit arrays. An
unsolved issue is how to selectively excite one qubit deep in a 3D atomic array
to Rydberg states. In this work, we show two methods for this purpose. The
first method relies on a well-known result: in a dipole transition between two
quantum states driven by two off-resonant fields of equal strength but opposite
detunings $\pm\Delta$, the transition is characterized by two counter-rotating
Rabi frequencies $\Omega e^{\pm i\Delta t}$~[or $\pm\Omega e^{\pm i\Delta t}$
if the two fields have a $\pi$-phase difference]. This pair of detuned fields
lead to a time-dependent Rabi frequency $2\Omega \cos(\Delta t)$~[or $2i\Omega
\sin(\Delta t)$], so that a full transition between the two levels is
recovered. We show that when the two detuned fields are sent in different
directions, one atom in a 3D optical lattice can be selectively addressed for
Rydberg excitation, and when its state is restored, the state of any nontarget
atoms irradiated in the light path is also restored. Moreover, we find that the
Rydberg excitation by this method can significantly suppress the fundamental
blockade error of a Rydberg gate, paving the way for a high-fidelity entangling
gate with commonly used quasi-rectangular pulse that is easily obtained by
pulse pickers. Along the way, we find a second method for single-site Rydberg
addressing in 3D, where a selected target atom can be excited to Rydberg state
while preserving the state of any nontarget atom due to a spin echo sequence.
The capability to selectively address a target atom in 3D atomic arrays for
Rydberg excitation makes it possible to design large-scale neutral-atom
information processor based on Rydberg blockade.

Neutral Rydberg atoms provide a versatile route toward flexible interactions
between single quanta. Previous efforts mainly focused on the excitation
annihilation~(EA) effect of the Rydberg blockade due to its robustness against
interaction fluctuation. We study another effect of the Rydberg blockade,
namely, the transition slow-down~(TSD). In TSD, a ground-Rydberg cycling in one
atom slows down a Rydberg-involved state transition of a nearby atom, which is
in contrast to EA that annihilates a presumed state transition. TSD can lead to
an accurate controlled-{\footnotesize NOT}~({\footnotesize CNOT}) gate with a
sub-$\mu$s duration about $2\pi/\Omega+\epsilon$ by two pulses, where
$\epsilon$ is a negligible transient time to implement a phase change in the
pulse and $\Omega$ is the Rydberg Rabi frequency. The speedy and accurate
TSD-based {\footnotesize CNOT} makes neutral atoms comparable~(superior) to
superconducting~(ion-trap) systems.

polarization effect is enhanced by the nuclear giant dipole resonance. The
electric quadrupole polarization effect is enhanced because the electrons in a

experiencing significant corrections to the conventional approximation in which

human society, deciphering the mechanisms behind has being a major goal for
centuries. A crucial fact is, however, largely missing in most prior studies
that games in the real world are typically played simultaneously and
interactively rather than separately as assumed. Here we introduce the idea of
interacting games that different games coevolve and influence each other's
decision-making. We show that as the game-game interaction becomes important,
the cooperation phase transition dramatically improves, a fairly high level of
cooperation is reached for all involved games when interaction goes to be
strong. A mean-field theory indicates that a new mechanism -- \emph{the
dynamical reciprocity}, as a counterpart to the well-known network reciprocity,
is at work to foster cooperation, which is confirmed by the detailed analysis.
This revealed reciprocity is robust against variations in the game type, the
population structure, and the updating rules etc, and more games generally
yield a higher level of cooperation. Our findings point out the great potential
towards high cooperation for many issues are interwoven with each other in the

lattices, we reveal that the game-game interaction can promote the cooperation
prevalence in all cases, and the cooperation-defection phase transitions even
become absent and fairly high cooperation is expected when the interaction goes
to be very strong. A mean-field theory is developed that points out new
dynamical routes arising therein. Detailed analysis shows indeed that there are
rich categories of interactions in either individual or bulk scenario:
invasion, neutral, and catalyzed types; their combination puts cooperators at a
persistent advantage position, which boosts the cooperation. The robustness of
the revealed reciprocity is strengthened by the studies of model variants,
including asymmetrical or time-varying interactions, games of different types,
games with time-scale separation, different updating rules etc. The structural
complexities of the underlying population, such as Newman--Watts small world
networks, Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random networks, and Barab\'asi--Albert networks,
also do not alter the working of the dynamical reciprocity. In particular, as
the number of games engaged increases, the cooperation level continuously
improves in general. Our work thus uncovers a new class of cooperation
mechanism and indicates the great potential for human cooperation where
concurrent issues are so often seen in the real world.

by replacing the variable diffusion coefficients with a constant coefficient to

as a right preconditioner and take the remaining part as a left preconditioner,
which constitutes our two-sided preconditioning. Exploiting the
diagonalizability of the constant-Laplacian matrix and the triangular Toeplitz
structure of the temporal discretization matrix, we obtain efficient
representations of inverses of the right and the left preconditioners, because
of which the iterative solution can be fast updated in a PinT manner.
Theoretically, the condition number of the two-sided preconditioned matrix is
proven to be uniformly bounded by a constant independent of the matrix size. To
the best of our knowledge, for the non-local evolutionary equation with
variable coefficients, this is the first attempt to develop a PinT
preconditioning technique that has fast and exact implementation and that the

sub-classes belonging to the same meta-class. Large inter-class similarity and
intra-class variance is the main challenge of this task. Most exiting methods
try to solve this problem by designing complex model structures to explore more
minute and discriminative regions. In this paper, we argue that mining
multi-regional multi-grained features is precisely the key to this task.
Specifically, we introduce a new loss function, termed top-down spatial
attention loss (TDSA-Loss), which contains a multi-stage channel constrained
module and a top-down spatial attention module. The multi-stage channel
constrained module aims to make the feature channels in different stages
category-aligned. Meanwhile, the top-down spatial attention module uses the
attention map generated by high-level aligned feature channels to make
middle-level aligned feature channels to focus on particular regions. Finally,
we can obtain multiple discriminative regions on high-level feature channels
and obtain multiple more minute regions within these discriminative regions on
middle-level feature channels. In summary, we obtain multi-regional
multi-grained features. Experimental results over four widely used fine-grained
image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. Ablative studies further show the superiority of two modules in the

flows and do not exhibit secular growth in energy errors are suitable for the
long-term integration of N-body Hamiltonian systems in the solar system.
However, the construction of explicit symplectic integrators is frequently
difficult in general relativity because all variables are inseparable.
Moreover, even if two analytically integrable splitting parts exist in a
relativistic Hamiltonian, all analytical solutions are not explicit functions
of proper time. Naturally, implicit symplectic integrators, such as the
midpoint rule, are applicable to this case. In general, these integrators are
numerically more expensive to solve than same-order explicit symplectic
algorithms. To address this issue, we split the Hamiltonian of Schwarzschild
spacetime geometry into four integrable parts with analytical solutions as
explicit functions of proper time. In this manner, second- and fourth-order
explicit symplectic integrators can be easily made available. The new
algorithms are also useful for modeling the chaotic motion of charged particles
around a black hole with an external magnetic field. They demonstrate excellent
long-term performance in maintaining bounded Hamiltonian errors and saving
computational cost when appropriate proper time steps are adopted.

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Niching is an important and widely used technique in evolutionary
multi-objective optimization. Its applications mainly focus on maintaining
diversity and avoiding early convergence to local optimum. Recently, a special
class of multi-objective optimization problems, namely, multi-modal
multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), started to receive increasing
attention. In MMOPs, a solution in the objective space may have multiple
inverse images in the decision space, which are termed as equivalent solutions.
Since equivalent solutions are overlapping (i.e., occupying the same position)
in the objective space, standard diversity estimators such as crowding distance
are likely to select one of them and discard the others, which may cause
diversity loss in the decision space. In this study, a general niching
mechanism is proposed to make standard diversity estimators more efficient when
handling MMOPs. In our experiments, we integrate our proposed niching diversity
estimation method into SPEA2 and NSGA-II and evaluate their performance on
several MMOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed niching mechanism
notably enhances the performance of SPEA2 and NSGA-II on various MMOPs.

response can lead to a large fluctuation in the estimated quantity of
adsorption isotherms. The conventional mathematical method of solving this

mechanics with classical terms such that some of the quantum mechanics
paradoxes can be avoided. Here we propose a new variational principle to
uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle,
information measures, such as relative entropy and Fisher information, are
imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This principle not
only recovers Nelson's theory and consequently, the Schr\""{o}dinger equation,
but also clears an unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple
Lagrangians can be used in the variational method and yield the same theory.
The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical
picture for stochastic mechanics. Each path configuration is considered as a
degree of freedom and has its own law of dynamics. Thus, the variation
principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic
theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory. The structure
of Lagrangian developed here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are
originated from information constraints. This suggests a Lagrangian may need to
include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete
description of the dynamics of a physical system.

neglected, (3) the radial component of the stellar magnetic field is neglected
as compared with the azimuthal component, (4) the stellar wind outflow is
spherically symmetric and supersonic. We present the results of numerical 3D
MHD modelling and explore how the global structure depends on the gas-dynamic
Mach number of the interstellar flow, $M_\infty$, and the Alfvenic Mach number
in the stellar wind. It is shown that the astropause has a tube-like shape for
small values of $M_\infty$. The wings of the tube are distorted toward the tail
as larger as larger the Mach number is. The new (to our knowledge) result is
the reverse interstellar flow in the vicinity of the astropause in the tail.
The larger the interstellar Mach number is the narrower the reverse flow is. At
some values of the Mach number the stellar wind overcomes the reverse
interstellar flow and moves out in downwind. In this regime the astropause
changes its topology from tube-like to sheet-like.

devices can collaboratively train a common model. However, a serious concern is
the leakage of privacy from exchanged gradient information between clients and
the parameter server (PS) in FL. To protect gradient information, clients can
adopt differential privacy (DP) to add additional noises and distort original
gradients before they are uploaded to the PS. Nevertheless, the model accuracy
will be significantly impaired by DP noises, making DP impracticable in real
systems. In this work, we propose a novel Noise Information Secretly Sharing
(NISS) algorithm to alleviate the disturbance of DP noises by sharing negated
noises among clients. We theoretically prove that: 1) If clients are
trustworthy, DP noises can be perfectly offset on the PS; 2) Clients can easily
distort negated DP noises to protect themselves in case that other clients are
not totally trustworthy, though the cost lowers model accuracy. NISS is
particularly applicable for FL across multiple IoT (Internet of Things)
systems, in which all IoT devices need to collaboratively train a model. To
verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the NISS algorithm, we conduct
experiments with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiment results verify
our analysis and demonstrate that NISS can improve model accuracy by 21% on
average and obtain better privacy protection if clients are trustworthy.

displaying wide dynamic range (WDR) images on low dynamic range (LDR) devices.
The proposed algorithm is mainly motivated by the logarithmic response and
local adaptation features of the human visual system (HVS). HVS perceives
luminance differently when under different adaptation levels, and therefore our
algorithm uses functions built upon different scales to tone map pixels to
different values. Functions of large scales are used to maintain image
brightness consistency and functions of small scales are used to preserve local
detail and contrast. An efficient method using local variance has been proposed
to fuse the values of different scales and to remove artifacts. The algorithm
utilizes integral images and integral histograms to reduce computation
complexity and processing time. Experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm can generate high brightness, good contrast, and appealing images

towards the direction of increasing Fn-measure to maximize it. We then propose
a hybrid attention block to extract feature, which integrates the Bayesian
attentive context normalization (BACN) and channel-wise attention (CA). BACN
can mine the prior information to better exploit global context and CA can
capture complex channel context to enhance the channel awareness of the
network. Finally, based on our Guided Loss and hybrid attention block, a
cascade network is designed to gradually optimize the result for more superior
performance. Experiments have shown that our network achieves the

depends on the ability of simpler classes to approximate the target.
Specifically, we show that a necessary condition for a function to be learnable

function, at least in a weak sense, with shallow neural networks. We also show
that a class of functions can be learned by an efficient statistical query

examples under white-box setting. Moreover, the malicious adversaries crafted
on the surrogate (source) model often exhibit black-box transferability on
other models with the same learning task but having different architectures.
Recently, various methods are proposed to boost the adversarial
transferability, among which the input transformation is one of the most
effective approaches. We investigate in this direction and observe that
existing transformations are all applied on a single image, which might limit
the adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a new input
transformation based attack method called Admix that considers the input image
and a set of images randomly sampled from other categories. Instead of directly
calculating the gradient on the original input, Admix calculates the gradient
on the input image admixed with a small portion of each add-in image while
using the original label of the input to craft more transferable adversaries.
Empirical evaluations on standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that Admix could
achieve significantly better transferability than existing input transformation
methods under both single model setting and ensemble-model setting. By
incorporating with existing input transformations, our method could further
improve the transferability and outperforms the state-of-the-art combination of
input transformations by a clear margin when attacking nine advanced defense
models under ensemble-model setting. Code is available at

characterized using three variables: the length of the region $L^{c}_K $ and
free fitting parameters $a^{c}_K $ and $b^{c}_K $. It was observed that the
values of the parameters as a function of energy grouped around certain lines
and there are jump-like changes. These observations together with the effect of
existing the several $p_T$ regions can say on discrete energy dependencies for
the $L^{c}_K $ , $a^{c}_K $ and $b^{c}_K $. The lengths of the regions increase
with the mass of the particles. This increase gets stronger with energy. The
mass dependencies of the parameters $a^{c}_K $ and $b^{c}_K $ show a regime
change at a mass $\simeq 500 MeV/c^2$. According to the phenomenology of string
theory, these results could be explained by two processes occurring
simultaneously: string hadronization and string breaking. In the experiment we
can only measure the spectrum of the hadronized particles, since we cannot
access the spectrum of the strings themselves. The string breaking effect could
be a signal of string formations and the reason behind the observation of

are brittle in nature and elastically anisotropic. The value of fracture
toughness, KIC for the B6S and B6Se are ~ 2.07 MPam0.5, evaluating the
resistance to limit the crack propagation inside the materials. Both B6S and
B6Se compounds possess high hardness values in the range 31-35 GPa, and have
the potential to be prominent members of the class of hard compounds. Strong
covalent bonding and sharp peak at low energy below the Fermi level confirmed
by partial density of states (PDOS) resulted in the high hardness. The profile
of band structure, as well as DOS, assesses the indirect semiconducting nature
of the titled compounds. The comparatively high value of Debye temperature
({\Theta}D), minimum thermal conductivity (Kmin), lattice thermal conductivity

show that our metric can robustly reflect and describe the imperceptibility of

demonstrate that this metric is highly flexible, which can be conveniently
integrated into different existing optimization frameworks to guide the noise
distribution for better imperceptibility. The metric is particularly useful in
the challenging black-box attack with limited queries, where the
imperceptibility is hard to achieve due to the non-trivial perturbation power.

alternative to the phenomenological linear-quadratic model for cell survival
under exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly for heavy charged particles.
The TET is based on a few simple model assumptions including the possibility to
derive some of the model parameters from nanodosimetry. This work intends to
carve out more clearly the basic assumptions behind the TET and to critically
review the resulting mathematical model equations. It is demonstrated that the
model assumptions of Poisson distribution and statistical independence of the
frequency distributions of so-called one-track and two-track events follow from
the Poisson distribution of the number of tracks affecting the considered
target volume. It is also shown that the modified TET model equation used in
the literature for consideration of repair is inconsistent with the model
assumptions and requires an additional model parameter. Furthermore, the
derivation of the model parameters from nanodosimetric properties of particle
track structure is revealed to lead to a pure exponential dose dependence when
the potentially large number of relevant nanometric target volumes inside a
cell nucleus is accounted for.

external forcing and internal couplings. Essential climate variables, such as
surface air temperature, describe this dynamics. Our current interglacial, the
Holocene (11,700 yr ago to today), has been characterized by small variations
in global mean temperature prior to anthropogenic warming. However, the
mechanisms and spatiotemporal patterns of fluctuations around this mean, called
temperature variability, are poorly understood despite their socio-economic
relevance. Here, we examine discrepancies between temperature variability from
model simulations and paleoclimate reconstructions by categorizing the scaling
behavior of local and global surface air temperature on the timescale of years
to centuries. To this end, we contrast power spectral densities (PSD) and their
power-law scaling using simulated and observation-based temperature series of
the last 6000 yr. We further introduce the spectral gain to disentangle the
externally forced and internally generated variability as a function of
timescale. It is based on our estimate of the joint PSD of radiative forcing,
which exhibits a scale break around the period of 7 yr. We find that local
temperature series from paleoclimate reconstructions show a different scaling
behavior than simulated ones, with a tendency towards stronger persistence
(i.e., correlation between successive values within a time series) on periods
of 10 to 200 yr. Conversely, the PSD and spectral gain of global mean
temperature are consistent across data sets. Our results point to the
limitation of climate models to fully represent local temperature statistics
over decades to centuries. By highlighting the key characteristics of
temperature variability, we pave a way to better constrain possible changes in
temperature variability with global warming and assess future climate risks.

to a programmable interactive environment of developing decentralized and
reliable applications addressing different use cases globally. In this
research, so as to facilitate trustworthy data provenance retrieval,
verification and management, as well as strengthening capability of product
anti-counterfeiting, key areas of decentralization and feasible mechanisms of

system requirements are set out for developing a blockchain-enabled autonomous

traceability, as a secure and immutable scientific data provenance tracking and
management platform in which provenance records, providing compelling
properties on data integrity of luxurious goods, are recorded and verified

the BAMSDN (Bandwidth Allocation Model through Software-Defined Networking)

object detection on point clouds. First, we propose a novel 3D detector,
PV-RCNN, which boosts the 3D detection performance by deeply integrating the
feature learning of both point-based set abstraction and voxel-based sparse
convolution through two novel steps, i.e., the voxel-to-keypoint scene encoding
and the keypoint-to-grid RoI feature abstraction. Second, we propose an
advanced framework, PV-RCNN++, for more efficient and accurate 3D object
detection. It consists of two major improvements: sectorized proposal-centric
sampling for efficiently producing more representative keypoints, and
VectorPool aggregation for better aggregating local point features with much
less resource consumption. With these two strategies, our PV-RCNN++ is about
$3\times$ faster than PV-RCNN, while also achieving better performance. The
experiments demonstrate that our proposed PV-RCNN++ framework achieves

robots, are becoming more pervasive in everyday life. Drawing on feminist
science and technology studies (STS) perspectives, we demonstrate how machine
designers are not just crafting neutral objects, but relationships between
machines and humans that are entangled in human social issues such as gender
and power dynamics. Thus, in order to create a more ethical and just future,
the dominant assumptions currently underpinning the design of these
human-machine relations must be challenged and reoriented toward relations of
justice and inclusivity. This paper contributes the ""social machine"" as a model
for technology designers who seek to recognize the importance, diversity and
complexity of the social in their work, and to engage with the agential power
of machines. In our model, the social machine is imagined as a potentially
equitable relationship partner that has agency and as an ""other"" that is
distinct from, yet related to, humans, objects, and animals. We critically
examine and contrast our model with tendencies in robotics that consider robots
as tools, human companions, animals or creatures, and/or slaves. In doing so,
we demonstrate ingrained dominant assumptions about human-machine relations and
reveal the challenges of radical thinking in the social machine design space.
Finally, we present two design challenges based on non-anthropomorphic
figuration and mutuality, and call for experimentation, unlearning dominant
tendencies, and reimagining of sociotechnical futures.

under uncertainty in areas that require transparency and explainability, by
relying on causal assumptions that enable us to simulate hypothetical
interventions. The graphical structure of such models can be estimated by
structure learning algorithms, domain knowledge, or a combination of both.
Various knowledge approaches have been proposed in the literature that enable
us to specify prior knowledge that constrains or guides these algorithms. This
paper introduces some novel, and also describes some existing, knowledge-based
approaches that enable us to combine structure learning with knowledge obtained
from heterogeneous sources. We investigate the impact of these approaches on
structure learning across different algorithms, case studies and settings that
we might encounter in practice. Each approach is assessed in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency, including graphical accuracy, model fitting,
complexity, and runtime; making this the first paper that provides a
comparative evaluation of a wide range of knowledge approaches for structure
learning. Because the value of knowledge depends on what data are available, we
illustrate the results both with limited and big data. While the overall
results show that knowledge becomes less important with big data due to higher
learning accuracy rendering knowledge less important, some of the knowledge
approaches are found to be more important with big data. Amongst the main
conclusions is the observation that reduced search space obtained from
knowledge does not always imply reduced computational complexity, perhaps
because the relationships implied by the data and knowledge are in tension.

  THz Region","This is a pre-print version of an article submitted to Optik
  (Elsevier)",,,,"physics.optics physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article proposes a novel three-port circulator with a triangular
graphene-based post for the THz region. This new circulator is formed by three
120 symmetrical metal-based waveguides with a multi-layer triangular
graphene-based post. The anisotropic feature for circulation is provided by
magnetically-biased graphene in the triangular post. The DC magnetic bias is
applied in the z-direction. The magnetized, triangular graphene sheet supports
hybrid TM-TE plasmons. To realize the proposed circulator, the structure has
been simulated in COMSOL software. In our simulation results, isolation of -40
dB with a transmission loss of -3.5 dB is obtained at the central frequency of
5 THz for a specific design. The bandwidth of the simulated circulator is
reported 7.25% with respect to the isolation level of -15 dB. It has been shown
that the scattering parameters of the proposed circulator can be changed by
altering the chemical potential of the graphene and DC magnetic bias, which
makes this circulator a tunable device to be utilized in various plasmonic
systems.

domain thanks to their high flexibility and scalability, fast and economical
deployment, pervasiveness in industrial, civil and domestic contexts. However,
the maintenance costs and the sensors reliability are strongly affected by the
battery lifetime, which may limit their use. In this paper we consider a
wireless smart camera, equipped with a low-energy radio receiver, and used to
visually detect a moving radio-emitting target. To preserve the camera lifetime
without sacrificing the detection capabilities, we design a probabilistic
energy-aware controller to switch on/off the camera. The radio signal strength
is used to predict the target detectability, via self-supervised Gaussian
Process Regression combined with Recursive Bayesian Estimation. The automatic
training process minimizes the human intervention, while the controller
guarantees high detection accuracy and low energy consumption, as numerical and
experimental results show.

  Score",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Injury Severity Score (ISS) is a standard aggregate indicator of the
overall severity of multiple injuries to the human body. This score is
calculated by summing the squares of the three highest values of the
Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) grades across six body regions of a trauma
victim. Despite its widespread usage over the past four decades, little is
known in the (mostly medical) literature on the subject about the axiomatic and
statistical properties of this quadratic aggregation score. To bridge this gap,
the present paper studies the ISS from the perspective of recent advances in
decision science. We demonstrate some statistical and axiomatic properties of
the ISS as a multicrtieria aggregation procedure. Our study highlights some
unintended, undesirable properties that stem from arbitrary choices in its
design and that call lead to bias in its use as a patient triage criterion.

arguably represent the defining challenges of our age, asking us to reckon with
the rise of computational technologies whose potential to radically
transforming social and individual orders and identity in unforeseen ways is
already being realised. Yet despite the multidisciplinary impact of this
algorithmic turn, there remains some way to go in motivating the
crossdisciplinary collaboration that is crucial to advancing feasible proposals
for the ethical design, implementation and regulation of algorithmic and
automated systems. In this work, we provide a framework to assist
cross-disciplinary collaboration by presenting a Four C's Framework covering
key computational considerations researchers across such diverse fields should
consider when approaching these questions: (i) computability, (ii) complexity,
(iii) consistency and (iv) controllability. In addition, we provide examples of
how insights from ethics, philosophy and population ethics are relevant to and
translatable within sciences concerned with the study and design of algorithms.
Our aim is to set out a framework which we believe is useful for fostering
cross-disciplinary understanding of pertinent issues in ethical algorithmic
literature which is relevant considering the feasibility of ethical algorithmic
governance, especially the impact of computational constraints upon algorithmic
governance.

  satellite data",,,,,"physics.geo-ph astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Amongst the available technologies for earthquake research, remote sensing
has been commonly used due to its unique features such as fast imaging and wide
image-acquisition range. Nevertheless, early studies on pre-earthquake and
remote-sensing anomalies are mostly oriented towards anomaly identification and
analysis of a single physical parameter. Many analyses are based on singular
events, which provide a lack of understanding of this complex natural
phenomenon because usually, the earthquake signals are hidden in the
environmental noise. The universality of such analysis still is not being
demonstrated on a worldwide scale. In this paper, we investigate physical and
dynamic changes of seismic data and thereby develop a novel machine learning
method, namely Inverse Boosting Pruning Trees (IBPT), to issue short-term
forecast based on the satellite data of 1,371 earthquakes of magnitude six or
above due to their impact on the environment. We have analyzed and compared our
proposed framework against several states of the art machine learning methods
using ten different infrared and hyperspectral measurements collected between
2006 and 2013. Our proposed method outperforms all the six selected baselines
and shows a strong capability in improving the likelihood of earthquake
forecasting across different earthquake databases.

essential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown
measure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on
our economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown
measures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and
epidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find
optimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during
the outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases
optimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the
overall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take
different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their
utility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through
various additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model
people's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage
between economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results
provides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on
when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period
of the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19
pandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the
outbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.

theory. However, how to handle uncertainties in the form of quantum is still an
open issue. In this paper, a new method is proposed to dispose uncertain
quantum information, which is called two-dimensional quantum mass function

  Detailed Theoretical Analysis",,,,,"physics.geo-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solar-thermal evaporation, a traditional steam generation method for solar
desalination, has received numerous attentions in recent years due to the
significant increase in efficiency by adopting interfacial evaporation. While
most of the previous studies focus on improving the evaporation efficiency by
materials innovation and system design, the underlying mechanisms of its energy
efficiency are less explored, leading to many confusions and misunderstandings.
Herein, we clarify these mechanisms with a detailed thermal analysis model.
Using this model, we elucidate the advantages of interfacial evaporation over
the traditional evaporation method. Furthermore, we clarify the role of tuning
the solar flux and surface area on the evaporation efficiency. Moreover, we
quantitatively prove that the influence of environmental conditions on
evaporation efficiency could not be eliminated by subtracting the dark
evaporation rate from evaporation rate under solar. We also find that
interfacial evaporation in a solar still does not have the high overall solar
desalination efficiency as expected, but further improvement is possible from
the system design part. Our analysis gains insights to the thermal processes
involved in interfacial solar evaporation and offers perspectives to the
further development of interfacial solar desalination technology.
