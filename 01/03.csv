  based on an electroencephalogram headset",,"Proceedings of ICERI2020 Conference",,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The COVID pandemic and the measures which were taken had effect over the
mental health of persons. The current paper proposes a concept that supports
the performance of students by analyzing three ways of distance learning,
namely text, text and illustrations, including charts, video. An
electroencephalogram headset allows the detection of brainwaves and the
developed web application enhances the process of distance learning. The
electrodes of the headset are placed at contact with the user head and monitor
the activity of the left and right frontal regions, along with the temporal
lobe. Mood, focus, stress, relaxation, engagement, excitement and interest are
triggered as numerical values by using the headset. The users provide
information about their daily activities, including learning and evaluation
processes. According to the study, users had the highest long term attention
while using text and illustrations, followed by watching videos. This is caused
by the fact that the text contained the code for the programs which were
presented in the video. Also, the users feel comfortable while using the
application and they started to pay more attention to the connection between
stress, health, education and well being. The results triggered by the headset
had higher values while students studied for the first time using videos. When
they wanted to remember the information, the text and illustrations way of
learning was the best option. Based on the study outcomes, the instructional
design can be enhanced. Moreover, the results improved as the students became
more equilibrated and confident in themselves. Teachers, professors and parents
are able to collaborate and enhance training. While studying online under
lockdown, students have found the proposed solution to be good because their
inner state influences their productivity while solving problems.

Here we explore the effectiveness of data learned approaches to mine and filter
information from streaming social media data from Hurricane Irma's landfall in
Florida, USA. We use 54,383 Twitter messages (out of 784K geolocated messages)
from 16,598 users from Sept. 10 - 12, 2017 to develop 4 independent models to
filter data for relevance: 1) a geospatial model based on forcing conditions at
the place and time of each tweet, 2) an image classification model for tweets
that include images, 3) a user model to predict the reliability of the tweeter,
and 4) a text model to determine if the text is related to Hurricane Irma. All
four models are independently tested, and can be combined to quickly filter and
visualize tweets based on user-defined thresholds for each submodel. We
envision that this type of filtering and visualization routine can be useful as
a base model for data capture from noisy sources such as Twitter. The data can
then be subsequently used by policy makers, environmental managers, emergency
managers, and domain scientists interested in finding tweets with specific
attributes to use during different stages of the disaster (e.g., preparedness,
response, and recovery), or for detailed research.

of 3D sensors that are able to rapidly measure the depth of scenes accurately.
Unfortunately, applying deep learning techniques to perform point cloud
analysis is non-trivial due to the inability of these methods to generalize to
unseen rotations. To address this limitation, one usually has to augment the
training data, which can lead to extra computation and require larger model
complexity. This paper proposes a new neural network called the Aligned Edge
Convolutional Neural Network (AECNN) that learns a feature representation of
point clouds relative to Local Reference Frames (LRFs) to ensure invariance to
rotation. In particular, features are learned locally and aligned with respect
to the LRF of an automatically computed reference point. The proposed approach
is evaluated on point cloud classification and part segmentation tasks. This
paper illustrates that the proposed technique outperforms a variety of state of
the art approaches (even those trained on augmented datasets) in terms of
robustness to rotation without requiring any additional data augmentation.

increasingly used in prevention and implementation studies. Marginal models
represent a flexible tool for analyzing SW-CRTs with population-averaged
interpretations, but the joint estimation of the mean and intraclass
correlation coefficients (ICCs) can be computationally intensive due to large
cluster-period sizes. Motivated by the need for marginal inference in SW-CRTs,
we propose a simple and efficient estimating equations approach to analyze
cluster-period means. We show that the quasi-score for the marginal mean
defined from individual-level observations can be reformulated as the
quasi-score for the same marginal mean defined from the cluster-period means.
An additional mapping of the individual-level ICCs into correlations for the
cluster-period means further provides a rigorous justification for the
cluster-period approach. The proposed approach addresses a long-recognized
computational burden associated with estimating equations defined based on
individual-level observations, and enables fast point and interval estimation
of the intervention effect and correlations. We further propose matrix-adjusted
estimating equations to improve the finite-sample inference for ICCs. By
providing a valid approach to estimate ICCs within the class of generalized
linear models for correlated binary outcomes, this article operationalizes key
recommendations from the CONSORT extension to SW-CRTs, including the reporting
of ICCs.

regarding the volume of salvageable hypoperfused tissue, which helps physicians
in the difficult decision-making process of treatment planning and
intervention. Treatment selection is influenced by clinical diagnosis, which
requires delineating the stroke lesion, as well as characterising cerebral
blood flow dynamics using neuroimaging acquisitions. Nonetheless, predicting
the final stroke lesion is an intricate task, due to the variability in lesion
size, shape, location and the underlying cerebral haemodynamic processes that
occur after the ischaemic stroke takes place. Moreover, since elapsed time
between stroke and treatment is related to the loss of brain tissue, assessing
and predicting the final stroke lesion needs to be performed in a short period
of time, which makes the task even more complex. Therefore, there is a need for
automatic methods that predict the final stroke lesion and support physicians
in the treatment decision process. We propose a fully automatic deep learning
method based on unsupervised and supervised learning to predict the final
stroke lesion after 90 days. Our aim is to predict the final stroke lesion
location and extent, taking into account the underlying cerebral blood flow
dynamics that can influence the prediction. To achieve this, we propose a

recommendation systems, etc, can be formulated as large state space
reinforcement learning problems with only a small budget of the number of
policy changes, i.e., low switching cost. This paper focuses on the linear
Markov Decision Process (MDP) recently studied in [Yang et al 2019, Jin et al
2020] where the linear function approximation is used for generalization on the
large state space. We present the first algorithm for linear MDP with a low
switching cost. Our algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{d^3H^4K}\right)$ regret bound with a near-optimal
$O\left(d H\log K\right)$ global switching cost where $d$ is the feature
dimension, $H$ is the planning horizon and $K$ is the number of episodes the
agent plays. Our regret bound matches the best existing polynomial algorithm by
[Jin et al 2020] and our switching cost is exponentially smaller than theirs.
When specialized to tabular MDP, our switching cost bound improves those in
[Bai et al 2019, Zhang et al 20020]. We complement our positive result with an
$\Omega\left(dH/\log d\right)$ global switching cost lower bound for any
no-regret algorithm.

on 19 out of 29 monitoring sessions, the intranight PSDs show an acceptable fit

structure in complex systems and graphons have been proposed as an infinite

identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. When such
building blocks may be present in graphons is an open question. In this paper,
we define a graphon-modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximised to
detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons
and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We
also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximisation as a continuous
optimisation problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack
thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an
intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with
exclusively maximising the modularity of the network. While the choice of
graphon-estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community
structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a
substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates
that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a
privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.

they generally suffer from strong acoustic radiation in liquid, which limits
their quality factor and increases their frequency noise. This article presents
an acoustic-radiation-free gravimetric biosensor based on a locally-resonant
surface phononic crystal (SPC) consisting of periodic high aspect ratio
electrodes to ad-dress the above issue. The acoustic wave generated in the SPC
is slower than the sound wave in water, hence preventing acoustic propagation
in the fluid and resulting in energy confinement near the electrode surface.
This energy confinement results in a significant quality factor improvement and
thus reduces the frequency noise. The proposed SPC resonator is numerically
studied by finite element analysis and experimentally implemented by an
electroplating based fabrication process. Experimental results show that the
SPC resonator exhibits an in-liquid quality factor 15 times higher than a
conventional Rayleigh wave resonator with a similar operating frequency. The
proposed radiation suppression method using SPC can also be applied in other
types of acoustic wave resonators. It can thus serve as a general technique for
boosting the in-liquid quality factor and the sensing performance of many
acoustic biosensors.

conditions in the formation of Fe I 6301.5 A and the 6302.5 A lines influences
the atmosphere obtained by inverting their profiles in LTE. The main cause of
NLTE effects is the line opacity deficit due to the excess ionization of the Fe
I atoms by the UV photons in the Sun. In the first paper, the above
photospheric lines were assumed to have formed in 1DNLTE and the effects of
horizontal radiation transfer (RT) were neglected. In the present paper, the
iron lines are computed in 3DNLTE. We investigate the influence of horizontal
RT on the inverted atmosphere and how it can enhance or reduce the errors due
to the neglect of 1DNLTE effects. The iron lines are computed in LTE, 1DNLTE
and 3DNLTE. They all are inverted using an LTE inversion code. The atmosphere
from the inversion of LTE profiles is taken as the reference model. The test
atmospheres from the inversion of 1DNLTE and 3DNLTE profiles are compared with
it. The differences between models are analysed and correspondingly attributed
to NLTE and 3D effects. The effects of horizontal RT are evident in regions
surrounded by strong horizontal gradients in temperature. In some regions, the
3D effects enhance the 1DNLTE effects while in some, they weaken. The errors
due to neglecting the 3D effects are less than 5% in temperature while the
errors are mostly less than 20% in both velocity and magnetic field strength.
These errors are found to survive spatial and spectral degradation. The neglect
of horizontal RT is found to introduce errors in the derived atmosphere. How
large the errors are depends on how strong the local horizontal gradients are
in temperature. Compared to the 1DNLTE effect, the 3D effects are more
localised to specific regions in the atmosphere and overall less dominant.

time integration schemes in terms of accuracy and stability, but high-order IRK
methods are not commonly used in practice with numerical PDEs due to the
difficulty of solving the stage equations. This paper introduces a theoretical
and algorithmic preconditioning framework for solving the systems of equations
that arise from IRK methods applied to linear numerical PDEs (without algebraic
constraints). This framework also naturally applies to discontinuous Galerkin
discretizations in time. Under quite general assumptions on the spatial
discretization that yield stable time integration, the preconditioned operator
is proven to have condition number bounded by a small, order-one constant,
independent of the spatial mesh and time-step size, and with only weak
dependence on number of stages/polynomial order; for example, the
preconditioned operator for 10th-order Gauss IRK has condition number less than
two, independent of the spatial discretization and time step. The new method
can be used with arbitrary existing preconditioners for backward Euler-type
time stepping schemes, and is amenable to the use of three-term recursion
Krylov methods when the underlying spatial discretization is symmetric. The new
method is demonstrated to be effective on various high-order finite-difference
and finite-element discretizations of linear parabolic and hyperbolic problems,
demonstrating fast, scalable solution of up to 10th order accuracy. The new
method consistently outperforms existing block preconditioning approaches, and
in several cases, the new method can achieve 4th-order accuracy using Gauss
integration with roughly half the number of preconditioner applications and
wallclock time as required using standard diagonally implicit RK methods.

to support massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC)
service. However, the dynamic resource configuration in GF-NOMA systems is
challenging due to random traffics and collisions, that are unknown at the base
station (BS). Meanwhile, joint consideration of the latency and reliability
requirements makes the resource configuration of GF-NOMA for mURLLC more
complex. To address this problem, we develop a general learning framework for
signature-based GF-NOMA in mURLLC service taking into account the multiple
access signature collision, the UE detection, as well as the data decoding
procedures for the K-repetition GF and the Proactive GF schemes. The goal of
our learning framework is to maximize the long-term average number of
successfully served users (UEs) under the latency constraint. We first perform
a real-time repetition value configuration based on a double deep Q-Network
(DDQN) and then propose a Cooperative Multi-Agent learning technique based on
the DQN (CMA-DQN) to optimize the configuration of both the repetition values
and the contention-transmission unit (CTU) numbers. Our results show that the
number of successfully served UEs under the same latency constraint in our
proposed learning framework is up to ten times for the K-repetition scheme, and
two times for the Proactive scheme, more than that with fixed repetition values
and CTU numbers. In addition, the superior performance of CMA-DQN over the
conventional load estimation-based approach (LE-URC) demonstrates its
capability in dynamically configuring in long term. Importantly, our general
learning framework can be used to optimize the resource configuration problems
in all the signature-based GF-NOMA schemes.

it the main subject of various fields in scientific and technical research. To
properly understand and control this new epidemic, mathematical modelling is
presented as a very effective tool that can illustrate the mechanisms of its
propagation. In this regard, the use of compartmental models is the most
prominent approach adopted in the literature to describe the dynamics of
COVID-19. Along the same line, we aim during this study to generalize and
ameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of
this epidemic. Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR epidemic system for
Coronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched by taking into account the media
intervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation matrix
method, the theoretical basic reproductive number $R_0$ is obtained for
COVID-19. Based on some nonstandard and generalized analytical techniques, the
local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium are proven when $R_0
< 1$. Moreover, in the case of $R_0 > 1$, the uniform persistence of COVID-19
model is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic model to reality,
the randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white
noises, which leads to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate
conditions, interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: extinction
and persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of
the perturbed COVID-19 model are determined by parameters that are closely
related to the magnitude of the stochastic noise. Finally, we present some

low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) phase is essential to explain the observed
$\nu$-distribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and to probe the stellar and
binary physics, including the possibility of continuous gravitational wave
emission. Here, using numerical computations we conclude that $\nu$ can evolve
in two distinctly different modes, as $\nu$ may approach a lower spin
equilibrium value ($\nu_{\rm eq,per}$) for persistent accretion for a long-term
average accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm av}$) greater than a critical limit
($\dot{M}_{\rm av,crit}$), and may approach a higher effective spin equilibrium
value ($\nu_{\rm eq,eff}$) for transient accretion for $\dot{M}_{\rm av} <
\dot{M}_{\rm av,crit}$. For example, when $\dot{M}_{\rm av}$ falls below
$\dot{M}_{\rm av,crit}$ for an initially persistent source, $\nu$ increases
considerably due to transient accretion, which is counterintuitive. We also
find that, contrary to what was suggested, a fast or sudden decrease of
$\dot{M}_{\rm av}$ to zero in the last part of the LMXB phase is not essential
for the genesis of spin-powered MSPs, and neutron stars could spin up in this
$\dot{M}_{\rm av}$-decreasing phase. Our findings imply that the traditional
way of $\nu$-evolution computation is inadequate in most cases, even for
initially persistent sources, and may not even correctly estimate whether $\nu$
increases or decreases.

important applications of Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron

challenging task of a sputter depth profile measurement is the determination of
the interface contaminations. Interface contaminations are only detectable if
the depth profile data were measured with a sufficient depth resolution.
Interface contaminations are crucial, because they strongly influence the
mechanical and electrical properties of the whole thin film system. The depth
resolution of unidirectional sputter depth profiling for polycrystalline
samples is limited by the sputter yield differences attributed to grains having
different crystalline orientations relative to the incoming ion beam. Therefore
depth resolution optimized sputter depth profiling of polycrystalline thin
films requires dedicated experimental approaches. If the sample is rotated
during ion sputtering the depth profile is recorded with a better depth
resolution because the ion impact direction relative to the grains orientation
varies. If depth profiling can be performed on a single grain only, the depth
resolution is improved, too. These approaches are applied to the depth
profiling and interface contamination analysis of a 5000 nm thick
polycrystalline Al layer. An O contamination at the interface of the Al to the

domain checking, machine learning algorithms have been used to address the

mitigate this weakness, we successfully applied a DGA-based malicious domain

data sharing restrictions. In this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA where
the source domain data is inaccessible during target adaptation. Our approach
is based on encoding the source domain information into an internal

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to

retina plays a pivotal role in determining degenerative retinal diseases, yet
it is a difficult problem. Due to successive resolution loss in the encoding
phase combined with the inability to recover this lost information in the
decoding phase, autoencoding based segmentation approaches are limited in their
ability to extract retinal microvascular structure. We propose RV-GAN, a new
multi-scale generative architecture for accurate retinal vessel segmentation to
alleviate this. The proposed architecture uses two generators and two
multi-scale autoencoding discriminators for better microvessel localization and
segmentation. In order to avoid the loss of fidelity suffered by traditional
GAN-based segmentation systems, we introduce a novel weighted feature matching
loss. This new loss incorporates and prioritizes features from the
discriminator's decoder over the encoder. Doing so combined with the fact that
the discriminator's decoder attempts to determine real or fake images at the
pixel level better preserves macro and microvascular structure. By combining
reconstruction and weighted feature matching loss, the proposed architecture
achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9887, 0.9914, and 0.9887 in
pixel-wise segmentation of retinal vasculature from three publicly available
datasets, namely DRIVE, CHASE-DB1, and STARE, respectively. Additionally,
RV-GAN outperforms other architectures in two additional relevant metrics, mean
intersection-over-union (Mean-IOU) and structural similarity measure (SSIM).

due to the massive scale and heterogeneity of the IoT system. For instance,
most IoT applications require timely delivery of collected information, which
is a key challenge for the IoT. In this paper, novel centralized and
distributed resource allocation schemes are proposed to enable IoT devices to
share limited communication resources and to transmit IoT messages in a timely
manner. In the considered system, the timeliness of information is captured
using non-linear age of information (AoI) metrics that can naturally quantify
the freshness of information. To model the inherent heterogeneity of the IoT
system, the non-linear aging functions are defined in terms of IoT device types
and message content. To minimize AoI, the proposed resource management schemes
allocate the limited communication resources considering AoI. In particular,
the proposed centralized scheme enables the base station to learn the device
types and to determine aging functions. Moreover, the proposed distributed
scheme enables the devices to share the limited communication resources based
on available information on other devices and their AoI. The convergence of the
proposed distributed scheme is proved, and the effectiveness in reducing the
AoI with partial information is analyzed. Simulation results show that the
proposed centralized scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous
AoI when compared to simple centralized allocation without learning, while the
proposed distributed scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous
AoI when compared to random allocation. The results also show that the proposed
centralized scheme outperforms the proposed distributed scheme in almost all
cases, but the distributed approach is more viable for a massive IoT.

due to the absence of ground-truth temporal locations of actions in the
training videos. With only video-level supervision during training, most
existing methods rely on a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework to
predict the start and end frame of each action category in a video. However,
the existing MIL-based approach has a major limitation of only capturing the
most discriminative frames of an action, ignoring the full extent of an
activity. Moreover, these methods cannot model background activity effectively,
which plays an important role in localizing foreground activities. In this
paper, we present a novel framework named HAM-Net with a hybrid attention
mechanism which includes temporal soft, semi-soft and hard attentions to
address these issues. Our temporal soft attention module, guided by an
auxiliary background class in the classification module, models the background
activity by introducing an ""action-ness"" score for each video snippet.
Moreover, our temporal semi-soft and hard attention modules, calculating two
attention scores for each video snippet, help to focus on the less
discriminative frames of an action to capture the full action boundary. Our
proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by at least 2.2%

encountered in a range of scientific and engineering problems. Moreover, these
sensors can be in motion and can become online or offline over time. The key
leverage in addressing this scientific issue is the wealth of data accumulated
from the sensors. As a solution to this problem, we propose a data-driven
spatial field recovery technique founded on a structured grid-based
deep-learning approach for arbitrary positioned sensors of any numbers. It
should be noted that the na\""ive use of machine learning becomes prohibitively
expensive for global field reconstruction and is furthermore not adaptable to
an arbitrary number of sensors. In the present work, we consider the use of
Voronoi tessellation to obtain a structured-grid representation from sensor
locations enabling the computationally tractable use of convolutional neural
networks. One of the central features of the present method is its
compatibility with deep-learning based super-resolution reconstruction
techniques for structured sensor data that are established for image
processing. The proposed reconstruction technique is demonstrated for unsteady
wake flow, geophysical data, and three-dimensional turbulence. The current
framework is able to handle an arbitrary number of moving sensors, and thereby
overcomes a major limitation with existing reconstruction methods. The
presented technique opens a new pathway towards the practical use of neural
networks for real-time global field estimation.

CANDECOMP/PARAFAC or canonical polyadic decomposition) are two popular
approaches of decomposing high dimensional data sets into low dimensional modes
that capture the most relevant features and/or dynamics. Despite their similar
goal, the two methods are largely used by different scientific communities and
formulated in distinct mathematical languages. We examine the two together and
show that, under a certain (reasonable) condition on the data, the theoretical
decomposition given by tensor component analysis is the \textit{same} as that
given by Koopman mode decomposition. This provides a ""bridge"" with which the
two communities should be able to more effectively communicate. When this
condition is not met, Koopman mode decomposition still provides a tensor
decomposition with an \textit{a priori} computable error, providing an
alternative to the non-convex optimization that tensor component analysis
requires. Our work provides new possibilities for algorithmic approaches to
Koopman mode decomposition and tensor component analysis, provides a new
perspective on the success of tensor component analysis, and builds upon a
growing body of work showing that dynamical systems, and Koopman operator
theory in particular, can be useful for problems that have historically made
use of optimization theory.

dynamics, and countermeasures against them. First, zero-dynamics attack is
re-introduced based on a canonical representation called normal form. Then it
is shown that the target dynamic system is at elevated risk if the associated
zero dynamics is unstable. From there on, several questions are raised in
series to ensure when the target system is immune to the attack of this kind.
The first question is: Is the target system secure from zero-dynamics attack if
it does not have any unstable zeros? An answer provided for this question is:
No, the target system may still be at risk due to another attack surface
emerging in the process of implementation. This is followed by a series of next
questions, and in the course of providing answers, variants of the classic
zero-dynamics attack are presented, from which the vulnerability of the target
system is explored in depth. At the end, countermeasures are proposed to render
the attack ineffective. Because it is known that the zero-dynamics in
continuous-time systems cannot be modified by feedback, the main idea of the
countermeasure is to relocate any unstable zero to a stable region in the stage
of digital implementation through modified digital samplers and holders.
Adversaries can still attack actuators, but due to the re-located zeros, they
are of little use in damaging the target system.

instance segmentation and tracking of cellular and subcellular objects. The
traditional method consists of two stages: (1) performing instance object
segmentation of each frame, and (2) associating objects frame-by-frame.
Recently, pixel-embedding-based deep learning approaches these two steps
simultaneously as a single stage holistic solution. In computer vision,
annotated training data with consistent segmentation and tracking is resource
intensive, the severity of which is multiplied in microscopy imaging due to (1)
dense objects (e.g., overlapping or touching), and (2) high dynamics (e.g.,
irregular motion and mitosis). Adversarial simulations have provided successful
solutions to alleviate the lack of such annotations in dynamics scenes in
computer vision, such as using simulated environments (e.g., computer games) to
train real-world self-driving systems. Methods: In this paper, we propose an
annotation-free synthetic instance segmentation and tracking (ASIST) method
with adversarial simulation and single-stage pixel-embedding based learning.
Contribution: The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) the proposed
method aggregates adversarial simulations and single-stage pixel-embedding
based deep learning; (2) the method is assessed with both the cellular (i.e.,
HeLa cells) and subcellular (i.e., microvilli) objects; and (3) to the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to explore annotation-free instance
segmentation and tracking study for microscope videos. Results: The ASIST
method achieved an important step forward, when compared with fully supervised
approaches: ASIST shows 7% to 11% higher segmentation, detection and tracking
performance on microvilli relative to fully supervised methods, and comparable
performance on Hela cell videos.

is, therefore, of both fundamental and applied interest. We demonstrate
emergent tuning of the active noise of a granular self-propelled particle by
confining it to a quasi one-dimensional channel. We find that this particle,
moving like an active Brownian particle (ABP) in two-dimensions, displays
run-and-tumble (RTP) characteristics in confinement. We show that the dynamics
of the relative orientation co-ordinate of the particle maps to that of a
Brownian particle in a periodic potential subject to a constant force, in
analogy to the dynamics of a molecular motor. This mapping captures the
essential statistical characteristics of the one-dimensional RTP motion.
Specifically, our theoretical analysis is in agreement with the empirical
distributions of the relative orientation co-ordinate and the run-times
(tumble-rates) of the particle. Finally, we explicitly control these emergent
run-and-tumble like noise parameters by external driving. Altogether, our work
illustrates geometry-induced tuning of the active dynamics of self-propelled

system with boundary conditions. Firstly, we extend the results in S. Peng
\cite{peng} from time-invariant case to time-dependent case, proving the
existence of a series of eigenvalues $\{\lambda_m\}$ and construct
corresponding eigenfunctions. Moreover, the order of growth for these
$\{\lambda_m\}$ are obtained: $\lambda_m\sim m^2$, as $m\rightarrow+\infty$. As
applications, we give an explicit estimation formula about the statistic period
of solutions of Forward-Backward SDEs. Besides, by a meticulous example we show
the subtle situation in time-dependent case that some eigenvalues appear when
the solution of the associated Riccati equation does not blow-up, which does
not happen in time-invariant case.

the question, can a similar class of matter be designed for background nematics
which are also active? Hence, we developed a minimal model for the mixture of
polar particles in active nematics. It is found that the active nematics in
such a mixture are highly sensitive to the presence of polar particles, and
show the formation of large scale higher order structures for a relatively low
polar particle density. Upon increasing the density of polar particles,
different phases of active nematics are found and it is observed that the
system shows two phase transitions. The first phase transition is a first order
transition from quasi-long ranged ordered active nematics to disordered active
nematics with larger scale structures. On further increasing density of polar
particles, the system transitions to a third phase, where polar particles form
large, mutually aligned clusters. These clusters sweep the whole system and
enforce local order in the nematics. The current study can be helpful for
detecting the presence of very low densities of polar swimmers in active
nematics and can be used to design and control different structures in active
nematics.

schools or the allocation of social housing, the one-sided matching problem
studies how a set of agents can be assigned to a set of objects when the agents
have preferences over the objects, but not vice versa. For fairness reasons,
most mechanisms use randomness, and therefore result in a probabilistic
assignment. We study the problem of decomposing these probabilistic assignments
into a weighted sum of ex-post (Pareto-)efficient matchings, while maximizing
the worst-case number of assigned agents. This decomposition preserves all the
assignments' desirable properties, most notably strategy-proofness. For a
specific class of probabilistic assignments, including the assignment by the
Probabilistic Serial mechanism, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for this
problem that obtains a decomposition in which all matchings assign at least the
expected number of assigned agents by the probabilistic assignment, rounded
down, thus achieving the theoretically best possible guarantee. For general
probabilistic assignments, the problem becomes NP-hard. For the Random Serial
Dictatorship mechanism, we show that the worst-case number of assigned agents
is at least half of the optimal, and that this bound is asymptotically tight.
Lastly, we propose a column generation framework for the introduced problem,
which we evaluate both on randomly generated data, and on real-world school
choice data from the Belgian cities Antwerp and Ghent.

have high performance on the datasets used for training but suffer from
significant performance degradation when deployed in new environments, where
there are usually style differences between the training images and the testing
images. An effective domain generalizable model is expected to be able to learn
feature representations that are both generalizable and discriminative. In this
paper, we design a novel Style Normalization and Restitution module (SNR) to
simultaneously ensure both high generalization and discrimination capability of
the networks. In the SNR module, particularly, we filter out the style
variations (e.g, illumination, color contrast) by performing Instance
Normalization (IN) to obtain style normalized features, where the discrepancy
among different samples and domains is reduced. However, such a process is
task-ignorant and inevitably removes some task-relevant discriminative
information, which could hurt the performance. To remedy this, we propose to
distill task-relevant discriminative features from the residual (i.e, the
difference between the original feature and the style normalized feature) and
add them back to the network to ensure high discrimination. Moreover, for
better disentanglement, we enforce a dual causality loss constraint in the
restitution step to encourage the better separation of task-relevant and
task-irrelevant features. We validate the effectiveness of our SNR on different
computer vision tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and
object detection. Experiments demonstrate that our SNR module is capable of
improving the performance of networks for domain generalization (DG) and
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on many tasks. Code are available at

simultaneous trajectory tracking and load alleviation. By exploiting the
control redundancy, the gust and maneuver loads are alleviated without
degrading the rigid-body command tracking performance. The proposed control
architecture contains four cascaded control loops: position control, flight
path control, attitude control, and optimal multi-objective wing control. Since
the position kinematics are not influenced by model uncertainties, the
nonlinear dynamic inversion control is applied. On the contrary, the flight
path dynamics are perturbed by both model uncertainties and atmospheric
disturbances; thus the incremental sliding mode control is adopted.
Lyapunov-based analyses show that this method can simultaneously reduce the
model dependency and the minimum possible gains of conventional sliding mode
control methods. Moreover, the attitude dynamics are in the strict-feedback
form; thus the incremental backstepping sliding mode control is applied.
Furthermore, a novel load reference generator is designed to distinguish the
necessary loads for performing maneuvers from the excessive loads. The load
references are realized by the inner-loop optimal wing controller, while the
excessive loads are naturalized by flaps without influencing the outer-loop
tracking performance. The merits of the proposed control architecture are
verified by trajectory tracking tasks and gust load alleviation tasks in
spatial von Karman turbulence fields.

the modulation and with side information at the transmitter. This model can
viewed as the quantum counterpart of the classical random-parameter Gaussian
channel. Based on Costa's writing-on-dirty-paper result (1983), the effect of
the channel parameter can be canceled even when the decoder has no side
information, and regardless of the input power constraint. For both homodyne
and heterodyne detection with a coherent-state protocol, the model reduces to a
classical channel with either real or complex-valued Gaussian noise. Thereby,
by applying Costa's dirty paper coding strategy, we observe that the effect of
the classical interference can be canceled for those channels as well. Then, we
consider the bosonic channel with joint detection, for which the classical
results do not apply, and derive a dirty-paper coding lower bound. Furthermore,
considering the special case of a pure-loss bosonic channel, we demonstrate
that the optimal coefficient for dirty paper coding is not necessarily the MMSE
estimator coefficient as in the classical setting.

order formalism working directly with the metric and the dilaton. We consider
the theory both in Anti-de Sitter(AdS) and de Sitter space(dS) and analyze the
path integral for the disk topology and the ""double trumpet"" topology with two
boundaries. We also consider its behavior in the presence of conformal matter.
In the dS case the path integral evaluates the wavefunction of the universe
which arises in the no-boundary proposal. In the asymptotic AdS or dS limit
without matter we get agreement with the first order formalism. More generally,
away from this limit, the path integral is more complicated due to the presence
of modes from the gravity-dilaton sector and also matter sector with short
wavelengths along the boundary that are smaller than the AdS or dS scales. In
the double trumpet case, for both AdS and dS, we find that bosonic matter gives
rise to a diverging contribution in the moduli space integral rendering the
path integral ill-defined. The divergence occurs when the size of the wormhole
neck vanishes and is related to the Casimir effect. For fermions this
divergence can be avoided by imposing suitable boundary conditions. In this
case, in dS space the resulting path integral gives a finite contribution for
two disconnected universes to be produced by quantum tunneling.

based on generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
Even though GANs have achieved remarkable results in synthetic data generation,
they are often challenging to interpret.Furthermore, GAN-based methods can
suffer when used with mixed real and categorical variables.Moreover, loss
function (discriminator loss) design itself is problem specific, i.e., the
generative model may not be useful for tasks it was not explicitly trained for.
In this paper, we propose to use a probabilistic model as a synthetic data
generator. Learning the probabilistic model for the data is equivalent to
estimating the density of the data. Based on the copula theory, we divide the
density estimation task into two parts, i.e., estimating univariate marginals
and estimating the multivariate copula density over the univariate marginals.
We use normalising flows to learn both the copula density and univariate
marginals. We benchmark our method on both simulated and real data-sets in

presenting theoretical explanations for these phenomenons by employing some

determined by some geometric measures of structure, e.g., the spherical
Gaussian width of a tangent cone and the Gaussian (squared) distance to a

we further investigate the relationship between these two kinds of recovery
procedures, which also reveals an optimal strategy (in the sense of Lagrange

modeled as a unitary interaction between the information carrying system and an
environment, where the latter is controlled by a passive helper, who can set
its initial state such as to assist sender and receiver, but not help actively
by adjusting her behaviour depending on the message. Here we investigate the
information transmission capabilities in this framework by considering Gaussian
unitaries acting on Bosonic systems.
  We consider both quantum communication and classical communication with
helper, as well as classical communication with free classical coordination
between sender and helper (conferencing encoders).
  Concerning quantum communication, we prove general coding theorems with and
without energy constraints, yielding multi-letter (regularized) expressions.
  In the search for cases where the capacity formula is computable, we look for
Gaussian unitaries that are universally degradable or anti-degradable. However,
we show that no Gaussian unitary yields either a degradable or anti-degradable
channel for all environment states. On the other hand, restricting to Gaussian
environment states, results in universally degradable unitaries, for which we
thus can give single-letter quantum capacity formulas.
  Concerning classical communication, we prove a general coding theorem for the
classical capacity under and energy constraint, given by a multi-letter
expression. Furthermore, we derive an uncertainty-type relation between the
classical capacities of the sender and the helper, helped respectively by the
other party, showing a lower bound on the sum of the two capacities. Then, this
is used to lower bound the classical information transmission rate in the

energy, the latter implying particle acceleration of charged particles such as
protons. Protons are injected out of the coronal acceleration region and can
interact with dense plasma in the lower solar atmosphere, producing mesons that
subsequently decay into gamma rays and neutrinos at O(MeV-GeV) energies. We
present the results of the first search for GeV neutrinos emitted during solar
flares carried out with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. While the experiment
was originally designed to detect neutrinos with energies between 10 GeV and a

jointly optimize the durations for CC tasks to maximize the completion rate of

definably simple, then it is itself cohesive. Finally, we show that an abelian
group definable in the disjoint union of finitely many o-minimal structures is
a quotient, by a discrete normal subgroup, of a direct product of locally
definable groups in the single structures.

reconstruction surface rendering algorithms. It forms cube voxels through the
input image, and then uses 15 basic topological configurations to extract the
iso-surfaces in the voxels. It processes each cube voxel in a traversal manner,
but it does not consider the relationship between iso-surfaces in adjacent
cubes. Due to ambiguity, the final reconstructed model may have holes. We
propose a Marching Cube algorithm based on edge growth. The algorithm first
extracts seed triangles, then grows the seed triangles and reconstructs the
entire 3D model. According to the position of the growth edge, we propose 17
topological configurations with iso-surfaces. From the reconstruction results,
the algorithm can reconstruct the 3D model well. When only the main contour of
the 3D model needs to be organized, the algorithm performs well. In addition,
when there are multiple scattered parts in the data, the algorithm can extract
only the 3D contours of the parts connected to the seed by setting the region
selected by the seed.

implications on cosmology, in particular on inflationary models. Some models of
inflation have been shown to be incompatible with these criterion while some
have been shown to be severely fine tuned, with most of these problems arising
in single field inflationary models in a General relativistic cosmology. Recent
works have although optimistically shown that single field models in more
general cosmologies can be consistent with these conjectures and hence there is
an optimism that not all such models lie in the swampland. However a paradigm
of inflation which has been shown to not be perfectly okay with the conjectures
is eternal inflation. So in this work, we discuss Tachyonic inflation in the
high energy RS-II Braneworld scenario in the context of the swampland
conjectures while also considering the possibility of swampland consistent
eternal inflation. We show that our concerned regime evades all the prominent
swampland issues for single field inflation being virtually unscathed. After
this, we show that the main conflicts of eternal inflation with the swampland
can easily be resolved in the considered tachyonic scenario and in particular,
we also discuss the exciting prospect of a Generalized Uncertainty Principle
facilitating the notion of Swampland consistent eternal inflation. Our work as

quantum gravitationally) consistent picture of a ""Multiverse"".

(SN) 2012aw taken at seven epochs during the photospheric phase, from 16 to
120d after explosion. We correct for the interstellar polarization by
postulating that the SN polarization is naught near the rest wavelength of the
strongest lines - this is later confirmed by our modeling. SN2012aw exhibits
intrinsic polarization, with strong variations across lines, and with a
magnitude that grows in the 7000A line-free region from 0.1% at 16d up to 1.2%
at 120d. This behavior is qualitatively similar to observations gathered for
other type II SNe. A suitable rotation of Stokes vectors places the bulk of the
polarization in q, suggesting the ejecta of SN2012aw is predominantly
axisymmetric. Using an upgraded version of our 2D polarized radiative transfer
code, we model the wavelength- and time-dependent polarization of SN2012aw. The
key observables may be explained by the presence of a confined region of
enhanced 56Ni at ~4000km/s, which boosts the electron density in a cone having
an opening angle of ~50deg and an observer's inclination of ~70deg to the axis
of symmetry. With this fixed asymmetry in time, the observed evolution of the
SN2012aw polarization arises from the evolution of the ejecta optical depth,
ionization, and the relative importance of multiple versus single scattering.
However, the polarization signatures exhibit numerous degeneracies.
Cancellation effects at early times imply that a low polarization may occur for
ejecta with a large asymmetry. An axisymmetric ejecta with a latitude-dependent
explosion energy can also yield similar polarization signatures as an
asymmetric 56Ni distribution. Despite these uncertainties, SN2012aw provides
additional evidence for the generic asymmetry of type II SN ejecta, of which
VLT-FORS spectropolarimetric observations are a decisive and exquisite probe.

scalar field (the khronon), which can be used as a preferred time coordinate
(thus selecting a preferred space-time foliation). Adopting the khronon as the
time coordinate, the theory is invariant only under time reparametrizations and
spatial diffeomorphisms. In the infrared limit, this theory is sometimes
referred to as khronometric theory. Here, we explicitly construct a
generalization of khronometric theory, which avoids the propagation of
Ostrogradski modes as a result of a suitable degeneracy condition (although
stability of the latter under radiative corrections remains an open question).
While this new theory does not have a general-relativistic limit and does not
yield a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-like cosmology on large scales, it still
passes, for suitable choices of its coupling constants, local tests on Earth
and in the solar system, as well as gravitational-wave tests. We also comment
on the possible usefulness of this theory as a toy model of quantum gravity, as
it could be completed in the ultraviolet into a 'degenerate Horava gravity'
theory that could be perturbatively renormalizable without imposing any
projectability condition.

in the body and increases its metabolic activity and thus oxygen consumption
with increasing cognitive demand. In this study, we explore the feasibility of
in-ear SpO2 cognitive workload tracking. To this end, we preform cognitive
workload assessment in 8 subjects, based on an N-back task, whereby the
subjects are asked to count and remember the number of odd numbers displayed on
a screen in 5 second windows. The 2 and 3-back tasks lead to either the lowest
median absolute SpO2 or largest median decrease in SpO2 in all of the subjects,
indicating a robust and measurable decrease in blood oxygen in response to
increased cognitive workload. Using features derived from in-ear pulse
oximetry, including SpO2, pulse rate and respiration rate, we were able to
classify the 4 N-back task categories, over 5 second epochs, with a mean
accuracy of 94.2%. Moreover, out of 21 total features, the 9 most important
features for classification accuracy were all SpO2 related features. The
findings suggest that in-ear SpO2 measurements provide valuable information for
classification of cognitive workload over short time windows, which together

  Deep Learning",,,,,"cs.SI cs.AI cs.LG physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to
partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent
functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly
applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community
detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety
of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network
methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly
more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed,
particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into
low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is
still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological
underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for
future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop
and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to
characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection.
Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community
detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing
methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep
learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two
categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection,
we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and
highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude
with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible
directions for future research.

laser amplitude noise and the large background detection offset which is
reported to be the main noise source of a single beam absorption SERF

the quality of their animals which are in their care. The most convenient and
good quality - price ratio should be chosen for the feed of animals. Blockchain
is used in a virtual space to store and share information over a network of
users. This is done using the open source Hyperledger Fabric platform. The
transactions can be viewed by all the other users in real time. These
transactions are stored as JSONs inside CouchDB NoSQL database which supports
queries on a large volume of data. When using this technology, the farmer can
know with whom the supplier for animal feed collaborated with. The history of
the transactions are not saved in just one place. In this way, it is more
difficult to hack and provide implausible information. An e-learning platform
was created where the farm's user can post information, respectively new blocks
about the animal's birth, vaccinations, medicines, including the location of
the livestock. The same e-learning platform is accessible from the mobile
phone. By using the blockchain technology, anyone, including the client from
the shop can know a lot about the origin of the products. Fake origins of food
are much more difficult to hide. Fraud is also limited. The system monitored
the traceability of dairy products inside a Romanian farm. Data about fodder
provider and quality, cow productive performances and health and dairy products
process were obtained and analyzed by students who will become specialists at
all the levels of the food chain. Blockchain is the technology which in case of
a dairy products contamination, the origin of the farm is traced in just a
couple of seconds. In this way just a batch of dairy products is removed from
distribution, leading to the reduction of food waste.

  Reinforcement Learning Framework","This manuscript will be submitted to IEEE Vehicular Technology
  Conference 2021 Spring",,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The huge research interest in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X)
communications in recent days is attributed to their ability to schedule
multiple access more efficiently as compared to its predecessor technology,
i.e., dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). However, one of the foremost
issues still remaining is the need for the V2X to operate stably in a highly
dynamic environment. This paper proposes a way to exploit the dynamicity. That
is, we propose a resource allocation mechanism adaptive to the environment,
which can be an efficient solution for air interface congestion that a V2X
network often suffers from. Specifically, the proposed mechanism aims at
granting a higher chance of transmission to a vehicle with a higher crash risk.
As such, the channel access is prioritized to those with urgent needs. The
proposed framework is established based on reinforcement learning (RL), which
is modeled as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB). Importantly, the framework
is designed to operate at a vehicle autonomously without any assistance from a
central entity, which, henceforth, is expected to make a particular fit to
distributed V2X network such as C-V2X mode 4.

Penicillium spp were more sensitive to the treatment and thus; were further
investigated using Dehydrogenase activity assay method. Total dehydrogenase
activities of Bacillus subtilis, Candidas spp, and Penicillium spp at the
extract concentration range of 0 to 2000mg/ml were progressively inhibited at
increasing extract concentrations. The threshold inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) of the extracts against Candidas spp, Penicillium spp and Bacillus

Our findings suggested the extract as a useful source of antimicrobial
phytochemicals for pharmaceutical use.
