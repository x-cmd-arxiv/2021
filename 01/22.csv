(RSG) candidates in NGC 6822, based on their 1.6 $\mu$m ""H-bump"". We collected
32 bands of photometric data for NGC 6822 ranging from optical to MIR. By using
the theoretical spectra from MARCS, we demonstrate that there is a prominent
difference around 1.6 $\mu$m (""H-bump"") between low-surface-gravity (LSG) and
high-surface-gravity (HSG) targets. Taking advantage of this feature, we
identify efficient color-color diagrams (CCDs) of rzH and rzK to separate HSG
and LSG targets from crossmatching of optical and NIR data. Moreover, synthetic
photometry from ATLAS9 also give similar results. Further separating RSG
candidates from the rest of the LSG candidates is done by using semi-empirical
criteria on NIR CMDs and resulted in 323 RSG candidates. Meanwhile, the
simulation of foreground stars from Besan\c{c}on models also indicates that our
selection criteria is largely free from the contamination of Galactic giants.
In addition to the ""H-bump"" method, we also use the traditional BVR method as a
comparison and/or supplement, by applying a slightly aggressive cut to select
as much as possible RSG candidates (358 targets). Furthermore, the Gaia
astrometric solution is used to constrain the sample, where 181 and 193 targets
were selected from the ""H-bump"" and BVR method, respectively. The percentages
of selected targets in both methods are similar as $\sim$60\%, indicating the
comparable accuracy of the two methods. In total, there are 234 RSG candidates
after combining targets from both methods with 140 ($\sim$60\%) of them in
common. The final RSG candidates are in the expected locations on the MIR CMDs,
while the spatial distribution is also coincident with the FUV-selected star
formation regions, suggesting the selection is reasonable and reliable.

thousands of years. Here we attempt to investigate space and time from the
information theoretic point of view to understand spatial and temporal
correlations under the relative assumption. Correlations, as a measure of
relationship between two quantities, do not distinguish space and time in
classical probability theory; quantum correlations in space are well-studied
but temporal correlations are not well understood. The thesis investigates
quantum correlations in space-time, by treating temporal correlations equally
in form as spatial correlations and unifying quantum correlations in space and
time. In particular, we follow the pseudo-density matrix formalism in which
quantum states in spacetime are properly defined by correlations from
measurements. We first review classical correlations, quantum correlations in
space and time, to motivate the pseudo-density matrix formalism in finite
dimensions. Next we generalise the pseudo-density matrix formulation to the
Gaussian case, general continuous variables via Wigner representations, and
general measurement processes like weak measurements. Then we compare the
pseudo-density matrix formalism with other spacetime formulations: indefinite
causal structures, consistent histories, generalised non-local games,
out-of-time-order correlation functions, and path integrals. We argue that in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics, different spacetime formulations are
closely related via quantum correlations, except path integrals. Finally, we
apply the pseudo-density matrix formulation to time crystals. By defining time
crystals as long-range order in time, we analyse continuous and discrete time
translation symmetry as well as discuss the existence of time crystals from an
algebraic point of view. Finally, we summarise our work and provide the outlook
for future directions.

cyclostationary biases in global solar irradiance measurements. Seasonal trends
are removed from the global solar irradiance time series, using the theoretical
global solar irradiance to obtain the clear sky index time series. We introduce
an atmospheric model to remove the effect of atmospheric scattering and the
effect of the Sun's direct irradiance from infrared images. Scattering is
produced by water spots and dust particles on the germanium lens of the camera

balance between exploiting--choosing the best action according to the current
knowledge, and exploring--obtaining information about values of other actions.
The multi-armed bandit problem, a classical task that captures this trade-off,
served as a vehicle in machine learning for developing bandit algorithms that
proved to be useful in numerous industrial applications. The active inference
framework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in
neuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by
its sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation
trade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already

approximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art
bandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson
sampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary
and a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active
inference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in
stationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem
active inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art
bandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in
theoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional
credibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and

be affected by a weak semantic representation of text, resulting in inaccurate
outcomes based on poor decisions. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel
approach called Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA), that disambiguates and
annotates each word by its specific sense, considering the semantic effects of
its context. Our approach brings three main contributions to the semantic
representation scenario: (i) an unsupervised technique that disambiguates and
annotates words by their senses, (ii) a multi-sense embeddings model that can
be extended to any traditional word embeddings algorithm, and (iii) a recurrent
methodology that allows our models to be re-used and their representations
refined. We test our approach on six different benchmarks for the word

Waals (vdW) bonding are often determined by the interplay between attractive
dispersion interactions and repulsive interactions caused by electron
confinement. Arising due to different mechanisms -- electron correlation for
dispersion and the Pauli exclusion principle for exchange-repulsion -- these
interactions do not appear to have a straightforward connection. In this paper,
we use a coarse-grained approach for evaluating the exchange energy for two
coupled quantum Drude oscillators and investigate the mutual compensation of
the attractive and repulsive forces at the equilibrium distance within the
multipole expansion of the Coulomb potential. This compensation yields a
compact formula relating the vdW radius of an atom to its multipole
polarizabilities, $R_{\rm vdW} = A_l^{\,}\, \alpha_l^{{2}/{7(l+1)}}$, where $l$
is the multipole rank and $A_l$ is a conversion factor. Such a relation is
compelling because it connects an electronic property of an isolated atom
(atomic polarizability) with an equilibrium distance in a dimer composed of two
closed-shell atoms. We assess the accuracy of the revealed formula for
noble-gas, alkaline-earth, and alkali atoms and show that the $A_l$ can be
assumed to be universal constants. Besides a seamless definition of vdW radii,
the proposed relation can also be used for the efficient determination of
atomic multipole polarizabilities solely based on the corresponding dipole
polarizability and the vdW radius. Finally, our work provides a basis for the
construction of efficient and minimally-empirical interatomic potentials by
combining multipolar interatomic exchange and dispersion forces on an equal

utilize the outputs of the reference system and the controlled system, rather
than their states, and differs from most existing tracking results that depend
on the state of the system. The optimal tracking problem is formulated into a
linear quadratic regulation problem by proposing a family of dynamic
discrete-time controllers. Then, it is shown that solving the output tracking
problem is equivalent to solving output regulation equations, whose solution,
however, requires the knowledge of the complete and accurate system dynamics.
To remove such a requirement, an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is
proposed using only the measured output data along the trajectories of the
system and the reference output. By introducing re-expression error and
analyzing the rank condition of the parameterization matrix, we ensure the
uniqueness of the proposed RL based optimal control via output feedback.

Kolmogorov scale is much smaller than the equilibrium correlation length $\xi$.
Although equilibrium critical fluctuations are destroyed by turbulence, $\xi$
still provides a crossover length scale between two types of energy cascade. At
scales much larger than $\xi$, the Richardson cascade becomes dominant, whereas
at scales much smaller than $\xi$, another type of cascade, which we call the
van der Waals cascade, is induced by density fluctuations. Experimental

The ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime in the THz range with split-ring
resonators coupled to magnetoplasmons has been widely investigated, achieving
successive world-records for the largest light-matter coupling ever achieved.
Ever shrinking resonators have allowed to approach the regime of few electrons
strong coupling, in which single-dipole properties can be modified by the
vacuum field. Here we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, the
existence of a limit to the possibility of arbitrarily increasing
electromagnetic confinement in polaritonic systems. Strongly sub-wavelength

leads to peculiar nonlocal polaritonic effects, as certain polaritonic features
disappear and the system enters in the regime of bound-to-continuum strong

lattices with a basis, with a focus on topological systems. The representations
differ in the relative phase of the Wannier functions corresponding to the
diffferent basis members. We show that the phase can be chosen in such a way
that the Wannier functions for the different sites in the basis both become
eigenstates of the position operator in a particular band. A key step in
showing this is the extension of the Brillouin zone. When the distance between
sites within a unit cell is a rational number, $p/q$, the Brillouin extends by
a factor of $q$. For irrational numbers, the Brillouin zone extends to
infinity. In the case of rational distance, $p/q$, the Berry phase ""lives"" on a
cyclic curve in the parameter space of the Hamiltonian, on the Brillouin zone
extended by a factor of $q$. For irrational distances the most stable way to
calculate the polarization is to approximate the distance as a rational
sequence, and use the formulas derived here for rational numbers. The use of
different bases are related to unitary transformations of the Hamiltonian, as
such, the phase diagrams of topological systems are not altered, but each phase
can acquire different topological characteristics when the basis is changed. In
the example we use, an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the use of the
diagonal basis leads to toroidal knots in the Hamiltonian space, whose winding
numbers give the polarization.

conditions of their excitation in a new type of electromagnetic metamaterials.
These metamaterials are all-dielectric planar periodic arrays of dielectric
disks disposed on a dielectric substrate. The elementary building blocks of the
array are trimers which are distributed in hexagonal unit supercells. The
highest geometrical symmetry of the unit supercell is C6v. The analysis is
fulfilled by using the representation theory of groups with the application of
the magnetic group theory, which is a new approach in solving such problems. We
have shown that to get access to the toroidal supermodes of the array, the unit
supercell symmetry must be broken twice: firstly, the C3v symmetry of the
trimer, and secondly, the C6v symmetry of the unit supercell needs to be
reduced. Selection rules for the symmetric and antisymmetric orders of the
toroidal dipole moments in the arrays are defined. In particular, we have shown
that with the reduction of the unit supercell symmetry to the C2v group, the
array exhibits the toroidal dipole resonance with an antitoroidic order. The
arrays with the lower Cs symmetry can provide the resonances with both toroidic
and antitoroidic orders. It is also shown that these arrays are always
polarization sensitive. Full-wave simulations and experiments confirm the
theoretical predictions. The suggested metamaterials can provide an enhanced
light-matter interaction due to the spatially and temporally confined light in
resonant systems with very high quality factors.

Building upon a model potential for the atom-ion interaction developed in
earlier theoretical works, we investigate the behaviour of the low-energy
eigenstates for varying contact interaction strength $g$ among the atoms. In
particular, we contrast the two cases of a static and a mobile ion. Our study
is carried out by means of the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent
Hartree method for Bosons, a numerically-exact $\textit{ab initio}$ method for
the efficient simulation of entangled mixtures. We find that repulsive atom
interactions induce locally-distinct modifications of the atomic probability
distribution unique to each eigenstate. Whilst the atoms on average separate
from each other with increasing $g$, they do not necessarily separate from the
ion. The mobility of the ion leads in general to greater separations among the
atoms as well as between the atoms and the ion. Notably, we observe an exchange
between the kinetic energy of the atoms and the atom-ion interaction energy for
all eigenstates, which is both interaction- and mobility-induced. For the
ground state, we provide an intuitive description by constructing an effective
Hamiltonian for each species, which aptly captures the response of the atoms to
the ion's mobility. Furthermore, the effective picture predicts enhanced
localisation of the ion, in agreement with our results from exact numerical
simulations.

undecidable for the whole language, and only very rudimentary decidable

automata use an infinite alphabet with a tree structure. We show that the game
semantics of any FICA term can be represented by traces of a leafy automaton.
Conversely, the traces of any leafy automaton can be represented by a FICA
term. Because of the close match with FICA, we view leafy automata as a
promising starting point for finding decidable subclasses of the language and,
more generally, to provide a new perspective on models of higher-order
concurrent computation. Moreover, we identify a fragment of FICA that is
amenable to verification by translation into a particular class of leafy

between levels is restricted and every other level is bounded, we show that
their emptiness problem is decidable by reduction to Petri net reachability.

  Network Slicing",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network slicing manages network resources as virtual resource blocks (RBs)
for the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN). Each communication request comes with
quality of experience (QoE) requirements such as throughput and
latency/deadline, which can be met by assigning RBs, communication power, and
processing power to the request. For a completed request, the achieved reward
is measured by the weight (priority) of this request. Then, the reward is
maximized over time by allocating resources, e.g., with reinforcement learning
(RL). In this paper, we introduce a novel flooding attack on 5G network
slicing, where an adversary generates fake network slicing requests to consume
the 5G RAN resources that would be otherwise available to real requests. The
adversary observes the spectrum and builds a surrogate model on the network
slicing algorithm through RL that decides on how to craft fake requests to
minimize the reward of real requests over time. We show that the portion of the
reward achieved by real requests may be much less than the reward that would be
achieved when there was no attack. We also show that this flooding attack is
more effective than other benchmark attacks such as random fake requests and
fake requests with the minimum resource requirement (lowest QoE requirement).
Fake requests may be detected due to their fixed weight. As an attack
enhancement, we present schemes to randomize weights of fake requests and show
that it is still possible to reduce the reward of real requests while
maintaining the balance on weight distributions.

  A Fisher analysis is conducted using $\sigma_8$ constraints derived from

find that the cluster abundances drive the constraints on the nDGP model while
$f(R)$ constraints are led by galaxy clustering. The two tracers of the
cosmological gravitational field are found to be complementary, and their
combination significantly improves constraints on the $f(R)$ in particular in
comparison to each individual tracer alone.
  For a fiducial model of $f(R)$ with $\text{log}_{10}(f_{R0})=-6$ and $n=1$ we
find combined constraints of $\sigma(\text{log}_{10}(f_{R0}))=0.48$ and
$\sigma(n)=2.3$, while for the nDGP model with $n_{\text{nDGP}}=1$ we find
$\sigma(n_{\text{nDGP}})=0.087$. Around a fiducial General Relativity (GR)

time-correlated (due to synaptic filtering) and state-dependent (due to
reversal potentials) input to demonstrate that inhibitory input acts to
decrease membrane potential fluctuations, a result that cannot be achieved with
simplified neural input models. To clarify the effects on spike-firing

models with dynamic firing thresholds and decreased firing regularity if
spike-firing adaptation was implemented through ionic currents or not at all.
This novel fluctuation-stabilization mechanism provides a new perspective on
the importance of strong inhibitory inputs observed in balanced states of

  Heterogeneous GNNs","This work has been accepted to The Web Conference 2021","In Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021. 3383-3395","10.1145/3442381.3449834",,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social events provide valuable insights into group social behaviors and
public concerns and therefore have many applications in fields such as product
recommendation and crisis management. The complexity and streaming nature of
social messages make it appealing to address social event detection in an
incremental learning setting, where acquiring, preserving, and extending
knowledge are major concerns. Most existing methods, including those based on
incremental clustering and community detection, learn limited amounts of
knowledge as they ignore the rich semantics and structural information
contained in social data. Moreover, they cannot memorize previously acquired
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-Preserving Incremental
Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (KPGNN) for incremental social event
detection. To acquire more knowledge, KPGNN models complex social messages into
unified social graphs to facilitate data utilization and explores the
expressive power of GNNs for knowledge extraction. To continuously adapt to the
incoming data, KPGNN adopts contrastive loss terms that cope with a changing
number of event classes. It also leverages the inductive learning ability of
GNNs to efficiently detect events and extends its knowledge from previously
unseen data. To deal with large social streams, KPGNN adopts a mini-batch
subgraph sampling strategy for scalable training, and periodically removes
obsolete data to maintain a dynamic embedding space. KPGNN requires no feature
engineering and has few hyperparameters to tune. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the superiority of KPGNN over various baselines.

of the ""sea"" of cosmic rays in distant parts of the Galaxy. By using data from
the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, we measure the gamma-ray

  We selected high-galactic latitude clouds that are in HAWC's field-of-view
and which are within 1~kpc distance from the Sun. We find no significant excess
emission in the cloud regions, nor when we perform a stacked log-likelihood
analysis of GMCs. Using a Bayesian approach, we calculate 95\% credible
intervals upper limits of the gamma-ray flux and estimate limits on the
cosmic-ray energy density of these regions. These are the first limits to
constrain gamma-ray emission in the multi-TeV energy range ($>$1 TeV) using
passive high-galactic latitude GMCs. Assuming that the main gamma-ray
production mechanism is due to proton-proton interaction, the upper limits are
consistent with a cosmic-ray flux and energy density similar to that measured
at Earth.

number forced (varicose) jet with coflow is studied using Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS), where we report the dynamics of these vortices for a range of
varying parameters. In a circular forced jet with Strouhal number 0.2,
continuous formation of these vortices is observed which undergo pairing,
tearing and disintegration. The forced jet is analyzed for varying frequency of
forced perturbations, coflow temperature, turbulence intensity, momentum
thickness, coflow intensity and Reynolds number at a constant forcing
amplitude. The observation reveals that any reduction in momentum thickness
increases the circulation as well as energy capacity of the leading and the
trailing vortices, thereby enhancing the vortex pairing time. However, the hot
coflow increases the strength of the leading vortex to such an extent that the
generated trailing vortex is weak and dissipates even before it undergoes
vortex pairing, while an incomplete disintegration of the leading vortex occurs
in this case. Moreover, the strength of leading and trailing vortices is found
to decrease with an increase in coflow power, thereby leading to a weaker
vortex pairing. The decrease in Reynolds number also reduces the intensity of
trailing vortices; whereas, at a lower Reynolds Number (Re) the trailing
vortices dissipate soon after they form. The findings are achieved based on the
analysis done by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD), fast Fourier transform (FFT), Q-criterion and vortex
tracking method to understand the dynamic interaction and behavior of the
vortices.

of discussion and find statistically significant indications that drops were
not authored by a single individual. Finally, we look at how posts on Reddit
are used to disseminate Q drops to wider audiences. We find that dissemination
was (initially) limited to a few sub-communities and that, while heavy-handed
moderation decisions have reduced the overall issue, the ""gospel"" of Q persists

cardiovascular mathematical model - made patient-specific by noninvasive data
routinely measured during ordinary clinical examinations - in order to obtain
sufficiently accurate central blood pressure (BP) estimates.
  Methods: A closed-loop multiscale (0D and 1D) model of the cardiovascular
system is made patient-specific by using as model inputs the individual mean
heart rate and left-ventricular contraction time, weight, height, age, sex and
mean/pulse brachial BPs. The resulting framework is used to determine central
systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse pressures, which are compared with the
beat-averaged invasive pressures of 12 patients aged 72$\pm$6.61 years.
  Results: Errors in central systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse pressures by
the model are 4.26$\pm$2.81 mmHg, 5.86$\pm$4.38 mmHg, 4.98$\pm$3.95 mmHg and
3.51$\pm$2.38 mmHg, respectively.
  Conclusion: The proposed modeling approach shows a good patient-specific
response and appears to be potentially useful in clinical practice. However,
this approach needs to be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients and could
possibly be improved through more accurate oscillometric BP measurement
methods.

  to low energy signals","14 pages, 6 figures",,,,"astro-ph.IM physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-phase xenon detectors, such as that at the core of the forthcoming LZ
dark matter experiment, use photomultiplier tubes to sense the primary (S1) and
secondary (S2) scintillation signals resulting from particle interactions in
their liquid xenon target. This paper describes a simulation study exploring
two techniques to lower the energy threshold of LZ to gain sensitivity to
low-mass dark matter and astrophysical neutrinos, which will be applicable to
other liquid xenon detectors. The energy threshold is determined by the number
of detected S1 photons; typically, these must be recorded in three or more
photomultiplier channels to avoid dark count coincidences that mimic real
signals. To lower this threshold: a) we take advantage of the double
photoelectron emission effect, whereby a single vacuum ultraviolet photon has a
$\sim20\%$ probability of ejecting two photoelectrons from a photomultiplier
tube photocathode; and b) we drop the requirement of an S1 signal altogether,
and use only the ionization signal, which can be detected more efficiently. For
both techniques we develop signal and background models for the nominal
exposure, and explore accompanying systematic effects, including the dependence
on the free electron lifetime in the liquid xenon. When incorporating double
photoelectron signals, we predict a factor of $\sim 4$ sensitivity improvement
to the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section at $2.5$ GeV/c$^2$, and a
factor of $\sim1.6$ increase in the solar $^8$B neutrino detection rate.
Dropping the S1 requirement may allow sensitivity gains of two orders of
magnitude in both cases. Finally, we apply these techniques to even lower
masses by taking into account the atomic Migdal effect; this could lower the
dark matter particle mass threshold to $80$ MeV/c$^2$.

is tailored to glioblastoma, a type of malignant tumor characterized by its
diffuse infiltration into the surrounding brain tissue, which poses significant
challenge to treatment target and tumor burden estimation using conventional
structural MRI. Although physiological MRI provides more specific information
regarding tumor infiltration, the relatively low resolution hinders a precise
full annotation. This has motivated us to develop a weakly supervised deep
learning solution that exploits the partial labelled tumor regions.
  EMReDL contains two components: a physiological prior prediction model and
EM-regularized segmentation model. The physiological prior prediction model
exploits the physiological MRI by training a classifier to generate a
physiological prior map. This map is passed to the segmentation model for
regularization using the EM algorithm. We evaluated the model on a glioblastoma
dataset with the pre-operative multiparametric and recurrence MRI available.
EMReDL showed to effectively segment the infiltrated tumor from the partially
labelled region of potential infiltration. The segmented core tumor and
infiltrated tumor demonstrated high consistency with the tumor burden labelled
by experts. The performance comparisons showed that EMReDL achieved higher
accuracy than published state-of-the-art models. On MR spectroscopy, the
segmented region displayed more aggressive features than other partial labelled
region. The proposed model can be generalized to other segmentation tasks that
rely on partial labels, with the CNN architecture flexible in the framework.

conclusion highlights include: i) showing Data Only results in the highest

all the explainers improve accuracy over the Data + ML Model Score variant but

2019avd on 2020-04-28 during its first all sky survey, when it was detected as
an ultra-soft X-ray source ($kT\sim 85$ eV) that was $\gtrsim 90$ times
brighter in the $0.2-2$ keV band than a previous 3$\sigma$ upper flux detection
limit (with no archival X-ray detection at this position). The ZTF optical
light curve in the $\sim 450$ days preceding the eROSITA detection is double
peaked, and the eROSITA detection coincides with the rise of the second peak.
Follow-up optical spectroscopy shows the emergence of a Bowen fluorescence
feature and high-ionisation coronal lines ([\ion{Fe}{X}] 6375 {\AA},
[\ion{Fe}{XIV}] 5303 {\AA}), along with persistent broad Balmer emission lines
(FWHM$\sim 1400$ km s$^{-1}$). Whilst the X-ray properties make AT 2019avd a
promising tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate, the optical properties are
atypical for optically selected TDEs. We discuss potential alternative origins
that could explain the observed properties of AT 2019avd, such as a stellar
binary TDE candidate, or a TDE involving a super massive black hole binary.

coaxial gaseous CH4 LOx at supercritical pressures. The choice of turbulence
model, real gas model, and chemical kinetics model are the critical parameters
in numerical simulations of cryogenic combustion at high pressure. At this
supercritical operating pressure, the ideal gas law does not remain valid for
such cases. Therefore, we have systematically carried out a comparative study
to analyze the importance of real gas models, turbulence parameters, and
chemical kinetics at such conditions. The comparison of real gas models with
the NIST database reveals better conformity of SRK (Soave Redlich Kwong
Equation of State (EoS)) model predictions with the database. Further, the
computed results indicate that the Standard k-e turbulence model with modified
constant captures the better flame shape and temperature peak position compared
to other RANS based turbulence models while invoking the non-premixed steady
b-PDF flamelet model for simulating the combustion process. Furthermore, a
comparative study comparing two different chemical kinetics models indicates
that the reduced Jones Lindstedt mechanism can accurately predict the flame
characteristics with the least computational cost. Finally, we have studied the
effect of chamber pressure and LOx inlet temperature on the flame
characteristics. The flame characteristics exhibit a strong sensitivity towards
the chamber pressure due to the weakening of the pseudo-boiling effect with an
increase in pressure. As a consequence of lower turbulent rates of energy and
mass transfer through the transcritical mixing layer, the flame spreading
becomes narrower at elevated pressure and temperature, thereby yielding an
increased flame length at transcritical conditions.

are in good agreement with data without exhibiting large differences among the

prediction of entrainment. The EDC combustion model predicts too early ignition
leading to a peak in the radial mean temperature profile at too low axial

written as a function not only of the physical fields, but also of Grassmann
fields representing a Jacobian arising from the noise distribution. SUSYs leave
the action invariant upon a transformation of the fields that mixes the

particularly parameterize the simple Lie algebras by the Vogel's table.
Subsequently a number of quantities, such as some universal knot invariants,

singular, provided one restricts them to the appropriate lines. We show, that
the same phenomenon takes place for another three distinguished points in

conversion to photons. Decay and scattering are the most commonly explored
channels in beam-dump type experiments, while conversion has typically been
utilized by light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments. A new class of
experiments, dubbed PASSAT (Particle Accelerator helioScopes for Slim

It has been shown that such hybrid beam-dump-helioscope experiments can probe
regions of parameter space that have not been investigated by other
laboratory-based experiments, hence providing complementary information; in
particular, they probe a fundamentally different region than decay or LSW
experiments. We propose the implementation of PASSAT in future neutrino

the magnetic field in the planned DUNE multi-purpose detector is already
capable of probing the ALP-photon coupling down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \sim {\rm

with up to $4\times 4^3$ and $4 \times 3^3$ spins, respectively. We demonstrate
that these techniques yield consistent results, allowing for reliable
extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. Our main results are (1) the
determination of the phase transition between the putative spin-liquid phase
and the neighboring magnetically ordered phase and (2) a careful
characterization of the ground state in terms of symmetry-breaking tendencies.
We find clear indications of spontaneously broken inversion and rotational
symmetry, calling the scenario of a featureless quantum spin-liquid into
question. Our work showcases how many-variable variational techniques can be

systems for magnetic cataclysmic variables leads to considerable challenges
when trying to understand how these systems form and evolve. Here we present a
sample of six magnetic white dwarfs in detached binaries with low-mass stellar
companions where we have constrained the stellar and binary parameters
including, for the first time, reliable mass estimates for these magnetic white

microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae.
Bimetric cosmology provides a good fit to data even for large values of the
mixing angle between the massless and massive gravitons. Interestingly, the
best-fit model is a self-accelerating solution where the accelerated expansion
is due to the dynamical massive spin-2 field, without a cosmological constant.
Due to the screening mechanism, the models are consistent with local tests of
gravity such as solar system tests and gravitational lensing by galaxies. We
also comment on the possibility of alleviating the Hubble tension with this
theory.

operations. It is known that quantum supermaps which respect a definite,
predefined causal order between their input operations correspond to
fixed-order quantum circuits. A systematic understanding of the physical
interpretation of more general types of quantum supermaps--in particular, those
incompatible with a definite causal structure--is however lacking. Here we
identify two new types of circuits that naturally generalise the fixed-order
case and that likewise correspond to distinct classes of quantum supermaps,
which we fully characterise. We first introduce ""quantum circuits with
classical control of causal order"", in which the order of operations is still
well-defined, but not necessarily fixed in advance: it can in particular be
established dynamically, in a classically-controlled manner, as the circuit is
being used. We then consider ""quantum circuits with quantum control of causal
order"", in which the order of operations is controlled coherently. The
supermaps described by these classes of circuits are physically realisable, and
the latter encompasses all known examples of physically realisable processes
with indefinite causal order, including the celebrated ""quantum switch"".
Interestingly, it also contains new examples arising from the combination of
dynamical and coherent control of causal order, and we detail explicitly one
such process. Nevertheless, we show that quantum circuits with quantum control
of causal order can only generate ""causal"" correlations, compatible with a
well-defined causal order. We furthermore extend our considerations to
probabilistic circuits that produce also classical outcomes, and we demonstrate
by an example how our characterisations allow us to identify new advantages for
quantum information processing tasks that could be demonstrated in practice.

astronomy. The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
polarisation can be used to constrain the reionisation history. Here we propose
a CMB-independent method using fast radio bursts (FRBs) to directly measure the
ionisation fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) as a function of
redshift. FRBs are new astronomical transients with millisecond timescales.
Their dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm IGM}$) is an indicator of the amount of
ionised material in the IGM. Since the differential of DM$_{\rm IGM}$ against
redshift is proportional to the ionisation fraction, our method allows us to
directly measure the reionisation history without any assumption on its
functional shape. As a proof of concept, we constructed mock non-repeating FRB
sources to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array, assuming three
different reionisation histories with the same optical depth of Thomson
scattering. We considered three cases of redshift measurements: (A)
spectroscopic redshift for all mock data, (B) spectroscopic redshift for 10% of
mock data, and (C) redshift estimated from an empirical relation of FRBs
between their time-integrated luminosity and rest-frame intrinsic duration. In
all cases, the reionisation histories are consistently reconstructed from the
mock FRB data using our method. Our results demonstrate the capability of
future FRBs in constraining the reionisation history.

theories that exhibit an unusual mechanism of topological protection against
Anderson localization. These describe surface-state quasiparticles of
time-reversal invariant, three-dimensional (3D) topological superconductors
(TSCs), subject to the effects of quenched disorder. Numerics reveal a
surprising connection between 3D TSCs in classes AIII, CI, and DIII, and 2D
quantum Hall effects in classes A, C, and D. Conventional arguments derived
from the non-linear $\sigma$-model picture imply that most TSC surface states
should Anderson localize for arbitrarily weak disorder (CI, AIII), or exhibit
weak antilocalizing behavior (DIII). The numerical studies reviewed here
instead indicate spectrum-wide surface quantum criticality, characterized by
robust eigenstate multifractality throughout the surface-state energy spectrum.
In other words, there is an ""energy stack"" of critical wave functions. For
class AIII, multifractal eigenstate and conductance analysis reveals identical
statistics for states throughout the stack, consistent with the class A integer
quantum-Hall plateau transition (QHPT). Class CI TSCs exhibit surface stacks of
class C spin QHPT states. Critical stacking of a third kind, possibly
associated to the class D thermal QHPT, is identified for nematic velocity
disorder of a single Majorana cone in class DIII. The Dirac theories studied
here can be represented as perturbed 2D Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten sigma
models; the numerical results link these to Pruisken models with the
topological angle $\vartheta = \pi$. Beyond applications to TSCs, all three
stacked Dirac theories (CI, AIII, DIII) naturally arise in the effective

search for periodic radial velocity variations. A signal with a periodicity of
0.676 days and a semi-amplitude of ~10 m/s is consistent with the rotation
period measured over much shorter time spans by previous spectroscopic and
spectropolarimetric studies, confirming the presence of surface features on
this A0 star. The timescale of evolution of these features can provide insight
into the mechanism that sustains the weak magnetic fields in normal A type
stars. Modeling the radial velocities with a Gaussian process using a
quasi-periodic kernel suggests that the characteristic spot evolution timescale
is ~180 days, though we cannot exclude the possibility that it is much longer.
Such long timescales may indicate the presence of failed fossil magnetic fields
on Vega. TESS data reveal Vega's photometric rotational modulation for the
first time, with a total amplitude of only 10 ppm, and a comparison of the
spectroscopic and photometric amplitudes suggest the surface features may be
dominated by bright plages rather than dark spots. For the shortest orbital
periods, transit and radial velocity injection recovery tests exclude the
presence of transiting planets larger than 2 Earth radii and most
non-transiting giant planets. At long periods, we combine our radial velocities
with direct imaging from the literature to produce detection limits for Vegan
planets and brown dwarfs out to distances of 15 au. Finally, we detect a
candidate radial velocity signal with a period of 2.43 days and a
semi-amplitude of 6 m/s. If caused by an orbiting companion, its minimum mass
would be ~20 Earth masses; because of Vega's pole-on orientation, this would
correspond to a Jovian planet if the orbit is aligned with the stellar spin. We
discuss the prospects for confirmation of this candidate planet.

the thick disc, and the low-$\alpha$ sequence, which mostly comprises
relatively young stars in the thin disc. We perform a Bayesian analysis based
on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain a multi-zone two-infall

inside-out formation of the Galaxy disc naturally emerges from the best fit of
our two-infall chemical-evolution model to APOGEE-DR16: inner Galactic regions
are assembled on shorter time-scales compared to the external ones. In the
outer disc (with radii $R>6$ kpc), the chemical dilution due to a late
accretion event of gas with primordial chemical composition is the main driver
of the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance pattern in the low-$\alpha$ sequence. In
the inner disc, in the framework of the two-infall model, we confirm the
presence of an enriched gas infall in the low-$\alpha$ phase as suggested by
chemo-dynamical models. Our Bayesian analysis of the recent APOGEE DR16 data
suggests a significant delay time, ranging from $\sim$3.0 to 4.7 Gyr, between
the first and second gas infall events for all the analyzed Galactocentric
regions. Our results propose a clear interpretation of the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
relations along the Galactic discs. The signatures of a delayed gas-rich merger

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is a promising paradigm for automating
these choices. Current ML software libraries, however, are quite limited in
handling the dynamic interactions among the components of AutoML. For example,
efficientNAS algorithms, such as ENAS and DARTS, typically require an
implementation coupling between the search space and search algorithm, the two
key components in AutoML. Furthermore, implementing a complex search flow, such
as searching architectures within a loop of searching hardware configurations,
is difficult. To summarize, changing the search space, search algorithm, or
search flow in current ML libraries usually requires a significant change in
the program logic. In this paper, we introduce a new way of programming AutoML
based on symbolic programming. Under this paradigm, ML programs are mutable,
thus can be manipulated easily by another program. As a result, AutoML can be
reformulated as an automated process of symbolic manipulation. With this
formulation, we decouple the triangle of the search algorithm, the search space
and the child program. This decoupling makes it easy to change the search space
and search algorithm (without and with weight sharing), as well as to add
search capabilities to existing code and implement complex search flows. We
then introduce PyGlove, a new Python library that implements this paradigm.
Through case studies on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-101, we show that with PyGlove
users can easily convert a static program into a search space, quickly iterate
on the search spaces and search algorithms, and craft complex search flows to
achieve better results.

for our understanding of the energy budget and chemical evolution of galaxies.
By using the New IRAM KIDs Array 2 (NIKA2) camera on the Institut de Radio
Astronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope, we have conducted
high-sensitivity and large-scale mapping of a fraction of the Galactic plane in
order to search for signatures of the transition between the high- and low-mass
star-forming modes. Here, we present the first results from the Galactic Star
Formation with NIKA2 (GASTON) project, a Large Programme at the IRAM 30-m
telescope which is mapping $\approx$2 deg$^2$ of the inner Galactic plane (GP),
centred on $\ell$=23.9$^\circ$, $b$=0.05$^\circ$, as well as targets in Taurus
and Ophiuchus in 1.15 and 2.00 mm continuum wavebands. In this paper we present
the first of the GASTON GP data taken, and present initial science results. We
conduct an extraction of structures from the 1.15 mm maps using a dendrogram
analysis and, by comparison to the compact source catalogues from Herschel
survey data, we identify a population of 321 previously-undetected clumps.
Approximately 80 per cent of these new clumps are 70 $\mu$m-quiet, and may be
considered as starless candidates. We find that this new population of clumps
are less massive and cooler, on average, than clumps that have already been
identified. Further, by classifying the full sample of clumps based upon their
infrared-bright fraction - an indicator of evolutionary stage - we find
evidence for clump mass growth, supporting models of clump-fed high-mass star
formation.

predict the properties of both materials and molecules as well as to explore
and visualize the chemical compound and configuration space. Recently, it has
become clear that many of the most effective representations share a
fundamental formal connection: that they can all be expressed as a
discretization of N-body correlation functions of the local atom density,
suggesting the opportunity of standardizing and, more importantly, optimizing
the calculation of such representations. We present an implementation, named
librascal, whose modular design lends itself both to developing refinements to
the density-based formalism and to rapid prototyping for new developments of
rotationally equivariant atomistic representations. As an example, we discuss
SOAP features, perhaps the most widely used member of this family of
representations, to show how the expansion of the local density can be
optimized for any choice of radial basis set. We discuss the representation in
the context of a kernel ridge regression model, commonly used with SOAP
features, and analyze how the computational effort scales for each of the
individual steps of the calculation. By applying data reduction techniques in
feature space, we show how to further reduce the total computational cost by at
up to a factor of 4 or 5 without affecting the model's symmetry properties and
without significantly impacting its accuracy.

distributions in the context of radiotherapy treatments. Their
water-equivalence, real-time response and high spatial resolution distinguish
them from traditional detectors, especially in complex irradiation geometries.
Their range of applications could be further extended by embedding
scintillators in a deformable matrix mimicking anatomical changes. In this
work, we characterized signal variations arising from the translation and
rotation of scintillating fibers with respect to a camera. Corrections are
proposed using stereo vision techniques and two sCMOS complementing a CCD
camera. The study was extended to the case of a prototype real-time deformable
dosimeter comprising an array of 19 scintillating. The signal to angle
relationship follows a gaussian distribution (FWHM = 52{\deg}) whereas the
intensity variation from radial displacement follows the inverse square law.
Tracking the position and angle of the fibers enabled the correction of these
spatial dependencies. The detecting system provides an accuracy and precision
of respectively 0.008 cm and 0.03 cm on the position detection. This resulted
in an uncertainty of 2{\deg} on the angle measurement. Displacing the dosimeter
by $\pm$3 cm in depth resulted in relative intensities of 100$\pm$10% (mean
$\pm$ standard deviation) to the reference position. Applying corrections
reduced the variations thus resulting in relative intensities of 100$\pm$1%.
Similarly, for lateral displacements of $\pm$3 cm, intensities went from
98$\pm$3% to 100$\pm$1% after the correction. Therefore, accurate correction of
the signal collected by a camera imaging the output of scintillating elements
in a 3D volume is possible. This work paves the way to the development of
real-time scintillator-based deformable dosimeters.

  Agreement, and Precision",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background. Developers use Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) to control
for potential quality issues in source code, including defects and technical
debt. Tool vendors have devised quite a number of tools, which makes it harder
for practitioners to select the most suitable one for their needs. To better
support developers, researchers have been conducting several studies on ASATs
to favor the understanding of their actual capabilities.
  Aims. Despite the work done so far, there is still a lack of knowledge
regarding (1) which source quality problems can actually be detected by static
analysis tool warnings, (2) what is their agreement, and (3) what is the
precision of their recommendations. We aim at bridging this gap by proposing a
large-scale comparison of six popular static analysis tools for Java projects:
Better Code Hub, CheckStyle, Coverity Scan, Findbugs, PMD, and SonarQube.
  Method. We analyze 47 Java projects and derive a taxonomy of warnings raised
by 6 state-of-the-practice ASATs. To assess their agreement, we compared them
by manually analyzing - at line-level - whether they identify the same issues.
Finally, we manually evaluate the precision of the tools.
  Results. The key results report a comprehensive taxonomy of ASATs warnings,
show little to no agreement among the tools and a low degree of precision.
  Conclusions. We provide a taxonomy that can be useful to researchers,
practitioners, and tool vendors to map the current capabilities of the tools.
Furthermore, our study provides the first overview on the agreement among
different tools as well as an extensive analysis of their precision.

dose distributions from one image set to another. However, the lack of
validation tools slows their clinical adoption, despite their commercial
availability. This work presents a novel water-equivalent deformable dosimeter
that simultaneously measures the dose distribution and tracks deformation
vector fields (DVF). The dosimeter in made of an array of 19 scintillating
fiber detectors embedded in a cylindrical elastomer matrix. It is imaged by two
pairs of stereoscopic cameras tracking the position and angulation of the
scintillators, while measuring the dose. The resulting system provides a
precision of 0.3 mm on DVF measurements. The dosimeter was irradiated with
5$\times$3, 4$\times$3 and 3$\times$3 cm$^2$ 6 MV photon beams in both fixed
and deformed conditions. The measured DVF was compared to the one computed with
a DIR algorithm (Plastimatch). The deviations between the computed and measured
DVFs was below 1.5 mm. As for dose measurements, the dosimeter acquired the
dose distribution in fixed and deformed conditions within 1\% of the treatment
planning system calculation and complementary dose validation using the
Hyperscint dosimetry system. Using the demonstrated qualities of scintillating
detectors, we developed a real-time, water-equivalent deformable dosimeter.
Given it's sensor tracking position precision and dose measurements accuracy,
the developed detector is a promising tools for the validation of DIR

shared model without disclosing their local datasets. This is achieved by
exchanging local model updates with the help of a parameter server (PS).
However, due to the increasing size of the trained models, the communication
load due to the iterative exchanges between the clients and the PS often
becomes a bottleneck in the performance. Sparse communication is often employed
to reduce the communication load, where only a small subset of the model
updates are communicated from the clients to the PS. In this paper, we
introduce a novel time-correlated sparsification (TCS) scheme, which builds
upon the notion that sparse communication framework can be considered as
identifying the most significant elements of the underlying model. Hence, TCS
seeks a certain correlation between the sparse representations used at
consecutive iterations in FL, so that the overhead due to encoding and
transmission of the sparse representation can be significantly reduced without
compromising the test accuracy. Through extensive simulations on the CIFAR-10
dataset, we show that TCS can achieve centralized training accuracy with 100
times sparsification, and up to 2000 times reduction in the communication load

an interesting feature that is not seen for any kind of black hole in Einstein

accretion flows, their possible relationship to black hole spin, and how they
interact with the surrounding medium. There have also been theoretical concerns
about instabilities in standard accretion disk models and lingering
discrepancies with observational constraints. Despite seemingly successful
applications to X-ray binaries, the standard accretion disk model faces a
growing list of observational constraints that challenge its application to
AGNs. Theoretical exploration of these questions has become increasingly
reliant on numerical simulations owing to the dynamic nature of these flows and
the complex interplay between hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, radiation
transfer, and curved spacetime. We conclude the following: The advent of
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations has greatly
improved our understanding of jet production and its dependence on black hole
spin. Simulation results show both disks and jets are sensitive to the magnetic
flux threading the accretion flow as well as possible misalignment between the
angular momentum of the accretion flow and the black hole spin. Radiation MHD
simulations are providing new insights into the stability of luminous accretion

because the evaluation of entanglement measures typically requires the full
reconstruction of the quantum state, which is extremely costly in terms of
measurement statistics. We derive an improved entanglement bound for bipartite
systems, which requires measuring joint probability distributions in only two
different measurement settings per subsystem, and demonstrate its power by
applying it to currently operational experimental setups for quantum simulation
with cold atoms. Examining the tightness of the derived entanglement bound, we
find that the set of pure states for which our relation is tight is strongly
restricted. We show that for measurements in mutually unbiased bases the only
pure states that saturate the bound are maximally entangled states on a
subspace of the bipartite Hilbert space (this includes product states). We
further show that our relation can also be employed for entanglement detection
using generalized measurements, i.e., when not all measurement outcomes can be

increased attention in high-resolution and high-speed applications. A lot of
work has been conducted to enhance recognition accuracy. However, the essential
topic of recognition delay or time efficiency is largely under-explored. In
this paper, we present a spiking learning system that uses the spiking neural
network (SNN) with a novel temporal coding for accurate and fast object
recognition. The proposed temporal coding scheme maps each event's arrival time
and data into SNN spike time so that asynchronously-arrived events are
processed immediately without delay. The scheme is integrated nicely with the
SNN's asynchronous processing capability to enhance time efficiency. A key
advantage over existing systems is that the event accumulation time for each
recognition task is determined automatically by the system rather than pre-set
by the user. The system can finish recognition early without waiting for all
the input events. Extensive experiments were conducted over a list of 7 LiDAR
and DVS datasets. The results demonstrated that the proposed system had
state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while achieving remarkable time
efficiency. Recognition delay was shown to reduce by 56.3% to 91.7% in various
experiment settings over the popular KITTI dataset.

Thereafter, a low-energy effective Hamiltonian is obtained by projecting the
high energy bands at the Gamma point into the subspace defined by the Kekule
wave vector. The spectrum of the low energy Hamiltonian is in excellent
agreement with the one obtained from a numerical diagonalization of the full
tight-binding Hamiltonian. The main effect of the second-neighbour interaction
is that a set of bands gains an effective mass and a shift in energy, thus
lifting the degeneracy of the conduction bands at the Dirac point. This band
structure is akin to a spin-one Dirac cone, a result expected for honeycomb
lattices with a distinction between one third of the atoms in one sublattice.
Finally, we present a study of Kekule patterned graphene nanoribbons. This
shows that the previous effects are enhanced as the width decreases. Moreover,
edge states become dispersive, as expected due to second neighbors interaction,

we evaluate the capabilities of our model, the Relational Graph Variational
Auto-Encoder (RGVAE). The impact of the modular hyperparameter choices,
encoding through graph convolutions, graph matching and latent space prior, is
compared. The RGVAE is first evaluated on link prediction. The mean reciprocal
rank (MRR) scores on the two datasets FB15K-237 and WN18RR are compared to the
embedding-based model DistMult. A variational DistMult and a RGVAE without
latent space prior constraint are implemented as control models. The results
show that between different settings, the RGVAE with relaxed latent space,
scores highest on both datasets, yet does not outperform the DistMult. Further,
we investigate the latent space in a twofold experiment: first, linear
interpolation between the latent representation of two triples, then the
exploration of each latent dimension in a $95\%$ confidence interval. Both
interpolations show that the RGVAE learns to reconstruct the adjacency matrix
but fails to disentangle. For the last experiment we introduce a new validation
method for the FB15K-237 data set. The relation type-constrains of generated
triples are filtered and matched with entity types. The observed rate of valid
generated triples is insignificantly higher than the random threshold. All
generated and valid triples are unseen. A comparison between different latent
space priors, using the $\delta$-VAE method, reveals a decoder collapse.
Finally we analyze the limiting factors of our approach compared to molecule

continuous approximations for interconnections of infinitely many discrete-time
switched systems. An approximation (also known as abstraction) is itself a
continuous-space system, which can be used as a replacement of the original
(also known as concrete) system in a controller design process. Having designed
a controller for the abstract system, it is refined to a more detailed one for
the concrete system. We use the notion of so-called simulation functions to
quantify the mismatch between the original system and its approximation. In
particular, each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one in
the abstract network are related through a notion of local simulation
functions. We show that if the local simulation functions satisfy certain
small-gain type conditions developed for a network containing infinitely many
subsystems, then the aggregation of the individual simulation functions
provides an overall simulation function quantifying the error between the
overall abstraction network and the concrete one. In addition, we show that our
methodology results in a scale-free compositional approach for any
finite-but-arbitrarily large networks obtained from truncation of an infinite
network. We provide a systematic approach to construct local abstractions and
simulation functions for networks of linear switched systems. The required
conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities that can be
efficiently computed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through
an application to AC islanded microgirds.

it is not hard to construct two-boundary Euclidean wormholes that dominate over

Maldacena and Maoz, the wormholes in these UV-complete settings always suffer
from brane-nucleation instabilities (even when sources that one might hope

dynamical disorder that can be detrimental to charge transport for example. We
use neutron spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy to study the effect of the
substitution of n-hexyl (Hex) by triethylene glycol (TEG) on the structural
dynamics of two organic semiconductors: a phenylene-bithiophene-phenylene
(PTTP) molecule and a fluorene-co-dibenzothiophene (FS) polymer.
Counterintuitively, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) reveals a softening of
the modes of PTTP and FS with Hex side chains, pointing towards an increased
dynamical disorder in these systems. However, T-dependent X-Ray and neutron
diffraction, INS and DSC evidence an extra reversible transition close to room
temperature (RT) for PTTP with TEG side chains. The observed transition, not
accompanied by a change in birefringence, can also be observed by quasi-elastic
neutron scattering. A fastening of the TEG side chains dynamics is observed in
the case of PTTP and not FS. We therefore assign this transition to the melt of
the TEG side chains which are promoting dynamical order at RT, but if
crystallising, may introduce an extra reversible structural transition above RT
leading to thermal instabilities. A deeper understanding of side chain polarity

increasing due to the introduction of application stores. The application store
is a type of digital distribution platform for application software, which is
provided as a component of an operating system on a smartphone or tablet.
Mobile devices have limited memory capacity and, unlike server and desktop
systems, due to their mobility they do not have a memory slot that can expand
the memory capacity. Low memory killer (LMK) and out-of-memory killer (OOMK)
are widely used memory management solutions in mobile systems. They forcibly
terminate applications when the available physical memory becomes insufficient.
In addition, before the forced termination, the memory shortage incurs
thrashing and fragmentation, thus slowing down application performance.
Although the existing page reclamation mechanism is designed to secure
available memory, it could seriously degrade user responsiveness due to the
thrashing. Memory management is therefore still important especially in mobile
devices with small memory capacity. This paper presents a new memory
partitioning technique that resolves the deterioration of the existing
application life cycle induced by LMK and OOMK. It provides a completely
isolated virtual memory node at the operating system level. Evaluation results
demonstrate that the proposed method improves application execution time under
memory shortage, compared with methods in previous studies.

with interesting properties. Among the main results in this work, we show that
minimal ({\alpha}, {\beta})-modules can be computed in polynomial time, and
that every graph admits an ({\alpha},{\beta})-modular decomposition tree, thus
generalizing Gallai's Theorem (which corresponds to the case for {\alpha} =

embeddings despite being 140x smaller. With the same number of parameters, they
outperform transformer baselines thereby showcasing their parameter efficiency.
Additionally, we show that pQRNNs are effective student architectures for
distilling large pre-trained language models. We perform careful ablations
which study the effect of pQRNN parameters, data augmentation, and distillation
settings. On MTOP, a challenging multilingual semantic parsing dataset, pQRNN
students achieve 95.9\% of the performance of an mBERT teacher while being 350x
smaller. On mATIS, a popular parsing task, pQRNN students on average are able
to get to 97.1\% of the teacher while again being 350x smaller. Our strong
results suggest that our approach is great for latency-sensitive applications
while being able to leverage large mBERT-like models.

literature. Asymmetric resonance lineshapes are usually associated with Fano
resonances, and two split peaks in the spectrum are often attributed to a Rabi
splitting. True Fano resonances and Rabi splittings are unequivocal signatures
of coherent coupling between subsystems. However, can the same spectral
lineshapes characterizing Fano resonances and Rabi splittings arise from a
purely incoherent sum of intensities? Here we answer this question through
experiments with a tunable Fabry-P\'erot cavity containing a
CsPbBr\textsubscript{3} perovskite crystal. By measuring the transmission and
photoluminescence of this system using microscope objectives with different
numerical aperture ($NA$), we find that even a modest $NA=0.4$ can artificially
generate Fano resonances and Rabi splittings. We furthermore show that this
modest $NA$ can obscure the anti-crossing of a bona fide strongly coupled
light-matter system. Through transfer matrix calculations we confirm that these
spectral artefacts are due to the incoherent sum of transmitted intensities at
different angles captured by the $NA$. Our results are relevant to the wide
nanophotonics community, characterizing dispersive optical systems with high
numerical aperture microscope objectives. We conclude with general guidelines
to avoid pitfalls in the characterization of such optical systems.

kernel-smoothed proper orthogonal decomposition (CKSPOD), to efficiently
emulate the spatiotemporal evolution of fluid flow dynamics. The proposed
surrogate model integrates and extends recent developments in Gaussian process
learning, high-fidelity simulations, projection-based model reduction,
uncertainty quantification, and experimental design, rendering a systematic,
multidisciplinary framework. The novelty of the CKSPOD emulation lies in the
construction of a common Gram matrix, which results from the Hadamard product
of Gram matrices of all observed design settings. The Gram matrix is a
spatially averaged temporal correlation matrix and contains the temporal
dynamics of the corresponding sampling point. The common Gram matrix
synthesizes the temporal dynamics by transferring POD modes into spatial
functions at each observed design setting, which remedies the phase-difference
issue encountered in the kernel-smoothed POD (KSPOD) emulation, a recent fluid
flow emulator proposed in Chang et al. (2020). The CKSPOD methodology is
demonstrated through a model study of flow dynamics of swirl injectors with
three design parameters. A total of 30 training design settings and 8
validation design settings are included. Both qualitative and quantitative
results show that the CKSPOD emulation outperforms the KSPOD emulation for all
validation cases, and is capable of capturing small-scale wave structures on
the liquid-film surface faithfully. The turbulent kinetic energy prediction
using CKSPOD reveals lower predictive uncertainty than KSPOD, thereby allowing
for more accurate and precise flow predictions. The turnaround time of the
CKSPOD emulation is about 5 orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding
high-fidelity simulation, which enables an efficient and scalable framework for
design exploration and optimization.

are not available at training time. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods have
attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their ability to
classify unseen/novel class examples. Most of the existing approaches on ZSL
works when all the samples from seen classes are available to train the model,
which does not suit real life. In this paper, we tackle this hindrance by
developing a generative replay-based continual ZSL (GRCZSL). The proposed
method endows traditional ZSL to learn from streaming data and acquire new
knowledge without forgetting the previous tasks' gained experience. We handle
catastrophic forgetting in GRCZSL by replaying the synthetic samples of seen
classes, which have appeared in the earlier tasks. These synthetic samples are
synthesized using the trained conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) over
the immediate past task. Moreover, we only require the current and immediate
previous VAE at any time for training and testing. The proposed GRZSL method is
developed for a single-head setting of continual learning, simulating a
real-world problem setting. In this setting, task identity is given during
training but unavailable during testing. GRCZSL performance is evaluated on
five benchmark datasets for the generalized setup of ZSL with fixed and dynamic
(incremental class) settings of continual learning. The existing class setting
presented recently in the literature is not suitable for a class-incremental
setting. Therefore, this paper proposes a new setting to address this issue.
Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
the baseline and the state-of-the-art method and makes it more suitable for
real-world applications.

Extensive numerical examples in 2D and 3D are provided as validations. The

particles are much heavier than the carrying fluid, e.g. aerosols, the
influence of particle inertia dominates the particle dynamics. Assuming that
the particle only experiences a local linear velocity profile, its rotational
and translational motion are independent. However, we show that quadratic terms
of the local velocity profile combined with particle inertia cause a lateral
drift of prolate spheroidal particles. We find that this drift is maximal when
particle inertial forces are of the same order of magnitude as viscous forces,
and that both extremely light and extremely heavy particles have negligible
drift. In the non-inertial case, the particle rotates according to the local
linear velocity profile, with each instantaneous orientation corresponding to a
velocity that gives zero force on the particle. This results in a translational
motion in the flow direction with periodic velocity fluctuations. With added
particle inertia, the particle is slow to react to the surrounding fluid motion
and the particle will switch between slower and faster rotation compared to the
zero-force solution. The final motion that gives zero integrated force over a
rotational period, is a motion with a lateral drift. We show that this drift is
purely an effect of the non-sphericity of the particle and its translational
inertia, while rotational inertia is negligible. Finally, although this
inertial drift will contribute to the lateral motion of heavy elongated
particles in channel flow, sedimentation due to gravity will dominate in any
practical application on earth.

to propose defenses that can protect the systems against these attacks.
Addressing these concerns, this paper at first investigates how
state-of-the-art x-vector based SR systems are affected by white-box
adversarial attacks, i.e., when the adversary has full knowledge of the system.
x-Vector based SR systems are evaluated against white-box adversarial attacks
common in the literature like fast gradient sign method (FGSM), basic iterative
method (BIM)--a.k.a. iterative-FGSM--, projected gradient descent (PGD), and
Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack. To mitigate against these attacks, the paper
proposes four pre-processing defenses. It evaluates them against powerful
adaptive white-box adversarial attacks, i.e., when the adversary has full
knowledge of the system, including the defense. The four pre-processing
defenses--viz. randomized smoothing, DefenseGAN, variational autoencoder (VAE),
and Parallel WaveGAN vocoder (PWG) are compared against the baseline defense of
adversarial training. Conclusions indicate that SR systems were extremely
vulnerable under BIM, PGD, and CW attacks. Among the proposed pre-processing
defenses, PWG combined with randomized smoothing offers the most protection
against the attacks, with accuracy averaging 93% compared to 52% in the
undefended system and an absolute improvement >90% for BIM attacks with
$L_\infty>0.001$ and CW attack.

nonlinear stabilization and a high-order approximation to the solution. This
work extends the implicit shock tracking framework to the case of unsteady
conservation laws using a method of lines discretization via a diagonally
implicit Runge-Kutta method by ""solving a steady problem at each timestep"". We
formulate and solve an optimization problem that produces a feature-aligned

sequential quadratic programing (SQP) optimization solver. This method is shown
to deliver highly accurate solutions on coarse, high-order discretizations

low time and space complexity for compatibility with limited-bandwidth devices.
Solving these challenges requires new models that achieve high-fidelity

usually require two pairs of multipartite GHZ state. Secondly, if consider the
practical transmission and detector efficiency, this EPP may be extremely
useful for the ratio of purification efficiency is increased rapidly with both

requires linear optics and does not add additional measurement operations, so
that it is feasible for experiment. All these advantages will make this

Recovering the underlying HSI from the compressive measurement is an ill-posed

problem. However, existing reconstruction methods always start from modeling
image prior with the 1D vector or 2D matrix and cannot fully exploit the

the loss function is relaxed to have an $\alpha$-H\""{o}lder continuous gradient
(referred to as $\alpha$-H\""{o}lder smoothness) which instantiates the
Lipschitz continuity ($\alpha=0$) and the strong smoothness ($\alpha=1$). We

appropriate for finding the solutions of PDEs; the corresponding loss function

kinds of PDEs. However, the rate of convergence has been considered as a
weakness of this approach. This paper proposes Sobolev-PINNs, a novel loss
function for the training of PINNs, making the training substantially
efficient. Inspired by the recent studies that incorporate derivative

training process similar to \textit{Sobolev Training} although PINNs is not a
fully supervised learning task. We provide several theoretical justifications
that the proposed loss functions upper bound the error in the corresponding
Sobolev spaces for the viscous Burgers equation and the kinetic Fokker--Planck
equation. We also present several simulation results, which show that compared
with the traditional $L^2$ loss function, the proposed loss function guides the
neural network to a significantly faster convergence. Moreover, we provide the
empirical evidence that shows that the proposed loss function, together with
the iterative sampling techniques, performs better in solving high dimensional

spectra to infer perturbations in the solar interior due to global and
local-scale flows and structural asphericity. Differential rotation, the
dominant global-scale axisymmetric perturbation, has been tightly constrained
primarily using measurements of frequency splittings via ""$a$-coefficients"".
However, the frequency-splitting formalism invokes the approximation that
multiplets are isolated. This assumption is inaccurate for modes at high
angular degrees. Analysing eigenfunction corrections, which respect cross
coupling of modes across multiplets, is a more accurate approach. However,
applying standard inversion techniques using these cross-spectral measurements
yields $a$-coefficients with a significantly wider spread than the
well-constrained results from frequency splittings. In this study, we apply
Bayesian statistics to infer $a$-coefficients due to differential rotation from
cross spectra for both $f$-modes and $p$-modes. We demonstrate that this
technique works reasonably well for modes with angular degrees $\ell=50-291$.
The inferred $a_3-$coefficients are found to be within $1$ nHz of the frequency
splitting values for $\ell > 200$. We also show that the technique fails at
$\ell < 50$ owing to the insensitivity of the measurement to the perturbation.
These results serve to further establish mode coupling as an important
helioseismic technique with which to infer internal structure and dynamics,
both axisymmetric (e.g., meridional circulation) and non-axisymmetric
perturbations.

action that leads to its prior preference for a future observation. In this
paper, we claim that active inference can be interpreted using reinforcement

extend the concept of expected free energy (EFE), which is a core quantity in
active inference, and claim that EFE can be treated as a negative value

connection, we propose a simple but novel method for learning a prior

be approached with a new perspective of active inference. Experimental results
of prior preference learning show the possibility of active inference with

transverse splitting at refraction and reflection phenomena, inherently depends
on the polarization states of the incidence. Most of the previous research have
focused on a horizontally or vertically polarized incidence, in which the
analytic formula of the shift is well-formulated and SHEL appears symmetrically
in both shift and intensity. However, the SHEL under an arbitrarily polarized
or unpolarized incidence has remained largely unexplored. Whereas the SHEL
under other polarization is sensitive to incident polarization and is
asymmetrical, here we demonstrate that the SHEL is independent of the incident
polarization and is symmetrical in shift if Fresnel coefficients of the two
linear polarization are the same. The independence of the shift with respect to
the incident polarization is proved both analytically and numerically.
Moreover, we prove that under an unpolarized incidence composed of a large
number of completely random polarization states, the reflected beam is split in
half into two circularly polarized components that undergo the same amount of
splitting but in opposite directions. This result means that under unpolarized
incidence, the SHEL occurs exactly the same as under horizontally or vertically
polarized incidence. We believe that the incident-polarization-independent SHEL
can broaden the applicability of the SHEL to cover optical systems in which
polarization is ill-defined.

moderately sensitive components are replaced with with a low rank implant that
is smaller and less computationally expensive than the original component. We
use the relative Hessian trace to measure sensitivity, as opposed to the
magnitude based sensitivity metric commonly used in the literature. We test HAP
for both computer vision tasks and natural language tasks, and we achieve new
state-of-the-art results. Specifically, HAP achieves less than $0.1\%$/$0.5\%$

a GHZ fidelity of at least 0.5. We measure the fidelities using multiple
quantum coherences of GHZ states on 11 to 27 qubits prepared on the IBM Quantum
ibmq_montreal device. Combinations of quantum readout error mitigation (QREM)
and parity verification error detection are applied to the states. A fidelity
of $0.546 \pm 0.017$ was recorded for a 27-qubit GHZ state when QREM was used,
demonstrating GME across the full device with a confidence level of 98.6%. We
benchmarked the effect of parity verification on GHZ fidelity for two GHZ state

remove the redundant edges as the algorithm progresses. Our optimized algorithm
not only significantly reduces the computation time but also maintains the

To test the time complexity, we conduct numerical tests on graphs with various
structures and random weights, from structured ring graphs to random graphs,
such as Erdos-Renyi graphs. The tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm on graphs, especially those with high degree nodes, and the
advantages expand as the graph gets larger. Moreover, we also launch tests on
various graphs/networks derived from a wide range of real-world problems to
suggest the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.

large grains. On the basis of a comparison with polarimetric measurements of

The macroscopic
matter-wave property of ultra-cold atoms leads to large coherent length and
long coherent time, which enable high accuracy and sensitivity to measurement.
Here, we review our efforts to improve the performance of the interferometer.
We demonstrate a shortcut method for manipulating ultra-cold atoms in an
optical lattice. Compared with traditional ones, this shortcut method can
reduce manipulation time by up to three orders of magnitude. We construct a
matter-wave Ramsey interferometer for trapped motional quantum states and
significantly increase its coherence time by one order of magnitude with an
echo technique based on this method. Efforts have also been made to enhance the
resolution by multimode scheme. Application of a noise-resilient
multi-component interferometer shows that increasing the number of paths could
sharpen the peaks in the time-domain interference fringes, which leads to a
resolution nearly twice compared with that of a conventional double-path
two-mode interferometer. With the shortcut method mentioned above, improvement
of the momentum resolution could also be fulfilled, which leads to atomic
momentum patterns less than 0.6 $\hbar k_L$. To identify and remove systematic
noises, we introduce the methods based on the principal component analysis
(PCA) that reduce the noise in detection close to the $1/\sqrt{2}$ of the
photon-shot noise and separate and identify or even eliminate noises.
Furthermore, we give a proposal to measure precisely the local gravity
acceleration within a few centimeters based on our study of ultracold atoms in
precision measurements.

multitude of experiments and numerical simulations, but also in the internal

separation and detached shocks, corresponding to a Strouhal number of

the leading 3-D flow eigenmode provides further evidence of the strong coupling

are able to formulate Noether's theorems by means of the covariant momentum
maps and to systematically introduce a covariant Poisson-Hamiltonian framework.
Also, by focusing on the space plus time decomposition for a generic classical

successfully recover the gauge content and the true local degrees of freedom
for the theory. In order to illustrate the relevance of these geometric
frameworks, we center our attention to the analysis of a model for

Immirzi-like parameter. At the Lagrangian level, we reproduce the field
equations of the system which for this model turn out to be equivalent to the
vanishing torsion condition and the Einstein equations. We also concentrate on

eliminate information leakage to an eavesdropper in a pure-loss channel.
However, the asymmetry of the protocol with respect to the quadratures of light
presents security issues and the eavesdropper's information is not necessarily
minimized for general asymmetric attacks. Here, we perform asymptotic security
analysis of the asymmetric protocol against general asymmetric collective
attacks and bound the eavesdropper's information via the Heisenberg uncertainty

  Attention","35 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human activity recognition in videos has been widely studied and has recently
gained significant advances with deep learning approaches; however, it remains
a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that
simultaneously considers both implicit and explicit representations of human
interactions by fusing information of local image where the interaction
actively occurred, primitive motion with the posture of individual subject's
body parts, and the co-occurrence of overall appearance change. Human
interactions change, depending on how the body parts of each human interact
with the other. The proposed method captures the subtle difference between
different interactions using interacting body part attention. Semantically
important body parts that interact with other objects are given more weight
during feature representation. The combined feature of interacting body part
attention-based individual representation and the co-occurrence descriptor of
the full-body appearance change is fed into long short-term memory to model the
temporal dynamics over time in a single framework. We validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method using four widely used public datasets by
outperforming the competing state-of-the-art method.

coding problem called update-based maximum column distance (UMCD) coding
scheme. The central idea in each transmission is to code messages such that one
of the receivers with the minimum size of side information is instantaneously
eliminated from unsatisfied receivers. One main contribution of the paper is to
prove that the other satisfied receivers can be identified after each
transmission, using a polynomial-time algorithm solving the well-known maximum
cardinality matching problem in graph theory. This leads to determining the
total number of transmissions without knowing the coding coefficients. Once
this number and what messages to transmit in each round are found, we then
propose a method to determine all coding coefficients from a sufficiently large
finite field. We provide concrete instances where the proposed UMCD coding
scheme has a better broadcast performance compared to the most efficient
existing coding schemes, including the recursive scheme (Arbabjolfaei and Kim,
2014) and the interlinked-cycle cover (ICC) scheme (Thapa et al., 2017). We
prove that the proposed UMCD coding scheme performs at least as well as the MDS
coding scheme in terms of broadcast rate. By characterizing two classes of
index coding instances, we show that the gap between the broadcast rates of the
recursive and ICC schemes and the UMCD scheme grows linearly with the number of
messages. Then, we extend the UMCD coding scheme to its vector version by
applying it as a basic coding block to solve the subinstances.

is how to design an optimal source sampling strategy on account of the
communication constraints which are often modeled as queues. In this paper, an
alternative perspective is presented -- a novel status-aware communication
scheme, namely \emph{parallel communications}, is proposed which allows sensors
to be communication-agnostic. Specifically, the proposed scheme can determine,
based on an online prediction functionality, whether a status packet is worth
transmitting considering both the network condition and status prediction, such
that sensors can generate status packets without communication constraints. We
evaluate the proposed scheme on a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) test platform,
which is integrated with a collaborative autonomous driving simulator, i.e.,
Simulation-of-Urban-Mobility (SUMO), to produce realistic vehicle control
models and road conditions. The results show that with online status
predictions, the channel occupancy is significantly reduced, while guaranteeing
low status recovery error. Then the framework is applied to two scenarios: a
multi-density platooning scenario, and a flight formation control scenario.
Simulation results show that the scheme achieves better performance on the
network level, in terms of keeping the minimum safe distance in both vehicle
platooning and flight control.

high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) value of 0.78 (0.80) at 500K in SiS2

preserved. The mCG potentials are derived by matching local structural
distributions of the mCG model to those of the atomistic model through
iterative Boltzmann inversion. For matching mCG and atomistic dynamics, the mCG
time is scaled by a time scaling factor, which compensates for the lower
monomeric friction coefficient of the mCG model than that of the atomistic one.
At the SLSP level, multiple Kuhn segments of a polymer chain are represented by
one coarse-grained bead. The very soft nonbonded interactions between beads do
not prevent chain crossing and, hence, can not capture entanglements. The
topological constraints are represented by slip-springs. A compensating pair
potential is used in the SLSP model, to keep the static macromolecular
properties unaltered upon the introduction of slip-springs. The static and
kinetic parameters of the SLSP model are determined based on the lower level
simulation models. Particularly, matching the orientational autocorrelation of
the end-to-end vector, we determine the number of slip-springs and calibrate
the timescale of the SLSP model. As the test case, the hierarchical methodology
is applied to $cis$-1,4-polybutadiene (cPB) at 413 K. Dynamical properties of
cPB melts are calculated for a broad range of molecular weights. The
calculations are compared, and found in good agreement, with experimental data
from the literature.

living matter, is a mystery in the origin of life. Frank's seminal model showed
in the fifties how chiral symmetry breaking can occur in non-equilibrium
chemical networks. However, an important shortcoming in this classic model is
that it considers a small number of species, while there is no reason for the
prebiotic system, in which homochirality first appeared, to have had such a
simple composition. Furthermore, this model does not provide information on
what could have been the size of the molecules involved in this homochiral
prebiotic system. Here, we show that large molecular systems are likely to
undergo a phase transition towards a homochiral state, as a consequence of the
fact that they contain a large number of chiral species. Using chemoinformatics
tools, we quantify how abundant are chiral species in the chemical universe of
all possible molecules of a given length. Then, we propose that Frank's model
should be extended to include a large number of species, in order to possess
the transition towards homochirality as confirmed by numerical simulations.
Finally, using random matrix theory, we prove that large non-equilibrium
reaction networks possess a generic and robust phase transition towards a
homochiral state.

images. However, box-level annotation is time-consuming and laborious. How to
locate lesions accurately with few, or even without careful annotations is an
urgent problem. Although several works have approached this problem with
weakly-supervised methods, the performance needs to be improved. One obstacle
is that general weakly-supervised methods have failed to consider the
characteristics of X-ray images, such as the highly-structural attribute. We
therefore propose the Cross-chest Graph (CCG), which improves the performance
of automatic lesion detection by imitating doctor's training and

different anatomical areas by leveraging the structural information to simulate
the doctor's habit of observing different areas. Meanwhile, the relationship
between any pair of images is modeled by a knowledge-reasoning module to
simulate the doctor's habit of comparing multiple images. We integrate
intra-image and inter-image information into a unified end-to-end framework.
Experimental results on the NIH Chest-14 database (112,120 frontal-view X-ray

little attention despite playing an important role in forwarding transit
traffic. More precisely, by default, IGP distances are taken into account by
BGP to select the closest exit gateway for the transit traffic (hot-potato
routing). Upon an IGP update, the new best gateway may change and should be
updated through the (full) re-convergence of BGP, causing superfluous BGP
processing and updates in many cases. We propose OPTIC (Optimal Protection
Technique for Inter-intra domain Convergence), an efficient way to assemble
both protocols without losing the hot-potato property. OPTIC pre-computes sets
of gateways (BGP next-hops) shared by groups of prefixes. Such sets are
guaranteed to contain the post-convergence gateway after any single IGP event
for the grouped prefixes. The new optimal exits can be found through a single
walk-through of each set, allowing the transit traffic to benefit from optimal
BGP routes almost as soon as the IGP converges. Compared to vanilla BGP,
OPTIC's structures allow it to consider a reduced number of entries: this
number can be reduced by 99\% for stub networks. The update of OPTIC's
structures, which is not required as long as border routers remain at least
bi-connected, scales linearly in time with its number of groups.

fundamental step in NLP and is well studied in the monolingual text.
Code-mixing adds a challenge to sentiment analysis due to its non-standard
representations. This paper proposes a meta embedding with a transformer method
for sentiment analysis on the Dravidian code-mixed dataset. In our method, we
used meta embeddings to capture rich text representations. We used the proposed

  hyperentanglement","11 pages, 9 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Entanglement purification is a powerful method to distill the high-quality
entanglement from low-quality entanglement. In the paper, we propose an
efficient two-step entanglement purification protocol (EPP) for the
polarization entanglement by using only one copy of two-photon hyperentangled
state in polarization, spatial-mode, and time-bin DOFs. We suppose that the
entanglement in all DOFs suffer from channel noise. In two purification steps,
the parties can reduce the bit-flip error and phase-flip error in polarization
DOF by consuming the imperfect entanglement in the spatial-mode and time-bin
DOFs, respectively. This EPP effectively reduces the consumption of
entanglement pairs and the experimental difficulty. Moreover, if consider the
practical photon transmission and detector efficiencies, our EPP has much
higher purification efficiency than previous recurrence EPPs. Meanwhile, when
one or two purification steps fail, the distilled mixed state may have residual
entanglement. Taking use of the residual entanglement, the parties may still
distill higher-quality polarization entanglement. Even if not, they can still
reuse the residual entanglement in the next purification round. The existence
of residual entanglement benefits for increasing the yield of the EPP. All the
above advantages make our EPP have potential application in future quantum
information processing.

ultra-high dose rate (""FLASH"") radiation treatment significantly reduces normal
tissue toxicity maintaining an equivalent tumor control. The dependence of this
""FLASH"" effect on target oxygenation has led to the assumption that oxygen
""depletion"" could be its major driving force. Materials and Methods: In a
bottom-up approach starting from the chemical track evolution of 1 MeV
electrons in oxygenated water simulated with the TRAX-CHEM Monte Carlo code, we
determine the oxygen consumption and radiolytic reactive oxygen species
production following a short radiation pulse. Based on these values, the
effective dose weighted by oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) or the in vitro cell
survival under dynamic oxygen pressure is calculated and compared to that of
conventional exposures, at constant OER. Results: We find an excellent
agreement of our Monte Carlo predictions with the experimental value for
radiolytic oxygen removal from oxygenated water. However, the application of
the present model to published radiobiological experiment conditions shows that
oxygen depletion can only have a negligible impact on radiosensitivity through
oxygen enhancement, especially at typical experimental oxygenations where a
FLASH effect has been observed. Conclusion: We show that the magnitude and
dependence of the ""oxygen depletion"" hypothesis are not consistent with the
observed biological effects of FLASH irradiation. While oxygenation plays an
undoubted role in mediating the FLASH effect, we conclude that state-of-the-art
radiation chemistry models do not support oxygen depletion and
radiation-induced transient hypoxia as the main mechanism.

light can be generated by pure scattering on a quantum system, without
involving a cavity. The squeezing can be detected at the output ports of the
interferometer either by direct detection or by measuring the spectrum of the
difference current. We use the Hudson-Parthasarathy equation to model the
global evolution. It can describe the scattering of photons and the resulting
radiation pressure interaction on the quantum oscillator. It allows to consider
also the interaction with a thermal bath. In this way we have a unitary
dynamics giving the evolution of oscillator and fields. The Bose fields of
quantum stochastic calculus and the related generalized Weyl operators allow to
describe the whole optical circuit. By working in the Heisenberg picture, the
quantum Langevin equations for position and momentum and the output fields
arise, which are used to describe the monitoring in continuous time of the
light at the output ports. In the case of strong laser and weak radiation
pressure interaction highly non-classical light is produced, and this can be
revealed either by direct detection (a negative Mandel Q-parameter is found),
either by the intensity spectrum of the difference current of two

researchers. The majority of current MTL studies adopt the hard parameter
sharing structure, where hard layers tend to learn general representations over
all tasks and specific layers are prone to learn specific representations for
each task. Since the specific layers directly follow the hard layers, the MTL
model needs to estimate this direct change (from general to specific) as well.
To alleviate this problem, we introduce the novel cluster layer, which groups
tasks into clusters during training procedures. In a cluster layer, the tasks
in the same cluster are further required to share the same network. By this
way, the cluster layer produces the general presentation for the same cluster,
while produces relatively specific presentations for different clusters. As
transitions the cluster layers are used between the hard layers and the
specific layers. The MTL model thus learns general representations to specific
representations gradually. We evaluate our model with MTL document
classification and the results demonstrate the cluster layer is quite efficient

  The first is when all the given rectangles have aspect ratios bounded by some

galaxy-velocity cross-correlation function, $\psi_3$. By including pair counts
measured from random catalogues of velocities and positions sampled from
distributions characteristic of the true data, we find that the variance in the
galaxy-velocity cross-correlation function is significantly reduced. Applying a
covariance analysis and $\chi^2$ minimisation procedure to these statistics, we
determine estimates and errors for the normalised growth rate $f\sigma_8$ and
the parameter $\beta = f/b$, where $b$ is the galaxy bias factor. We test this
framework on mock hemisphere datasets for redshift $z < 0.1$ with realistic
velocity noise constructed from the L-PICOLA simulation code, and find that we
are able to recover the fiducial value of $f\sigma_8$ from the joint
combination of $\psi_1$ + $\psi_2$ + $\psi_3$ + $\xi_{gg}$, with 15\% accuracy
from individual mocks. We also recover the fiducial $f\sigma_8$ to within
1$\sigma$ regardless of the combination of correlation statistics used. When we
consider all four statistics together we find that the statistical uncertainty
in our measurement of the growth rate is reduced by $59\%$ compared to the same
analysis only considering $\psi_2$, by $53\%$ compared to the same analysis

function of $M$. To these data, we associate natural conformally covariant
polynomial one-parameter families of differential operators $C^\infty(X) \to
C^\infty(M)$. They arise through a residue construction which generalizes an
earlier construction in the framework of Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics. The main
ingredient of the definition of residue families are eigenfunctions of the
Laplacian of the singular metric $\sigma^{-2}g$. We prove that if $\sigma$ is
an approximate solution of a singular Yamabe problem, these families can be
written as compositions of certain degenerate Laplacians. This result implies
that the notions of extrinsic conformal Laplacians and extrinsic $Q$-curvature
introduced in recent works by Gover and Waldron can naturally be rephrased in
terms of residue families. The new spectral theoretical perspective enables us
to relate the extrinsic conformal Laplacians and the critical extrinsic
$Q$-curvature to the scattering operator of the asymptotically hyperbolic
metric $\sigma^{-2}g$ extending the work of Graham and Zworski. The latter
relation implies that the extrinsic conformal Laplacians are self-adjoint. We
describe the asymptotic expansion of the volume of a singular Yamabe metric in
terms of Laplace-Robin operators. We also derive new local holographic formulas
for all extrinsic $Q$-curvatures in terms of renormalized volume coefficients,
the scalar curvature of the background metric, and the asymptotic expansions of
eigenfunctions of the Laplacian of the singular metric $\sigma^{-2}g$.
Furthermore, we prove a new formula for the singular Yamabe obstruction $B_n$,
and we use the latter formula to derive explicit expressions for the
obstructions in low-order cases (confirming earlier results). Finally, we
relate the obstruction $B_n$ to the supercritical $Q$-curvature $Q_{n+1}$.

language sentence which indicates complex human activities in a long and
untrimmed video sequence, has received unprecedented attentions over the last
few years. Although each newly proposed method plausibly can achieve better
performance than previous ones, current TSGV models still tend to capture the
moment annotation biases and fail to take full advantage of multi-modal inputs.
Even more incredibly, several extremely simple baselines without training can
also achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we take a closer look
at the existing evaluation protocols for TSGV, and find that both the
prevailing dataset splits and evaluation metrics are the devils to cause
unreliable benchmarking. To this end, we propose to re-organize two widely-used
TSGV benchmarks (ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA). Specifically, we
deliberately make the ground-truth moment distribution different in the
training and test splits, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. Meanwhile,
we introduce a new evaluation metric dR@n,IoU@m to calibrate the basic IoU
scores by penalizing on the bias-influenced moment predictions and alleviate
the inflating evaluations caused by the dataset annotation biases such as
overlong ground-truth moments. Under our new evaluation protocol, we conduct
extensive experiments and ablation studies on eight state-of-the-art TSGV
methods. All the results demonstrate that the re-organized dataset splits and
new metric can better monitor the progress in TSGV. Our reorganized datsets are

the aim to study its evolution and to detect its central compact relic. The
detection of neutrinos from the supernova strongly supports the formation of a
neutron star (NS). However, the constant and fruitless search for this object
has led to different hypotheses on its nature. Up to date, the detection in the
ALMA data of a feature somehow compatible with the emission arising from a
proto Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) is the only hint of the existence of such
elusive compact object. Here we tackle this 33-years old issue by analyzing
archived observations of SN87A performed Chandra and NuSTAR in different years.
We firmly detect nonthermal emission in the $10-20$ kev energy band, due to
synchrotron radiation. The possible physical mechanism powering such emission
is twofold: diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) or emission arising from an
absorbed PWN. By relating a state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of
SN87A to the actual data, we reconstruct the absorption pattern of the PWN
embedded in the remnant and surrounded by cold ejecta. We found that, even
though the DSA scenario cannot be firmly excluded, the most likely scenario
that well explains the data is the PWN emission.

in order to enable isolation from other concurrent computations and resilience
to failures. Modern databases provide transactions with various semantics
corresponding to different trade-offs between consistency and availability.
Since a weaker consistency model provides better performance, an important
issue is investigating the weakest level of consistency needed by a given
program (to satisfy its specification). As a way of dealing with this issue, we
investigate the problem of checking whether a given program has the same set of
behaviors when replacing a consistency model with a weaker one. This property
known as robustness generally implies that any specification of the program is
preserved when weakening the consistency. We focus on the robustness problem
for consistency models which are weaker than standard serializability, namely,
causal consistency, prefix consistency, and snapshot isolation. We show that
checking robustness between these models is polynomial time reducible to a
state reachability problem under serializability. We use this reduction to also
derive a pragmatic proof technique based on Lipton's reduction theory that
allows to prove programs robust. We have applied our techniques to several
challenging applications drawn from the literature of distributed systems and
databases.

quasars depends on the density, temperature, and ionization state of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). Therefore, high-redshift (z > 5) Ly{\alpha} forests
could be invaluable in studying the late stages of the epoch of reionization
(EoR), as well as properties of the sources that drive it. Indeed, high-quality
quasar spectra have now firmly established the existence of large-scale opacity
fluctuations at z > 5, whose physical origins are still debated. Here we
introduce a Bayesian framework capable of constraining the EoR and galaxy
properties by forward-modelling the high-z Ly{\alpha} forest. Using priors from
galaxy and CMB observations, we demonstrate that the final overlap stages of
the EoR (when >95% of the volume was ionized) should occur at z < 5.6, in order
to reproduce the large-scale opacity fluctuations seen in forest spectra.
However, it is the combination of patchy reionization and the inhomogeneous UV
background that produces the longest Gunn-Peterson troughs. Ly{\alpha} forest
observations tighten existing constraints on the characteristic ionizing escape
fraction of galaxies, with the combined observations suggesting f_{\rm esc}
\approx 7^4_3%, and disfavoring a strong evolution with the galaxy's halo (or

challenges the traditional mesh-conforming methods making the computational
costs prohibitively large. In the present work, an immersed image-to-analysis
framework is applied to efficiently evaluate the bending behavior of AM
lattices. To this end, we employ the Finite Cell Method (FCM) to perform a
three-dimensional numerical analysis of the three-point bending test of a

applicability of dimensionally reduced beam models to the prediction of the

resolution simulations for embryo formation from a disc of up to 41,000
fully-self gravitating planetesimals with the GPU-based N-body code GENGA. Our
results indicate that the growth of embryos are highly dependent on the initial
conditions. More massive initial planetesimals, a shorter gas disc decay
timescale and initially eccentric Jupiter and Saturn (EJS) all lead to faster
growth of embryos. Asteroid belt material can thereby be implanted into the
terrestrial planet region via sweeping secular resonances. This could possibly
explain the rapid growth of Mars within 10 Myr inferred from its Hf-W
chronology. The sweeping secular resonance almost completely clears the
asteroid belt and deposits this material in the Mercury-Venus region, altering
the composition of embryos there. This could result in embryos in the
Mercury-Venus region accreting an unexpectedly high mass fraction from beyond 2
AU. Changing the initial orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to more circular (CJS) or
assuming embryos formed in a gas free environment removes the sweeping secular
resonance effect and thus greatly decreases material accreted from beyond 2 AU
for Mercury-Venus region embryos. We therefore propose that rock samples from
Mercury and Venus could aid greatly in deducing the condition and lifetime of
the initial protoplanetary gas disc during planetesimal and embryo formation,

a typical random graph, we investigate how the diagonality of graphs varies

demands of training and deploying over-parameterized deep neural networks. For
inference acceleration, methods that discover a sparse network from a
pre-trained dense network (dense-to-sparse training) work effectively.
Recently, dynamic sparse training (DST) has been proposed to train sparse
neural networks without pre-training a dense model (sparse-to-sparse training),
so that the training process can also be accelerated. However, previous
sparse-to-sparse methods mainly focus on Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLPs)
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), failing to match the performance of
dense-to-sparse methods in the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) setting. In
this paper, we propose an approach to train intrinsically sparse RNNs with a
fixed parameter count in one single run, without compromising performance.
During training, we allow RNN layers to have a non-uniform redistribution
across cell gates for better regularization. Further, we propose SNT-ASGD, a
novel variant of the averaged stochastic gradient optimizer, which
significantly improves the performance of all sparse training methods for RNNs.
Using these strategies, we achieve state-of-the-art sparse training results,
better than the dense-to-sparse methods, with various types of RNNs on Penn
TreeBank and Wikitext-2 datasets. Our codes are available at

respondents' privacy is proposed. It is designed for estimating the population
total, or the population mean, of a quantitative characteristic. It provides
a~high degree of protection to the interviewed individuals, hence it may be
favorably perceived by them and increase their willingness to cooperate.
Instead of revealing the true value of the characteristic under investigation,
a respondent only states whether the value is greater (or smaller) than
a~number which is selected by him/her at random, and is unknown to the
interviewer. For each respondent this number, a sort of individual threshold,
is generated as a pseudorandom number from the uniform distribution. Further,
two modifications of the proposed technique are presented. The first
modification assumes that the interviewer also knows the generated random
number. The second modification deals with the issue that, for certain
variables, such as income, it may be embarrassing for the respondents to report
either high or low values. Thus, depending on the value of the pseudorandom
lower bound, the respondent is asked different questions to avoid being
embarrassed. The suggested approach is applied in detail to the simple random
sampling without replacement, but it can also be applied to many currently used
sampling schemes, including cluster sampling, two-stage sampling, etc. Results
of simulations illustrate the behavior of the proposed procedure.

difficult to obtain abundant labels with limited costs. Active learning
strategies come into ease the burden of human annotation, which queries only a
subset of training data for annotation. Despite receiving attention, most of
active learning methods generally still require huge computational costs and
utilize unlabeled data inefficiently. They also tend to ignore the intermediate
knowledge within networks. In this work, we propose a deep active
semi-supervised learning framework, DSAL, combining active learning and
semi-supervised learning strategies. In DSAL, a new criterion based on deep
supervision mechanism is proposed to select informative samples with high

respectively. The internal criterion leverages the disagreement of intermediate
features within the deep learning network for active sample selection, which
subsequently reduces the computational costs. We use the proposed criteria to
select samples for strong and weak labelers to produce oracle labels and pseudo
labels simultaneously at each active learning iteration in an ensemble learning
manner, which can be examined with IoMT Platform. Extensive experiments on
multiple medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed

available and have been exploited for thermal conductivity enhancement in
polymers. These include materials with very different features, in terms of
thickness, lateral size and composition, especially concerning the oxygen to
carbon ratio and the possible presence of surface functionalization. Due to the
variability of GRM properties, the differences in polymer nanocomposites
preparation methods and the microstructures obtained, a large scatter of
thermal conductivity performance is found in literature. However, detailed
correlations between GRM-based nanocomposites features, including nanoplatelets
thickness and size, defectiveness, composition and dispersion, with their
thermal conductivity remain mostly undefined. In the present paper, the thermal
conductivity of GRM-based polymer nanocomposites, prepared by melt
polymerization of cyclic polybutylene terephtalate oligomers, exploiting 13
different GRM grades, was investigated. The selected GRM, covering a wide range
of specific surface area, size and defectiveness, secure a sound basis for the
understanding of the effect of GRM properties on the thermal conductivity of
their relevant polymer nanocomposites. Indeed, the thermal conductivity
obtained appeared to depend on the interplay between the above GRM feature. In
particular, the combination of low GRM defectiveness and high filler
percolation density was found to maximize the nanocomposites thermal
conductivity.

Surprisingly, the network reduces the simulation noises by itself, thereby
achieving as much accuracy as the Monte-Carlo simulation. Extremely high
accuracy cannot be attained via existing approximate formulas. Moreover, the
network is as efficient as the approaches based on the formulas. When
evaluating based on high accuracy and efficiency, extensive networks can
eliminate the necessity of the pricing formulas for the SABR model. Another
significant contribution is that a novel method is proposed to examine the

other pricing models for which it is hard to induce analytic formulas.

central challenge in diachronic research. Historical corpora of classical
languages, such as Ancient Greek and Latin, typically come with rich metadata,

interpretative power. In contrast, Bayesian models provide explicit and
interpretable representations of semantic change phenomena. In this chapter we
build on GASC, a recent computational approach to semantic change based on a
dynamic Bayesian mixture model. In this model, the evolution of word senses
over time is based not only on distributional information of lexical nature,
but also on text genres. We provide a systematic comparison of dynamic Bayesian

show that Bayesian mixture models are highly competitive approaches to detect

flakiness is well established, prior research focused on Java projects, thus
raising the question of how the findings generalize. In order to provide a
better understanding of the role of flakiness in software development beyond
Java, we empirically study the prevalence, causes, and degree of flakiness
within software written in Python, one of the currently most popular
programming languages. For this, we sampled 22352 open source projects from the
popular PyPI package index, and analyzed their 876186 test cases for flakiness.
Our investigation suggests that flakiness is equally prevalent in Python as it
is in Java. The reasons, however, are different: Order dependency is a much
more dominant problem in Python, causing 59% of the 7571 flaky tests in our
dataset. Another 28% were caused by test infrastructure problems, which
represent a previously undocumented cause of flakiness. The remaining 13% can
mostly be attributed to the use of network and randomness APIs by the projects,
which is indicative of the type of software commonly written in Python. Our
data also suggests that finding flaky tests requires more runs than are often
done in the literature: A 95% confidence that a passing test case is not flaky

$\ell$ and maximum degree $\Delta$. For given numbers $b_v\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq

\mathcal{E}$ such that every vertex $v$ in $V$ belongs to at least $b_v$ edges
in $C$. Set multicover is the problem of finding a minimum-cardinality set
multicover. Peleg, Schechtman and Wool conjectured that unless $\cal{P}
=\cal{NP}$, for any fixed $\Delta$ and $b:=\min_{v\in V}b_{v}$, no
polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the Set multicover problem has an
approximation ratio less than $\delta:=\Delta-b+1$. Hence, it's a challenge to
know whether the problem of set multicover is not approximable within a ratio
of $\beta \delta$ with a constant $\beta<1$.
  This paper proposes a repeated randomized algorithm for the Set multicover
problem combined with an initial deterministic threshold step. Boosting success
by repeated trials, our algorithm yields an approximation ratio of $
\max\left\{ \frac{15}{16}\delta, \left(1- \frac{(b-1)\exp\left(\frac{

only that our result improves over the approximation ratio presented by
Srivastav et al (Algorithmica 2016) for any $\delta\geq 13$, but it's more
general since we set no restriction on the parameter $\ell$. Furthermore, we
prove that it is NP-hard to approximate the Set multicover problem on
$\Delta$-regular hypergraphs within a factor of $(\delta-1-\epsilon)$. Moreover
we show that the integrality gap for the Set multicover problem is at least
$\frac{\ln_{2}(n+1)}{2b}$, which for constant $b$ is $\Omega(\ln n )$.

applications. The Fully Depleted Monolithic Active Microstrip Sensors (FD-MAMS)
described in this work, which are developed within the framework of the ARCADIA
project, are compliant with commercial CMOS fabrication processes. A TCAD
simulation campaign was performed in the perspective of an upcoming engineering
production run with the aim of designing FD-MAMS, studying their electrical
characteristics and optimising the sensor layout for enhanced performance in
terms of low capacitance, fast charge collection and low-power operation. A
very fine pitch of 10 $\mu$m was chosen to provide very high spatial
resolution. This small pitch still allows readout electronics to be
monolithically integrated in the inter-strip regions, enabling the segmentation
of long strips and the implementation of distributed readout architectures. The
effects of surface radiation damage expected for total ionising doses of the
order of 10 to 10$^5$ krad were also modelled in the simulations. The results
of the simulations exhibit promising performance in terms of timing and low

since there are many real applications that require modeling (e.g., business
intelligence, strategic analysis) as well as querying data in RDBMSs. In this
paper, we provide an SQL solution that has the potential to support different
machine learning modelings. As an example, we study how to support unsupervised
probabilistic modeling, that has a wide range of applications in clustering,
density estimation and data summarization, and focus on
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, which is a general technique for
finding maximum likelihood estimators. To train a model by EM, it needs to
update the model parameters by an E-step and an M-step in a while-loop
iteratively until it converges to a level controled by some threshold or
repeats a certain number of iterations. To support EM in RDBMSs, we show our
answers to the matrix/vectors representations in RDBMSs, the relational algebra
operations to support the linear algebra operations required by EM, parameters
update by relational algebra, and the support of a while-loop. It is important
to note that the SQL'99 recursion cannot be used to handle such a while-loop
since the M-step is non-monotonic. In addition, assume that a model has been
trained by an EM algorithm, we further design an automatic in-database model
maintenance mechanism to maintain the model when the underlying training data

extracting high-level contextual features into the model. However, most current
methods still have difficulties with handling tiny details, like hairs or furs.
In this paper, we argue that recovering these microscopic details relies on
low-level but high-definition texture features. However, {these features are
downsampled in a very early stage in current encoder-decoder-based models,
resulting in the loss of microscopic details}. To address this issue, we design
a deep image matting model {to enhance fine-grained details. Our model consists
of} two parallel paths: a conventional encoder-decoder Semantic Path and an
independent downsampling-free Textural Compensate Path (TCP). The TCP is
proposed to extract fine-grained details such as lines and edges in the
original image size, which greatly enhances the fineness of prediction.
Meanwhile, to leverage the benefits of high-level context, we propose a feature
fusion unit(FFU) to fuse multi-scale features from the semantic path and inject
them into the TCP. In addition, we have observed that poorly annotated trimaps
severely affect the performance of the model. Thus we further propose a novel
term in loss function and a trimap generation method to improve our model's
robustness to the trimaps. The experiments show that our method outperforms
previous start-of-the-art methods on the Composition-1k dataset.

this goal, the program Monte Carlo Prophecy 4f with special scenarios of
parameters, 7B1 and 5B1 were used. It was found that the decay width of the
heavier CP-even Higgs boson, H differs from H$_{SM}$ by 1227.93 times and
changes to a negative value when deviating from the standard scenarios. Scale
factors k$^2_{Z}$ and k$^2_{W}$ showed the predominance of the associated with
Z boson production cross section of CP-even Higgs boson over the associated
with W production cross section.

an infectious disease to time-nonhomogeneous cases. First, we discuss the
deterministic model, and derive the expected value of the infection process.
Then as an application we consider that a government issues a decree to its
citizens to curtail their activities that may incur further infections and show
how the public's tardy response may further increase infections and prolong the
epidemic much longer than one might think. We seek to solve a partial
differential equation for the probability generating function. We find,
however, that an exact solution is obtainable only for the BD process, i.e., no
arrivals of the infected from outside. The coefficient of variation for the
nonhomogeneous BD process is found to be well over unity. This result implies
that the variations among different sample paths will be as large as in the
negative binomial distribution with r<1, which was found in Part I for the
homogeneous BDI model. In the final section, we illustrate, using our running
example, how much information we can derive from the time dependent PMF
(probability mass function) P_k(t)=Pr[I(t)=k]. We present graphical plots of
the PMF at various t's, and cross-sections of this function at various k's. A
mesh plot of the function over the (k, t) plane summarizes the above numerous

Part II) that it would be a futile effort to attempt to identify all possible
reasons why environments of similar situations differ so much in their epidemic
patterns. Mere ""luck"" plays a more significant role than most of us may

the effect of data contamination on the estimated joint and individual

in the data can cause instability in such methods, and lead to incorrect
estimation of joint and individual variance components. We focus on the aJIVE
factorization method and provide a thorough analysis of the effect outliers on
the resulting variation decomposition. After showing that such effect is not
negligible when all data-sources are contaminated, we propose a robust
extension of aJIVE (RaJIVE) that integrates a robust formulation of the

shown to provide correct decompositions even in the presence of outliers and
improves the performance of aJIVE. We use extensive simulation studies with

describe an application of RaJIVE to a multi-omics breast cancer dataset from

interaction methods were used in the present work. To improve the quality of
the wave functions and reduce the relative differences between length and
velocity forms for transition data involving high Rydberg states, alternative
computational strategies were employed by imposing restrictions on the electron
substitutions when constructing the orbital basis for each atom and ion.
Transition data, e.g., weighted oscillator strengths and transition
probabilities, are given for radiative electric dipole (E1) transitions
involving levels up to 1s$^2$2s$^2$2p6s for C I, up to 1s$^2$2s$^2$7f for C II,
up to 1s$^2$2s7f for C III, and up to 1s$^2$8g for CIV. Using the difference
between the transition rates in length and velocity gauges as an internal
validation, the average uncertainties of all presented E1 transitions are
estimated to be 8.05%, 7.20%, 1.77%, and 0.28%, respectively, for C I - IV.
Extensive comparisons with available experimental and theoretical results are
performed and good agreement is observed for most of the transitions. In
addition, the C I data were employed in a reanalysis of the solar carbon
abundance. The new transition data give a line-by-line dispersion similar to

Different methods have been proposed to classify the role of each attention
head based on the relations between tokens which have high pair-wise attention.
These roles include syntactic (tokens with some syntactic relation), local
(nearby tokens), block (tokens in the same sentence) and delimiter (the special
[CLS], [SEP] tokens). There are two main challenges with existing methods for
classification: (a) there are no standard scores across studies or across
functional roles, and (b) these scores are often average quantities measured
across sentences without capturing statistical significance. In this work, we
formalize a simple yet effective score that generalizes to all the roles of
attention heads and employs hypothesis testing on this score for robust
inference. This provides us the right lens to systematically analyze attention
heads and confidently comment on many commonly posed questions on analyzing the
BERT model. In particular, we comment on the co-location of multiple functional
roles in the same attention head, the distribution of attention heads across
layers, and effect of fine-tuning for specific NLP tasks on these functional
roles.

with the Planck result $Y_{\rm p}^{\it {Planck}} = 0.2471 \pm 0.0003$. Using
the determined value of $Y_p$ and the primordial deuterium abundance taken from

challenging because the signal morphology can vary between and within-subjects.
Also, it differs from one sensor to another. Hence, it is essential to evaluate
HR detection algorithms across several datasets and under different
experimental setups. In this paper, we studied the potential of three HR
detection algorithms across four independent BCG datasets. The three algorithms
are as follows: the multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete
wavelet transform (MODWT-MRA), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and template
matching (TM). The four datasets were obtained using a microbend fiber optic
sensor, a fiber Bragg grating sensor, electromechanical films, and load cells,
respectively. The datasets were gathered from: a) 10 patients during a
polysomnography study, b) 50 subjects in a sitting position, c) 10 subjects in
a sleeping position, and d) 40 subjects in a sleeping position. Overall, CWT
with derivative of Gaussian provided superior results compared with the
MODWT-MRA, CWT (frequency B-spline), and CWT (Shannon). That said, a BCG
template was constructed from DataSet1. Then, it was used for HR detection in
the other datasets. The TM method achieved satisfactory results for DataSet2
and DataSet3, but it did not detect the HR of two subjects in DataSet4. The
proposed methods were implemented on a Raspberry Pi. As a result, the average
time required to analyze a 30-second BCG signal was less than one second for

(UAV) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks are investigated. A new
transmission framework is proposed, where multiple UAV-mounted base stations
employ NOMA to serve multiple groups of ground users with the aid of an IRS.
The three-dimensional (3D) placement and transmit power of UAVs, the reflection
matrix of the IRS, and the NOMA decoding orders among users are jointly
optimized for maximization of the sum rate of considered networks. To tackle
the formulated mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem with coupled
variables, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm is
developed. Specifically, the original problem is decomposed into three
subproblems, which are alternatingly solved by exploiting the penalty method
and the successive convex approximation technique. The proposed BCD-based
algorithm is demonstrated to be able to obtain a stationary point of the
original problem with polynomial time complexity. Numerical results show that:
1) the proposed NOMA-IRS scheme for multi-UAV networks achieves a higher sum
rate compared to the benchmark schemes, i.e., orthogonal multiple access
(OMA)-IRS and NOMA without IRS; 2) the use of IRS is capable of providing
performance gain for multi-UAV networks by both enhancing channel qualities of
UAVs to their served users and mitigating the inter-UAV interference; and 3)
optimizing the UAV placement can make the sum rate gain brought by NOMA more
distinct due to the flexible decoding order design.

gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)
and TianQin. Previous EMRI rate studies have focused on the ""loss cone""
scenario, where stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) are scattered into highly
eccentric orbits near the central massive black hole (MBH) via multi-body
interaction. In this work, we calculate the rate of EMRIs of an alternative
formation channel: EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around
accreting massive black holes. In this scenario, sBHs and stars on inclined
orbits are captured by the accretion disk, and then subsequently migrate
towards the MBH, under the influence of density wave generation and head wind.
By solving the Fokker-Planck equation incorporating both sBH-sBH/sBH-star
scatterings and sBH/star-disk interactions, we find that an accretion disk
usually boosts the EMRI formation rate per individual MBH by $\mathcal
O(10^1-10^3)$ compared with the canonical ""loss cone"" formation channel. Taking
into account that the fraction of active galactic nucleus (AGNs) is $\sim
\mathcal O(10^{-2}-10^{-1})$, where the MBHs are expected to be rapidly
accreting, we expect EMRI formation assisted by AGN disks to be an important
channel for all EMRIs observed by space-borne gravitational wave detectors.
These two channels also predict distinct distributions of EMRI eccentricities
and orbit inclinations with respect to the MBH spin equatorial plan, which can
be tested by future gravitational wave observations.

focus of the ST community. These models condense the previously cascaded
systems by directly converting sound waves into translated text. However,
cascaded models have the advantage of including automatic speech recognition
output, useful for a variety of practical ST systems that often display
transcripts to the user alongside the translations. To bridge this gap, recent
work has shown initial progress into the feasibility for end-to-end models to
produce both of these outputs. However, all previous work has only looked at
this problem from the consecutive perspective, leaving uncertainty on whether
these approaches are effective in the more challenging streaming setting. We
develop an end-to-end streaming ST model based on a re-translation approach and
compare against standard cascading approaches. We also introduce a novel
inference method for the joint case, interleaving both transcript and
translation in generation and removing the need to use separate decoders. Our
evaluation across a range of metrics capturing accuracy, latency, and
consistency shows that our end-to-end models are statistically similar to
cascading models, while having half the number of parameters. We also find that
both systems provide strong translation quality at low latency, keeping 99% of
consecutive quality at a lag of just under a second.

focusing initially on high-priced global electricity markets and including
integrated thermal storage in order to maximize revenue and compete in markets
with high renewables penetration. Process heat and hydrogen production will be
tough early markets for fusion, but may open up to fusion as markets evolve and
if fusion's levelized cost of electricity falls below 50 \$/MWh$_\mathrm{e}$.

to lower capital costs (e.g., by minimizing construction times and interest or

available: i) a model of 3D scene and scanner, ii) a model of the beam-scene
interaction, simplified to a computationally feasible while physically
realistic level, and iii) an application for which simulated data is fit for
use. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which
we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation
framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning
implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the
trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity
(runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration.
Unique features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings
(pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene
representation. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using
a subsampling strategy, and is able to create full-waveform outputs as a basis
for detailed analysis. As generation and analysis of waveforms can strongly
impact runtimes, the user may set the level of detail for the subsampling, or
optionally disable full-waveform output altogether. A detailed assessment of
computational considerations and a comparison of HELIOS++ to its predecessor,
HELIOS, reveal reduced runtimes by up to 83 %. At the same time, memory
requirements are reduced by up to 94 %, allowing for much larger (i.e. more

detected and undetected) that can result in new infections, and (ii)
time-varying characteristics due to new variants, Non-Pharmaceutical
Interventions etc. We develop a model called SUTRA (Susceptible, Undetected
though infected, Tested positive, and Removed Analysis) that takes into account
both of these two key properties. While applying the model to a region, two
parameters of the model can be learnt from the number of daily new cases found
in the region. Using the learnt values of the parameters the model can predict
the number of daily new cases so long as the learnt parameters do not change
substantially. Whenever any of the two parameters changes due to the key
property (ii) above, the SUTRA model can detect that the values of one or both
of the parameters have changed. Further, the model has the capability to
relearn the changed parameter values, and then use these to carry out the
prediction of the trajectory of the pandemic for the region of concern. The
SUTRA approach can be applied at various levels of granularity, from an entire
country to a district, more specifically, to any large enough region for which
the data of daily new cases are available.
  We have applied the SUTRA model to thirty-two countries, covering more than
half of the world's population. Our conclusions are: (i) The model is able to
capture the past trajectories very well. Moreover, the parameter values, which
we can estimate robustly, help quantify the impact of changes in the pandemic
characteristics. (ii) Unless the pandemic characteristics change significantly,
the model has good predictive capability. (iii) Natural immunity provides
significantly better protection against infection than the currently available
vaccines.

al, \textit{ACS Nano}, \textbf{14}, 8616--8623, 2020) that the topology of the
hydrogen bond network (HBN) is a very sensitive measure that should be
considered when developing new interaction potentials. Here we report a
thorough comparison of 11 popular non polarizable classical water models
against their HBN, which is at the root of water properties. We probe the
topology of the HBN using the ring statistics and we evaluate the quality of
the network inspecting the percentage of broken and intact HBs. For each water
model, we assess the tendency to develop hexagonal rings (that promote
crystallization at low temperatures) and pentagonal rings (known to frustrate
against crystallization at low temperatures). We then introduce the
\emph{network complexity index}, a general descriptor to quantify how much the
topology of a given network deviates from that of the ground state, namely of
hexagonal or cubic ice. Remarkably, we find that the network complexity index
allows us to relate, for the first time, the dynamical properties of different
water models with their underlying topology of the HBN. Our study provides a
benchmark against which the performances of new models should be tested
against, and introduces a general way to quantify the complexity of a network
which can be transferred to other materials and that links the topology of the
HBN with dynamical properties. Finally, our study introduces a new perspective
that can help in rationalizing the transformations among the different phases
of water and of other materials.

known outright, but has to be estimated by sampling. For example, meta-games
that arise in multi-agent evaluation can only be accessed by running a
succession of expensive experiments that may involve simultaneous deployment of
several agents. In this paper, we focus on $\alpha$-rank, a popular
game-theoretic solution concept designed to perform well in such scenarios. We
aim to estimate the $\alpha$-rank of the game using as few samples as possible.
Our algorithm maximizes information gain between an epistemic belief over the
$\alpha$-ranks and the observed payoff. This approach has two main benefits.
First, it allows us to focus our sampling on the entries that matter the most
for identifying the $\alpha$-rank. Second, the Bayesian formulation provides a
facility to build in modeling assumptions by using a prior over game payoffs.
We show the benefits of using information gain as compared to the confidence
interval criterion of ResponseGraphUCB (Rowland et al. 2019), and provide
theoretical results justifying our method.

interaction closures for modeling turbulent combustion in the Moderate and
Intense Low oxygen Dilution combustion regime. 2D RANS simulations have been
carried out to model flames issuing from two burners DJHC burner and Adelaide
JHC burner which imitate the MILD combustion. In order to model these flames,
two different approaches of turbulence-chemistry interaction models are
considered; while in the PDF based modeling, two different variants are invoked
to understand the applicability of the PDF based models in the MILD regime: one
is based on presumed shape PDF approach and the other one is transported PDF
approach. A comprehensive study has been carried out by comparing the results
obtained from these different models. For the DJHC burner, the computations are
carried out for a jet speed corresponding to Reynolds numbers of Re=4100,
whereas the Adelaide JHC burner computations are performed for a jet speed
corresponding to Reynolds number of Re=10000. The effects of molecular
diffusion on the flame characteristics are also studied by using different
micro-mixing models. In the case of DJHC burner, it has been observed that the
mean axial velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy profiles are in good
agreement with the measurements. However, the temperature profiles are
over-predicted in the downstream region by both EDC and the PDF based models.
In the context of Adelaide JHC burner, the profiles of the temperature and the
mass fraction of major species (CH4, H2, O2, H2O, CO2) obtained using LPDF
approach are in better agreement with the measurements compared to those
obtained using EDC model; although, both the solution approaches fail to
capture CO and OH radical profiles.

is that the flame front is artificially thickened to resolve on the
computational LES grid while keeping the laminar flame speed ( ) constant. The
artificially thickening of the flame front is obtained by enhancing the
molecular diffusion and decreasing the pre-exponential factor of the Arrhenius
law. Since the flame front is artificially thickened, the response of the
thickened flame to turbulence is affected and taken care of by incorporating an
efficiency function (E) in the governing equations. The efficiency function (E)
in the modified TF model is proposed based on the direct numerical simulations
(DNS) data set of flame-vortex interactions (Colin et al., 2000). The predicted
simulation results are compared with the experimental data and with
computations reported using RANS based probability distribution function (PDF)

nonlinear binary integer programming model and then solved as a linearized
branch-and-bound algorithm. A number of sensitivity analyses are performed to
illustrate the robustness of the model and to draw key managerial insights.
Experimental results reveal that a two-layer detection will significantly
minimize the expected number of casualties in a threat area over a one-layer

mechanics, in particular to the Navier-Stokes equation. The derivation of the
discrete equation of motion is built from the intuitions of Galileo, the
principles of Galilean equivalence and relativity. Other more recent concepts
such as the equivalence between mass and energy and the Helmholtz-Hodge
decomposition complete the formal framework used to write a fundamental law of
motion such as the conservation of accelerations, the intrinsic acceleration of
the material medium, and the sum of the accelerations applied to it. The two
scalar and vector potentials of the acceleration resulting from the
decomposition into two contributions, to curl-free and to divergence-free,
represent the energies per unit of mass of compression and shear.
  The solutions obtained by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and the
discrete equation of motion are the same, with constant physical properties.
This new formulation of the equation of motion makes it possible to
significantly modify the treatment of surface discontinuities, thanks to the
intrinsic properties established from the outset for a discrete geometrical
description directly linked to the decomposition of acceleration. The treatment
of the jump conditions of density, viscosity and capillary pressure is
explained in order to understand the two-phase flows. The choice of the
examples retained, mainly of the exact solutions of the continuous equations,
serves to show that the treatment of the conditions of jumps does not affect
the precision of the method of resolution.

acute events for clinical applications. While most of such prediction
applications are developed to predict the risk of a particular acute event at
one hospital, few efforts have been made in extending the developed solutions
to other events or to different hospitals. We provide a scalable solution to
extend the process of clinical risk prediction model development of multiple
diseases and their deployment in different Electronic Health Records (EHR)
systems.
  Materials and Methods: We defined a generic process for clinical risk
prediction model development. A calibration tool has been created to automate
the model generation process. We applied the model calibration process at four
hospitals, and generated risk prediction models for delirium, sepsis and acute
kidney injury (AKI) respectively at each of these hospitals.
  Results: The delirium risk prediction models achieved area under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) ranging from 0.82 to 0.95 over
different stages of a hospital stay on the test datasets of the four hospitals.
The sepsis models achieved AUROC ranging from 0.88 to 0.95, and the AKI models
achieved AUROC ranging from 0.85 to 0.92.
  Discussion: The scalability discussed in this paper is based on building
common data representations (syntactic interoperability) between EHRs stored in
different hospitals. Semantic interoperability, a more challenging requirement
that different EHRs share the same meaning of data, e.g. a same lab coding
system, is not mandated with our approach.
  Conclusions: Our study describes a method to develop and deploy clinical risk
prediction models in a scalable way. We demonstrate its feasibility by
developing risk prediction models for three diseases across four hospitals.

reduced payoffs when individuals compete for the same option with others. (C)
People care how they are doing relatively to others. The latter trait, the
propensity to compare one's own success with that of others, expresses itself
as envy.
  It is shown that the combination of (A)-(C) leads to spontaneous class
stratification. Societies of agents split endogenously into two social classes,
an upper and a lower class, when envy becomes relevant. A comprehensive
analysis of the Nash equilibria characterizing a basic reference game is
presented. Class separation is due to the condensation of the strategies of
lower-class agents, which play an identical mixed strategy. Upper class agents
do not condense, following individualist pure strategies.
  Model and results are size-consistent, holding for arbitrary large numbers of
agents and options. Analytic results are confirmed by extensive numerical
simulations. An analogy to interacting confined classical particles is

secure a permanent position or leave research altogether. Astrophysicists do
perceive working abroad as important and positive for their careers (Parenti,

much time abroad to further their careers (Fohlmeister & Helling, 2012). By
implication, women need to work abroad longer or have more positions abroad to
achieve the same rank as men. Astrophysicists living in the United Kingdom
prefer to work in their country of origin, but many did not do so because of
worse working conditions or difficultly finding a job for their spouse

relies on the amount and quality of data used to train it. Data augmentation
has been used to improve quality of the trained models by synthetically
producing more training data, and several approaches were used in the
literature that tackles the problem of lack of training data from different

into the context of electromagnetic (EM) design in electrical engineering. The
MMDF is composed of superimposed multiple dielectric layers in order to pass or

model of MMDF is constituted to be the total reflection coefficients for
oblique incident wave angular range with transverse electric (TE) or transverse
magnetic (TM) polarizations. The objective functions depend on the total
reflection (TR) at the pass and stop band re-gions. Three types of the MDFs
that are low pass (LP), high pass (HP) and band pass (BP) MMDFs are optimally
designed across the constituted dual-objective EM model with a frequency
dependent material database through using the multi-objective ABC (MO-ABC)
strategy. The Pareto optimal solutions are refined within the possible
solutions for synchronously minimizing the objective func-tions. The global
optimal MMDF designs are selected from the Pare-to optimal solutions by
providing the trade-off therein between the objective functions. The

models based on administrative boundaries such as countries, which eases data
collection and reduces computation times. However, a low spatial resolution can
lead to sub-optimal investment decisions for wind and solar generation.
Ignoring power grid bottlenecks within regions tends to underestimate system
costs, while combining locations with different wind and solar capacity factors
in the same resource class tends to overestimate costs. We investigate these
two competing effects in a capacity expansion model for Europe's power system
with a high share of renewables, taking advantage of newly-available
high-resolution datasets as well as computational advances. We vary the number
of nodes, interpolating between a 37-node model based on country and
synchronous zone boundaries, and a 1024-node model based on the location of
electricity substations. If we focus on the effect of renewable resource
resolution and ignore network restrictions, we find that a higher resolution
allows the optimal solution to concentrate wind and solar capacity at sites
with better capacity factors and thus reduces system costs by up to 10%
compared to a low resolution model. This results in a big swing from offshore
to onshore wind investment. However, if we introduce grid bottlenecks by
raising the network resolution, costs increase by up to 23% as generation has
to be sourced more locally at sites with worse capacity factors. These effects
are most pronounced in scenarios where grid expansion is limited, for example,
by low local acceptance. We show that allowing grid expansion mitigates some of
the effects of the low grid resolution, and lowers overall costs by around 16%.

who takes products to market, which startups succeed or fail, and as such who
gets to participate in the shaping of our collective economy. While gender
diversity contributes to startup success, most funding is allocated to
male-only entrepreneurial teams. In the wake of COVID-19, 2020 is seeing a
notable decline in funding to female and mixed-gender teams, giving raise to an
urgent need to study and correct the longstanding gender bias in startup
funding allocation. We conduct an in-depth data analysis of over 48,000
companies on Crunchbase, comparing funding allocation based on the gender
composition of founding teams. Detailed findings across diverse industries and
geographies are presented. Further, we construct machine learning models to
predict whether startups will reach an equity round, revealing the surprising
finding that the CEO's gender is the primary determining factor for attaining
funding. Policy implications for this pressing issue are discussed.

  applications to Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis","Working Draft",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition responsible
for most cases of dementia and considered as one of the greatest challenges for
neuroscience in this century. Early Ad signs are usually mistaken for normal
age-related cognitive dysfunctions, thus patients usually start their treatment
in advanced AD stages, when its benefits are severely limited. AD has no known
cure, as such, hope lies on early diagnosis which usually depends on
neuroimaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET). PET data is
then analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software, which uses
mass univariate statistical analysis, inevitably incurring in errors derived
from this multiple testing approach. Recently, Wang et al. (2020) formulated an
alternative: applying functional data analysis (FDA), a relatively new branch
of statistics, to calculate mean function and simultaneous confidence corridors
(SCCs) for the difference between two groups' PET values. Here we test this
approach with a practical application for AD diagnosis, estimating mean
functions and SCCs for the difference between AD and control group's PET
activity and locating regions where this difference galls outside estimated
SCCs, indicating differences in brain activity attributable to AD-derived
neural loss. Our results are consistent with previous literature on AD
pathology and suggest that this FDA approach is more resilient to reductions in
sample size and less dependent on ad hoc selection of an {\alpha} level than
its counterpart, suggesting that this novel technique is a promising venue for
research in the field of medical imaging.

of health (SBDH) play a substantial effect in a wide range of health outcomes.
Electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely employed to conduct
observational studies in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). However,
there has been little research into how to make the most of SBDH information
from EHRs. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in six databases to find
relevant peer-reviewed publications that had recently been published. Relevance
was determined by screening and evaluating the articles. Based on selected
relevant studies, a methodological analysis of AI algorithms leveraging SBDH
information in EHR data was provided. Results: Our synthesis was driven by an
analysis of SBDH categories, the relationship between SBDH and
healthcare-related statuses, and several NLP approaches for extracting SDOH
from clinical literature. Discussion: The associations between SBDH and health
outcomes are complicated and diverse; several pathways may be involved. Using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to support the extraction of SBDH
and other clinical ideas simplifies the identification and extraction of
essential concepts from clinical data, efficiently unlocks unstructured data,
and aids in the resolution of unstructured data-related issues. Conclusion:
Despite known associations between SBDH and disease, SBDH factors are rarely
investigated as interventions to improve patient outcomes. Gaining knowledge
about SBDH and how SBDH data can be collected from EHRs using NLP approaches
and predictive models improves the chances of influencing health policy change
for patient wellness, and ultimately promoting health and health equity.

most salient in artificial general intelligence, which may soon replicate any
human capacity: computers can perform complex functions (in the limit
resembling human behavior) in the absence of consciousness. Complex behavior
becomes meaningless if it is not performed by a conscious being.

tasks, including function boundary detection, binary code search, function
prototype inference, value set analysis, etc. When applying deep learning to
binary analysis tasks, we need to decide what input should be fed into the
neural network model. More specifically, we need to answer how to represent an
instruction in a fixed-length vector. The idea of automatically learning
instruction representations is intriguing, however the existing schemes fail to
capture the unique characteristics of disassembly. These schemes ignore the
complex intra-instruction structures and mainly rely on control flow in which
the contextual information is noisy and can be influenced by compiler
optimizations.
  In this paper, we propose to pre-train an assembly language model called
PalmTree for generating general-purpose instruction embeddings by conducting
self-supervised training on large-scale unlabeled binary corpora. PalmTree
utilizes three pre-training tasks to capture various characteristics of
assembly language. These training tasks overcome the problems in existing
schemes, thus can help to generate high-quality representations. We conduct
both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, and compare PalmTree with other
instruction embedding schemes. PalmTree has the best performance for intrinsic
metrics, and outperforms the other instruction embedding schemes for all
downstream tasks.

develop a new category for IoT data quality. Hence, we examine existing IoT
data quality dimensions and IoT data quality issues in general and specific
domains and IoT data quality dimensions' categories. It is worth considering
that categories in the context of IoT are not many. We developed a new category
in which IoT data quality dimensions and issues are separated. Concerning this

the physics of channel mixing accounted for in linear response TD-DFT leads to
an increase in the opacity in the bound-free quasi-continuum, where the Sandia
