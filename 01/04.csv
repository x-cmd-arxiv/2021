grant-free random access system, where a huge number of devices sporadically
transmit data to a base station (BS) with imperfect synchronization. The goal
is to design algorithms for joint user activity detection, delay detection, and
channel estimation. By exploiting the sparsity on both user activity and
delays, we formulate a hierarchical sparse signal recovery problem in both the
single-antenna and the multiple-antenna scenarios. While traditional compressed
sensing algorithms can be applied to these problems, they suffer high
computational complexity and often require the perfect statistical information
of channel and devices. This paper solves these problems by designing the
Learned Approximate Message Passing (LAMP) network, which belongs to
model-driven deep learning approaches and ensures efficient performance without
tremendous training data. Particularly, in the multiple-antenna scenario, we
design three different LAMP structures, namely, distributed, centralized and
hybrid ones, to balance the performance and complexity. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed LAMP networks can significantly outperform the
conventional AMP method thanks to their ability of parameter learning. It is
also shown that LAMP has robust performance to the maximal delay spread of the
asynchronous users.

for various applications such as verification and identification. However, face
recognition approaches that are based purely on RGB images rely solely on
intensity information, and therefore are more sensitive to facial variations,
notably pose, occlusions, and environmental changes such as illumination and
background. A novel depth-guided attention mechanism is proposed for deep
multi-modal face recognition using low-cost RGB-D sensors. Our novel attention
mechanism directs the deep network ""where to look"" for visual features in the
RGB image by focusing the attention of the network using depth features
extracted by a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The depth features help the
network focus on regions of the face in the RGB image that contains more
prominent person-specific information. Our attention mechanism then uses this
correlation to generate an attention map for RGB images from the depth features
extracted by CNN. We test our network on four public datasets, showing that the
features obtained by our proposed solution yield better results on the
Lock3DFace, CurtinFaces, IIIT-D RGB-D, and KaspAROV datasets which include
challenging variations in pose, occlusion, illumination, expression, and

additional experiments with thermal images, instead of depth images, showing
the high generalization ability of our solution when adopting other modalities

adding Gauss-Bonnet string corrections and assuming that the non-canonical
kinetic term $\omega X^\gamma$ is in quadratic, one can obtain a ghost free
description. Demanding compatibility with the recent GW170817 event forces one
to accept that the relation $\ddot\xi=H\dot\xi$ for the scalar coupling
function $\xi (\phi)$. As a result, the scalar functions of the theory are
revealed to be interconnected and by assuming a specific form for one of them,
specifies immediately the other. Here, we shall assume that the scalar
potential is directly derivable from the equations of motion, once the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling is appropriately chosen, but obviously the opposite is
feasible as well. As a result, each term entering the equations of motion, can
be written in terms of the scalar field and a relatively tractable
phenomenology is produced. For quadratic kinetic terms, the resulting scalar
potential is quite elegant functionally. Different exponents, which lead to
either a more perplexed solution for the scalar potential, are still a
possibility which was not further studied. We also discuss in brief the
non-Gaussianities issue under the slow-roll and constant-roll conditions

to manage healthcare resources. Several experts have called for the necessity
to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing
approaches are often applying standard models of the respective research field.
This habit, however, often comes along with certain restrictions. For instance,
most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate
unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human
mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions
by exploiting these data structures, yet lack intuitive interpretability as
they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a trade-off between
both research directions and present a multimodal learning approach that
combines the advantages of statistical regression and machine learning models
for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany. This novel approach enables the
use of a richer collection of data types, including mobility flows and
colocation probabilities, and yields the lowest MSE scores throughout our

leave, however, a degeneracy between the gas density and metallicity in these

future ALMA observations of the [\oiii] 52 $\mu$m line. Among the current set

detections (at 6-$\sigma$) in SXDF-NB1006-2, B14-6566, J0217-0208, and
J1211-0118 within on-source observing times of 2-10 hours, provided their gas
densities are larger than about $n_{\mathrm{H}} \gtrsim 10^2-10^3$ cm$^{-3}$.
Other targets generally require much longer integration times for a 6-$\sigma$
detection. Either successful detections of the 52 $\mu$m line, or reliable
upper limits, will lead to significantly tighter constraints on ISM parameters.
The forecasted improvements are as large as $\sim 3$ dex in gas density and
$\sim 1$ dex in metallicity for some regions of parameter space. We suggest
SXDF-NB1006-2 as a promising first target for 52 $\mu$m line measurements. We
discuss how such measurements will help in understanding the mass metallicity

characterise the host star through spectroscopic analysis and derive the radius
with the infrared flux method. We constrain the stellar mass and age by
combining the results obtained from two sets of stellar evolutionary tracks. We
analyse the available TESS light curves and one CHEOPS transit light curve for
each known planet in the system. We find that HD 108236 is a Sun-like star with
$R_{\star}=0.877\pm0.008 R_{\odot}$, $M_{\star}=0.869^{+0.050}_{-0.048}

detection of an additional planet, HD 108236 f, in one of the CHEOPS light

curves leads to a tentative orbital period of about 29.5 days. From the light
curve analysis, we obtain radii of $1.615\pm0.051$, $2.071\pm0.052$,
$2.539_{-0.065}^{+0.062}$, $3.083\pm0.052$, and $2.017_{-0.057}^{+0.052}$

are in agreement with previous TESS-based estimates, but with an improved
precision of about a factor of two. We perform a stability analysis of the
system, concluding that the planetary orbits most likely have eccentricities
smaller than 0.1. We also employ a planetary atmospheric evolution framework to
constrain the masses of the five planets, concluding that HD 108236 b and HD

assuming quiescent edge conditions, without reference to the internal structure
of shocks or to instabilities potentially generated in them. Our recent work
has shown that the kinetically modeled internal nonequilibrium zone of straight
shocks away from solid boundaries exhibits low-frequency molecular
fluctuations. The presence of the dominant low frequencies observed using the
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been explained as a consequence
of the well-known bimodal probability density function (PDF) of the energy of
particles inside a shock. Here, PDFs of particle energies are derived in the
upstream and downstream equilibrium regions, as well as inside shocks, and it
is shown for the first time that they have the form of the non-central
chi-squared (NCCS) distributions. A linear correlation is proposed to relate
the change in the shape of the analytical PDFs as a function of Mach number,
within the range $3 \le M \le 10$, with the DSMC-derived average characteristic
low-frequency of shocks, as computed in our earlier work. At a given Mach
number $M=7.2$, varying the input translational temperature in the range $89
\le T_{tr,1}/(K) \le 1420$, it is shown that the variation in DSMC-derived
low-frequencies is correlated with the change in most-probable-speed inside
shocks at the location of maximum bulk velocity gradient. Using the proposed
linear functions, average low-frequencies are estimated within the examined
ranges of Mach number and input temperature and a semi-empirical relationship
is derived to predict low-frequency oscillations in shocks. Our model can be
used to provide realistic physics-based boundary conditions in receptivity and
linear stability analysis studies of laminar-turbulent transition in high-speed

in the cases where a scalar potential is included or is absent, and the
evolution of the scalar field will be assumed to satisfy the slow-roll or the
constant-roll condition. In the case of the slow-roll models with scalar
potential, we shall calculate the slow-roll indices, and the corresponding
observational indices of the theory, and we demonstrate that the resulting
theory is compatible with the latest Planck data. The same results are obtained
in the constant-roll case, at least in the presence of a scalar potential. In
the case that models without potential are considered, the results are less
appealing since these are strongly model dependent, and at least for a
power-law choice of the non-minimal coupling, the theory is non-viable.
Finally, due to the fact that the scalar and tensor power spectra are conformal
invariant quantities, we argue that the Einstein frame counterpart of the
non-minimal $k$-inflation models with scalar potential, can be a viable theory,
due to the conformal invariance of the observational indices. The Einstein
frame theory is more involved and thus more difficult to work with it

Multiple parties monitor a physical dynamic process by deploying their own
sensor networks and update the state estimate according to the average state
estimate of all the parties calculated by a cloud server and security module.
The paradigm taps additively homomorphic encryption which enables the cloud
server and security module to jointly fuse parties' data while preserving the
data privacy. Meanwhile, all the parties collaboratively develop a stable (or
optimal) fusion rule without divulging sensitive model information. For the
proposed filtering paradigm, we analyze the stabilization and the optimality.
First, to stabilize the multi-party state estimator while preserving
observation model privacy, two stabilization design methods are proposed. For
special scenarios, the parties directly design their estimator gains by the
matrix norm relaxation. For general scenarios, after transforming the original
design problem into a convex semi-definite programming problem, the parties
collaboratively derive suitable estimator gains based on the ADMM. Second, an
optimal collaborative gain design method with model privacy guarantees is
provided, which results in the asymptotic MMSE state estimation. Finally,
numerical examples are presented to illustrate our design and theoretical
findings.

management that have received significant attention in recent years. This paper
proposes and analyzes alternative market models for a TMC system -- focusing on
market design aspects such as allocation/expiration of tokens, rules governing
trading, transaction fees, and regulator intervention -- and develops a
methodology to explicitly model the dis-aggregate behavior of individuals
within the market. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted within a
combined mode and departure time context for the morning commute problem to
compare the performance of the alternative designs relative to congestion
pricing and a no-control scenario. The simulation experiments employ a
day-to-day assignment framework wherein transportation demand is modeled using
a logit-mixture model with income effects and supply is modeled using a
standard bottleneck model. The results indicate that small fixed transaction
fees can effectively mitigate undesirable behavior in the market without a
significant loss in efficiency (total welfare) whereas proportional transaction
fees are less effective both in terms of efficiency and in avoiding undesirable
market behavior. Further, an allocation of tokens in continuous time can be
beneficial in dealing with non-recurrent events and avoiding concentrated
trading activity. In the presence of income effects, despite small fixed
transaction fees, the TMC system yields a marginally higher social welfare than
congestion pricing while attaining revenue neutrality. Further, it is more
robust in the presence of forecasting errors and non-recurrent events due to
the adaptiveness of the market. Finally, as expected, the TMC scheme is more
equitable (when revenues from congestion pricing are not redistributed)
although it is not guaranteed to be Pareto-improving when tokens are
distributed equally.

  In this note we prove that in order that the description of the spin will be

way to correct deviations as soon as they occur. This could therefore lead to
more robust models using more flexible representations, even during inference

also study the difference in behavior of these novel models compared to a
standard LSTM baseline and investigate error cases in detail to identify points
of future research. I show that while the proposed approach comes with
promising theoretical guarantees and an appealing intuition, it is only able to
produce minor improvements over the baseline due to challenges in its practical

handover method based on multipath transmission control protocol (MPTCP) is
proposed. The proposed handover method is executed in the controller of the
software-defined HetNets (SDHetNets) and consists of three steps: location
prediction, network selection, and handover execution. In particular, the
method first predicts the user's location in the next moment with an echo state
network (ESN). Given the predicted location, the SDHetNet controller can
determine the candidate network set for the handover to pre-allocate network
wireless resources. Second, the target network is selected through fuzzy
analytic hierarchical process (FAHP) algorithm, jointly considering user
preferences, service requirements, network attributes, and user mobility
patterns. Then, seamless handover is realized through the proposed MPTCP-based
handover mechanism. Simulations using real-world user trajectory data from
Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology show that the proposed method
can reduce the handover times by 10.85% to 29.12% compared with traditional
methods. The proposed method also maintains at least one MPTCP subflow

captures the distinct nonlinearities associated with the constitutive flux
equations and the reaction terms. The IMEX method conveniently treats these two
sources of nonlinearity implicitly and explicitly, respectively, within a
single time-stepping framework. The combination of the p-adaptive mixed

proposed methods eliminate the coupled effect of mesh size and time step on the
algorithmic stability. A residual based a posteriori error estimate that
provides an upper bound of the natural error norm is derived. The availability

two additional results: First, a combinatorial application about triangular
patterns in certain subsets of the Cartesian square of arbitrary amenable
groups, extending a result of Bergelson, McCutcheon and Zhang for countable
amenable groups. Second, a new uniformity aspect in the double recurrence

Our uncountable Roth theorem is crucial in the proof of both of these results.

It has become
an effective research area as an important aspect of image processing and the
building block of image localization, detection, and scene parsing. Object
classification from low-quality images is difficult for the variance of object
colors, aspect ratios, and cluttered backgrounds. The field of object
classification has seen remarkable advancements, with the development of deep
convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Deep neural networks have been
demonstrated as very powerful systems for facing the challenge of object
classification from high-resolution images, but deploying such object
classification networks on the embedded device remains challenging due to the
high computational and memory requirements. Using high-quality images often
causes high computational and memory complexity, whereas low-quality images can
solve this issue. Hence, in this paper, we investigate an optimal architecture
that accurately classifies low-quality images using DCNNs architectures. To
validate different baselines on lowquality images, we perform experiments using
webcam captured image datasets of 10 different objects. In this research work,
we evaluate the proposed architecture by implementing popular CNN
architectures. The experimental results validate that the MobileNet

  steganography scheme","12 pages double-column, 7 tables, and 11 figures",,,,"cs.MM math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Image steganography plays a vital role in securing secret data by embedding
it in the cover images. Usually, these images are communicated in a compressed
format. Existing techniques achieve this but have low embedding capacity.
Enhancing this capacity causes a deterioration in the visual quality of the
stego-image. Hence, our goal here is to enhance the embedding capacity while
preserving the visual quality of the stego-image. We also intend to ensure that
our scheme is resistant to steganalysis attacks.
  This paper proposes a Compressed Sensing Image Steganography (CSIS) scheme to
achieve our goal while embedding binary data in images. The novelty of our
scheme is the combination of three components in attaining the above-listed
goals. First, we use compressed sensing to sparsify cover image block-wise,
obtain its linear measurements, and then uniquely select permissible
measurements. Further, before embedding the secret data, we encrypt it using
the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, and finally, we embed two bits of
encrypted data into each permissible measurement. Second, we propose a novel
data extraction technique, which is lossless and completely recovers our secret
data. Third, for the reconstruction of the stego-image, we use the least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for the resultant
optimization problem.
  We perform experiments on several standard grayscale images and a color
image, and evaluate embedding capacity, PSNR value, mean SSIM index, NCC
coefficients, and entropy. We achieve 1.53 times more embedding capacity as
compared to the most recent scheme. We obtain an average of 37.92 dB PSNR
value, and average values close to 1 for both the mean SSIM index and the NCC
coefficients, which are considered good. Moreover, the entropy of cover images
and their corresponding stego-images are nearly the same.

challenges of complicated diagnosis at a very early stage of infection, where
an efficient lesion segmentation network is optimized initially which is later
integrated into a joint optimization framework for the diagnosis and severity
prediction tasks providing feature enhancement of the infected regions.
Moreover, for overcoming the challenges with diffused, blurred, and varying

segmentation network is introduced, namely Tri-level Attention-based
Segmentation Network (TA-SegNet). This network has significantly reduced
semantic gaps in subsequent encoding decoding stages, with immense
parallelization of multi-scale features for faster convergence providing
considerable performance improvement over traditional networks. Furthermore, a
novel tri-level attention mechanism has been introduced, which is repeatedly
utilized over the network, combining channel, spatial, and pixel attention
schemes for faster and efficient generalization of contextual information
embedded in the feature map through feature re-calibration and enhancement
operations. Outstanding performances have been achieved in all three-tasks

pool of features is defined from the predicates in the planning examples using
a general grammar, and a small subset of features is sought for separating
""good"" from ""bad"" state transitions, and goals from non-goals. The problems of
finding such a ""separating surface"" while labeling the transitions as ""good"" or
""bad"" are jointly addressed as a single combinatorial optimization problem
expressed as a Weighted Max-SAT problem. The advantage of looking for the
simplest policy in the given feature space that solves the given examples,
possibly non-optimally, is that many domains have no general, compact policies
that are optimal. The approach yields general policies for a number of

high-bandwidth data capture. This paper extends the SBB by applying anomaly
detection and action detection methods for generalized event-of-interest (EOI)
detection. An updated SBB pipeline is proposed for the real-time capture of
driving video data. A video dataset is constructed to evaluate the SBB on
real-world data for the first time. SBB performance is assessed by comparing
the compression of normal and anomalous data and by comparing our prioritized
data recording with a FIFO strategy. Results show that SBB data compression can
increase the anomalous-to-normal memory ratio by ~25%, while the prioritized
recording strategy increases the anomalous-to-normal count ratio when compared
to a FIFO strategy. We compare the real-world dataset SBB results to a baseline
SBB given ground-truth anomaly labels and conclude that improved general EOI

it is shown that the quantum version of this condition is much less restrictive

disambiguated and revised to take into account that real (on-shell) photons are

discussed is the manner in which real, physical non-unitarity naturally arises

investigating interacting many-body systems in quantum simulators, such as
quantum gas microscopes. Experimental measurements of mixed spin-charge
correlation functions in the 2D Hubbard have been used to study equilibrium
properties of magnetic polarons and to identify coherent and incoherent regimes
of their dynamics. In this paper we consider theoretically an extension of this
technique to systems which use a pinning potential to reduce the mobility of a
single dopant in the Mott insulating regime of the 2D Hubbard model. We find
that localization of the dopant has a dramatic effect on its magnetic dressing.
The connected third-order spin correlations are weakened in the case of a
mobile hole but strengthened near an immobile hole. In the case of the
fifth-order correlation function, we find that its bare value has opposite
signs in cases of the mobile and of fully pinned dopant, whereas the connected
part is similar for both cases. We study suppression of higher-order
correlators by thermal fluctuations and demonstrate that they can be observed
up to temperatures comparable to the spin-exchange energy $J$. We discuss

also include interparticle collisions: the fully kinetic particle-in-cell VPIC,
the fully kinetic continuum Gkeyll, and the Eulerian Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell

definition is related to energy transfer in a fluid description of a plasma,
and (ii) four distribution function-based parameters, requiring knowledge of
the particle velocity distribution function. There is an overall agreement
between the dissipation measures obtained in the PIC and continuum reconnection
simulations, with slight differences due to the presence/absence of secondary
islands in the two simulations. There are also many qualitative similarities
between the signatures in the reconnection simulations and the self-consistent
current sheets that form in turbulence, although the latter exhibits
significant variations compared to the reconnection results. All the parameters
confirm that dissipation occurs close to regions of intense magnetic stresses,
thus exhibiting local correlation. The distribution function-based measures
show a broader width compared to energy-based proxies, suggesting that energy
transfer is co-localized at coherent structures, but can affect the particle
distribution function in wider regions. The effect of interparticle collisions

two frequently discussed competing structures for this tetraquark by

use the static-light approximation, where the two $\bar{b}$ quarks are assumed

field to investigate the relation of AGN type with host galaxy properties.
Applying a Bayesian method, we derive the hardness ratios (HRs) and through
these the hydrogen column density ($\rm N_H$) for each source. We consider as
absorbed sources (type-2) those with $\rm N_H > 10^{21.5}\, \rm{cm^{-2}}$. We
examine the star formation rate (SFR) as well the stellar mass (M$_*$)
distributions for both absorbed and unabsorbed sources. Our work indicates that
there is no significant link between the AGN type and these host galaxy
properties. Next, we investigate whether the AGN power, as represented by its
X-ray luminosity, $\rm L_X$, correlates with any deviation of the host galaxy's
place from the so-called Main Sequence of galaxies, and we examine this
separately for the obscured and the unobscured AGN populations. To take into
account the effect of M$_*$ and redshift on SFR, we use the normalised SFR
(SFR$_{norm}$). We find that the correlation between $\rm L_X$ and
SFR$_{norm}$, follows approximately the same trend for both absorbed and
unabsorbed sources, a result that favours the standard AGN unification models.
Finally, we explore the connection between the obscuration, $\rm N_H$, and the
SFR. We find that there is no relation between these, suggesting that the
obscuration is not related to the large scale SFR in the galaxy.

perform a statistical exploration of the attenuation of LyC photons by neutral
hydrogen in the intergalactic medium using ensembles of simulated transmission
functions. We show that LyC detected galaxies are more likely to be found in
sightlines with higher-than-average transmission of LyC photons. This means
that adopting a mean transmission at a given redshift leads to an overestimate
of the true $f_{\rm esc}$ for LyC detected galaxies. We note, however, that
mean values are appropriate for $f_{\rm esc}$ estimates of larger parent
samples that include LyC non-detected galaxies. We quantify this IGM
transmission bias for LyC detections in photometric and spectroscopic surveys
in the literature and show that the bias is stronger for both shallower
observations and for fainter parent samples (i.e. Lyman $\alpha$ emitters
versus Lyman break galaxies). We also explore the effects of varying the
underlying probability distribution function (PDF) of $f_{\rm esc}$ on

a first step in improved interpretation of LyC detections in the context of

$\infty$, we show that the limsup of the KPZ height function with the scaling
by $t^{1/3}(\log\log t)^{2/3}$ is almost surely equal to

to reduce the computations and parameters size of CNNs meanwhile maintaining
the model accuracy. It also brings profound impact to improve the applicability
of the compute- and memory-intensive CNNs to a broad range of applications,
such as mobile devices, which are generally short of computation power and
memory. However, previous research in DSCs are largely focusing on compositing
the limited existing DSC designs, thus, missing the opportunities to explore
more potential designs that can achieve better accuracy and higher
computation/parameter reduction. Besides, the off-the-shelf convolution
implementations offer limited computing schemes, therefore, lacking support for
DSCs with different convolution patterns.
  To this end, we introduce, DSXplore, the first optimized design for exploring
DSCs on CNNs. Specifically, at the algorithm level, DSXplore incorporates a
novel factorized kernel -- sliding-channel convolution (SCC), featured with
input-channel overlapping to balance the accuracy performance and the reduction
of computation and memory cost. SCC also offers enormous space for design
exploration by introducing adjustable kernel parameters. Further, at the
implementation level, we carry out an optimized GPU-implementation tailored for
SCC by leveraging several key techniques, such as the input-centric backward
design and the channel-cyclic optimization. Intensive experiments on different
datasets across mainstream CNNs show the advantages of DSXplore in balancing
accuracy and computation/parameter reduction over the standard convolution and

Algorithm-wise, most first-order proximal algorithms in the literature for

SVD does not scale appropriately with the dimension of the matrices, these
algorithms become slower when the problem size becomes larger. By incorporating
the variational formulation of the nuclear norm into the sub-problem of

speed-up. Moreover, our algorithm preserves the rank identification property of
nuclear norm [33] which further allows us to design a rank continuation scheme
that asymptotically achieves the minimal iteration complexity. Numerical

they provide huge convenience for passengers. As a fundamental problem, the
timely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for
effective traffic flow control and route planning. As both spatial and temporal
patterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has
evolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modeling historical
passenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot
by connecting region nodes via different relational edges (e.g.,
origin-destination relationship, geographical distance, etc.). Consequently,
the spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in
the constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about
the directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two
connected regions. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to
simultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed, and
weighted (DDW) graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph
representations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel
spatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with
all attention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those
three intrinsic properties of DDW graphs, we build three attention layers to
fully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across
all historical time slots. Moreover, the model employs a subtask to conduct
pretraining so that it can obtain accurate results more quickly. We evaluate
the proposed model on real-world datasets, and our experimental results
demonstrate that Gallat outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

distributed computing resources for supporting computation-intensive vehicular
applications in dynamic driving environments. To facilitate this paradigm, the
onsite resource trading serves as a critical enabler. However, dynamic
communications and resource conditions could lead unpredictable trading
latency, trading failure, and unfair pricing to the conventional resource
trading process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel
futures-based resource trading approach in edge computing-enabled internet of

related negotiations between an MEC server (seller) and a vehicle (buyer) in a

resource supply and network condition, we formulate the futures-based resource
trading as the optimization problem aiming to maximize the seller's and the
buyer's expected utility, while applying risk evaluations to relieve possible
losses incurred by the uncertainties in the system. To tackle this problem, we
propose an efficient bilateral negotiation approach which facilitates the
participants reaching a consensus. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed futures-based resource trading brings considerable utilities to both
participants, while significantly outperforming the baseline methods on
critical factors, e.g., trading failures and fairness, negotiation latency and
cost.

of the fifth-generation (5G) networks. The integration of MEC with
resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could enable flexible
resource provisioning for supporting dynamic and computation-intensive UAV
applications. Existing resource trading could facilitate this paradigm with
proper incentives, which, however, may often incur unexpected negotiation
latency and energy consumption, trading failures and unfair pricing, due to the
unpredictable nature of the resource trading process. Motivated by these
challenges, an efficient futures-based resource trading mechanism for edge
computing-assisted UAV network is proposed, where a mutually beneficial and
risk-tolerable forward contract is devised to promote resource trading between
an MEC server (seller) and a UAV (buyer). Two key problems i.e. futures
contract design before trading and power optimization during trading are
studied. By analyzing historical statistics associated with future resource
supply, demand, and air-to-ground communication quality, the contract design is
formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize both
the seller's and the buyer's expected utilities, while estimating their
acceptable risk tolerance. Accordingly, we propose an efficient bilateral
negotiation scheme to help players reach a trading consensus on the amount of
resources and the relevant price. For the power optimization problem, we
develop a practical algorithm that enables the buyer to determine its optimal
transmission power via convex optimization techniques. Comprehensive
simulations demonstrate that the proposed mechanism offers both players
considerable utilities, while outperforming the onsite trading mechanism on
trading failures and fairness, negotiation latency, and cost.

signals such as neutrinos and massive gravitational waves in some theories
beyond GR. In this work we study the time delay between different relativistic
images formed by signals with arbitrary asymptotic velocity $v$ in general
static and spherically symmetric spacetimes. A perturbative method is used to
calculate the total travel time in the strong field limit, which is found to be
in quasi-series of the small parameter $a=1-b_c/b$ where $b$ is the impact
parameter and $b_c$ is its critical value. The coefficients of the series are
completely fixed by the behaviour of the metric functions near the particle
sphere $r_c$ and only the first term of the series contains a weak logarithmic
divergence. The time delay $\Delta t_{n,m}$ to the leading non-trivial order
was shown to equal the particle sphere circumference divided by the local
signal velocity and multiplied by the winding number and the redshift factor.
By assuming the Sgr A* supermassive black hole is a Hayward one, we were able
to validate the quasi-series form of the total time, and reveal the effects of
the spacetime parameter $l$, the signal velocity $v$ and the source/detector
coordinate difference $\Delta\phi_{sd}$ on the time delay. It is found that as
$l$ increase from 0 to its critical value $l_c$, both $r_c$ and $\Delta
t_{n,m}$ decrease. The variation of $\Delta t_{n+1,n}$ for $l$ from 0 to $l_c$
can be as large as $7.2\times 10^1$ [s], whose measurement then can be used to
constrain the value of $l$. While for ultra-relativistic neutrino or
gravitational wave, the variation of $\Delta t_{n,m}$ is too small to be
resolved. The dependence of $\Delta t_{n,-n}$ on $\Delta \phi_{sd}$ shows that
to temporally resolve the two sequences of images from opposite sides of the
lens, $|\Delta \phi_{sd}-\pi|$ has to be larger than certain value.

equitable CS education draws on critical pedagogy to ensure the rightful

  We argue for affordance analysis, a more critical algorithm analysis based on

in turn embody values with political consequences. We illustrate 5 case studies
of how affordance analysis refutes social determination of technology,
foregrounds the limitations of data abstractions, and implicates the design of

develop a novel optimization methodology that jointly accounts for these

Supervised learning is used in the work, which classifies the particular

accuracy, Googlenet is used. The final layer of the Googlenet is replaced with
the transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the Googlenet. At the same
time, the accuracy in moving images can be maintained by transfer learning
techniques. Hardware is the main backbone for any model to obtain faster
results with a large number of datasets. Here, Nvidia Jetson Nano is used which

state prior to the application of a driving field, to the long-time steady (or
periodically oscillating) state. These dynamics are complex: the retarded
quantities tend to approach their long-time limit much faster than the lesser

electric fields illustrated that the system may evolve through successive
quasi-thermal states obeying an effective fluctuation-dissipation theorem in
time. We demonstrate an extrapolation scheme that uses the short-time transient

lesser/greater quantities vary with time and then extend the numerical
solutions all the way to the steady state, with minimal additional
computational cost. Our approach focuses on extrapolating the electronic

Integrating FL in IIoT ensures that no local sensitive data is exchanged, as
the distribution of learning models over the edge devices has become more

into two fields based on the availability of HSC reference images. For the
fields with the HSC reference images, we applied an image subtraction
technique; for the fields without the HSC reference images, we sought
individual HSC images by matching a catalog of observed objects with the PS1
catalog. The search depth is 22.28 mag in the former method and the limit of
search depth is 21.3 mag in the latter method. Subsequently, we performed
visual inspection and obtained 83 candidates using the former method and 50

their distances with photometry of associated extended objects. We found three

AGN using archival RM data. We performed systematic modeling of the continuum
and emission line light curves using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on
Bayesian statistics implemented in PBMAP (Parallel Bayesian code for
reverberation-MAPping data) code to constrain BLR geometrical parameters and
recover velocity integrated transfer function. We found that the recovered
transfer functions have various shapes such as single-peaked, double-peaked and
top-hat suggesting that AGN have very different BLR geometries. Our model lags
are in general consistent with that estimated using the conventional
cross-correlation methods. The BLR sizes obtained from our modeling approach is
related to the luminosity with a slope of 0.583 (+/-) 0.026 and 0.471 (+/-)
0.084 based on H{\beta} and H{\alpha} lines, respectively. We found a
non-linear response of emission line fluxes to the ionizing optical continuum
for 93\% objects. The estimated virial factors for the AGN studied in this work
range from 0.79 to 4.94 having a mean at 1.78 (+/-) 1.77 consistent with the
values found in the literature.

finite-temperature properties of the half-filled attractive SU($3$) Hubbard
model on a honeycomb lattice. We calculate the phase diagram in which the phase
boundary separates the disordered phase and the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase
and the transition temperature $T_{\text{tr}}(|U|)$ varies non-monotonically
with attractive Hubbard interaction $|U|$. As the Hubbard $|U|$ increases at
constant temperature $T<\text{max}(T_{\text{tr}}(|U|))$, the system first
undergoes a transition from thermal Dirac semimetal phase to CDW phase, and
eventually the CDW state is thermally melted at a strong Hubbard $|U|$ where
the system enters a liquid-like disordered phase of on-site trions. In between
the two transition points the non-monotonic $|U|$ dependence of CDW order
strength is strikingly different from the zero-temperature monotonic behavior.
In the trion CDW states where off-site trions arise from quantum fluctuations
(a fermion inside an on-site trion hops to a nearest-neighbor site), the
simulated triple occupancy at constant Hubbard $|U|$ surprisingly increases
with temperature, implying that the formation of off-site trions is suppressed
by the thermal delocalization of on-site trions. We have also calculated the
entropy-temperature relations for various attractive Hubbrad interactions,
which exhibit the prominent characteristic of the Pomeranchuk effect. Our work
has revealed that the formation of on-site and off-site trions has significant
consequences for thermodynamic properties of SU(3) Dirac fermions.

$\textit{Re} = \Omega_0 a^2/\nu_s$ and $\textit{De} = \Omega_0 \tau$ are,
respectively, the Reynolds and Deborah numbers based on the core angular
velocity ($\Omega_0$), the radius of the column ($a$), the solvent-based
kinematic viscosity ($\nu_s = \mu_s/\rho$), and the polymeric relaxation time
($\tau$). The stability of small-amplitude perturbations in this distinguished
limit is governed by the elastic Rayleigh equation whose spectrum is
parameterized by $ \textrm{E} = \textit{El}(1-\beta)$, $\beta$ being the ratio
of the solvent to the solution viscosity. The neglect of the relaxation terms,
in the said limit, implies that the polymer solution supports undamped elastic
shear waves propagating relative to the base-state flow. The existence of these
shear waves leads to multiple (three) continuous spectra associated with the
elastic Rayleigh equation in contrast to just one for the original Rayleigh
equation. Further, unlike the neutrally stable inviscid case, an instability of
the vortex column arises for finite E due to a pair of elastic shear waves
being driven into a resonant interaction under the differential convection by
the irrotational shearing flow outside the core. An asymptotic analysis for the
Rankine profile shows the absence of an elastic threshold; although, for small
E, the growth rate of the unstable discrete mode is transcendentally small,
being O$(\textrm{E}^2e^{-1/\textrm{E}^{\frac{1}{2}}})$. An accompanying
numerical investigation shows that the instability persists for smooth
vorticity profiles, provided the radial extent of the transition region (from
the rotational core to the irrotational exterior) is less than a certain
$\textrm{E}$-dependent threshold.

a $k$-wing equivalence relationship to summarize the edges of a bipartite graph
$G$ into groups. Therefore, all the edges of $G$ are segregated into different
groups, i.e. $k$-wing equivalence class, forming an efficient and wing number
conserving index called EquiWing. Further, we propose a more compact version of

are used to expedite the personalized $k$-wing search with a non-repetitive

applications. In IoT networks, where a large-number of nodes are distributed,
severe interference may incur during the transmission phase which causes age of
information (AoI) degradation. It is therefore important to study the
performance limit of AoI as well as how to achieve such limit. In this paper,
we aim to optimize the AoI in random access Poisson networks. By taking into
account the spatio-temporal interactions amongst the transmitters, an
expression of the peak AoI is derived, based on explicit expressions of the
optimal peak AoI and the corresponding optimal system parameters including the
packet arrival rate and the channel access probability are further derived. It
is shown that with a given packet arrival rate (resp. a given channel access
probability), the optimal channel access probability (resp. the optimal packet
arrival rate), is equal to one under a small node deployment density, and
decrease monotonically as the spatial deployment density increases due to the
severe interference caused by spatio-temproal coupling between transmitters.
When joint tuning of the packet arrival rate and channel access probability is
performed, the optimal channel access probability is always set to be one.
Moreover, with the sole tuning of the channel access probability, it is found
that the optimal peak AoI performance can be improved with a smaller packet
arrival rate only when the node deployment density is high, which is contrast
to the case of the sole tuning of the packet arrival rate, where a higher
channel access probability always leads to better optimal peak AoI regardless
of the node deployment density. In all the cases of optimal tuning of system
parameters, the optimal peak AoI linearly grows with the node deployment
density as opposed to an exponential growth with fixed system parameters.

strategy to jointly regard the inter-snippet and intra-snippet temporal
dependencies as self-supervision signals for temporal representation learning.
To model multi-scale temporal dependencies, our TCGL integrates the prior
knowledge about the frame and snippet orders into graph structures, i.e., the
intra-/inter- snippet temporal contrastive graphs. By randomly removing edges
and masking nodes of the intra-snippet graphs or inter-snippet graphs, our TCGL
can generate different correlated graph views. Then, specific contrastive
learning modules are designed to maximize the agreement between nodes in
different views. To adaptively learn the global context representation and
recalibrate the channel-wise features, we introduce an adaptive video snippet
order prediction module, which leverages the relational knowledge among video
snippets to predict the actual snippet orders. Experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our TCGL over the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale
action recognition and video retrieval benchmarks.

capabilities, especially when they generate consistent long text in thousands
of words with ease. However, users of these models can only control the prefix
of sentences or certain global aspects of generated text. It is challenging to
simultaneously achieve fine-grained controllability and preserve the
state-of-the-art unconditional text generation capability. In this paper, we
first propose a new task named ""Outline to Story"" (O2S) as a test bed for
fine-grained controllable generation of long text, which generates a
multi-paragraph story from cascaded events, i.e. a sequence of outline events
that guide subsequent paragraph generation. We then create dedicate datasets
for future benchmarks, built by state-of-the-art keyword extraction techniques.
Finally, we propose an extremely simple yet strong baseline method for the O2S
task, which fine tunes pre-trained language models on augmented sequences of
outline-story pairs with simple language modeling objective. Our method does
not introduce any new parameters or perform any architecture modification,
except several special tokens as delimiters to build augmented sequences.
Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art
conditional story generation performance with our model, achieving better
fine-grained controllability and user flexibility. Our paper is among the first
ones by our knowledge to propose a model and to create datasets for the task of
""outline to story"". Our work also instantiates research interest of
fine-grained controllable generation of open-domain long text, where

business decisions. In today's data-rich environment, people often aim to
choose the optimal forecasting model for their data. However, identifying the
optimal model requires professional knowledge and experience, making accurate
forecasting a challenging task. To mitigate the importance of model selection,
we propose a simple and reliable algorithm to improve the forecasting
performance. Specifically, we construct multiple time series with different
sub-seasons from the original time series. These derived series highlight
different sub-seasonal patterns of the original series, making it possible for
the forecasting methods to capture diverse patterns and components of the data.
Subsequently, we produce forecasts for these multiple series separately with
classical statistical models (ETS or ARIMA). Finally, the forecasts are
combined. We evaluate our approach on widely-used forecasting competition data
sets (M1, M3, and M4) in terms of both point forecasts and prediction
intervals. We observe performance improvements compared with the benchmarks.
Our approach is particularly suitable and robust for the data with higher
frequency. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposition, we showcase
the performance improvements from our approach on hourly load data that exhibit
multiple seasonal patterns.

camera, when faced with the scene of gathering or covering, it can hardly
perform well in unstructured scenes that appear as gathering and covering, for
the reason that can't recognize objects accurately in cluster scenes from a
single perspective and the manipulators can't make the environment better for
grasping. In this case, a novel method of pushing-grasping collaborative based
on the deep Q-network in dual perspectives is proposed in this paper. This
method adopts an improved deep Q network algorithm, with an RGB-D camera to
obtain the information of objects' RGB images and point clouds from two
perspectives, and combines the pushing and grasping actions so that the trained
manipulator can make the scenes better for grasping so that it can perform well
in more complicated grasping scenes. What's more, we improved the reward
function of the deep Q-network and propose the piecewise reward function to
speed up the convergence of the deep Q-network. We trained different models and
tried different methods in the V-REP simulation environment, and it concluded
that the method proposed in this paper converges quickly and the success rate
of grasping objects in unstructured scenes raises up to 83.5%. Besides, it
shows the generalization ability and well performance when novel objects appear

the fluctuations and their dependence on distance and context (i.e. large scale
solar wind properties), aiming to understand the role that different effects
such as source properties, solar wind expansion, stream interaction might play
in determining the turbulent state. We carry out a statistical survey of the
data from the first five orbits of PSP with a focus on how the fluctuation
properties at the large, MHD scales, vary with different solar wind streams and
distance from the Sun. A more in-depth analysis from several selected periods
is also presented. Our results show that as fluctuations are transported
outward by the solar wind, the magnetic field spectrum steepens while the shape
of the velocity spectrum remains unchanged. The steepening process is
controlled by the ""age"" of the turbulence, determined by the wind speed
together with the radial distance. Statistically, faster solar wind has higher
""Alfv\'enicity"", with more dominant outward propagating wave component and more
balanced magnetic/kinetic energies. The outward wave dominance gradually
weakens with radial distance, while the excess of magnetic energy is found to
be stronger as we move closer toward the Sun. We show that the turbulence
properties can vary significantly stream to stream even if these streams are of
similar speed, indicating very different origins of these streams. Especially,
the slow wind that originates near the polar coronal holes has much lower
Alfv\'enicity compared with the slow wind that originates from the active
regions/pseudostreamers. We show that structures such as heliospheric current
sheets and velocity shears can play an important role in modifying the
properties of the turbulence.

finding the maximal probability of satisfying a parity condition on a (possibly
hybrid) state space. While characterizing the exact satisfaction probability is
open, we show that a lower bound on this probability can be obtained by (I)
computing an under-approximation of the qualitative winning region, i.e.,
states from which the parity condition can be enforced almost surely, and (II)
computing the maximal probability of reaching this qualitative winning region.
The heart of our approach is a technique to symbolically compute the
under-approximation of the qualitative winning region in step (I) via a
finite-state abstraction of the original system as a 2.5-player parity game.
Our abstraction procedure uses only the support of the probabilistic evolution;
it does not use precise numerical transition probabilities. We prove that the
winning set in the abstract 2.5-player game induces an under-approximation of
the qualitative winning region in the original synthesis problem, along with a
policy to solve it. By combining these contributions with (a) a symbolic
fixpoint algorithm to solve 2.5-player games and (b) existing techniques for
reachability policy synthesis in stochastic nonlinear systems, we get an
abstraction-based algorithm for finding a lower bound on the maximal
satisfaction probability. We have implemented the abstraction-based algorithm
in Mascot-SDS (Majumdar et al., 2020), where we combined the outlined
abstraction step with our recent tool FairSyn. We evaluated our implementation

the version number does not provide a good indication of the maturity of a

better understand the role of creativity in this field, we conducted four focus

apparent delay upon the end of the reverse martensitic transformation at field

martensite. As a consequence, the field hysteresis increases and higher fields
are required to saturate the transition. In contrast, no time-dependent effects

analysis of high-$z$ gas and dark matter (DM) filaments around a Milky Way-like
progenitor simulated with the {\sc ramses} adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code
from cosmic scales ($\sim$1 Mpc) down to the virial radius of its DM halo host
($\sim$20 kpc at $z=4$). Radial density profiles of both gas and DM filaments
are found to have the same functional form, namely a plummer-like profile
modified to take into account the wall within which these filaments are
embedded. Measurements of the typical filament core radius $r_0$ from the
simulation are consistent with that of isothermal cylinders in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Such an analytic model also predicts a redshift evolution for the
core radius of filaments in fair agreement with the measured value for DM $(r_0
\propto (1+z)^{-3.18\pm 0.28})$. Gas filament cores grow as $(r_0 \propto
(1+z)^{-2.72\pm 0.26})$. In both gas and DM, temperature and vorticity sharply
drop at the edge of filaments, providing an excellent way to constrain the
outer filament radius. When feedback is included the gas temperature and
vorticity fields are strongly perturbed, hindering such a measurement in the
vicinity of the galaxy. However, the core radius of the filaments as measured
from the gas density field is largely unaffected by feedback, and the median
central density is only reduced by about 20%.

port-based third-party DPI tools can suffer from limitations in efficiently

OpenFlow-enabled deep packet inspection (OFDPI) approach is proposed based on
the SDN paradigm to provide adaptive and efficient packet inspection. First,
OFDPI prescribes an early detection at the flow-level granularity by checking
the IP addresses of each new flow via OpenFlow protocols. Then, OFDPI allows
for deep packet inspection at the packet-level granularity: (i) for unencrypted
packets, OFDPI extracts the features of accessible payloads, including tri-gram
frequency based on Term Frequency and Inverted Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and
linguistic features. These features are concatenated into a sparse matrix
representation and are then applied to train a binary classifier with logistic
regression rather than matching with specific pattern combinations. In order to
balance the detection accuracy and performance bottleneck of the SDN
controller, OFDPI introduces an adaptive packet sampling window based on the
linear prediction; and (ii) for encrypted packets, OFDPI extracts notable
features of packets and then trains a binary classifier with a decision tree,
instead of decrypting the encrypted traffic to weaken user privacy. A prototype
of OFDPI is implemented on the Ryu SDN controller and the Mininet platform. The
performance and the overhead of the proposed sulotion are assessed using the
real-world datasets through experiments. The numerical results indicate that
OFDPI can provide a significant improvement in detection accuracy with
acceptable overheads.

using computationally-expensive spatial-temporal analysis, while falling short
in real-time verification of live video feeds. The recent work correlates
time-series camera and wireless signals to recognize replayed surveillance
videos using event-level timing information but it cannot realize fine-grained
forgery detection and localization on each frame. To fill this gap, this paper
proposes Secure-Pose, a novel cross-modal forgery detection and localization
system for live surveillance videos using WiFi signals near the camera spot. We
observe that coexisting camera and WiFi signals convey common human semantic
information and the presence of forgery attacks on video frames will decouple
such information correspondence. Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose
features from synchronized multi-modal signals and detects and localizes
forgery traces under both inter-frame and intra-frame attacks in each frame. We
implement Secure-Pose using a commercial camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and
evaluate it in real-world environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection
accuracy of 95.1% and can effectively localize tampered objects under different

local context with a relatively large receptive field. We evaluate the proposed

Penrose-Walker Killing spinor. Some of its properties, including associated
conservation laws, are discussed. Perturbations of Petrov type II Einstein
geometries in terms of a complex scalar Debye potential yield complex solutions
to the linearized Einstein equations. The complex linearized Weyl tensor is
shown to be half Petrov type N. The remaining curvature component on the
algebraically special side is reduced to a first order differential operator
acting on the potential.

the small rotation velocity by amplifying the phase shift of the Sagnac effect.
At the given the maximum incident intensity of the initial spectrum, the

micro-differences to identify centres of interest and attempts to understand

TeV. The beam is assumed to be unpolarized and fast detector simulation is
included. The signal process produces a fully hadronic final state through $
e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow AH\rightarrow b\bar{b}b\bar{b} $ where both CP-even and
CP-odd Higgs bosons ($H$ and $A$) are assumed to decay to a pair of $b$-jets.
Several benchmark scenarios are introduced as the baseline for the analysis
taking $ m_{H/A}$ in the range 150--300 GeV. In order to avoid Higgs boson
conversion $A \to ZH$, Higgs boson masses are chosen with $m_A-m_H < m_Z$. It
is shown that with a proper kinematic correction applied on final state $b$-jet

reconstruction of both Higgs bosons through $b\bar{b}$ invariant mass

whether similar conditions hold in other approaches to quantum gravity. In this
article, the asymptotic safety hypothesis is considered in the context of
eternal inflation. As exemplary inflationary models the SU(N) Yang-Mills in the
Veneziano limit and various RG-improvements of the gravitational action are
studied. The existence of UV fixed point generically flattens the potential and
our findings suggest no tension between eternal inflation and asymptotic
safety, both in the matter and gravitational sector in contradistinction to
string theory. Moreover, the eternal inflation cannot take place in the range
of applicability of effective field quantum gravity theory. We employ the
analytical relations for eternal inflation to some of the models with single
minima, such as Starobinsky inflation, alpha-attractors, or the RG-improved
models and verify them with the massive numerical simulations. The validity of
these constraints is also discussed for a multi-minima model.

color superconductivity (CSC) of the Yang-Mills theory with including the
higher derivative corrections which allow to study the CSC phase with the color
number $N_c\geq2$. First, we consider the CSC phase transition in the context
of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. We analyze the Cooper pair condensate
in the deconfinement and confinement phases which are dual to the planar
GB-RN-AdS black hole and GB-AdS soliton, respectively, where the backreaction
of the matter part is taken into account. By examining the breakdown of the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound in the background of the planar GB-RN-AdS black
hole, we find that the positive GB coupling parameter $\alpha>0$ leads to a
lower upper bound of the color number in comparison to Einstein gravity where
the CSC phase for $N_c\geq2$ is not realized. But, with the $\alpha<0$ case it
is possible to observe the Cooper pair condensate for $N_c\geq2$ with the
reasonable magnitude of $\alpha$. This is confirmed and the corresponding phase
diagram is found by solving numerically the equations of motion for the
gravitational system. In addition, we show that the CSC phase disappears in the
confinement phase for the magnitude of $\alpha$ below a certain value which
means that beyond that value it might lead to the breakdown region of the EGB
gravity in investigating the CSC phase. However, the CSC phase transition
occurring with $N_c\geq2$ requires the magnitude of the GB coupling parameter
to be rather large. As a result, the GB term would no longer be considered as
the correction and it also violates the boundary causality bound. We resolve
this problem by including additionally the higher derivative correction for the
Maxwell electrodynamics and the non-minimal coupled Maxwell field.

hearing aid users might be different, and if hearing aid users adapt their
self-motion because of the directional algorithm, its performance might
increase. In this work we therefore investigated the influence of hearing
impairment on self-motion, and the interaction of hearing aids with
self-motion. In order to do this, the self-motion of three hearing-impaired
(HI) participant groups, aided with an adaptive differential microphone (ADM),
aided without ADM, and unaided, was compared, also to previously measured
self-motion data from younger and older normal-hearing (NH) participants. The
self-motion was measured in virtual audiovisual environments (VEs) in the
laboratory. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and SNR improvement
of the ADM resulting from the head movements of the participants were estimated
with acoustic simulations. A strong effect of hearing impairment on self-motion
was found, which led to an overall increase in estimated SNR of 0.8 dB for the
HI participants compared to the NH participants, and differences in estimated
SNR improvement of the ADM. However, the self-motion of the HI participants
aided with ADM and the other HI participants was very similar, indicating that
they did not adapt their self-motion because of the ADM.

with subsystems making up the full system. Furthermore, various aspects of

consists of a sturdy vacuum enclosure mounted on a three-axis micropositioning

system is equipped with ultra-flexible radio frequency waveguides to
electrically actuate resonators. With it we characterize the lowest frequency
mode of a FLG resonator by measuring its frequency response as a function of
position on the membrane. The resonator is suspended over a nanofabricated
local gate electrode acting both as a mirror and as a capacitor plate to
actuate vibrations at radio frequencies. From these measurements, we estimate
the ratio of thermal expansion coefficient to thermal conductivity of the
membrane, and we measure the effective mass of the lowest frequency mode. We
complement our study with a globally gated resonator and image its first three
vibration modes. There, we find that folds in the membrane locally suppress
vibrations.

different character than those in large galaxies. They are modelled by a simple
pseudo iso-thermal model containing only two parameters that do not allow to
obtain insight into physics of the DM halo. We would like to obtain some
insight into the physical conditions in DM halos of dwarf galaxies by using a
simple physically based model of DM halos. In order to treat a diversity of the
dwarf galaxy velocity profiles in a unifying framework, we apply the polytropic
spheres characterised by the polytropic index $n$ and the relativistic
parameter $\sigma$ as a model of dwarf-galaxy DM halos and match the velocity
of circular geodesics of the polytropes to the velocity curves observed in the
dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS ensemble. We introduce three classes of
the LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies in accord with the polytrope models, due to
the different character of the velocity profile. The first class corresponds to
polytropes having $n < 1$ with linearly increasing velocity along with the
whole profile, the second class has $1 < n < 2$ and the velocity profile
becomes flat in the external region, the third class has $n > 2$ and the
velocity profile reaches a maximum and demonstrated a decline in the external
region. The $\sigma$ parameter has to be strongly non-relativistic ($\sigma <
10^{-8}$) for all dwarf galaxy models -- it varies for the models of each
class, but these variations have a negligible influence on the character of the
velocity profile. Our results indicate the possibility that at least two
different kinds of dark matter are behind the composition of DM halos. The
matches of the observational velocity curves are of the same quality as those
obtained by the pseudo-isothermal, core-like models of dwarf galaxy DM halos.

chaotic stream cipher and afterwards the encoded data is hidden behind an RGB

be used by the recipient to extract that bit-plane of the image. In fact, the

the monolithic structure and mostly static configuration of mobile application

  In this paper, we present REACT, a new Android-based framework that enables
apps to be developed as a collection of loosely coupled microservices (MS). It
allows individual distribution, dynamic management and offloading of MS to be
executed by services in the network, based on contextual changes. REACT aims to
provide i) a framework as an Android Library for creating MS-based apps that
adapt to contextual changes ii) a unified HTTP-based communication mechanism,
using Android Inter-Process Communication (IPC) for transporting requests
between locally running MS, while allowing flexible and transparent switching
between network and IPC requests, when offloading. We evaluate REACT by
implementing a video streaming app that dynamically offloads MS to web services

adaptability to contextual changes and reductions in power consumption when
offloading, while our communication mechanism overcomes performance limitations
of Android IPC by enabling efficient transferring of large payloads between

efficient high-resolution velocity model-building tool for seismic imaging,
with the unique ability to recover complex subsurface structures. Originally
based on a data fitting process using a least-squares cost function, it
suffered from high sensitivity to cycle-skipping and was therefore of poor
efficiency in handling large time shifts between observed and modelled seismic
events. To tackle this problem, a common practice is to start the inversion
using the low temporal frequencies of the data and selecting diving wave
events. Complementary to this, the use of other cost functions has been
investigated. Among these, cost functions based on optimal transport appeared
appealing to possibly handle large time shifts between seismic events. Several
strategies inspired by optimal transport have been proposed, taking into
account the specificities of seismic data. Among them, the approach based on
the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm offers the possibility of the direct use of
seismic data and an efficient numerical implementation allowing for a
multidimensional (data coordinate space) application.
  We present here an analysis of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, discussing
its theoretical and practical aspects. A key component of our analysis is the
back-propagated adjoint-source. We highlight its piecewise linearity, analyze
its frequency content and amplitude balancing. We also emphasize the benefit of

feature attribution methods help to explain black box models and are therefore
a powerful tool for assessing the reliability and fairness of predictions. To
this end, most attribution models compare the importance of input features with
a reference value, often called baseline. Recent studies show that the baseline
can heavily impact the quality of feature attributions. Yet, we frequently find
simplistic baselines, such as the zero vector, in practice. In this paper, we
show empirically that baselines can significantly alter the discriminative
power of feature attributions. We conduct our analysis on tabular data sets,
thus complementing recent works on image data. Besides, we propose a new
taxonomy of baseline methods. Our experimental study illustrates the
sensitivity of popular attribution models to the baseline, thus laying the
foundation for a more in-depth discussion on sensible baseline methods for

effects embedded in the waves of solar radio bursts. In this work, we perform
ray-tracing simulations on radio wave transport in the corona and
interplanetary region with anisotropic electron density fluctuations. For the
first time, the variation of the apparent source size, burst duration, and
source position of both fundamental emission and harmonic emission at frequency
35 MHz are simulated as the function of the anisotropic parameter $\alpha$ and
the angular scattering rate coefficient $\eta =\epsilon^2/h_0$, where
$\epsilon^2={\langle \delta n^2\rangle}/{n^2}$ is the density fluctuation level
and $h_0$ is its correlation length near the wave exciting site. It is found
that isotropic fluctuations produce a much larger decay time than a highly
anisotropic fluctuation for fundamental emission. By comparing the observed
duration and source size with the simulation results in the parameter space, we
can estimate the scattering coefficient and the anisotropy parameter $\eta =
8.9\times 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{km^{-1}}$ and $\alpha = 0.719$ with point pulse
source assumption. Position offsets due to wave scattering and refraction can
produce the co-spatial of fundamental and harmonic waves in observations of
some type III radio bursts. The visual speed due to the wave propagation effect
can reach 1.5\,$c$ for $\eta = 2.4\times 10^{-4}\, \mathrm{km^{-1}}$ and
$\alpha=0.2$ for fundamental emission in the sky plane, accompanying with large
expansion rate of the source size. The visual speed direction is mostly
identical to the offset direction, thus, for the observation aiming at
obtaining the source position, the source centroid at the starting point is
closer to the wave excitation point.

forgets the previously learned tasks when being retrained on new tasks.
Overcoming the forgetting problem is a major problem in machine learning.
Numerous continual learning algorithms are very successful in incremental
learning of classification tasks, where new samples with their labels appear
frequently. However, there is currently no research that addresses the
catastrophic forgetting problem in regression tasks as far as we know. This
problem has emerged as one of the primary constraints in some applications,
such as renewable energy forecasts. This article clarifies problem-related
definitions and proposes a new methodological framework that can forecast
targets and update itself by means of continual learning. The framework
consists of forecasting neural networks and buffers, which store newly
collected data from a non-stationary data stream in an application. The changed
probability distribution of the data stream, which the framework has
identified, will be learned sequentially. The framework is called CLeaR
(Continual Learning for Regression Tasks), where components can be flexibly
customized for a specific application scenario. We design two sets of
experiments to evaluate the CLeaR framework concerning fitting error
(training), prediction error (test), and forgetting ratio. The first one is
based on an artificial time series to explore how hyperparameters affect the
CLeaR framework. The second one is designed with data collected from European
wind farms to evaluate the CLeaR framework's performance in a real-world
application. The experimental results demonstrate that the CLeaR framework can
continually acquire knowledge in the data stream and improve the prediction
accuracy. The article concludes with further research issues arising from

particular, the user needs to select a sequence of tactics that lead to a
successful proof, a task that in general requires knowledge of the exact names
and use of a large set of tactics.
  We present Lassie, a tactic framework for the HOL4 theorem prover that allows
individual users to define their own tactic language by example and give
frequently used tactics or tactic combinations easier-to-remember names. The
core of Lassie is an extensible semantic parser, which allows the user to
interactively extend the tactic language through a process of definitional
generalization. Defining tactics in Lassie thus does not require any knowledge
in implementing custom tactics, while proofs written in Lassie retain the
correctness guarantees provided by the HOL4 system. We show through case
studies how Lassie can be used in small and larger proofs by novice and more
experienced interactive theorem prover users, and how we envision it to ease

introduce saliency subitizing as the weak supervision since it is
class-agnostic. This allows the supervision to be aligned with the property of
saliency detection, where the salient objects of an image could be from more
than one class. To this end, we propose a model with two modules, Saliency
Subitizing Module (SSM) and Saliency Updating Module (SUM). While SSM learns to
generate the initial saliency masks using the subitizing information, without
the need for any unsupervised methods or some random seeds, SUM helps
iteratively refine the generated saliency masks. We conduct extensive

step an autoregressive model is presented, which generates synthetic weekly
mobility schedules of individual occupants and thereby captures day to day
dependencies in mobility behavior. In a second step, an imputation model is
presented, which enriches the weekly mobility schedules with detailed
information about energy relevant at home activities. The weekly activity
profiles build the basis for modelling consistent electricity, heat and
mobility demand profiles of households. Furthermore, the approach presented
forms the basis for providing data on socio-demographically differentiated
occupant behavior to the general public.

eigenmodes of the system. Modal theories based on quasinormal modes provide a
natural tool to calculate and understand light scattering by nanoresonators. We
show that, in the case of resonators made of absorbing dielectric materials,
eigenmodes with zero eigenfrequency (static modes) play a key role in the modal
formalism. The excitation of static modes builds a non-resonant contribution to
the modal expansion of the scattered field. This non-resonant term plays a
crucial physical role since it largely contributes to the off-resonance signal
to which resonances are added in amplitude, possibly leading to interference
phenomena and Fano resonances. By considering light scattering by a silicon
nanosphere, we quantify the impact of static modes. This study shows that the
importance of static modes is not just formal. Modal expansions without static
modes reconstruct an incorrect internal field and incorrect extinction and
absorption cross-sections. Static modes are of prime importance in an expansion
truncated to only a few modes.

interest has led to remarkable advances in developing a theoretical

an agreement (consensus) or develop coordinated behavior, such as
synchronization. However, much less understood is the phenomenon of network
coherence. Network coherence generally refers to nodes' ability in a network to
have a similar dynamic response despite heterogeneity in their individual

the level of network coherence that a system exhibits by relating coherence
with a low-rank property of the system. More precisely, for a networked system
with linear dynamics and coupling, we show that, as the network connectivity
grows, the system transfer matrix converges to a rank-one transfer matrix
representing the coherent behavior. Interestingly, the non-zero eigenvalue of
such a rank-one matrix is given by the harmonic mean of individual nodal
dynamics, and we refer to it as the coherent dynamics. Our analysis unveils the
frequency-dependent nature of coherence and a non-trivial interplay between
dynamics and network topology. We further show that many networked systems can
exhibit similar coherent behavior by establishing a concentration result in a
setting with randomly chosen individual nodal dynamics.

approaches in a multilevel setting. This is relevant in many fields, for
example education with students nested into schools. The multilevel structure
raises peculiar issues related to the contextual effects and the distinction
between individual-level and cluster-level treatment. We derive approximate
analytical results and compare the two approaches by a simulation study. For an
individual-level treatment our findings are in line with the literature,
whereas for a cluster-level treatment we point out the key role of the cluster
mean of the pre-test score, which favors the conditioning approach in settings
with large clusters.

  conditional image generation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an arrange of two neural networks
-- the generator and the discriminator -- that are jointly trained to generate
artificial data, such as images, from random inputs. The quality of these
generated images has recently reached such levels that can often lead both
machines and humans into mistaking fake for real examples. However, the process
performed by the generator of the GAN has some limitations when we want to
condition the network to generate images from subcategories of a specific
class. Some recent approaches tackle this \textit{conditional generation} by
introducing extra information prior to the training process, such as image
semantic segmentation or textual descriptions. While successful, these
techniques still require defining beforehand the desired subcategories and
collecting large labeled image datasets representing them to train the GAN from
scratch. In this paper we present a novel and alternative method for guiding
generic non-conditional GANs to behave as conditional GANs. Instead of
re-training the GAN, our approach adds into the mix an encoder network to
generate the high-dimensional random input vectors that are fed to the
generator network of a non-conditional GAN to make it generate images from a
specific subcategory. In our experiments, when compared to training a
conditional GAN from scratch, our guided GAN is able to generate artificial
images of perceived quality comparable to that of non-conditional GANs after
training the encoder on just a few hundreds of images, which substantially
accelerates the process and enables adding new subcategories seamlessly.

Green's function in nonrelativistic quantum many-body theory with an emphasis
on normalization. By downfolding a correlation function covering all of Fock
space into the observable portion, we derive a nonlocal Dyson equation which
depends on an unknown downfolding frequency. The downfolding frequency is
determined by solving the inverse problem so that the spectral function of the
single-particle propagator is a Dirac-$\delta$ function. Upon measurement, the
system collapses stochastically onto one of these normalized solutions. This
collapse has a nonlocal effect on the path the particle takes, in agreement
with quantum entanglement. We postulate that the multiplicity of each quantized
solution is directly related to the ensemble averaged spectrum and the entropy
created by measurement of the particle.
  In the final part, we outline a new picture of dynamics in quantum many-body
systems. As a function of the coupling strength, the multiplicity for collapse
has a complicated form due to the shape of the quantization condition. This
structure creates an entropic force from counting quantized solutions which is
predominantly attractive but likely also has a narrow repulsive regime at weak
coupling. Upon collapse, an internal spacetime forms between the two points in
order to carry the information gained from the reduction of the probabilistic
many-body state. The repeated creation of these spacetime bridges defines an
internal spacetime with a complicated shape and history. We treat the quantum
system as a finite informational resource that holds information about possible
normalized outcomes, collapses the wave function to reset after encountering a
conflict, and creates an internal spacetime to carry the information gained
with every collapse.

problem of commensurate-incommensurate transitions into the focus of current
research. In 2D classical systems, or in 1D quantum systems, the commensurate
melting of a period-p phase with p larger than 4 is known to take place through
an intermediate floating phase where correlations between domain walls or
particles decay only as a power law, but when p is equal to 3 or 4, it has been
argued by Huse and Fisher that the transition could also be direct and
continuous in a non-conformal chiral universality class with a dynamical
exponent larger than 1. This is only possible however if the floating phase
terminates at a Lifshitz point before reaching the conformal point, a
possibility debated since then. Here we argue that this is a generic feature of
models where the number of particles is not conserved because the exponent of
the floating phase changes along the Pokrovsky-Talapov transition and can thus
reach the value at which the floating phase becomes unstable. Furthermore, we
show numerically that this scenario is realized in an effective model of the
period-3 phase of Rydberg chains in which hard-core bosons are created and
annihilated three by three: The Luttinger liquid parameter reaches the critical
value $p^2/8=9/8$ along the Pokrovsky-Talapov transition, leading to a Lifshitz
point that separates the floating phase from a chiral transition. Implications
beyond Rydberg atoms are briefly discussed.

nonlinearity in temporal dynamics as well as complex location-characterized
patterns in spatial domains, especially in fields like weather forecasting.
Graph convolutions are usually used for modeling the spatial dependency in
meteorology to handle the irregular distribution of sensors' spatial location.
In this work, a novel graph-based convolution for imitating the meteorological
flows is proposed to capture the local spatial patterns. Based on the
assumption of smoothness of location-characterized patterns, we propose
conditional local convolution whose shared kernel on nodes' local space is
approximated by feedforward networks, with local representations of coordinate
obtained by horizon maps into cylindrical-tangent space as its input. The
established united standard of local coordinate system preserves the
orientation on geography. We further propose the distance and orientation
scaling terms to reduce the impacts of irregular spatial distribution. The
convolution is embedded in a Recurrent Neural Network architecture to model the
temporal dynamics, leading to the Conditional Local Convolution Recurrent
Network (CLCRN). Our model is evaluated on real-world weather benchmark
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with obvious improvements. We
conduct further analysis on local pattern visualization, model's framework
choice, advantages of horizon maps and etc.

\cite{KM2019}.
  In this article, we discuss this equation without any restriction on $p$ and

macroscopic oscillation between the two sites, the critical parameter for the
dynamical macroscopic quantum self trapping (MQST), and the attractive critical
interaction strength for the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the ground

good agreement with the predictions of time-dependent ACS variational approach,

observations of SH - we perform a systematic study of the chemistry of
S-bearing hydrides. We determine their column densities using coupled
excitation, radiative transfer as well as chemical formation and destruction
models. We revise some of the key gas-phase reactions that lead to their
chemical synthesis. This includes ab initio quantum calculations of the
vibrational-state-dependent reactions SH+ + H2 <-> H2S+ + H and S + H2 <-> SH +
H. We find that reactions of UV-pumped H2 (v>1) with S+ explain the presence of
SH+ in a high thermal-pressure gas component, P_th~10^8 cm^-3 K, close to the
H2 dissociation front. However, subsequent hydrogen abstraction reactions of
SH+, H2S+, and S with vibrationally excited H2, fail to ultimately explain the
observed H2S column density (~2.5x10^14 cm^-2, with an ortho-to-para ratio of
2.9+/-0.3). To overcome these bottlenecks, we build PDR models that include a
simple network of grain surface reactions leading to the formation of solid H2S
(s-H2S). The higher adsorption binding energies of S and SH suggested by recent
studies imply that S atoms adsorb on grains (and form s-H2S) at warmer dust
temperatures and closer to the UV-illuminated edges of molecular clouds.
Photodesorption and, to a lesser extent, chemical desorption, produce roughly
the same H2S column density (a few 10^14 cm-^2) and abundance peak (a few
10^-8) nearly independently of n_H and G_0. This agrees with the observed H2S
column density in the Orion Bar as well as at the edges of dark clouds without
invoking substantial depletion of elemental sulfur abundances.

kept at an acceptably low level while TPR remains high. To this end, we propose
a two-tiered learning, called ``Echelon"", from raw byte data with no need for
hand-crafted features. The first tier locks FPR at a specified target level,
whereas the second tier improves TPR while maintaining the locked FPR. The core
of Echelon lies at extracting activation information of the hidden layers of
first tier model for constructing a stronger second tier model. Echelon is a

overcoming the internal energy losses by radiation. These results open up a new

are thought to be subject to viscous forces preventing them from rising
coherently. Numerous studies have suggested that MFRs require a minimum twist
in order to remain coherent during their rise. Furthermore, even MFRs that get
to the photosphere may be unable to successfully emerge into the corona unless
they are at least moderately twisted, since the magnetic pressure gradient
needs to overcome the weight of the photospheric plasma. To date, however, no
lower limit has been placed on the critical minimum twist required for an MFR
to rise coherently through the convection zone or emerge through the
photosphere. In this paper, we simulate an untwisted toroidal MFR which is able
to rise from the convection zone and emerge through the photosphere as an
active region that resembles those observed on the Sun. We show that untwisted
MFRs can remain coherent during their rise and then pile-up near the
photosphere, triggering the undular instability, allowing the MFR to emerge
through the photosphere. We propose that the toroidal geometry of our MFR is
critical for its coherent rise. Upon emerging, a pair of lobes rises into the
corona which interact and reconnect, resulting in a localized high speed jet.
The resulting photospheric magnetogram displays the characteristic
salt-and-pepper structure often seen in observations. Our major result is that
MFRs need not be twisted to rise coherently through the convection zone and
emerge through the photosphere.

structures observed by the worldwide experiments in the last two decades.
Hadronic molecules attract special attention because many of these seemingly
unconventional resonances are located close to the threshold of a pair of
hadrons. To give an overall feature of the spectrum of hadronic molecules
composed of a pair of heavy-antiheavy hadrons, namely, which pairs are possible
to form molecular states, we take charmed hadrons for example to investigate
the interaction between them and search for poles by solving the Bethe-Salpeter
equation. We consider all possible combinations of hadron pairs of the $S$-wave
singly-charmed mesons and baryons as well as the narrow $P$-wave charmed
mesons. The interactions, which are assumed to be meson-exchange saturated, are
described by constant contact terms which are resummed to generate poles. It
turns out that if a system is attractive near threshold by the light meson
exchange, there is a pole close to threshold corresponding to a bound state or
a virtual state, depending on the strength of interaction and the cutoff. In
total, 229 molecular states are predicted. The observed near-threshold
structures with hidden-charm, like the famous $X(3872)$ and $P_c$ states, fit
into the spectrum we obtain. We also highlight a $\Lambda_c\bar \Lambda_c$
bound state that has a pole consistent with the cross section of the

gravitational anomaly involving an exact $U(1)$ symmetry which is unique to KD
fields. Under this $U(1)$ symmetry the partition function transforms by a phase
depending only on the Euler character of the background space. Compactifying
flat space to a sphere we learn that the anomaly vanishes in odd dimensions but
breaks the symmetry down to $Z_4$ in even dimensions. This $Z_4$ is sufficient
to prohibit bilinear terms from arising in the fermionic effective action. Four
fermion terms are allowed but require multiples of two flavors of KD field. In
four dimensional flat space each KD field can be decomposed into four Dirac
spinors and hence these anomaly constraints ensure that eight Dirac fermions
or, for real representations, sixteen Majorana fermions are needed for a
consistent interacting theory. These constraints on fermion number agree with
known results for topological insulators and recent work on discrete anomalies
rooted in the Dai-Freed theorem. Our work suggests that KD fermions may offer
an independent path to understanding these constraints. Finally we point out
that this anomaly survives intact under discretization and hence is relevant in
understanding recent numerical results on lattice models possessing massive
symmetric phases.

equations for a `running' gravitational coupling, which is used to construct
examples non-perturbative potentials for the gravitational binding of two
particles. Model-I is based on the complete set of the relevant Feynman
diagrams. Its potential has a singularity at a distance below which it becomes
complex and the system gets black hole-like features. Model-II is based on a
reduced set of diagrams and its coupling approaches a non-Gaussian fixed point
as the distance is reduced. Energies and eigenfunctions are obtained and used
in a study of time-dependent collapse (model-I) and bouncing (both models) of a
spherical wave packet. The motivation for such non-perturbative `toy' models
stems from a desire to elucidate the mass dependence of binding energies found
25 years ago in an explorative numerical simulation within the dynamical
triangulation approach to quantum gravity. Models I \& II suggest indeed an
explanation of this mass dependence, in which the Schwarzschild scale plays a
role. An estimate of the renormalized Newton coupling is made by matching with
the small-mass region. Comparison of the dynamical triangulation results for
mass renormalization with `renormalized perturbation theory' in the continuum
leads to an independent estimate of this coupling, which is used in an improved
analysis of the binding energy data.

in security-sensitive scenarios. Most existing black-box attacks fool the
target model by interacting with it many times and producing global
perturbations. However, global perturbations change the smooth and
insignificant background, which not only makes the perturbation more easily be
perceived but also increases the query overhead. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework to perturb the discriminative areas of clean examples only
within limited queries in black-box attacks. Our framework is constructed based
on two types of transferability. The first one is the transferability of model
interpretations. Based on this property, we identify the discriminative areas
of a given clean example easily for local perturbations. The second is the
transferability of adversarial examples. It helps us to produce a local
pre-perturbation for improving query efficiency. After identifying the
discriminative areas and pre-perturbing, we generate the final adversarial
examples from the pre-perturbed example by querying the targeted model with two
kinds of black-box attack techniques, i.e., gradient estimation and random
search. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our framework can
significantly improve the query efficiency during black-box perturbing with a
high attack success rate. Experimental results show that our attacks outperform
state-of-the-art black-box attacks under various system settings.

solved with 2-EXPTIME complexity when the input automata are without guessing
and unambiguous, improving on the currently best-known 2-EXPSPACE upper bound
by Mottet and Quaas. When the number of registers of both automata is fixed, we
obtain a lower EXPTIME complexity, also improving the EXPSPACE upper bound from
Mottet and Quaas for fixed number of registers. We reduce inclusion to
universality, and then we reduce universality to the problem of counting the
number of orbits of runs of the automaton. We show that the orbit-counting
function satisfies a system of bidimensional linear recursive equations with
polynomial coefficients (linrec), which generalises analogous recurrences for
the Stirling numbers of the second kind, and then we show that universality
reduces to the zeroness problem for linrec sequences. While such a counting
approach is classical and has successfully been applied to unambiguous finite
automata and grammars over finite alphabets, its application to register
automata over infinite alphabets is novel. We provide two algorithms to decide
the zeroness problem for bidimensional linear recursive sequences arising from
orbit-counting functions. Both algorithms rely on techniques from linear
non-commutative algebra. The first algorithm performs variable elimination and
has elementary complexity. The second algorithm is a refined version of the
first one and it relies on the computation of the Hermite normal form of
matrices over a skew polynomial field. The second algorithm yields an EXPTIME
decision procedure for the zeroness problem of linrec sequences, which in turn
yields the claimed bounds for the universality and inclusion problems of
register automata.

registration that removes the need to tune important registration
hyperparameters during training. Classical registration methods solve an
optimization problem to find a set of spatial correspondences between two
images, while learning-based methods leverage a training dataset to learn a
function that generates these correspondences. The quality of the results for
both types of techniques depends greatly on the choice of hyperparameters.
Unfortunately, hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and typically involves
training many separate models with various hyperparameter values, potentially
leading to suboptimal results. To address this inefficiency, we introduce
amortized hyperparameter learning for image registration, a novel strategy to
learn the effects of hyperparameters on deformation fields. The proposed
framework learns a hypernetwork that takes in an input hyperparameter and
modulates a registration network to produce the optimal deformation field for
that hyperparameter value. In effect, this strategy trains a single, rich model
that enables rapid, fine-grained discovery of hyperparameter values from a
continuous interval at test-time. We demonstrate that this approach can be used
to optimize multiple hyperparameters considerably faster than existing search
strategies, leading to a reduced computational and human burden as well as
increased flexibility. We also show several important benefits, including
increased robustness to initialization and the ability to rapidly identify
optimal hyperparameter values specific to a registration task, dataset, or even
a single anatomical region, all without retraining the HyperMorph model. Our
code is publicly available at http://voxelmorph.mit.edu.

depicted in evolution space versus time then it corresponds to the direction of

causation, if the vector is closely parallel to that of the ultimate causation
then the changes will confer desirable attributes which will lead to further
development. If however the variations do not occur in a direction close to the
of the ultimate causation vector the evolved organism will quickly die out.
This may be viewed as similar to Feynmans sum over all histories. Therefore,
the principle of least action gives a direction, but not a purpose, to
evolution. Taking the coevolution model of Lewontin, an equation of motion for
coevolution shows that it is the rate of evolutionary change that responds to
changes in the environment, in line with some evidence. In the face of widely

greater than 5 cannot, in most cases, be solved by radicals. Due of this
theorem we will present a formula that solves specific cases of sixth degree
equations using Martinellis polynomial as a base. To better understand how this
formula works, we will solve a sixth degree equation as an example. We will
also see that all sixth degree equations that meet the coefficient criterion
have a resolvent of fifth degree that can be splitted into a second degree and
a third degree equation. Throughout the paper we will see a demonstration of
the ratio of the coefficients of a sixth degree equation that can be solved
with the formula that will be presented this paper

longitudinal background flow. We study resonant absorption of the kink and
sausage modes in the slow continuum under magnetic pore conditions in the
presence of flow. we determine the dispersion relation then solve it
numerically, and find the frequencies and damping rates of the slow kink and
sausage surface modes. We also, obtain analytical solution for the damping rate
of the slow surface mode in the long wavelength limit. We show that in the
presence of plasma flow, resonance absorption can result in strong damping for
forward waves and can be considered as an efficient mechanism to justify the
extremely rapid damping of slow surface sausage waves observed in magnetic
pores. Also, the plasma flow reduces the efficiency of resonance absorption to
damp backward waves. Furthermore, for the pore conditions, the resonance
instability is avoided in our model.

event data. These data are often recorded by information systems and are widely
available. However, they often contain sensitive private information that
should be analyzed responsibly. Therefore, privacy issues in process mining are
recently receiving more attention. Privacy preservation techniques obviously
need to modify the original data, yet, at the same time, they are supposed to
preserve the data utility. Privacy-preserving transformations of the data may
lead to incorrect or misleading analysis results. Hence, new infrastructures
need to be designed for publishing the privacy-aware event data whose aim is to
provide metadata regarding the privacy-related transformations on event data
without revealing details of privacy preservation techniques or the protected
information. In this paper, we provide formal definitions for the main
anonymization operations, used by privacy models in process mining. These are
used to create an infrastructure for recording the privacy metadata. We
advocate the proposed privacy metadata in practice by designing a privacy
extension for the XES standard and a general data structure for event data
which are not in the form of standard event logs.

noted that the six degrees of freedom (DOF) motions of the moving platform of
the CDPR, namely, the base of the PSW, and the three-DOF motion of the PSW are
actuated by means of eight actuators fixed to the base. As a consequence, the
overall system is underactuated and its total mass and inertia in motion is

range of motor and cognitive symptoms. PD diagnosis is a challenging task since
its symptoms are very similar to other diseases such as normal ageing and
essential tremor. Much research has been applied to diagnosing this disease.
This project aims to automate the PD diagnosis process using deep learning,
Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to
differentiate between healthy and PD patients. Besides that, since different
datasets may capture different aspects of this disease, this project aims to
explore which PD test is more effective in the discrimination process by
analysing different imaging and movement datasets (notably cube and spiral
pentagon datasets). In addition, this project evaluates which dataset type,
imaging or time series, is more effective in diagnosing PD.

  Multi-Channel EEG Data",,,,,"q-bio.NC stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder affecting more than 50 million
people globally. An epileptic seizure acts like a temporary shock to the
neuronal system, disrupting normal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy
is frequently diagnosed with electroencephalograms (EEGs). Current methods
study the time-varying spectra and coherence but do not directly model changes
in extreme behavior. Thus, we propose a new approach to characterize brain
connectivity based on the joint tail behavior of the EEGs. Our proposed method,
the conditional extremal dependence for brain connectivity (Conex-Connect), is
a pioneering approach that links the association between extreme values of
higher oscillations at a reference channel with the other brain network
channels. Using the Conex-Connect method, we discover changes in the extremal
dependence driven by the activity at the foci of the epileptic seizure. Our
model-based approach reveals that, pre-seizure, the dependence is notably
stable for all channels when conditioning on extreme values of the focal
seizure area. Post-seizure, by contrast, the dependence between channels is
weaker, and dependence patterns are more ""chaotic"". Moreover, in terms of
spectral decomposition, we find that high values of the high-frequency
Gamma-band are the most relevant features to explain the conditional extremal
dependence of brain connectivity.

wear of cobalt-based interfaces at high temperature. The studied contact is a
cobalt-based alloy subjected to fretting against an alumina sample. At high
temperature, a protective third body is spontaneously created at the interface
and presents excellent tribological properties. The formation of the so-called
''glaze layer'' leads to an absence of wear. The investigation presents on
complete description of the hightemperature tribolayer with microstructural,
chemical and mechanical characterizations. The glaze layer regime is mainly
related to a threshold temperature above which a thin cobalt-rich layer is
formed by a tribo-sintering process. A formalization of the tribo-sintering
process is proposed to predict the necessary number of fretting cycles N GL to
form the glaze layer. The tribo-sintering process prevents wear debris ejection
by continuously re-incorporating the wear debris particles in the glaze layer.
The re-incorporation of the wear debris may be the reason for the absence of
wear of the fretted interface from a macroscopic point of view. Finally, the
paper presents an extended friction energy wear approach taking into account
tribo-oxidation and tribo-sintering considerations. The formulation is able to
predict wear for a large range of tribological parameters (temperature,
frequency, sliding amplitude, number of cycles), when applied to the
Co-based/alumina contact.

fretting cycles and contact area. evolution is formalized using a power law
formulation which allowed predicting wear transitions for plain and
