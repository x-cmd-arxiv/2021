the class, we can compute the diameter faster than in ${\cal O}(nm)$ time is an
important research problem both in theory and in practice. We here make a new
step in this direction, for some metrically defined graph classes.
Specifically, a subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is called a retract of $G$ if it is
the image of some idempotent endomorphism of $G$. Two necessary conditions for
$H$ being a retract of $G$ is to have $H$ is an isometric and isochromatic
subgraph of $G$. We say that $H$ is an absolute retract of some graph class
${\cal C}$ if it is a retract of any $G \in {\cal C}$ of which it is an
isochromatic and isometric subgraph. In this paper, we study the complexity of
computing the diameter within the absolute retracts of various hereditary graph
classes. First, we show how to compute the diameter within absolute retracts of
bipartite graphs in randomized $\tilde{\cal O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time. For the
special case of chordal bipartite graphs, it can be improved to linear time,
and the algorithm even computes all the eccentricities. Then, we generalize
these results to the absolute retracts of $k$-chromatic graphs, for every fixed
$k \geq 3$. Finally, we study the diameter problem within the absolute retracts
of planar graphs and split graphs, respectively.

constructed from sparse Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with a limited number of

DAG can be used to devise fast algorithms for posterior sampling of the latent

life, the issue of fairness in recommendation is becoming more and more
important. Most of the prior approaches to fairness-aware recommendation have
been situated in a static or one-shot setting, where the protected groups of
items are fixed, and the model provides a one-time fairness solution based on
fairness-constrained optimization. This fails to consider the dynamic nature of
the recommender systems, where attributes such as item popularity may change
over time due to the recommendation policy and user engagement. For example,
products that were once popular may become no longer popular, and vice versa.
As a result, the system that aims to maintain long-term fairness on the item
exposure in different popularity groups must accommodate this change in a
timely fashion.
  Novel to this work, we explore the problem of long-term fairness in
recommendation and accomplish the problem through dynamic fairness learning. We
focus on the fairness of exposure of items in different groups, while the
division of the groups is based on item popularity, which dynamically changes
over time in the recommendation process. We tackle this problem by proposing a
fairness-constrained reinforcement learning algorithm for recommendation, which
models the recommendation problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP), so that the model can dynamically adjust its recommendation policy to
make sure the fairness requirement is always satisfied when the environment
changes. Experiments on several real-world datasets verify our framework's
superiority in terms of recommendation performance, short-term fairness, and
long-term fairness.

equation. In classical PDF closure models, a stochastic differential equation
has to be modeled and solved to obtain samples of turbulent quantities. The
NF-PDF closure model allows for direct sampling from the underlying probability
density functions of fluctuating turbulent quantities, such that
ensemble-averaged quantities can then be computed. To illustrate this approach
we demonstrate an application for the canonical case of homogeneous shear

built over the Dunn-Belnap four-valued semantics in terms of the communication
of information in a network of sites of knowledge production (laboratories).
The knowledge communicated concerns experimental data and the regularities
tested using it. There have been many nods to interpretations similar to ours -
for example, in Dunn (1976), Belnap (1977). The laboratory interpretation was
outlined in Bilkova et al. (2010).
  Our system is built on the Routley--Meyer semantics for relevant logic
equipped with a four-valued valuation of formulas, where labs stand in for
situations, and the four values reflect the complexity of assessing results of
experiments. This semantics avoids using the Routley star, on the cost of
introducing a further relation, required in evaluating falsity assignments of
implication. We can however provide a natural interpretation of two
accessibility relations - confirmation and refutation of hypotheses are two
independent processes in our laboratory setup. This setup motivates various
basic properties of the accessibility relations, as well as a number of other
possible restrictions. This gives us a flexible modular system which can be
adjusted to specific epistemic contexts.
  As perfect regularities are rarely, or perhaps never, actually observed, we
add probabilities to the logical framework. As our logical framework is
non-classical, the probability is non-classical as well, satisfying a weaker
version of Kolmogorov axioms (cf. Priest 2006). We show that these
probabilities allow for a relative frequency as well as for a subjective
interpretation (we provide a Dutch book argument). We further show how to
update the probabilities and to distinguish conditional probabilities from the

main challenges is the strengthening of waves as they move radially inward
towards the origin, especially under the self-consistent gravitational field
for gaseous stars. A fundamental unsolved problem is whether the density of the
global solution forms concentration to become a delta measure at the origin. To
solve this problem, we develop a new approach for the construction of
approximate solutions as the solutions of an appropriately formulated free
boundary problem for the compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with a
carefully adapted class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms, so
that a rigorous convergence proof of the approximate solutions to the
corresponding global solution of the compressible Euler-Poisson equations with
large initial data of spherical symmetry can be obtained. Even though the
density may blow up near the origin at certain time, it is proved that no
concentration (delta measure) is formed in the vanishing viscosity limit for
the finite-energy solutions of the compressible Euler-Poisson equations for
both gaseous stars and plasmas in the physical regimes under consideration.

consider two cases regarding the class of lead-time quotation policies, i.e.,

It fills the void of wireless resource allocation for multiple simultaneous FL

allocation framework comprising \emph{intra-service} resource allocation and
\emph{inter-service} resource allocation. The intra-service resource allocation
problem aims to minimize the length of FL rounds by optimizing the bandwidth
allocation among the clients of each FL service. Based on this, an
inter-service resource allocation problem is further considered, which
distributes bandwidth resources among multiple simultaneous FL services. We
consider both cooperative and selfish providers of the FL services. For
cooperative FL service providers, we design a distributed bandwidth allocation
algorithm to optimize the overall performance of multiple FL services,
meanwhile cater to the fairness among FL services and the privacy of clients.
For selfish FL service providers, a new auction scheme is designed with the FL
service owners as the bidders and the network provider as the auctioneer. The
designed auction scheme strikes a balance between the overall FL performance
and fairness. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms
outperform other benchmarks under various network conditions.

for SS Aur gives to a higher temperature $\sim 33,375 \pm 1875 $~K, yielding to
a higher WD mass $\sim 1 \pm 0.25 M_{\odot}$, which could be due to the effect
of a second hot emitting component present in the short wavelengths of FUSE.
Most importantly, based on the white dwarf far ultraviolet absorption lines, we
find that both systems have subsolar carbon and silicon abundances. For TU Men
we also find suprasolar nitrogen abundance, evidence of CNO processing.

time scales with strong electric fields enable studying the nonperturbative
optical response and Bloch bands' topological properties, originated from
Berry's trilogy: connection, curvature, and phase. This letter introduces a
theoretical framework for the nonperturbative electron dynamics in
two-dimensional (2D) crystalline solids induced by the few-cycle and
strong-field optical lasers. In the presented model, the expression associated
with the Bloch band topology and broken crystal symmetry merges
self-consistently in the system observables such as High Harmonic Generation
(HHG). This singles out our work from recent HHG calculations from the
strongly-driven systems. Concisely, in our theoretical experiment on 2D
materials in the strong-field optical regime, we show that Bloch band topology
and broken symmetry manifest themselves in several ways: the momentum-resolved
attosecond interferometry of electron wave packets, anomalous and chiral
velocity in both intraband and interband dynamics, anomalous Hall current and
respective HHG highly sensitive to the laser waveform, multiple plateau-cutoff
structures in both longitudinal and transverse HHG, the formation of even
harmonics in the perpendicular polarization with respect to the driving laser,
singular jumps across the phase diagram of the HHG, attosecond chirp, and
ultrafast valley polarization induced by the chiral gauge field that is robust
to lattice imperfections and scattering. The link between HHG and solid-state
band geometry offers an all-optical reconstruction of electron band structure
by optical means, and accelerates studies on the non-equilibrium Floquet
engineering, topologically-protected nonlinear spin and edge currents,
valleytronics, quantum computing and high-temperature superconductivity on
sub-femtosecond time scales.

decision maker has to choose between $N$ services to host at the edge to
satisfy the demands of customers. Our goal is to design adaptive algorithms to
minimize the average service delivery latency for customers. We pose the
problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the system state is given
by describing, for each service, the number of customers that are currently
waiting at the edge to obtain the service. However, solving this $N$-services
MDP is computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. To
overcome this challenge, we show that the optimal policy for a single-service
MDP has an appealing threshold structure, and derive explicitly the Whittle
indices for each service as a function of the number of requests from customers
based on the theory of Whittle index policy.
  Since request arrival and service delivery rates are usually unknown and
possibly time-varying, we then develop efficient learning augmented algorithms
that fully utilize the structure of optimal policies with a low learning
regret. The first of these is UCB-Whittle, and relies upon the principle of
optimism in the face of uncertainty. The second algorithm, Q-learning-Whittle,
utilizes Q-learning iterations for each service by using a two time scale

UCB-Whittle by analyzing its learning regret, and also analyze the convergence
properties of Q-learning-Whittle. Simulation results show that the proposed

Maxwell-like equations and the energy-momentum tensor conservation are
presented and discussed in their generality. We next expand the fields around a

external magnetic fields. This yields constraints that relate the derivatives

the Universe as a mechanism for primordial magnetic fields amplification. We
assume the presence of a charged spectator scalar field arbitrarily coupled to
gravity during Inflation in its vacuum de Sitter state. Gravitational particle
creation takes place at the transition from Inflation to the subsequent
Reheating stage and thus the vacuum field state becomes an excited many
particles one. Consequently this state can be described as a real fluid, and we
build out the hydrodynamic framework using second order theories for
relativistic fluids with a relaxation time prescription for the collision
integral. Given the high-temperature regime and the vanishing scalar curvature
of the Universe during Reheating (radiation-dominated-type era), the fluid can
be regarded as a conformal one. The large quantum fluctuations induced by the
rapid transition from inflationary to effectively radiation dominated expansion
become statistical fluctuations whereby both a charge excess and anisotropic
pressures are produced in any finite domain. The precise magnitude of the
effect for each scale is determined by the size of the averaging domain and the
coupling to curvature. We look at domains which are larger than the horizon at
the beginning of Reheating, but much smaller than our own horizon, and show
that in a finite fraction of them the anisotropy and charge excess provide
suitable conditions for a Weibel instability. If moreover the duration of
reheating is shorter than the relaxation time of the fluid, then this
instability can compensate or even overcome the conformal dilution of a
primordial magnetic field. We show that the non-trivial topology of the
magnetic field encoded in its magnetic helicity is also amplified if present.

cardinality of the generating set, they are, up to isomorphisms, unique, and
equal to algebras of terms (or propositional formulas, in the context of

extend to multialgebras. Not only multialgebras satisfying the universal

from a multialgebra of terms to another multialgebra, and a collection of

corresponds a unique homomorphism, which ressembles the universal mapping

preferentially happens along the magnetic field, while is suppressed across it.
However, most of the information about the coronal heating is derived from
analysis of EUV or soft X-ray emissions, which are not explicitly sensitive to
the magnetic field. This paper employs another electromagnetic channel -- the

variants of SSPPR: (i) high-precision queries and (ii) approximate queries. For
high-precision queries, Power Iteration (PowItr) and Forward Push (FwdPush) are
two fundamental approaches. Given an absolute error threshold $\lambda$, the
only known bound of FwdPush is $O(\frac{m}{\lambda})$, much worse than the $O(m
\log \frac{1}{\lambda})$-bound of PowItr. Whether FwdPush can achieve the same
running time bound as PowItr does still remains an open question in the
research community. We give a positive answer to this question by showing that
the running time of a common implementation of FwdPush is actually bounded by
$O(m \cdot \log \frac{1}{\lambda})$.Based on this finding, we propose a new
algorithm, called Power Iteration with Forward Push (PowerPush), which
incorporates the strengths of both PowItr and FwdPush. For approximate queries
(with a relative error $\epsilon$), we propose a new algorithm, called
SpeedPPR, with overall expected time bounded by $O(n \cdot \log n \cdot \log
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ on scale-free graphs. This bound greatly improves the
$O(\frac{n \cdot \log n}{\epsilon})$ bound of a state-of-the-art algorithm
FORA.

systems is a challenging task, requiring the modeling of complex nonlinear
relationships among HVAC load, indoor temperatures, and outdoor environments.
This paper proposes a new strategy for optimal operation of an HVAC system in a
commercial building. The system for indoor temperature control is divided into
three sub-systems, each of which is modeled using an artificial neural network
(ANN). The ANNs are then interconnected and integrated into an optimization
problem for temperature set-point scheduling. The problem is reformulated to
determine the optimal set-points using a deterministic search algorithm. After
the optimal scheduling is initiated, the ANNs undergo online learning
repeatedly, mitigating the overfitting. Case studies are performed to analyze
the performance of the proposed strategy, compared to the strategies with a
pre-determined temperature set-point, an ideal physics-based building model,
and conventional ANN-based building models. The case study results confirm that
the proposed strategy is effective in terms of the HVAC energy cost, practical
applicability, and training data requirement.

embeddings with self-attentive neural networks. To better model complex feature
interaction, in this paper we propose a novel DisentanglEd Self-atTentIve
NEtwork (DESTINE) framework for CTR prediction that explicitly decouples the
computation of unary feature importance from pairwise interaction.
Specifically, the unary term models the general importance of one feature on
all other features, whereas the pairwise interaction term contributes to
learning the pure impact for each feature pair. We conduct extensive
experiments using two real-world benchmark datasets. The results show that
DESTINE not only maintains computational efficiency but achieves consistent
improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

  kinetics","32 pages, 10 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For predicting the kinetics of nucleic acid reactions, continuous-time Markov
chains (CTMCs) are widely used. The rate of a reaction can be obtained through
the mean first passage time (MFPT) of its CTMC. However, a typical issue in
CTMCs is that the number of states could be large, making MFPT estimation
challenging, particularly for events that happen on a long time scale (rare
events). We propose the pathway elaboration method, a time-efficient
probabilistic truncation-based approach for detailed-balance CTMCs. It can be
used for estimating the MFPT for rare events in addition to rapidly evaluating
perturbed parameters without expensive recomputations. We demonstrate that
pathway elaboration is suitable for predicting nucleic acid kinetics by
conducting computational experiments on 267 measurements that cover a wide
range of rates for different types of reactions. We utilize pathway elaboration
to gain insight on the kinetics of two contrasting reactions, one being a rare
event. We then compare the performance of pathway elaboration with the
stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) for MFPT estimation on 237 of the
reactions for which SSA is feasible. We further build truncated CTMCs with SSA
and transition path sampling (TPS) to compare with pathway elaboration.
Finally, we use pathway elaboration to rapidly evaluate perturbed model
parameters during optimization with respect to experimentally measured rates
for these 237 reactions. The testing error on the remaining 30 reactions, which
involved rare events and were not feasible to simulate with SSA, improved
comparably with the training error. Our framework and dataset are available at

Furthermore, we investigate how these perceptions and expectations change as

quasi-persistent X-ray transients is affected by predictions of the strength of
neutrino cooling via crust Urca processes. The strength of crust Urca neutrino
cooling depends sensitively on the electron-capture and $\beta$-decay
ground-state to ground-state transition strengths of neutron-rich rare
isotopes. Nuclei with mass number $A=61$ are predicted to be among the most
abundant in accreted crusts, and the last remaining experimentally undetermined
ground-state to ground-state transition strength was the $\beta$-decay of
$^{61}$V. This work reports the first experimental determination of this
transition strength, a ground-state branching of 8.1$^{+2.2}_{-2.0} \%$,
corresponding to a log $ft$ value of 5.5$^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$. This result was
achieved through the measurement of the $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ rays using the
total absorption spectrometer SuN and the measurement of the $\beta$-delayed
neutron branch using the neutron long counter system NERO at the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. This method
helps to mitigate the impact of the Pandemonium effect in extremely
neutron-rich nuclei on experimental results. The result implies that $A=61$
nuclei do not provide the strongest cooling in accreted neutron star crusts as
expected by some predictions, but that their cooling is still larger compared
to most other mass numbers. Only nuclei with mass numbers 31, 33, and 55 are
predicted to be cooling more strongly. However, the theoretical predictions for
the transition strengths of these nuclei are not consistently accurate enough
to draw conclusions on crust cooling. With the experimental approach developed
in this work all relevant transitions are within reach to be studied in the
future.

various transient events like supernovae (SNe). Although the common envelope
(CE) in a binary, outcomes of the CE and conditions for the SN explosion during
the CE phase are uncertain, it has been suggested that SN explosions can be
triggered during the CE phase. In this work, we explore formation and evolution
routes of carbon/oxygen (CO) WDs binaries in order to investigate mergers of CO
WDs and cores of non-degenerate stars during the CE phase as possible origins
for SNe under the core merger detonation (CMD) scenario by considering several
binary physical models. Evolution of CO WD + intermediate mass normal
(non-degenerate and hydrogen-rich) star binaries lead to mergers during the CE
phases still may trigger type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) interacting with circumstellar
material under different models. Mergers between CO WDs and cores of He
(non-degenerate and helium-rich) stars within the CE phases are rare comparing
to other CE merger events. These two channels may produce peculiar SNe Ia such
as over-luminous/super-chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia as certain fraction of them
have combined core masses $\geq2M_\odot$. In the channel of CO WD + massive
star ($\geq8M_\odot$) CE events, we find that rates of mergers between CO WDs
and He cores of massive stars are (0.85 - 12.18)$\times10^{-5}{M_\odot}^{-1}$
which may initiate type II superluminous SNe like SN 2006gy, and delay times
from this scenario are in the range of 34 - 120 Myr. Our results based on the
CMD model are comparable with observational results of peculiar SNe.

reliability assessment and failure predictions of highly reliable product
units. The degradation performance measurements over time are highly
heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity can be partially attributed to external
factors, such as accelerated/environmental conditions, and can also be
attributed to internal factors, such as material microstructure characteristics
of product units. The latent heterogeneity due to the unobserved/unknown
factors shared within each product unit may also exists and need to be
considered as well. Existing degradation models often fail to consider (i) the
influence of both external accelerated/environmental conditions and internal
material information, (ii) the influence of unobserved/unknown factors within
each unit. In this work, we propose a generic degradation performance modeling
framework with mixed-type covariates and latent heterogeneity to account for
both influences of observed internal and external factors as well as unobserved
factors. Effective estimation algorithm is also developed to jointly quantify
the influences of mixed-type covariates and individual latent heterogeneity,
and also to examine the potential interaction between mixed-type covariates.
Functional data analysis and data augmentation techniques are employed to
address a series of estimation issues. A real case study is further provided to
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over several
alternative modeling approaches. Besides, the proposed degradation performance
modeling framework also provides interpretable findings.

galaxies (SMGs) at $z=1.0\sim3.2$ with an angular resolution of $\sim0.2$"".
These galaxies were uncovered by the Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS), and feature
exceptionally bright far-infrared continuum emission ($S_\mathrm{peak} \gtrsim
90$ mJy) owing to their lensing magnification. We detect 29 sources in 20
fields of massive galaxy clusters with ALMA. Using both the Spitzer/IRAC
(3.6/4.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) and ALMA data, we have successfully modeled the
surface brightness profiles of 26 sources in the rest-frame near- and
far-infrared. Similar to previous studies, we find the median dust-to-stellar
continuum size ratio to be small ($R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star} =
0.38\pm0.14$) for the observed SMGs, indicating that star formation is
centrally concentrated. This is, however, not the case for two spatially
extended main-sequence SMGs with a low surface brightness at 1.3 mm ($\lesssim
0.1$ mJy arcsec$^{-2}$), in which the star formation is distributed over the
entire galaxy ($R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star}>1$). As a whole, our SMG
sample shows a tight anti-correlation between
($R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star}$) and far-infrared surface brightness
($\Sigma_\mathrm{IR}$) over a factor of $\simeq$ 1000 in $\Sigma_\mathrm{IR}$.
This indicates that SMGs with less vigorous star formation (i.e., lower
$\Sigma_\mathrm{IR}$) lack central starburst and are likely to retain a broader
spatial distribution of star formation over the whole galaxies (i.e., larger
$R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star}$). The same trend can be reproduced with
cosmological simulations as a result of central starburst and potentially
subsequent ""inside-out"" quenching, which likely accounts for the emergence of
compact quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$.

machine learning-based methods, which are capable of yielding accurate
remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for industrial equipment or components
without exploring the degradation mechanism. A prerequisite ensuring the
success of these methods depends on a wealth of run-to-failure data, however,
run-to-failure data may be insufficient in practice. That is, conducting a
substantial amount of destructive experiments not only is high costs, but also
may cause catastrophic consequences. Out of this consideration, an enhanced RUL
framework focusing on data self-generation is put forward for both non-cyclic
and cyclic degradation patterns for the first time. It is designed to enrich
data from a data-driven way, generating realistic-like time-series to enhance
current RUL methods. First, high-quality data generation is ensured through the
proposed convolutional recurrent generative adversarial network (CR-GAN), which
adopts a two-channel fusion convolutional recurrent neural network. Next, a
hierarchical framework is proposed to combine generated data into current RUL
estimation methods. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is verified
through both non-cyclic and cyclic degradation systems. With the enhanced RUL
framework, an aero-engine system following non-cyclic degradation has been
tested using three typical RUL models. State-of-art RUL estimation results are
achieved by enhancing capsule network with generated time-series. Specifically,
estimation errors evaluated by the index score function have been reduced by
21.77%, and 32.67% for the two employed operating conditions, respectively.
Besides, the estimation error is reduced to zero for the Lithium-ion battery
system, which presents cyclic degradation.

specific advantage of the proposed CAMM is that it requires no explicit

show the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of CAMM for modeling
non-Gaussian data including fat-tailed and/or skewed distributions. Finally,
the model is applied to crime data to examine the empirical performance of the
regression analysis and prediction. The result shows that CAMM provides
intuitively reasonable coefficient estimates and outperforms AMM in terms of
prediction accuracy. CAMM is verified to be a fast and flexible model that
potentially covers a wide variety of non-Gaussian data modeling. The proposed

$\gamma=c(H)(1-C\frac{\delta^{2}}{H^{2}})$, where $C$ is a constant independent
of the mesh size $h$ and the diameter of subdomains $H$, $\delta$ is the
overlapping size among the subdomains, and $c(H)$ decreasing as $H\to 0$, which
means the greater the number of subdomains, the better the convergence rate.

relationship between online and in-store shopping, national-level modeling and
investigation of the demand for online shopping with a prediction focus remain
limited in the literature. This paper differs from prior work and leverages two
recent releases of the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for
2009 and 2017 to develop machine learning (ML) models, specifically gradient
boosting machine (GBM), for predicting household-level online shopping
purchases. The NHTS data allow for not only conducting nationwide investigation
but also at the level of households, which is more appropriate than at the
individual level given the connected consumption and shopping needs of members
in a household. We follow a systematic procedure for model development
including employing Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to select input
variables (features) in order to reduce the risk of model overfitting and
increase model explainability. Extensive post-modeling investigation is
conducted in a comparative manner between 2009 and 2017, including quantifying
the importance of each input variable in predicting online shopping demand, and
characterizing value-dependent relationships between demand and the input
variables. In doing so, two latest advances in machine learning techniques,
namely Shapley value-based feature importance and Accumulated Local Effects
plots, are adopted to overcome inherent drawbacks of the popular techniques in
current ML modeling. The modeling and investigation are performed both at the
national level and for three of the largest cities (New York, Los Angeles, and
Houston). The models developed and insights gained can be used for online
shopping-related freight demand generation and may also be considered for
evaluating the potential impact of relevant policies on online shopping demand.

extremely fast prediction of steady-state heat convection of a hot object with
arbitrary complex geometry in a two-dimensional space. According to the
governing equations, the steady-state heat convection is dominated by
convection and thermal diffusion terms, thus the distribution of the physical
fields would exhibit stronger correlations between adjacent points. Therefore,
the proposed neural network model uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
layers as the encoder and Deconvolutional Neural Network (DCNN) layers as the
decoder. Compared with fully connected (FC) network model, the CNN based model
is good for capturing and reconstructing the spatial relationships of low-rank
feature spaces, such as edge intersections, parallelism and symmetry.
Furthermore, we applied the signed distance function (SDF) as the network input
for representing the problem geometry, which contains more information compared
to a binary image. For displaying the strong learning and generalization
ability of the proposed network model, the training dataset only contains hot
objects with simple geometries: triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons
and dodecagons; while the validating cases use arbitrary and complex
geometries. According to the study, the trained network model can accurately
predict the velocity and temperature field of the problems with complex
geometries which has never been seen by the network model during the model
training; and the prediction speed is four orders faster than the CFD. The
ability of the accurate and extremely faster prediction of the network model
suggests the potentials of applying such kind of models to the applications of

learning, considering that the cable's behavior can be implicitly represented
by the measured cable force series. A deep learning model, long short term
memory fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN), is leveraged by assigning
appropriate inputs and representative class labels for the TSC problem, First,
a TSC classifier is trained and validated using the data collected under intact
conditions of stay cables, setting the segmented data series as input and the
cable (or cable pair) ID as class labels. Subsequently, the classifier is
tested using the data collected under possible damaged conditions. Finally, the
cable or cable pair corresponding to the least classification accuracy is
recommended as the most probable damaged cable or cable pair. The proposed
method was tested on an in-service cable-stayed bridge with damaged stay
cables. Two scenarios in the proposed TSC scheme were investigated: 1) raw time
series of cable forces were fed into the classifiers; and 2) cable force ratios
were inputted in the classifiers considering the possible variation of force
distribution between cable pairs due to cable damage. Combining the results of
TSC testing in these two scenarios, the cable with rupture was correctly

important to provide a stable and efficient environment for Lithium-ion
batteries (LiBs) powered devices. Most data-driven SoC models are built for a
fixed ambient temperature, which neglect the high sensitivity of LiBs to
temperature and may cause severe prediction errors. Nevertheless, a systematic
evaluation of the impact of temperature on SoC estimation and ways for a prompt
adjustment of the estimation model to new temperatures using limited data have
been hardly discussed. To solve these challenges, a novel SoC estimation method
is proposed by exploiting temporal dynamics of measurements and transferring
consistent estimation ability among different temperatures. First, temporal
dynamics, which is presented by correlations between the past fluctuation and
the future motion, is extracted using canonical variate analysis. Next, two
models, including a reference SoC estimation model and an estimation ability
monitoring model, are developed with temporal dynamics. The monitoring model
provides a path to quantitatively evaluate the influences of temperature on SoC
estimation ability. After that, once the inability of the reference SoC
estimation model is detected, consistent temporal dynamics between temperatures
are selected for transfer learning. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed
method is verified through a benchmark. Our proposed method not only reduces
prediction errors at fixed temperatures (e.g., reduced by 24.35% at -20{\deg}C,
49.82% at 25{\deg}C) but also improves prediction accuracies at new
temperatures.

distributed mobile robot as an FL client with resource limitations either in
memory, bandwidth, processor, or battery life. We consider such mobile robots
as FL clients to understand their resource-constrained behavior in a real-world
setting. We consider an FL client to be untrustworthy if the client infuses
incorrect models or repeatedly gives slow responses during the FL process.
After disregarding the ineffective and unreliable client, we perform local
training on the selected FL clients. To further reduce the straggler issue, we
enable an asynchronous FL mechanism by performing aggregation on the FL server
without waiting for a long period to receive a particular client's response.

approach, the number of commodities is a driving factor in the speed at which
the LP can be solved, as it is linear in the number of constraints and
variables. The conventional approach to improve the solve time of the LP
relaxation of a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model that encodes such an
instance is to aggregate all commodities that have the same origin or the same
destination. However, the bound of the resulting LP relaxation can
significantly worsen, which tempers the efficiency of aggregating techniques.
In this paper, we introduce the concept of partial aggregation of commodities
that aggregates commodities over a subset of the network instead of the
conventional aggregation over the entire underlying network. This offers a high
level of control on the trade-off between size of the aggregated MIP model and
quality of its LP bound. We apply the concept of partial aggregation to two
different MIP models for the multicommodity network design problem. Our
computational study on benchmark instances confirms that the trade-off between
solve time and LP bound can be controlled by the level of aggregation, and that
choosing a good trade-off can allow us to solve the original large-scale
problems faster than without aggregation or with full aggregation.

expensive forward operators is challenging especially when the unknowns involve
the strongly heterogeneous Earth. To meet these challenges, we propose a
preconditioning scheme involving a conditional normalizing flow (NF) capable of
sampling from a low-fidelity posterior distribution directly. This conditional
NF is used to speed up the training of the high-fidelity objective involving
minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and the
desired high-fidelity posterior density for indirect measurements at hand. To
minimize costs associated with the forward operator, we initialize the
high-fidelity NF with the weights of the pretrained low-fidelity NF, which is
trained beforehand on available model and data pairs. Our numerical
experiments, including a 2D toy and a seismic compressed sensing example,
demonstrate that thanks to the preconditioning considerable speed-ups are
achievable compared to training NFs from scratch.

three-fold. First, we advance a one-stage plug-and-play solution by embedding
hierarchical style transfer units into a segmentation architecture. Our
solution can remove appearance shifts and perform segmentation simultaneously.
Second, we adopt Dynamic Instance Normalization to conduct precise and dynamic
style transfer in a learnable manner, rather than previously fixed style
normalization. Third, our solution is fast and lightweight for routine clinical

In particular, for star queries, we design combinatorial algorithms that

attracted growing research interests thanks to the large corpus of easily
accessible video data on the Internet. However, for video action recognition,
the action of interest might only exist in arbitrary clips of untrimmed web
videos, resulting in high label noises in the temporal space. To address this
issue, we introduce a new method for pre-training video action recognition
models using queried web videos. Instead of trying to filter out, we propose to
convert the potential noises in these queried videos to useful supervision
signals by defining the concept of Sub-Pseudo Label (SPL). Specifically, SPL
spans out a new set of meaningful ""middle ground"" label space constructed by
extrapolating the original weak labels during video querying and the prior
knowledge distilled from a teacher model. Consequently, SPL provides enriched
supervision for video models to learn better representations. SPL is fairly
simple and orthogonal to popular teacher-student self-training frameworks
without extra training cost. We validate the effectiveness of our method on
four video action recognition datasets and a weakly-labeled image dataset to
study the generalization ability. Experiments show that SPL outperforms several
existing pre-training strategies using pseudo-labels and the learned
representations lead to competitive results when fine-tuning on HMDB-51 and
UCF-101 compared with recent pre-training methods.

obtained using AC paracentesis, an invasive procedure to obtain AC fluid
requiring needle insertion into the AC. We previously developed a spectroscopic
optical coherence tomography (SOCT) analysis method to differentiate between
populations of RBCs and subtypes of WBCs, including granulocytes, lymphocytes
and monocytes, both in vitro and in ACs of excised porcine eyes. We have shown
that different types of WBCs have distinct characteristic size distributions,
extracted from the backscattered reflectance spectrum of individual cells using
Mie theory. Here, we further develop our method to estimate the composition of
blood cell mixtures, both in vitro and in vivo. To do so, we estimate the size
distribution of unknown cell mixtures by fitting the distribution observed
using SOCT with a weighted combination of reference size distributions of each
WBC type calculated using kernel density estimation. We validate the accuracy
of our estimation in an in vitro study, by comparing our results for a given
WBC sample mixture with the cellular concentrations measured by a hemocytometer
and SOCT images before mixing. We also conducted a small in vivo quantitative
cell mixture validation pilot study which demonstrates congruence between our
method and AC paracentesis in two patients with uveitis. The SOCT based method
appears promising to provide quantitative diagnostic information of cellular
responses in the ACs of patients with uveitis.

we solved the two-dimensional Laplace's equation for a shallow or finite domain
consisting of interdigitated boundaries. We achieved this by using Jacobian
elliptic functions to conformally transform the interdigitated domain into a
parallel plates domain. The obtained expressions for potential distribution,
flux density and flux allow for arbitrary domain height, different band widths
and asymmetric potentials at the interdigitated array, besides considering
fringing effects at both ends of the array. All these expressions depend only
on relative dimensions, instead of absolute ones. With these results we showed
that the behavior in shallow or finite domains approaches that of a
semi-infinite domain, when its height is greater than the separation between
the centers of consecutive bands. We also found that, for any desired but fixed
flux, bands of equal width minimize the total surface of the interdigitated
array. Finally, we present approximate expressions for the flux, based on
elementary functions, which can be applied to ease the calculation of currents

two categories of edge bands near the Fermi energy (EF), i.e., the
shuttle-shaped twofold-degenerate and the near-flat simple degenerate edge
bands. However, the usual experimental measurement may not distinguish the
difference between the two categories of edge bands. Here we study the varying
rule for the edge bands of PNRs under an external electrostatic field. By using
the KWANT code based on the tight-binding approach, we find that the
twofold-degenerate edge bands can be divided into two separated shuttles until
the degeneracy is completely removed and a gap near EFis opened under a
sufficiently strong in-plane electric field. Importantly, each shuttle from the
ribbon upper or lower edge outmost atoms is identified according to the local
density of states. However, under a small off-plane field the shuttle-shaped
bands are easily induced into two near-flat bands contributed from the edge
atoms of the top and bottom sublayers, respectively. The evidence provides the
edge and sublayer degrees of freedom (DOF) for the PNRs with shuttle-shaped
edge bands, of which is obviously different from another category PNRs
intrinsically with near-flat edge bands. This is because that the former
category of ribbons solely have four zigzag-like atomic configurations at the

against the point defect in the ribbon center area. As an application,
furthermore, based on this issue we propose a homogenous junction of a
shuttle-edge-band PNR attached by two electric gates. Interestingly, the
transport property of the junction with field manipulation well reflects the
characteristics of the two DOFs. These findings may provide a further
understanding on PNRs and initiate new developments in PNR-based electronics.

the software. Such compromised practice results in the increasing burden to
developers in future development. The metaphor, technical debt, describes such
practice. Prior research has illustrated the negative impact of technical debt,
and many researchers investigated how developers deal with a certain type of
technical debt. However, few studies focused on the removal of different types
of technical debt in practice.
  To fill this gap, we use the introduction and removal of different types of
self-admitted technical debt (i.e., SATD) in 7 deep learning frameworks as an
example. This is because deep learning frameworks are some of the most
important software systems today due to their prevalent use in life-impacting
deep learning applications. Moreover, the field of the development of different
deep learning frameworks is the same, which enables us to find common behaviors
on the removal of different types of technical debt across projects. By mining
the file history of these frameworks, we find that design debt is introduced
the most along the development process. As for the removal of technical debt,
we find that requirement debt is removed the most, and design debt is removed
the fastest. Most of test debt, design debt, and requirement debt are removed
by the developers who introduced them. Based on the introduction and removal of
different types of technical debt, we discuss the evolution of the frequencies
of different types of technical debt to depict the unresolved sub-optimal
trade-offs or decisions that are confronted by developers along the development
process. We also discuss the removal patterns of different types of technical
debt, highlight future research directions, and provide recommendations for
practitioners.

  Historical Data","38 pages, 6 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical
role in productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with
complex biological mechanisms, and this leads to high variability in the
process outputs, namely, the protein and impurity levels. By building on the
biological mechanisms of protein and impurity growth, we introduce a stochastic
model to characterize the accumulation of the protein and impurity levels in
the fermentation process. However, a common challenge in the industry is the
availability of only a very limited amount of data, especially in the
development and early stage of production. This adds an additional layer of
uncertainty, referred to as model risk, due to the difficulty of estimating the
model parameters with limited data. In this paper, we study the harvesting
decision for a fermentation process under model risk (i.e., when to stop the
fermentation and collect the production reward). We adopt a Bayesian approach
to update the unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the
resulting posterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on
fermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a
Markov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the
posterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in
decision-making. The resulting model is solved by using a reinforcement
learning algorithm based on Bayesian sparse sampling. We provide analytical
results on the structure of the optimal policy and its objective function, and
explicitly study the impact of model risk on harvesting decisions. Our case
studies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution
approach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving
substantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower
batch-to-batch variability.

fine-grained and adaptable authorization based on the attributes of users,

access control (HGABAC) model was recently proposed which introduces the novel
notion of attribute inheritance through group membership. GURAG was
subsequently proposed to provide an administrative model for user attributes in
HGABAC, building upon the ARBAC97 and GURA administrative models. The GURA
model uses administrative roles to manage user attributes. The reachability
problem for the GURA model is to determine what attributes a particular user
can acquire, given a predefined set of administrative rules. This problem has
been previously analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we study the user
attribute reachability problem based on directly assigned attributes of the
user and attributes inherited via group memberships. We first define a
restricted form of GURAG, called rGURAG scheme, as a state transition system
with multiple instances having different preconditions and provide reachability
analysis for each of these schemes. In general, we show PSPACE-complete
complexity for all rGURAG schemes. We further present polynomial time
algorithms to solve special instances of rGURAG schemes under restricted

the feedback from the final answer, which makes the learning unstable or

  To address this challenge, we propose a novel teacher-student approach for

correct answer to the query, while the teacher network tries to learn
intermediate supervision signals for improving the reasoning capacity of the
student network. The major novelty lies in the design of the teacher network,
where we utilize both forward and backward reasoning to enhance the learning of
intermediate entity distributions. By considering bidirectional reasoning, the
teacher network can produce more reliable intermediate supervision signals,
which can alleviate the issue of spurious reasoning. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on

the full age-metallicity probability density functions (PDFs) of individual
stars. No assumptions are made about the shape of the underlying distribution,
and the only free parameter of the algorithm is used to ensure a smooth
solution. In this work we use individual age-metallicity PDFs from isochrone
fitting of stars with known metallicities. The method is tested with synthetic
samples and is found to recover the input age-metallicity distribution more
accurately than the distribution of individually estimated ages and
metallicities. The recovered sample age distribution is always more accurate
than the distribution of individual ages, also when restricted to the most
precise individual ages. By applying the method to the stars in the
Geneva-Copenhagen survey, we detect a possible minimum in the star formation
history of the Solar neighbourhood at an age of 10 Gyr which is not seen in the
distribution of individual ages. Although we apply the method only to
age-metallicity distributions, the algorithm is described more generally and
can in principle be applied in other parameter spaces. It is also not
restricted to individual parameter distributions from isochrone fitting,
meaning that a sample age distribution can be estimated based on individual age
PDFs from other methods such as asteroseismology or gyrochronology.

vision technology has become increasingly important for flat-panel displays
(FPD) industry. This paper discloses a novel visual inspection system for
liquid crystal display (LCD), which is currently a dominant type in the FPD
industry. The system is based on two cornerstones: robust/high-performance
defect recognition model and cognitive visual inspection service architecture.
A hybrid application of conventional computer vision technique and the latest
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) leads to an integrated defect
detection, classfication and impact evaluation model that can be economically
trained with only image-level class annotations to achieve a high inspection
accuracy. In addition, the properly trained model is robust to the variation of
the image qulity, significantly alleviating the dependency between the model
prediction performance and the image aquisition environment. This in turn
justifies the decoupling of the defect recognition functions from the front-end
device to the back-end serivce, motivating the design and realization of the
cognitive visual inspection service architecture. Empirical case study is
performed on a large-scale real-world LCD dataset from a manufacturing line
with different layers and products, which shows the promising utility of our
system, which has been deployed in a real-world LCD manufacturing line from a
major player in the world.

MHD equations. The dynamo effect is divided into two parts, parallel and
perpendicular to the magnetic field. Firstly, the force-free plasma is
considered. It is found that the parallel dynamo effect drives opposite current
densities at the different sides of the rational surface, making the $\lambda
=\boldsymbol{j}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}/|\boldsymbol{B}|^2$ profile completely
flattened near the rational surface. There are many rational surfaces for the
turbulent plasma, which means the plasma is tending to relax into the Taylor
state. In contrast, a bit far from the rational surface, the parallel dynamo
effect is much smaller, and the nonlinear dynamo form approximates the
quasilinear form. Secondly, the pressure gradient is included. It is found that
rather than the $\lambda$ profile, the $\boldsymbol{j}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}$
profile is flattened by the parallel dynamo effect. Besides, the perpendicular
dynamo effect of tearing modes is found to eliminate the pressure gradient near
the rational surface. In addition, our result also provides another basis for
the assumption that current density is flat in the magnetic island for the
tearing modes theory.

two of its metabolites, the cysteine and the N-acetyl-cysteine conjugates. The

applied to plasma from mice cutaneously exposed to CEES. All four markers could

is consistent with anhydrous Fe-oxide, as the enrichment in iron is not
associated with enrichment in any other elements, nor with detections of
volatiles. The lack of ferric absorption features in the ChemCam reflectance
spectra and the hexagonal crystalline structure associated with dark-toned
crystals points toward coarse ""grey"" hematite. In addition, the host rock
adjacent to these features appears bleached and show low-FeO$_T$ content as
well as depletion in Mn, indicating mobilization of these redox-sensitive
elements during diagenesis. Thus, groundwater fluid circulations could account
for the remobilization of iron and recrystallization as crystalline hematite
during diagenesis as well as color variations observed in the Vera Rubin ridge
outcrops.

As one of the common structures in coronal holes, coronal plumes might
contribute to the origin of the nascent solar wind. To estimate the
contribution of coronal plumes to the nascent solar wind, we make the first
attempt to estimate their populations in solar polar coronal holes. By
comparing the observations viewed from two different angles taken by the twin
satellites of STEREO and the results of Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate
about 16--27 plumes rooted in an area of $4\times10^4$ arcsec$^2$ of the polar
coronal holes near the solar minimum, which occupy about 2--3.4% of the area.
Based on these values, the contribution of coronal plumes to the nascent solar
wind has also been discussed. A further investigation indicates that more
precise number of coronal plumes can be worked out with observations from three

  Human-Machine Systems",,"10.1109/THMS.2022.3149173",,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Embodied conversational agents (ECA) are often designed to produce nonverbal
behavior to complement or enhance their verbal communication. One such form of
nonverbal behavior is co-speech gesturing, which involves movements that the
agent makes with its arms and hands that are paired with verbal communication.
Co-speech gestures for ECAs can be created using different generation methods,
divided into rule-based and data-driven processes, with the latter gaining
traction because of the increasing interest from the applied machine learning
community. However, reports on gesture generation methods use a variety of
evaluation measures, which hinders comparison. To address this, we present a
systematic review on co-speech gesture generation methods for iconic,
metaphoric, deictic, and beat gestures, including reported evaluation methods.
We review 22 studies that have an ECA with a human-like upper body that uses
co-speech gesturing in social human-agent interaction. This includes studies
that use human participants to evaluate performance. We found most studies use
a within-subject design and rely on a form of subjective evaluation, but
without a systematic approach. We argue that the field requires more rigorous
and uniform tools for co-speech gesture evaluation, and formulate
recommendations for empirical evaluation, including standardized phrases and
example scenarios to help systematically test generative models across studies.
Furthermore, we also propose a checklist that can be used to report relevant
information for the evaluation of generative models, as well as to evaluate
co-speech gesture use.

The description method utilizes the recently proposed Vision Transformer

been very successfully replaced, over the last years, by the Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN)-based methods. However, the experimental evaluation
conducted in this paper on several benchmarking datasets against 36
state-of-the-art descriptors from the literature demonstrates that a neural
network that contains no convolutional layer, such as Vision Transformer, can
shape a global descriptor and achieve competitive results. As fine-tuning is
not required, the presented methodology's low complexity encourages adoption of
the architecture as an image retrieval baseline model, replacing the
traditional and well adopted CNN-based approaches and inaugurating a new era in
image retrieval approaches.

systems, demand out-of-domain detection methods. Intent classification models
should be equipped with a mechanism to distinguish seen intents from unseen
ones so that the dialog agent is capable of rejecting the latter and avoiding
undesired behavior. However, despite increasing attention paid to the task, the
best practices for out-of-domain intent detection have not yet been fully
established.
  This paper conducts a thorough comparison of out-of-domain intent detection
methods. We prioritize the methods, not requiring access to out-of-domain data
during training, gathering of which is extremely time- and labor-consuming due
to lexical and stylistic variation of user utterances. We evaluate multiple
contextual encoders and methods, proven to be efficient, on three standard
datasets for intent classification, expanded with out-of-domain utterances. Our
main findings show that fine-tuning Transformer-based encoders on in-domain
data leads to superior results. Mahalanobis distance, together with utterance
representations, derived from Transformer-based encoders, outperforms other
methods by a wide margin and establishes new state-of-the-art results for all
datasets.
  The broader analysis shows that the reason for success lies in the fact that
the fine-tuned Transformer is capable of constructing homogeneous
representations of in-domain utterances, revealing geometrical disparity to out
of domain utterances. In turn, the Mahalanobis distance captures this disparity
easily.

show that every predicate computable by population protocols is computable by a
BCP with expected $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ interactions, which is asymptotically
optimal. We further show that every log-space, randomized Turing machine can be
simulated by a BCP with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n \cdot T)$ interactions in

attenuation are also well explained in these solids. This is not yet the case
in glasses where the lack of periodicity generates enormous difficulties in
theoretical treatments as well as in experiments or in numerical simulations.
Thanks to recent developments along all these lines, comprehensive studies have
emerged in the last decades and several decisive advances have been made. This
chapter is thus devoted to a discussion of the nature of the vibrational
properties in glasses with particular emphasis on the low-frequency part of the
vibrational density of states, including the acoustic excitations, and of the
experimental techniques used to their study.

  Progressive Subspace Clustering",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep multi-view clustering methods have achieved remarkable performance.
However, all of them failed to consider the difficulty labels (uncertainty of
ground-truth for training samples) over multi-view samples, which may result
into a nonideal clustering network for getting stuck into poor local optima
during training process; worse still, the difficulty labels from multi-view
samples are always inconsistent, such fact makes it even more challenging to
handle. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Adversarial Inconsistent
Cognitive Sampling (DAICS) method for multi-view progressive subspace
clustering. A multiview binary classification (easy or difficult) loss and a
feature similarity loss are proposed to jointly learn a binary classifier and a
deep consistent feature embedding network, throughout an adversarial minimax
game over difficulty labels of multiview consistent samples. We develop a
multi-view cognitive sampling strategy to select the input samples from easy to
difficult for multi-view clustering network training. However, the
distributions of easy and difficult samples are mixed together, hence not
trivial to achieve the goal. To resolve it, we define a sampling probability
with theoretical guarantee. Based on that, a golden section mechanism is
further designed to generate a sample set boundary to progressively select the
samples with varied difficulty labels via a gate unit, which is utilized to
jointly learn a multi-view common progressive subspace and clustering network
for more efficient clustering. Experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of DAICS over the state-of-the-art methods.

mass spectrometry based metabolomics research. Till now, number of mass spectra
databases and search algorithms have been developed to address this issue.
However, two critical problems still exist: the low chemical component record
coverage in databases and significant MS/MS spectra variations related to
experiment equipment and parameter settings. In this work, we considered the
molecule fragment as basic building blocks of the metabolic components which
had relatively consistent signatures in MS/MS spectra. And from a bottom-up
point of view, we built a fragment centered database, MSFragDB, by reorganizing
the data from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and developed an
intensity-free searching algorithm to search and rank the most relative
metabolite according to the users' input. We also proposed the concept of
fragment network, a graph structure that encoded the relationship between the
molecule fragments to find close motif that indicated a specific chemical
structure. Although based on the same dataset as the HMDB, validation results
implied that the MSFragDB had a higher hit ratio and furthermore, estimated
possible taxonomy that a query spectrum belongs to when the corresponding
chemical component was missing in the database. Aid by the Fragment Network,
the MSFragDB was also proved to be able to estimate the right structure while
the MS/MS spectrum suffers from the precursor-contamination. The strategy
proposed is general and can be adopted in existing databases. We believe
MSFragDB and Fragment Network can improve the performance of structure
identification with existing data. The beta version of the database is freely
available at www.xrzhanglab.com/msfragdb/.

hardware characteristics and deploying environments, an IRS may be subject to
reflecting element blockages and failures, and hence developing diagnostic

this paper, we develop diagnostic techniques for IRS systems to locate faulty
reflecting elements and retrieve failure parameters. Three cases of channel
state information (CSI) availability are considered. In the first case where
full CSI is available, a compressed sensing based diagnostic technique is
proposed, which significantly reduces the required number of measurements. In
the second case where only partial CSI is available, we jointly exploit the
sparsity of the millimeter-wave channel and the failure, and adopt compressed
sparse and low-rank matrix recovery algorithm to decouple channel and failure.
In the third case where no CSI is available, a novel atomic norm is introduced
as the sparsity-inducing norm of the cascaded channel, and the diagnosis
problem is formulated as a joint sparse recovery problem. Finally, the proposed
diagnostic techniques are validated through numerical simulations.

connection with the morphology of the galaxy. This is done by examining the
distribution of parametric and non-parametric statistics across the
star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) plane and studying how
these distributions change with the environment in the local universe
($z<0.15$).
  We determine the concentration (C), Gini, M$_{20}$, asymmetry, Gini-M$_{20}$
bulge statistic (GMB), 50\% light radius ($r_{50}$), total S\'{e}rsic index,
and bulge S\'{e}rsic index ($n_{Bulge}$) for galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass
Assembly (GAMA) survey using optical images from the Kilo Degree Survey. We
determine the galaxy environment using the GAMA group catalogue and split the
galaxies into field or group galaxies. The group galaxies are further divided
by the group halo mass (M$_{h}$) -
$11\leq\mathrm{log(M}_{h}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)<12$,
$12\leq\mathrm{log(M}_{h}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)<13$, and
$13\leq\mathrm{log(M}_{h}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)<14$ - and into central and
satellite galaxies. The galaxies in each of these samples are then placed onto
the SFR-M$_{\star}$ plane, and each parameter is used as a third dimension. We
fit the resulting distributions for each parameter in each sample using two
two-dimensional Gaussian distributions: one for star-forming galaxies and one
for quiescent galaxies. The coefficients of these Gaussian fits are then
compared between environments.
  Using C and $r_{50}$, we find that galaxies typically become larger as the
group mass increases. This change is greater for larger galaxies. There is no
indication that galaxies are typically more or less clumpy as the environment
changes. Using GMB and $n_{Bulge}$, we see that the star-forming galaxies do
not become more bulge or disk dominated as the group mass changes. Asymmetry
does not appear to be greatly influenced by environment.

while optimizing a single objective, such as path length. However, many
applications may require multiple objectives, say fuel consumption and
completion time, to be simultaneously optimized during planning and these
criteria may not be readily compared and sometimes lie in competition with each
other. The goal of the problem is thus to find a Pareto-optimal set of
solutions instead of a single optimal solution. Naively applying existing
multi-objective search algorithms, such as multi-objective A* (MOA*), to
multi-agent path finding may prove to be inefficient as the dimensionality of
the search space grows exponentially with the number of agents. This article
presents an approach named Multi-Objective Conflict-Based Search (MO-CBS) that
attempts to address this so-called curse of dimensionality by leveraging prior
Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a well-known algorithm for single-objective
multi-agent path finding, and principles of dominance from multi-objective
optimization literature. We also develop several variants of MO-CBS to improve
its performance. We prove that MO-CBS and its variants can compute the entire
Pareto-optimal set. Numerical results show that MO-CBS outperforms MOM*, a
recently developed state-of-the-art multi-objective multi-agent planner.

using Gumbel-Softmax in order to allow end-to-end training. This approach leads
to an adjustable increase in number of parameters while preserving an almost

the unit is not represented. Skew closed categories in turn are a weakening of
the closed categories of Eilenberg and Kelly where no structural law is
required to be invertible. The presence of a monoidal structure in these
categories is not required. We construct several equivalent presentations of
the free skew prounital closed category on a given set of generating objects: a
categorical calculus (Hilbert-style system), a cut-free sequent calculus and a
natural deduction system corresponding to a variant of planar (=
non-commutative linear) typed lambda-calculus. We solve the coherence problem
for skew prounital closed categories by showing that the sequent calculus
admits focusing and presenting two reduction-free normalization procedures for
the natural deduction calculus: normalization by evaluation and hereditary
substitutions. Normal natural deduction derivations (beta-eta-long forms) are
in one-to-one correspondence with derivations in the focused sequent calculus.
Unexpectedly, the free skew prounital closed category on a set satisfies a
left-normality condition which makes it lose its skew aspect. This pitfall can
be avoided by considering the free skew prounital closed category on a skew
multicategory instead. The latter has a presentation as a cut-free sequent
calculus for which it is easy to see that the left-normality condition
generally fails.
  The whole development has been fully formalized in the dependently typed

core has been assembled, but the planet did not open a deep gap yet. During
this phase the planet is subject to fast type-I migration, which is mostly
directed inwards, and the planet can lose a significant fraction of its
semi-major axis. The duration of this phase is set by how long the planetary
envelope needs to contract until it reaches a mass similar to the mass of the
planetary core, which is when runaway gas accretion can set in and the planet
can open a deeper gap in the disc, transitioning into the slower type-II
migration. This envelope contraction phase depends crucially on the planetary
mass and on the opacity inside the planetary envelope. Here we study how
different opacity prescriptions influence the envelope contraction time and how
this in turn influences how far the planet migrates through the disc. We find
within our simulations that the size distribution of the grains as well as the
chemical composition of the grains crucially influences how far the planet
migrates before it can reach the runaway gas accretion phase. Grain size
distributions with larger grain sizes result in less inward migration of the
growing planet, due to faster gas accretion enabled by more efficient cooling.
In addition, we find that planets forming in water poor environments can
contract their envelope faster and thus migrate less, implying that gas giants
forming in water poor environments might be located further away from their
central star compared to gas giants forming in water rich environments. Future
studies of planet formation that aim to investigate the chemical composition of
formed gas giants need to take these effects self consistently into account.

considered as a promising candidate for accommodating various emerging
communication and sensing applications in high-mobility environments. In this
paper, we propose a novel cross domain iterative detection algorithm to enhance
the error performance of OTFS modulation. Different from conventional OTFS
detection methods, the proposed algorithm applies basic estimation/detection
approaches to both the time domain and delay-Doppler (DD) domain and
iteratively updates the extrinsic information from two domains with the unitary
transformation. In doing so, the proposed algorithm exploits the time domain
channel sparsity and the DD domain symbol constellation constraints. We
evaluate the estimation/detection error variance in each domain for each
iteration and derive the state evolution to investigate the detection error
performance. We show that the performance gain due to iterations comes from the
non-Gaussian constellation constraint in the DD domain. More importantly, we
prove the proposed algorithm can indeed converge and, in the convergence, the
proposed algorithm can achieve almost the same error performance as the
maximum-likelihood sequence detection even in the presence of fractional
Doppler shifts. Furthermore, the computational complexity associated with the
domain transformation is low, thanks to the structure of the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) kernel. Simulation results are consistent with our analysis and
demonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to conventional OTFS
detection methods.

first blush, it lacks a single precise meaning. Instead, meanings range from
typical or characteristic, to a proportionate match between sample and
population, to a more general sense of accuracy, generalizability, coverage, or
inclusiveness. Moreover, the concept has long been contested. In statistics,
debates about the merits and methods of selecting a representative sample date
back to the late 19th century; in politics, debates about the value of likeness
as a logic of political representation are older still. Today, as the concept
crops up in the study of fairness and accountability in machine learning, we
need to carefully consider the term's meanings in order to communicate clearly
and account for their normative implications. In this paper, we ask what
representativeness means, how it is mobilized socially, and what values and
ideals it communicates or confronts. We trace the concept's history in
statistics and discuss normative tensions concerning its relationship to
likeness, exclusion, authority, and aspiration. We draw on these analyses to
think through how representativeness is used in FAccT debates, with emphasis on
data, shift, participation, and power.

required effort needed to achieve control is vital. Previous works have
addressed this issue by studying the scaling laws of energy cost in a general
way with continuous-time linear dynamics. However, continuous-time linear
dynamics is unable to capture conformity behavior, which is common in many
complex social systems. Therefore, to understand controlling social systems
with conformity, discrete-time modelling is used and the energy cost scaling
laws are derived. The results are validated numerically with model and real
networks. In addition, the energy costs needed for controlling systems with and
without conformity are compared, and it was found that controlling networked
systems with conformity features always requires less control energy. Finally,
it is shown through simulations that heterogeneous scale-free networks are less
controllable, requiring a higher number of minimum drivers. Since the
conformity-based model relates to various complex systems, such as flocking, or
evolutionary games, the results of this paper represent a step forward towards
developing realistic control of complex social systems.

  large array",,,"10.1017/jfm.2021.692",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The efficiency of tidal-stream turbines in a large array depends on the
balance between negative effects of turbine-wake interactions and positive
effects of bypass-flow acceleration due to local blockage, both of which are
functions of the layout of turbines. Here we investigate the hydrodynamics of
turbines in an infinitely large array with aligned or staggered layouts for a
range of streamwise and lateral turbine spacing. First, we present a
theoretical analysis based on an extension of the Linear Momentum Actuator Disc
Theory (LMADT) for perfectly aligned and staggered layouts, employing a hybrid
inviscid-viscous approach to account for the local blockage effect within each
turbine row and the viscous (turbulent) wake mixing behind each row in a
coupled manner. We perform Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of open-channel flow for
28 layouts of tidal turbines using an Actuator-Line Method with periodic
boundary conditions. Both theoretical and LES results show that the efficiency
of turbines (or the power of turbines for a given bulk velocity) in an aligned
array decreases as we reduce the streamwise spacing, whereas that in a
staggered array remains high and may even increase due to the positive local
blockage effect (causing the local flow velocity upstream of each turbine to
exceed the bulk velocity) if the lateral turbine spacing is sufficiently small.
The LES results further reveal that the amplitude of wake meandering tends to
decrease as we reduce the lateral spacing, which leads to a lower wake recovery
rate in the near-wake region. These results will help to understand and improve
the efficiency of tidal turbines in future large arrays, even though the
performance of real tidal arrays may depend not only on turbine-to-turbine
interactions but also on macro-scale interactions between the array and natural
tidal currents, the latter of which are outside the scope of this study.

  Driving","Conditionally accepted by T-RO",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Real-time planning under uncertainty is critical for robots operating in
complex dynamic environments. Consider, for example, an autonomous robot
vehicle driving in dense, unregulated urban traffic of cars, motorcycles,
buses, etc. The robot vehicle has to plan in both short and long terms, in
order to interact with many traffic participants with uncertain intentions and
drive effectively. Planning explicitly over a long time horizon, however,
incurs prohibitive computational costs and is impractical under real-time
constraints. To achieve real-time performance for large-scale planning, this
work introduces a new algorithm Learning from Tree Search for Driving
(LeTS-Drive), which integrates planning and learning in a closed loop, and
applies it to autonomous driving in crowded urban traffic in simulation.
Specifically, LeTS-Drive learns a policy and its value function from data
provided by an online planner, which searches a sparsely-sampled belief tree;
the online planner in turn uses the learned policy and value functions as
heuristics to scale up its run-time performance for real-time robot control.
These two steps are repeated to form a closed loop so that the planner and the
learner inform each other and improve in synchrony. The algorithm learns on its
own in a self-supervised manner, without human effort on explicit data
labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that LeTS-Drive outperforms either
planning or learning alone, as well as open-loop integration of planning and
learning.

for the detection of low surface brightness sources in images, in particular
(but not limited to) ICL. DAWIS follows a multiresolution vision based on
wavelet representation to detect sources, embedded in an iterative procedure
called synthesis-by-analysis approach to restore the complete unmasked light
distribution of these sources with very good quality. The algorithm is built so
sources can be classified based on criteria depending on the analysis goal; we
display in this work the case of ICL detection and the measurement of ICL
fractions. We test the efficiency of DAWIS on 270 mock images of galaxy
clusters with various ICL profiles and compare its efficiency to more
traditional ICL detection methods such as the surface brightness threshold
method. We also run DAWIS on a real galaxy cluster image, and compare the
output to results obtained with previous multiscale analysis algorithms. We
find in simulations that in average DAWIS is able to disentangle galaxy light
from ICL more efficiently, and to detect a greater quantity of ICL flux due to
the way it handles sky background noise. We also show that the ICL fraction, a
metric used on a regular basis to characterise ICL, is subject to several
measurement biases both on galaxies and ICL fluxes. In the real galaxy cluster
image, DAWIS detects a faint and extended source with an absolute magnitude two
orders brighter than previous multiscale methods.

powerful sources of gravitational wave radiation led to increased interest in
the physics of the most massive stars. The largest sample of possible
progenitors of such objects, very massive stars (VMS) with masses up to 300
Msun, have been identified in the 30 Dor star-forming region in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The physics and evolution of VMS is highly uncertain,
mainly due to their proximity to the Eddington limit. In this work we
investigate the two most important effects that are thought to occur near the
Eddington limit. Enhanced mass loss through optically thick winds, and the
formation of radially inflated stellar envelopes. We compute evolutionary
models for VMS at LMC metallicity and perform a population synthesis of the
young stellar population in 30 Dor. We find that enhanced mass loss and
envelope inflation have a dominant effect on the evolution of the most massive
stars. While the observed mass-loss properties and the associated surface
He-enrichment are well described by our new models, the observed O-star
mass-loss rates are found to cover a much larger range than theoretically
predicted, with particularly low mass-loss rates for the youngest objects.
Also, the (rotational) surface enrichment in the O-star regime appears to be
not well understood. The positions of the most massive stars in the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) are affected by mass loss and envelope
inflation. For instance, the majority of luminous B-supergiants in 30 Dor, and
the lack thereof at the highest luminosities, can be explained through the
combination of envelope inflation and mass loss. Finally, we find that the
upper limit for the inferred initial stellar masses in the greater 30 Dor
region is significantly lower than in its central cluster R 136, implying a
variable upper limit for the masses of stars.

pattern instances, there might exist intervals for the same entity that
contradict the pattern's usual meaning. We conjecture that non-transparent
patterns are also less useful as classification or prediction features. We
propose a new pruning constraint during a frequent temporal-pattern discovery
process, the Semantic Adjacency Criterion [SAC], which exploits domain
knowledge to filter out patterns that contain potentially semantically
contradictory components. We have defined three SAC versions, and tested their
effect in three medical domains. We embedded these criteria in a
frequent-temporal-pattern discovery framework. Previously, we had informally
presented the SAC principle and showed that using it to prune patterns enhances
the repeatability of their discovery in the same clinical domain. Here, we
define formally the semantics of three SAC variations, and compare the use of
the set of pruned patterns to the use of the complete set of discovered
patterns, as features for classification and prediction tasks in three
different medical domains. We induced four classifiers for each task, using
four machine-learning methods: Random Forests, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic
Regression. The features were frequent temporal patterns discovered in each
data set. SAC-based temporal pattern-discovery reduced by up to 97% the number
of discovered patterns and by up to 98% the discovery runtime. But the
classification and prediction performance of the reduced SAC-based
pattern-based features set, was as good as when using the complete set. Using
SAC can significantly reduce the number of discovered frequent interval-based
temporal patterns, and the corresponding computational effort, without losing
classification or prediction performance.

the pressing concern with the use of containers is its susceptibility to

proposing two metrics that reflects coverage and accuracy. We analyze 59
popular public container images for Java applications hosted on DockerHub using
different container scanning tools (such as Clair, Anchore, and Microscanner).
Our findings show that existing container scanning approach does not detect
application package vulnerabilities. Furthermore, existing tools do not have
high accuracy, since 34% vulnerabilities are being missed by the best

models in turbulent flows with a large number of species is to track every
species by solving a separate transport equation, which can be computationally
impracticable. In this paper, we present an on-the-fly reduced order modeling
of reactive as well as passive transport equations to reduce the computational
cost. The presented approach seeks a low-rank decomposition of the species to
three time-dependent components: (i) a set of orthonormal spatial modes, (ii) a
low-rank factorization of the instantaneous species correlation matrix, and
(iii) a set of orthonormal species modes, which represent a low-dimensional
time-dependent manifold. Our approach bypasses the need to solve the
full-dimensional species to generate high-fidelity data - as it is commonly
performed in data-driven dimension reduction techniques such as the principle
component analysis. Instead, the low-rank components are directly extracted
from the species transport equation. The evolution equations for the three
components are obtained from optimality conditions of a variational principle.
The time-dependence of the three components enables an on-the-fly adaptation of
the low-rank decomposition to transient changes in the species. Several
demonstration cases of reduced order modeling of passive and reactive transport
equations are presented.

the spherical signals to the vectors through the grid. By building the

which a human comprehensible, quantitative description of the data-generating
process, e.g., in the form of equations, cannot be achieved. While doing so,
DNNs often produce an abstract (entangled and non-interpretable) representation
of the data-generating process. This is one of the reasons why DNNs are not
extensively used in physics-signal processing: physicists generally require
their analyses to yield quantitative information about the studied systems. In
this article we use DNNs to disentangle components of oscillating time series,
and recover meaningful information. We show that, because DNNs can find useful
abstract feature representations, they can be used when prior knowledge about
the signal-generating process exists, but is not complete, as it is
particularly the case in ""new-physics"" searches. To this aim, we train our DNN
on synthetic oscillating time series to perform two tasks: a regression of the
signal latent parameters and signal denoising by an Autoencoder-like
architecture. We show that the regression and denoising performance is similar
to those of least-square curve fittings (LS-fit) with true latent parameters'
initial guesses, in spite of the DNN needing no initial guesses at all. We then
explore applications in which we believe our architecture could prove useful
for time-series processing in physics, when prior knowledge is incomplete. As
an example, we employ DNNs as a tool to inform LS-fits when initial guesses are
unknown. We show that the regression can be performed on some latent
parameters, while ignoring the existence of others. Because the Autoencoder
needs no prior information about the physical model, the remaining unknown
latent parameters can still be captured, thus making use of partial prior
knowledge, while leaving space for data exploration and discoveries.

given normal $\vec{n}_\Gamma$, which truncates an arbitrary polyhedron
$\mathcal{P}$ such that the remaining sub-polyhedron admits a given volume
$\alpha|\mathcal{P}|$. In the literature, this is commonly referred to as
Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) interface positioning problem. The novelty of our work is
twofold: firstly, by recursive application of the Gaussian divergence theorem,
the volume of a truncated polyhedron can be computed at high efficiency, based
on summation over quantities associated to the faces of the polyhedron. One
obtains a very convenient piecewise parametrization (within so-called brackets)
in terms of the signed distance s to the plane $\Gamma$. As an implication, one
can restrain from the costly necessity to establish topological connectivity,
rendering the present approach most suitable for the application to
unstructured computational meshes. Secondly, in the vicinity of the truncation
position s, the volume can be expressed exactly, i.e. in terms of a cubic
polynomial of the normal distance to the PLIC plane. The local knowledge of
derivatives enables to construct a root-finding algorithm that pairs bracketing
and higher-order approximation. The performance is assessed by conducting an
extensive set of numerical experiments, considering convex and non-convex
polyhedra of genus (i.e., number of holes) zero and one in combination with
carefully selected volume fractions $\alpha$ (including $\alpha\approx0$ and
$\alpha\approx1$) and normal orientations $\vec{n}_\Gamma$. For all
configurations we obtain a significant reduction of the number of
(computationally costly) truncations required for the positioning: on average,
our algorithm requires between one and two polyhedron truncations to find the
position of the plane $\Gamma$, outperforming existing methods.

anomalous Hall response of the SRO ultra-thin films by virtue of density
functional theory calculations. Our findings reveal that the ferromagnetic SRO
films grown on SrTiO$_3$ (in-plane strain of $-$0.47$\%$) have an orthorhombic
(both tilting and rotation) distorted structure and with an increasing amount
of substrate-induced compressive strain the octahedral tilting angle is found
to be suppressed gradually, with SRO films grown on NdGaO$_3$ (in-plane strain
of $-$1.7$\%$) stabilized in the tetragonal distorted structure (with zero
tilting). Our Berry curvature calculations predict a positive value of the
anomalous Hall conductivity of $+$76\,S/cm at $-$1.7$\%$ strain, whereas it is
found to be negative ($-$156\,S/cm) at $-$0.47$\%$ strain. We attribute the
found behavior of the anomalous Hall effect to the nodal point dynamics in the
electronic structure arising in response to tailoring the oxygen octahedral
distortion driven by the substrate-induced strain. We also calculate
strain-mediated anomalous Hall conductivity as a function of reduced
magnetization obtained by scaling down the magnitude of the exchange field
inside Ru atoms finding good qualitative agreement with experimental
observations, which indicates a strong impact of longitudinal thermal
fluctuations of Ru spin moments on the anomalous Hall effect in this system.

expression, for predicting clinical outcomes or selecting markers.
Additionally, so-called co-data are often available, providing complementary
information on the covariates, like p-values from previously published studies
or groups of genes corresponding to pathways. Elastic net penalisation is
widely used for prediction and covariate selection. Group-adaptive elastic net
penalisation learns from co-data to improve the prediction and covariate
selection, by penalising important groups of covariates less than other groups.
Existing methods are, however, computationally expensive. Here we present a
fast method for marginal likelihood estimation of group-adaptive elastic net
penalties for generalised linear models. We first derive a low-dimensional
representation of the Taylor approximation of the marginal likelihood and its
first derivative for group-adaptive ridge penalties, to efficiently estimate
these penalties. Then we show by using asymptotic normality of the linear
predictors that the marginal likelihood for elastic net models may be
approximated well by the marginal likelihood for ridge models. The ridge group
penalties are then transformed to elastic net group penalties by using the
variance function. The method allows for overlapping groups and unpenalised
variables. We demonstrate the method in a model-based simulation study and an
application to cancer genomics. The method substantially decreases computation
time and outperforms or matches other methods by learning from co-data.

enough, a significant portion of the array can be considered to be an ""open

chemical perturbations. The main purpose of this study is to examine the impact
of double-diffusive convection on magnetic field generation by means of 3D
global geodynamo models, in the so-called ""top-heavy"" regime of
double-diffusive convection, when both thermal and compositional background
gradients are destabilizing. Using a linear eigensolver, we begin by confirming
that, compared to the standard single-diffusive configuration, the onset of
convection is facilitated by the addition of a second buoyancy source. We next
carry out a systematic parameter survey by performing $79$ numerical dynamo
simulations. We show that a good agreement between simulated magnetic fields
and the geomagnetic field can be attained for any partitioning of the
convective input power between its thermal and chemical components. On the
contrary, the transition between dipole-dominated and multipolar dynamos is
found to strongly depend on the nature of the buoyancy forcing. Classical
parameters expected to govern this transition, such as the local Rossby number
or the degree of equatorial symmetry of the flow, fail to capture the dipole
breakdown. A scale-dependent analysis of the force balance instead reveals that
the transition occurs when the ratio of inertial to Lorentz forces at the
dominant length scale reaches $0.5$, regardless of the partitioning of the
buoyancy power. The ratio of integrated kinetic to magnetic energy $E_k/E_m$
provides a reasonable proxy of this force ratio. Given that $E_k/E_m \ll 1$ in
the Earth's core, the geodynamo is expected to operate far from the
dipole-multipole transition. It hence appears that the occurrence of
geomagnetic reversals is unlikely related to dramatic and punctual changes of
the amplitude of inertial forces in the Earth's core, and that another
mechanism must be sought.

subgraph with $f$ edges, and let $\sigma(m,f)=\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}
|S_n(m,f)|/\binom{n}{2}$. As a natural extension of an extremal problem of
Erd\H{o}s, this was investigated by Erd\H{o}s, F\""uredi, Rothschild and S\'os
twenty years ago. Their main result indicates that integers in $S_n(m,f)$ are
rare for most pairs $(m,f)$, though they also found infinitely many pairs
$(m,f)$ whose $\sigma(m,f)$ is a fixed positive constant. Here we aim to
provide some improvements on this study. Our first result shows that
$\sigma(m,f)\leq \frac12$ holds for all but finitely many pairs $(m,f)$ and the
constant $\frac12$ cannot be improved. This answers a question of Erd\H{o}s et.
al. Our second result considers infinitely many pairs $(m,f)$ of special forms,
whose exact values of $\sigma(m,f)$ were conjectured by Erd\H{o}s et. al. We
partially solve this conjecture (only leaving two open cases) by making
progress on some constructions which are related to number theory. Our proofs
are based on the research of Erd\H{o}s et. al and involve different arguments
in number theory. We also discuss some related problems.

observations (for 448 RRLs) carried out with the Southern African Large

the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), and (3) literature. These
are combined with accurate proper motion data from the second release of
\textit{Gaia} mission (DR2). This study primarily determines the velocity
distribution of solar neighborhood RRLs, and it also calibrates the zero points
of the RRLs visual V-band luminosity-metallicity (LZ or $M_V-$[\text{Fe/H}])

\textit{WISE} $W_1-$ and \textit{2MASS} $Ks-$band. The calibrated PLZ and LZ
relations are used to estimate the Galactic Center distance and the distance
modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which are found to be
7.99$\pm$0.49\,kpc and 18.46$\pm$0.09 \,mag, respectively. All our results are
in excellent agreement with available literature based on statistical parallax
analysis, but are considerably more accurate and precise. Moreover, the
zero-points of our calibrated PLZ and LZ relations are quite consistent with
current results found by other techniques and yield the LMC distance modulus
that is within 0.04\,mag of the current most precise estimate.

to inverse problems has recently gained popularity in applied mathematics,
physics, and engineering. However, traditional Bayesian inference methods based
on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tend to be computationally intensive and
inefficient for such high dimensional problems. To address this issue, several
methods based on surrogate models have been proposed to speed up the inference
process. More specifically, the calibration-emulation-sampling (CES) scheme has
been proven to be successful in large dimensional UQ problems. In this work, we
propose a novel CES approach for Bayesian inference based on deep neural
network models for the emulation phase. The resulting algorithm is
computationally more efficient and more robust against variations in the
training set. Further, by using an autoencoder (AE) for dimension reduction, we
have been able to speed up our Bayesian inference method up to three orders of
magnitude. Overall, our method, henceforth called \emph{Dimension-Reduced
Emulative Autoencoder Monte Carlo (DREAMC)} algorithm, is able to scale
Bayesian UQ up to thousands of dimensions for inverse problems. Using two
low-dimensional (linear and nonlinear) inverse problems we illustrate the
validity of this approach. Next, we apply our method to two high-dimensional
numerical examples (elliptic and advection-diffussion) to demonstrate its
computational advantages over existing algorithms.

Environment perception is usually performed by combining the semantic

information from the respective sensor can be extracted by using convolutional

is still much gap between long-range and short-range dependencies, which
largely reduces the models' flexibility in application to diverse spatial
scales and relationships in complicated natural scene images. To fill such a
gap, we develop a Middle-Range (MR) branch to capture middle-range dependencies

spatial regions which have large correlations with others can be emphasized to
exploit long-range dependencies more accurately, and thus propose a Reweighed
Long-Range (RLR) branch. Based on the proposed MR and RLR branches, we build an
Omni-Range Dependencies Network (ORDNet) which can effectively capture short-,

method is the iterative method of choice for solving systems of linear
algebraic equations $Ax=b$ with a real symmetric positive definite matrix $A$.
During the iterations it is important to monitor the quality of the approximate
solution $x_k$ so that the process could be stopped whenever $x_k$ is accurate
enough. One of the most relevant quantities for monitoring the quality of $x_k$
is the squared $A$-norm of the error vector $x-x_k$. This quantity cannot be
easily evaluated, however, it can be estimated. Many of the existing estimation
techniques are inspired by the view of CG as a procedure for approximating a
certain Riemann--Stieltjes integral. The most natural technique is based on the
Gauss quadrature approximation and provides a lower bound on the quantity of
interest. The bound can be cheaply evaluated using terms that have to be
computed anyway in the forthcoming CG iterations. If the squared $A$-norm of
the error vector decreases rapidly, then the lower bound represents a tight
estimate. In this paper we suggest a heuristic strategy aiming to answer the

higher-order system behaviors, and are encoded using data as the network's
edges. However, distinguishing between true weak edges and low-weight edges
caused by noise remains a challenge. We address this problem by examining the
higher-order structure of noisy, weak edges added to model networks. We find
that the structure of low-weight, noisy edges varies according to the topology
of the model network to which it is added. By investigating this variation more
closely, we see that at least three qualitative classes of noise structure
emerge. Furthermore, we observe that the structure of noisy edges contains
enough model-specific information to classify the model networks with moderate
accuracy. Finally, we offer network generation rules that can drive different
types of structure in added noisy edges. Our results demonstrate that noise
does not present as a monolithic nuisance, but rather as a nuanced,
topology-dependent, and even useful entity in characterizing higher-order
network interactions. Hence, we provide an alternate approach to noise
management by embracing its role in such interactions.

the routing engine learns implicit preferences that human planners have when

distinctively formulating a custom VRP for every company with its own routing
requirements. Instead, we assume the presence of past vehicle routing solutions
over similar sets of customers, and learn to make similar choices. The learning
approach is based on the concept of learning a Markov model, which corresponds
to a probabilistic transition matrix, rather than a deterministic distance
matrix. This nevertheless allows us to use existing arc routing VRP software in
creating the actual routings, and to optimize over both distances and
preferences at the same time. For the learning, we explore different schemes to
construct the probabilistic transition matrix that can co-evolve with changing
preferences over time. Our results on a use-case with a small transportation
company show that our method is able to generate results that are close to the
manually created solutions, without needing to characterize all constraints and
sub-objectives explicitly. Even in the case of changes in the customer sets,
our method is able to find solutions that are closer to the actual routings

changes when transformed into practical routings.

chiral responses of open photonic structures from perspectives of quasi-normal

nontrivial topology of the momentum sphere secures the existence of singularity
directions along which mode radiations are either circularly or linearly
polarized. When plane waves are incident along those directions, the
reciprocity ensures ideal maximization and minimization of optical chiralities,
for corresponding mode radiations of circular and linear polarizations

unveiled the subtle equality of a Stokes parameter and the circular dichroism,
showing that an intrinsically chiral structure can unexpectedly exhibit no

We use a three parameter model of EoR simulated using 21\textrm{cmFAST}, namely
the ionizing efficiency of sources $\zeta$, the minimum virial temperature
$T_{vir}$ required for collapse into a halo and the maximum radius for ionizing
radiation described by $R_{mfp}$. We performed a Bayesian analysis to recover
model parameters for a mock 21cm image from SKA phase I at a redshift of
$z=7.4$ corresponding to a mean neutral hydrogen fraction of $\mathrm{\bar
x}_{HI} \simeq 0.5$. We find that in the absence of noise the average size of
structures in the field with $x_{HI} \lesssim 0.5$ is smaller than regions with
$x_{HI} \gtrsim 0.5$ and the structures are equally isotropic when
$\mathrm{\bar x}_{HI}=0.5$ . We also find that in order to recover the input
model to within $1-\sigma$ accuracy for a mock noisy image at a single
frequency channel of $1~\mathrm{MHz}$, for an observation time
$t_{obs}<2000~\mathrm{hrs}$, the noisy $\delta T_b$ map needs to be smoothed at
a scale $R_s>9.5~\mathrm{Mpc}$. Finally we show that the systematic behaviour
of the statistic as ionization progresses, enables us to obtain stringent
constraints on $\mathrm{\bar x}_{HI}$ (with a coefficient of variation $\sim
0.05$ as compared to $\sim 0.1-0.2$ for model parameter constraints), thereby
making these descriptors a promising statistic for constraining EoR model

The malware applications in a malware family may have common features and

Thus, classifying Android malware into their corresponding families is an
important task in malware analysis. At present, the main problem of existing
research works on Android malware family classification lies in that the
extracted features are inadequate to represent the common behavior
characteristics of the malware in malicious families, and leveraging a single

accuracy of classification. In this paper, we propose FamDroid, a
learning-based Android malware family classification scheme using static

hardware components, app components, intent filters are extracted from the apk

extracted APIs is used to represents the API call relationship in the
application. Then, we design an adaptive weighted ensemble classifier, which
considers the adaptability of the sample to each base classifier, to carry out
accurate malware family classification. We conducted experiments on the Drebin
dataset which contains 5560 Android malicious applications. The superiority of
FamDroid is demonstrated through comparing it with 5 traditional machine
learning models and 4 state-of-the-art reference schemes. FamDroid can
correctly classify 98.92% of malware samples into their families and achieve
99.12% F1-Score.

Hermitian connection on a Hermitian line bundle $L$ over a manifold with a
${\rm Spin}(7)$-structure defined by fully nonlinear PDEs. It was first
introduced by Lee and Leung as a mirror object of a Cayley cycle obtained by
the real Fourier-Mukai transform and its alternative definition was suggested
in our other paper. As the name indicates, a ${\rm Spin}(7)$-dDT connection can
also be considered as an analogue of a Donaldson-Thomas connection (${\rm
Spin}(7)$-instanton).
  In this paper, using our definition, we show that the moduli space
$\mathcal{M}_{{\rm Spin}(7)}$ of ${\rm Spin}(7)$-dDT connections has similar
properties to these objects. That is, we show the following for an open subset
$\mathcal{M}'_{{\rm Spin}(7)} \subset \mathcal{M}_{{\rm Spin}(7)}$. (1)
Deformations of elements of $\mathcal{M}'_{{\rm Spin}(7)}$ are controlled by a
subcomplex of the canonical complex introduced by Reyes Carri\'on by
introducing a new ${\rm Spin}(7)$-structure from the initial ${\rm
Spin}(7)$-structure and a ${\rm Spin}(7)$-dDT connection. (2) The expected
dimension of $\mathcal{M}'_{{\rm Spin}(7)}$ is finite. It is $b^1$, the first
Betti number of the base manifold, if the initial ${\rm Spin}(7)$-structure is
torsion-free. (3) Under some mild assumptions, $\mathcal{M}'_{{\rm Spin}(7)}$
is smooth if we perturb the initial ${\rm Spin}(7)$-structure generically. (4)
The space $\mathcal{M}'_{{\rm Spin}(7)}$ admits a canonical orientation if all
deformations are unobstructed.

systems (introduced by the authors in july 2019 during the Simultech
conference, p.176-186) enables us to solve the nonlinear coupling function
while keeping the smoothness of interfaces without introducing a delay.
Moreover, it automatically adapts the size of the steps between data exchanges
among the systems according to the difficulty of the solving of the coupling
constraint. The latter was solved by a fixed-point algorithm in the original
implementation whereas this paper introduces the JFM version (standing for
Jacobian-Free Methods). Most implementations of Newton-like methods require a
jacobian matrix which can be difficult to compute in the co-simulation context,
except in the case where the interfaces are represented by a Zero-Order-Hold
(ZOH). As far as IFOSMONDI coupling algorithm uses Hermite interpolation for
smoothness enhancement (up to Third-Order-Hold), we propose hereafter a new
formulation of the non-linear coupling function including both the values and
the time-derivatives of the coupling variables. This formulation is well
designed for solving the coupling through jacobian-free Newton type methods.
Consequently, successive function evaluations consist in multiple simulations
of the systems on a co-simulation time step using rollback. The
orchestrator-workers structure of the algorithm enables us to combine the PETSc
framework on the orchestrator side for the non-linear Newton-type solvers with
the parallel integrations of the systems on the workers side thanks to MPI
processes. Different nonlinear methods will be compared to one another and to
the original fixed-point implementation on a newly proposed 2-systems academic
test-case (mass-spring-damper type) with direct feedthrough on both sides.

for the lowest orders. The new estimators can be used directly to constrain the
multivariate probability density function of flow fluctuations, since its
functional form can be reconstructed only from its true moments or cumulants.
The new definition for cumulants of azimuthal angles enables separation of
nonflow and flow contributions, and offers first insights into how the
combinatorial background contributes for small multiplicities to flow
measurements with correlation techniques. All the presented results are
supported by Monte Carlo studies using state-of-the-art models.

in hospitals. This paper sets out a framework to assure medication safety that
combines machine learning and safety engineering methods. It uses safety
analysis to proactively identify potential causes of medication error, based on
expert opinion. As healthcare is now data rich, it is possible to augment
safety analysis with machine learning to discover actual causes of medication
error from the data, and to identify where they deviate from what was predicted
in the safety analysis. Combining these two views has the potential to enable
the risk of medication errors to be managed proactively and dynamically. We
apply the framework to a case study involving thoracic surgery, e.g.
oesophagectomy, where errors in giving beta-blockers can be critical to control
atrial fibrillation. This case study combines a HAZOP-based safety analysis
method known as SHARD with Bayesian network structure learning and process
mining to produce the analysis results, showing the potential of the framework
for ensuring patient safety, and for transforming the way that safety is
managed in complex healthcare environments.

solid malignancies have been the subject of intense research. These studies
hold great promise for finding co-targetable hub/pathways which in turn would
control the downstream non-genetic mechanisms of adaptive resistance. Many such
mechanisms have been described in the paradigmatic BRAF-mutated melanoma model
of adaptive response to BRAF inhibition. Currently, a major challenge for these
mechanistic studies is to confirm in vivo, at the single-cell proteomic level,
the existence of dependencies between the co-targeted hub/pathways and their
downstream effectors. Moreover, the drug-induced in vivo modulation of these
dependencies needs to be demonstrated. Here, we implement such
single-cell-based in vivo expression dependency quantification using
immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based analyses of sequential biopsies in two
xenograft models. These mimic phase 2 and 3 trials in our own therapeutic
strategy to prevent the adaptive response to BRAF inhibition. In this
mechanistic model, the dependencies between the targeted Li2CO3-inducible hub
HuR and the resistance effectors are more likely time-shifted and transient
since the minority of HuRLow cells, which act as a reservoir of adaptive
plasticity, switch to a HuRHigh state as they paradoxically proliferate under
BRAF inhibition. Nevertheless, we show that a copula/kernel density estimator
(KDE)-based quantification of mutual information (MI) efficiently captures, at
the individual level, the dependencies between HuR and two relevant resistance
markers pERK and EGFR, and outperforms classic expression correlation
coefficients. Ultimately, the validation of MI as a predictive IHC-based metric
of response to our therapeutic strategy will be carried in clinical trials.

instabilities, driven by the anisotropy of different species of plasma
particles present in the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere. These
instabilities are fast enough to efficiently convert the free energy of plasma
particles into enhanced (small-scale) fluctuations with multiple implications,
regulating the anisotropy of plasma particles. In this paper we use both linear
and quasilinear (QL) frameworks to describe complex unstable regimes, which
realistically combine different temperature anisotropies of electrons and ions
(protons). Thus parameterized are various instabilities, e.g., proton and
electron firehose, electromagnetic ion cyclotron, and whistler instability,
showing that their main linear properties are markedly altered by the interplay
of anisotropic electrons and protons. Linear theory may predict a strong
competition of two instabilities of different nature when their growth rates
are comparable. In the QL phase wave fluctuations grow and saturate at
different levels and temporal scales, by comparison to the individual
excitation of the proton or electron instabilities. In addition, cumulative
effects of the combined proton and electron induced fluctuations can markedly
stimulate the relaxations of their temperature anisotropies. Only whistler
fluctuations inhibit the efficiency of proton firehose fluctuations in the
relaxation of anisotropic protons. These results offer valuable premises for
further investigations in numerical simulations, to decode the full spectrum of
kinetic instabilities resulting from the interplay of anisotropic electrons and
protons in space plasmas.

that encompasses both the class information (group invariant) and symmetric
transformations (group equivariant) of input images. Through these
transformations, we decrease intra-class distance and increase the inter-class
distance. It is then passed through a dimension reduction layer followed by a

AlexNet (CNN) internal representation for better dissemination of simulation

using a novel clustering algorithm that used label proposals as side
information to guide more accurate clusters. Great savings in time and human
input was had. Statistically, FIW shows enormous gains over its predecessors.
We have several benchmarks in kinship verification, family classification,
tri-subject verification, and large-scale search and retrieval. We also trained
CNNs on FIW and deployed the model on the renowned KinWild I and II to gain
SOTA. Most recently, we further augmented FIW with MM. Now, video dynamics,
audio, and text captions can be used in the decision making of kinship
recognition systems. We expect FIW will significantly impact research and
reality. Additionally, we tackled the classic problem of facial landmark
localization. A majority of these networks have objectives based on L1 or L2
norms, which inherit several disadvantages. The locations of landmarks are
determined from generated heatmaps from which predicted landmark locations get
penalized without accounting for the spread: a high scatter corresponds to low
confidence and vice-versa. To address this, we introduced an objective that
penalizes for low confidence. Another issue is a dependency on labeled data,
which is expensive to collect and susceptible to error. We addressed both
issues by proposing an adversarial training framework that leverages unlabeled
data to improve model performance. Our method claims SOTA on renowned
benchmarks. Furthermore, our model is robust with a reduced size: 1/8 the
number of channels is comparable to SOTA in real-time on a CPU. Finally, we
built BFW to serve as a proxy to measure bias across ethnicity and gender
subgroups, allowing us to characterize FR performances per subgroup. We show
performances are non-optimal when a single threshold is used to determine
whether sample pairs are genuine.

  Refinement",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Wildland fires are complex multi-physics problems that span wide spatial
scale ranges. Capturing this complexity in computationally affordable numerical
simulations for process studies and ""outer-loop"" techniques (e.g., optimization
and uncertainty quantification) is a fundamental challenge in reacting flow
research. Further complications arise for propagating fires where a priori
knowledge of the fire spread rate and direction is typically not available. In
such cases, static mesh refinement at all possible fire locations is a
computationally inefficient approach to bridging the wide range of spatial
scales relevant to wildland fire behavior. In the present study, we address
this challenge by incorporating adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in fireFoam, an
OpenFOAM solver for simulations of complex fire phenomena. The AMR
functionality in the extended solver, called wildFireFoam, allows us to
dynamically track regions of interest and to avoid inefficient over-resolution
of areas far from a propagating flame. We demonstrate the AMR capability for
fire spread on vertical panels and for large-scale fire propagation on a
variable-slope surface that is representative of real topography. We show that
the AMR solver reproduces results obtained using much larger statically refined
meshes, at a substantially reduced computational cost.

  Edge Computing Systems",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Federated Learning (FL), a global statistical model is developed by
encouraging mobile users to perform the model training on their local data and
aggregating the output local model parameters in an iterative manner. However,
due to limited energy and computation capability at the mobile devices, the
performance of the model training is always at stake to meet the objective of
local energy minimization. In this regard, Multi-access Edge Computing
(MEC)-enabled FL addresses the tradeoff between the model performance and the
energy consumption of the mobile devices by allowing users to offload a portion
of their local dataset to an edge server for the model training. Since the edge
server has high computation capability, the time consumption of the model
training at the edge server is insignificant. However, the time consumption for
dataset offloading from mobile users to the edge server has a significant
impact on the total time consumption. Thus, resource management in MEC-enabled
FL is challenging, where the objective is to reduce the total time consumption
while saving the energy consumption of the mobile devices. In this paper, we
formulate an energy-aware resource management for MEC-enabled FL in which the
model training loss and the total time consumption are jointly minimized, while
considering the energy limitation of mobile devices. In addition, we recast the
formulated problem as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) to capture
the coupling constraints between the radio resource management and dataset
offloading. We then analyze the impact of the dataset offloading and computing
resource allocation on the model training loss, time, and the energy
consumption.
