Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters
for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with
outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However,
despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered
by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these
with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design
intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs.
Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show
large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision
(bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain
up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources.
These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains
over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the
current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter
models on the ""Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus"" and achieve a 4x speedup over the
T5-XXL model.

that this can be even worse by exhibiting norm inflation with an infinite loss
of regularity. To establish these phenomena, we employ a Fourier analytic
approach and introduce new resonant sets corresponding to the fractional

$\alpha$ is large enough, we obtain norm inflation {above} scaling critical
regularity in some of these spaces. It turns out that our approach could treat
both equations (Hartree and power-type NLS) in a unified manner. The method
should also work for a broader range of nonlinear equations with Hartree-type
nonlinearity.

develops an activity-based modeling framework for individual mobility
prediction. Specifically, an input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) framework
is proposed to simultaneously predict the (continuous) time and (discrete)
location of an individual's next trip using transit smart card data. The
prediction task can be transformed into predicting the hidden activity duration

that the proposed model can achieve similar prediction performance as the
state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Unlike LSTM, the proposed
IOHMM model can also be used to analyze hidden activity patterns, which
provides meaningful behavioral interpretation for why an individual makes a
certain trip. Therefore, the activity-based prediction framework offers a way
to preserve the predictive power of advanced machine learning methods while
enhancing our ability to generate insightful behavioral explanations, which is
useful for enhancing situational awareness in user-centric transportation

the way for the rise of the Internet of Things in industrial applications
(IIoT). However, to cope with increasing demands for reliability and
throughput, several mostly TDMA-based protocols like IEEE 802.15.4 and its
extensions were proposed. Nonetheless, many of these IIoT-protocols still
require contention-based communication, e.g., for slot allocation and broadcast
transmission. In many cases, subtle but hidden patterns characterize this
secondary traffic. Present contention-based protocols are unaware of these
hidden patterns and can therefore not exploit this information. Especially in
dense networks, they often do not provide sufficient reliability for primary
traffic, e.g., they are unable to allocate transmission slots in time. In this
paper, we propose QMA, a contention-based multiple access scheme based on
Q-learning, which dynamically adapts transmission times to avoid collisions by
learning patterns in the contention-based traffic. QMA is designed to be
resource-efficient and targets small embedded devices. We show that QMA solves
the hidden node problem without the additional overhead of RTS / CTS messages
and verify the behaviour of QMA in the FIT IoT-LAB testbed. Finally, QMA's
scalability is studied by simulation, where it is used for GTS allocation in
IEEE 802.15.4 DSME. Results show that QMA considerably increases reliability
and throughput in comparison to CSMA/CA, especially in networks with a high
load.

Adjusting the unconditional in-control (IC) average run length (ARL) makes the

improves the performance of CEL especially for imbalanced EHR data and the
related COVID-19 analyses. This study has been approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We use EHR data
from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) to predict
mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients over 24 and 48 hour time windows. We train two sequential
architectures (RNN and RETAIN) using two loss functions (CEL and CL). Models
are tested on full sample data set which contain all available data and
restricted data set to emulate higher class imbalance.CL models consistently
outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with
differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For
the restricted sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is
able to identify important features, such as pulse oximetry. CL outperforms CEL
in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect to
three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature
importance. We believe that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used
for EHR ML work in general.

However, both observations and simulations support the idea that these

evidence of disruptive events that are capable of fast quenching is rare, and
constraints on their statistical prevalence are lacking. Here we present a
massive starburst galaxy at z=1.4 which is ejecting $46 \pm 13$\% of its

detected in four (low- and high-J) CO and [CI] transitions and in the ionized

this is not a feedback-driven wind, but rather material from a merger that has
been probably tidally ejected. This finding challenges some literature studies

generally assumed, i.e., that the cloud belongs to the near side of the central
molecular zone, at 60 pc from the Galactic center. This assumption was based on
dynamical models of the central molecular zone, observationally constrained
uniquely by the radial velocity of this and other clouds. Determining the true
position of the Brick cloud is relevant because this is the densest cloud of
the Galaxy not showing any ongoing star formation. This puts the cloud off by 1
order of magnitude from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation between the density of
the dense gas and the star formation rate. Several explanations have been

different time-maturities and strikes, means a relevant problem in finance. The
dynamics describing the price of vanilla options when constant volatilities and
interest rates are assumed, is governed by the Black-Scholes model, a linear
parabolic partial differential equation with terminal value given by the
pay-off of the option contract and no additional boundary conditions. Here, we
present a digital quantum algorithm to solve Black-Scholes equation on a
quantum computer by mapping it to the Schr\""odinger equation. The non-Hermitian
nature of the resulting Hamiltonian is solved by embedding its propagator into
an enlarged Hilbert space by using only one additional ancillary qubit.
Moreover, due to the election of periodic boundary conditions, which are needed
for an efficient diagonalization of the discretized momentum operator, we
duplicate the initial condition, which substantially improves the stability and
performance of the protocol. The algorithm shows a feasible approach for using
Hamiltonian simulation techniques to solve the price dynamics of financial
derivatives on a digital quantum computer. Our approach differs from those
based on Monte Carlo integration, exclusively focused on sampling the solution
assuming the dynamics is known. Assuming a bounded truncation error, our
algorithm remarkably provides an exponential speedup with respect to classical
numerical methods when simulating the dynamics, reducing the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$. We report expected
accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using 10 qubits

aim is to obtain second-order statistics of stochastic processes from
compressive measurements. Recently, these methods have been used in various
image processing and communications applications, including denoising, spectrum
sensing, and compression. Notice that estimating the covariance matrix from
compressive samples leads to ill-posed minimizations with severe performance
loss at high compression rates. In this regard, a regularization term is
typically aggregated to the cost function to consider prior information about a
particular property of the covariance matrix. Hence, this paper proposes an
algorithm based on the projected gradient method to recover low-rank or
Toeplitz approximations of the covariance matrix from compressive measurements.
The algorithm divides the compressive measurements into data subsets projected
onto different subspaces and accurately estimates the covariance matrix by
solving a single optimization problem assuming that each data subset contains
an approximation of the signal statistics. Furthermore, gradient filtering is
included at every iteration of the proposed algorithm to minimize the
estimation error. The error induced by the proposed splitting approach is
analytically derived along with the convergence guarantees of the proposed
method. The algorithm estimates the covariance matrix of hyperspectral images
from synthetic and real compressive samples. Extensive simulations show that
the proposed algorithm can effectively recover the covariance matrix of
hyperspectral images from compressive measurements (8-15% approx). Moreover,
simulations and theoretical results show that the filtering step reduces the
recovery error up to twice the number of eigenvectors. Finally, an optical
implementation is proposed, and real measurements are used to validate the
theoretical findings.

for high-performance architectures with reduced computational cost. However,
DAS-based methods mainly focus on searching for a repeatable cell structure,
which is then stacked sequentially in multiple stages to form the networks.
This configuration significantly reduces the search space, and ignores the
importance of connections between the cells. To overcome this limitation, in
this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search
(H-DAS) that performs architecture search both at the cell level and at the
stage level. Specifically, the cell-level search space is relaxed so that the
networks can learn stage-specific cell structures. For the stage-level search,
we systematically study the architectures of stages, including the number of
cells in each stage and the connections between the cells. Based on insightful
observations, we design several search rules and losses, and mange to search
for better stage-level architectures. Such hierarchical search space greatly
improves the performance of the networks without introducing expensive search
cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed H-DAS. Moreover, the searched stage-level
architectures can be combined with the cell structures searched by existing DAS
methods to further boost the performance. Code is available at:

from observations of transiently accreting neutron stars, we show that the heat
capacity of MDCDW quark matter is well above that lower limit and hence cannot
be ruled out. This result adds to a wealth of complementary investigations, all
of which has served to strengthen the viability of a neutron star interior made
of MDCDW quark matter. For completeness, we review the contributions to the
heat capacity of the main neutron star ingredients at low, high and
intermediate densities, with and without the presence of a magnetic field.

that can be linearly polarized up to several percent. This polarization can
reveal the presence of a circumsubstellar accretion disk, rotation-induced
oblateness of the atmosphere, or an inhomogeneous distribution of atmospheric
dust clouds. We measured the near-infrared linear polarization of 20 known
directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarf companions with the high-contrast
imager SPHERE-IRDIS at the VLT. We reduced the data using the IRDAP pipeline to
correct for the instrumental polarization and crosstalk with an absolute
polarimetric accuracy <0.1% in the degree of polarization. We report the first
detection of polarization originating from substellar companions, with a
polarization of several tenths of a percent for DH Tau B and GSC 6214-210 B in
H-band. By comparing the measured polarization with that of nearby stars, we
find that the polarization is unlikely to be caused by interstellar dust.
Because the companions have previously measured hydrogen emission lines and red
colors, the polarization most likely originates from circumsubstellar disks.
Through radiative transfer modeling, we constrain the position angles of the
disks and find that the disks must have high inclinations. The presence of
these disks as well as the misalignment of the disk of DH Tau B with the disk
around its primary star suggest in situ formation of the companions. For the 18
other companions, we do not detect significant polarization and place
subpercent upper limits on their degree of polarization. These non-detections
may indicate the absence of circumsubstellar disks, a slow rotation rate of
young companions, the upper atmospheres containing primarily submicron-sized
dust grains, and/or limited cloud inhomogeneity. Finally, we present images of
the circumstellar disks of DH Tau, GQ Lup, PDS 70, Beta Pic, and HD 106906.

real-world colonoscopy operations due to the significant difference between
images in a real colonoscopy and those in the public datasets. Unlike the
well-chosen clear images with obvious polyps in the public datasets, images
from a colonoscopy are often blurry and contain various artifacts such as
fluid, debris, bubbles, reflection, specularity, contrast, saturation, and
medical instruments, with a wide variety of polyps of different sizes, shapes,
and textures. All these factors pose a significant challenge to effective polyp
detection in a colonoscopy. To this end, we collect a private dataset that

represents realistic operation scenarios and thus can be used to better train
the models and evaluate a system's performance in practice. We propose an

parameter uncertainties is paramount to assess a model's credibility. For
computationally expensive simulations, this is often feasible only via
surrogate models that are learned from a small set of simulation samples. The
surrogate models are commonly chosen and deemed trustworthy based on heuristic
measures, and substituted for the simulation in order to approximately
propagate the simulation input uncertainties to the simulation output. In the
process, the contribution of the uncertainties of the surrogate itself to the
simulation output uncertainties are usually neglected. In this work, we
specifically address the case of doubtful surrogate trustworthiness, i.e.
non-negligible surrogate uncertainties. We find that Bayesian probability
theory yields a natural measure of surrogate trustworthiness, and that
surrogate uncertainties can easily be included in simulation output
uncertainties. For a Gaussian likelihood for the simulation data, with unknown
surrogate variance and given a generalized linear surrogate model, the
resulting formulas reduce to simple matrix multiplications. The framework
contains Polynomial Chaos Expansions as a special case, and is easily extended
to Gaussian Process Regression. Additionally, we show a simple way to

After establishing basic metric and topological properties of

observations show evidence of dislocation emissions from the void surface, a
mechanism possibly facilitates the expansion of the voids and contributes to
the increased void volume fraction. Phenomenological parameters such as stress
triaxiality, often believed to control void growth, are investigated through
crystal plasticity simulation and compared with literature reported data. The
results indicate weak correlation between stress triaxiality and void growth,
but this may be possibly due to the lack of data at higher level of plastic
deformation, which is limited by the ductility of the material. The
distribution of the stress triaxiality field within the sample is heterogeneous
and the peak of the triaxiality field is a function of the ratio between notch
diameter and sample width. A smaller notch diameter to sample width ratio tend
to distribute the triaxiality peaks towards the centre of the sample but also
lead to higher strain localisation, an effect that results in early sample
failure.

previously estimated in the range of $\approx10-300$ yr$^{-1}$, either based on
extrapolations from a handful of very bright optical novae or the nova rates in
nearby galaxies; both methods are subject to debatable assumptions. The total
discovery rate of optical novae remains much smaller ($\approx5-10$ yr$^{-1}$)
than these estimates, even with the advent of all-sky optical time domain
surveys. Here, we present a systematic sample of 12 spectroscopically confirmed
Galactic novae detected in the first 17 months of Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR), a
wide-field near-infrared time domain survey. Operating in $J$-band
($\approx1.2$ $\mu$m) that is relatively immune to dust extinction, the
extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is highly skewed to large extinction
values ($> 50$% of events obscured by $A_V\gtrsim5$ mag). Using recent
estimates for the distribution of mass and dust in the Galaxy, we show that the
observed extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is commensurate with that
expected from dust models. The PGIR extinction distribution is inconsistent
with that reported in previous optical searches (null hypothesis probability $<
0.01$%), suggesting that a large population of highly obscured novae have been
systematically missed in previous optical searches. We perform the first
quantitative simulation of a $3\pi$ time domain survey to estimate the Galactic
nova rate using PGIR, and derive a rate of $\approx 46.0^{+12.5}_{-12.4}$

correlations, the availability of closely competing pairing channels leads to
characteristic soft collective fluctuations of the order parameters, which
leave fingerprints in many observables and allow to scrutinize the phase
competition. Superconducting layered materials, where electron-electron
interactions are enhanced with decreasing thickness, are promising candidates
to display these correlation effects. In this work, we report the existence of
a soft collective mode in single-layer NbSe$_2$, observed as a characteristic
resonance excitation in high resolution tunneling spectra. This resonance is
observed along with higher harmonics, its frequency $\Omega/2\Delta$ is
anticorrelated with the local superconducting gap $\Delta$, and its amplitude
gradually vanishes by increasing the temperature and upon applying a magnetic
field up to the critical values (T$_C$ and H$_{C2}$), which sets an unambiguous
link to the superconducting state. Aided by a microscopic model that captures
the main experimental observations, we interpret this resonance as a collective
Leggett mode that represents the fluctuation towards a proximate f-wave triplet
state, due to subleading attraction in the triplet channel. Our findings
demonstrate the fundamental role of correlations in superconducting 2D
transition metal dichalcogenides, opening a path towards unconventional
superconductivity in simple, scalable and transferable 2D superconductors.

consuming vertical videos on hand-held devices. To revitalize the exposure of
horizontal contents, we hereby set forth the exploration of automated
horizontal-to-vertical (abbreviated as H2V) video conversion with our proposed
H2V framework, accompanied by an accurately annotated H2V-142K dataset.
Concretely, H2V framework integrates video shot boundary detection, subject
selection and multi-object tracking to facilitate the subject-preserving
conversion, wherein the key is subject selection. To achieve so, we propose a
Rank-SS module that detects human objects, then selects the subject-to-preserve
via exploiting location, appearance, and salient cues. Afterward, the framework
automatically crops the video around the subject to produce vertical contents
from horizontal sources. To build and evaluate our H2V framework, H2V-142K
dataset is densely annotated with subject bounding boxes for 125 videos with
132K frames and 9,500 video covers, upon which we demonstrate superior subject
selection performance comparing to traditional salient approaches, and exhibit
promising horizontal-to-vertical conversion performance overall. By publicizing
this dataset as well as our approach, we wish to pave the way for more valuable
endeavors on the horizontal-to-vertical video conversion task.

  Modern systems may produce such a large amount of events monitoring every

aggregated over a fixed period of time, reporting the number of times every
event has occurred in that time period. This aggregation facilitates scaling,
but requires a different approach for anomaly detection. In this research, we

between aggregated events. Based on the initial phase of our research we
present graphs representations of our aggregated dataset, which represent the
different relationships between aggregated instances in the same context.
  Using the graph representation, we propose Multiple-graphs autoencoder MGAE,
a novel convolutional graphs-autoencoder model which exploits the relationships
of the aggregated instances in our unique dataset. MGAE outperforms standard
graph-autoencoder models and the different experiments. With our novel MGAE we
present 60% decrease in reconstruction error in comparison to standard graph
autoencoder, which is expressed in reconstructing high-degree relationships.

intense coexistence increases domestic violence, while social distancing

or presence of the deterrence system of domestic violence against women and (b)
measures to increase social distancing. VIDA presents comparative results for
metropolitan regions and neighbourhoods considered in the experiments. Results
suggest that social distancing measures, particularly those encouraging staying
at home, may have increased domestic violence against women by about 10%. VIDA
suggests further that more populated areas have comparatively fewer cases per
hundred thousand women than less populous capitals or rural areas of urban
concentrations. This paper contributes to the literature by formalising, to the
best of our knowledge, the first model of domestic violence through agent-based

However, very low-quality inputs cannot offer accurate geometric prior while
high-quality references are inaccessible, limiting the applicability in

Thanks to the powerful generative facial prior and delicate designs, our

49 AGN. The SFMS is explored at log M > 8 and it is clearly defined by the blue
galaxies, with the red galaxies located below them. The SFMS is described as
log SFR = 0.83 log M - 8.44. We find a good agreement with previous estimations
of the SFMS, especially those based on integral field spectroscopy. The Halpha
luminosity function of the AGN-free sample is well described by a Schechter

monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) is an especially rich system owing to its low

within the correlated phase diagram of tMBG, giving rise to the anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) in correlated metallic states nearby most odd integer fillings of
the flat conduction band, as well as correlated Chern insulator states
stabilized in an external magnetic field. The behavior of the states at zero
field appears to be inconsistent with simple spin and valley polarization for
the specific range of twist angles we investigate, and instead may plausibly
result from an intervalley coherent (IVC) state with an order parameter that
breaks time reversal symmetry. The application of a magnetic field further
tunes the competition between correlated states, in some cases driving
first-order topological phase transitions. Our results underscore the rich
interplay between closely competing correlated ground states in tMBG, with
possible implications for probing exotic IVC ordering.

directions have recently attracted considerable attention. Here, a method for
identifying cosine-dependence in a dataset of galaxies annotated by their spin
directions is described in the light of different aspects that can impact the
statistical analysis of the data. These aspects include the presence of
duplicate objects in a dataset, errors in the galaxy annotation process, and
non-random distribution of the asymmetry that does not necessarily form a
dipole or quadrupole axes. The results show that duplicate objects in the
dataset can artificially increase the likelihood of cosine dependence detected
in the data, but a very high number of duplicate objects is required to lead to
a false detection of an axis. Inaccuracy in galaxy annotations has relatively
minor impact on the identification of cosine dependence when the error is
randomly distributed between clockwise and counterclockwise galaxies. However,
when the error is not random, even a small bias of 1% leads to a statistically
significant cosine dependence that peaks at the celestial pole. Experiments
with artificial datasets in which the distribution was not random showed strong
cosine dependence even when the data did not form a full dipole axis alignment.
The analysis when using the unmodified data shows asymmetry profile similar to
the profile shown in multiple previous studies using several different
telescopes.

can be tested with spectral distortions (SDs) of the cosmic microwave

elastically with photons, electrons or nuclei imprints a negative chemical
potential $\mu$ to the CMB spectrum. This article revisits the first study of
this effect, with an accurate treatment of heat exchange between DM and SM
particles. We show that the instantaneous-decoupling approximation made in the
original study systematically and significantly underestimates the amplitude of
SDs. As a consequence, we derive tighter upper bounds to the DM-SM
elastic-scattering cross section for DM masses $m_\chi \lesssim 0.1$ MeV, from
the non-detection of $\mu$-distortions by FIRAS. We also show that a future
instrument like PIXIE, sensitive to $|\mu| \sim 10^{-8}$, would be able to
probe DM-SM cross sections much smaller than first forecasted, and orders of
magnitude below current upper limits from CMB-anisotropy data, up to DM masses
of $\sim 1$ GeV. Lastly, we study the sensitivity of SDs to the electric and
magnetic dipole moments of the DM. Although SDs can place non-trivial
constraints on these models, we find that even future SD experiments are
unlikely to improve upon the best current bounds. This article is accompanied
by the public code DMDIST, which allows one to compute CMB SDs for generic

for the growth of filamentous actin. Actin polymerization can generate a local
outward push on the membrane. Inward pull from the contractile actomyosin
cortex can propagate along the membrane via actin filaments. We use coupled
evolution of fields to perform linear stability analysis and numerical
calculations. As activity overcomes the stabilizing factors such as surface
tension and bending rigidity, the spherical membrane shows instability towards
pattern formation, localized pulsation, and running pulsation between poles. We
present our results in terms of phase diagrams and evolutions of the coupled
fields. They have relevance for living cells and can be verified in experiments
on artificial cell-like constructs.

graphs which are analogue of eigenvalue instantons in matrix models. The phase
structure of exponential random graphs with chemical potential for 4-cycles and
degree preserving constraint is clarified. The first order phase transition at
critical value of chemical potential for 4-cycles into bipartite phase with a
formation of fixed number of bipartite clusters is found for ensemble of random
regular graphs (RRG). We consider the similar phase transition in combinatorial
quantum gravity based of the Ollivier graph curvature for RRG supplemented with
hard-core constraint and show that a order of a phase transition and the
structure of emerging phase depend on a vertex degree d in RRG. For d = 3 the
bipartite closed ribbon emerges at bipartite phase while for d > 3 the ensemble
of isolated or weakly interacting hypercubes supplemented with the bipartite
closed ribbon gets emerged at the first order phase transition with a clear-cut
hysteresis. If the additional connectedness condition is imposed the bipartite
phase gets identified as the closed chain of weakly coupled hypercubes. Since
the ground state of isolated hypercube is the thermofield double (TFD) we
suggest that the dual holographic picture involves multiboundary wormholes.
Treating RRG as a model of a Hilbert space for a interacting many-body system
we discuss the patterns of the Hilbert space fragmentation at the phase
transition. We also briefly comment on a possible relation of the found phase
transition to the problem of holographic interpretation of a partial
deconfinement transition in the gauge theories.

employed in order to conduct a multi-class entity normalization task. In

the encoder output embedding representations for the outcomes and labels was
utilized. Finally, cosine similarity was calculated across the vectors to
obtain the semantic similarity. This method was able to both harness the
domain-specific context of each of the tokens from the learned embeddings of
the BioBERT model as well as a more stable metric of sentence similarity. Some
common outcomes identified using the Jaccard similarity in each of the

source population. Here $\alpha$ is the spectral index and $\E33$ is the mean
FRB energy in units of $10^{33} \, {\rm J}$ across a $2128 - 2848\; {\rm MHz}$
band in the FRB rest frame. We have considered several different FRB energy
distributions, and also different scenarios for the scattering pulse
broadening, the event rate density variation with $z$ and the host dispersion
measure. We find that in all cases, the common allowed region includes the
range $-3.9\leq\alpha\leq-1.3$ and $0.42\leq\E33\leq1$. In all case, large
values $\alpha > 4$ and $\E33 >60$ are ruled out. Considering the allowed
$(\alpha, \E33)$ parameter range, we predict that CHIME is unlikely to detect
an FRB with extra-galactic dispersion measure $(DM_{Ex})$ exceeding $3700\,{\rm

anticipated from CHIME would falsify the assumptions of the present analysis.
Our analysis is expected to yield tighter parameter constraints with the advent

the rapid mixing of a random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which reveals
that the complexity of Bayesian learning of sparse equivalence classes grows
only polynomially in $n$ and $p$, under some high-dimensional assumptions. A
series of high-dimensional consistency results is obtained, including the
strong selection consistency of an empirical Bayes model for structure
learning. Our proof is based on two new results. First, we derive a general
mixing time bound on finite state spaces, which can be applied to local MCMC
schemes for other model selection problems. Second, we construct
high-probability search paths on the space of equivalence classes with node
degree constraints by proving a combinatorial property of DAG comparisons.

candidate to foster the ambition of a greener aviation. Despite the relevant
amount of research carried out in the last years, several aspects of this novel
configuration still need further insight to pave the way to future
applications. Among them, the coupled flight-dynamic and aeroelastic response
is addressed in this work by means of a dedicated in-house framework. For the
evaluation of the aerodynamic forces, an enhanced Doublet Lattice Method, able
to take into account terms typically neglected by classic formulations, is
employed. First, flight-dynamic aspects are considered, showing how effects of
interaction between Short Period or Dutch Roll with elastic modes remarkably
deteriorate the flying qualities. Then, focus is on the aeroelastic stability
of the aircraft. As observed also in previous literature efforts on this
configuration, flutter onset is considerably different when considering the
aircraft being free in the air or fixed in space. Thanks to the adopted
formulation it is shown how, for this PrandtlPlane, the aerodynamic coupling of
elastic and rigid modes has a beneficial effect on flutter onset. However, the
different modal properties, consequence of the diverse boundary conditions,
when switching from fixed-in-space to free-flying aircraft, also play a
relevant role in determining the occurrence of flutter. Whereas for the
longitudinal case both effects contribute increasing flutter speed, for the
lateral-directional case the variation in modal properties has a detrimental
and dominating effect, leading to a flutter speedwell within the flight
envelope.Finally,the work discusses the contributions of the additional terms
modeled by the enhanced Doublet Lattice Method, showing how they induce a
considerable effect when modeling the flight dynamics of the flexible aircraft.

780 nm, using the high-resolution ESPRESSO spectrograph. The derived planetary
transmission spectrum exhibits features at all wavelengths where the parent
star shows strong absorption lines, for example, NaI, MgI, FeI, FeII, CaI, VI,
H$\alpha$, and KI. We interpreted these features as the signature of the
deformation of the stellar line profiles due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,
combined with the centre-to-limb effects on the stellar surface, which is in
agreement with similar reports recently presented in the literature. We also
searched for species that might be present in the planetary atmosphere but not
in the stellar spectra, such as TiO and VO, and obtained a negative result.
Thus, we find no evidence of any planetary absorption, including previously
reported NaI, in the atmosphere of HD 209458b. The high signal-to-noise ratio
in the transmission spectrum allows us to compare the modelled deformation of
the stellar lines in assuming different one-dimensional stellar atmospheric
models. We conclude that the differences among various models and observations
remain within the precision limits of the data. However, the transmission light
curves are better explained when the centre-to-limb variation is not included
in the computation and only the Rossiter-McLaughlin deformation is considered.
This demonstrates that ESPRESSO is currently the best facility for spatially
resolving the stellar surface spectrum in the optical range using transit
observations and carrying out empirical validations of stellar models.

arising from spatial weight sharing disappear in the infinite limit. This is
undesirable, as spatial correlation is the main motivation behind CNNs. We show
that the loss of this property is not a consequence of the infinite limit, but
rather of choosing an independent weight prior. Correlating the weights
maintains the correlations in the activations. Varying the amount of
correlation interpolates between independent-weight limits and mean-pooling.
Empirical evaluation of the infinitely wide network shows that optimal
performance is achieved between the extremes, indicating that correlations can
be useful.

a new method for neural re-rendering of a human under a novel user-defined pose

shape as a parametric mesh which can be reconstructed from a single image and
easily reposed. Instead of a colour-based UV texture map, our approach further
employs a learned high-dimensional UV feature map to encode appearance. This
rich implicit representation captures detailed appearance variation across
poses, viewpoints, person identities and clothing styles better than learned
colour texture maps. The body model with the rendered feature maps is fed
through a neural image-translation network that creates the final rendered
colour image. The above components are combined in an end-to-end-trained neural
network architecture that takes as input a source person image, and images of
the parametric body model in the source pose and desired target pose.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach produces higher quality
single image re-rendering results than existing methods.

approach is to limit the ability of a particular adversary who seeks to
maximize parity. Unfortunately, representations produced by adversarial

that these maximally supersymmetric holographic correlators exhibit a hidden
dimensional reduction structure \`a la Parisi and Sourlas. This emergent
structure allows the correlators to be compactly expressed in terms of only
scalar exchange diagrams in a dimensionally reduced spacetime, where formally
both the AdS and the sphere factors have four dimensions less. We also
demonstrate the superconformal properties of holographic correlators under the
chiral algebra and topological twistings. For $AdS_5\times S^5$ and
$AdS_7\times S^4$, we obtain closed form expressions for the meromorphic
twisted correlators from the maximally R-symmetry violating limit of the
holographic correlators. The results are compared with independent field theory
computations in 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and the 6d $(2,0)$ theory, finding
perfect agreement. For $AdS_4\times S^7$, we focus on an infinite family of
near-extremal four-point correlators, and extract various protected OPE
coefficients from supergravity. These OPE coefficients provide new holographic

In deriving these results, we also develop many technical tools which should

photometric time series for hundreds of main-sequence stars with
gravito-inertial (g) pulsation modes. This high precision allows us to evaluate
increasingly detailed theoretical stellar models. Recent theoretical work
extended the traditional approximation of rotation (TAR), a framework to
evaluate the effect of the Coriolis acceleration on g-modes, to include the
effects of the centrifugal acceleration in the approximation of slightly
deformed stars, which so far had mostly been neglected in asteroseismology.
This extension of the TAR was conceived by rederiving the TAR in a
centrifugally deformed, spheroidal coordinate system. We explore the effect of
the centrifugal acceleration on g modes and assess its detectability in
space-based photometry. We implement the new framework to calculate the
centrifugal deformation of precomputed 1D spherical stellar structure models
and compute the corresponding g-mode frequencies, assuming uniform rotation.
The framework is evaluated for a grid of stellar structure models covering a
relevant parameter space for observed g-mode pulsators. The centrifugal
acceleration modifies the effect of the Coriolis acceleration on g modes,
narrowing the equatorial band in which they are trapped. Furthermore, the
centrifugal acceleration causes the pulsation periods and period spacings of
the most common g modes (prograde dipole modes and r modes) to increase with
values similar to the observational uncertainties in Kepler and TESS data. The
effect of the centrifugal acceleration on g~modes is formally detectable in
modern space photometry. Implementation of the new theoretical framework in
stellar structure and pulsation codes will allow for more precise asteroseismic
modelling of centrifugally deformed stars, to assess its effect on mode

While current machine learning algorithms in this area rely on
scientist-derived instability metrics, our new technique learns its own metrics
from scratch, enabled by a novel internal structure inspired from dynamics
theory. Our Bayesian neural network model can accurately predict not only if,
but also when a compact planetary system with three or more planets will go
unstable. Our model, trained directly from short N-body time series of raw
orbital elements, is more than two orders of magnitude more accurate at
predicting instability times than analytical estimators, while also reducing
the bias of existing machine learning algorithms by nearly a factor of three.
Despite being trained on compact resonant and near-resonant three-planet
configurations, the model demonstrates robust generalization to both
non-resonant and higher multiplicity configurations, in the latter case
outperforming models fit to that specific set of integrations. The model
computes instability estimates up to five orders of magnitude faster than a
numerical integrator, and unlike previous efforts provides confidence intervals
on its predictions. Our inference model is publicly available in the SPOCK

delivery of dust from the disc to the wind. In the case of ionized winds, the
disc and wind are sharply delineated by a narrow ionization front where the gas
density and temperature vary by more than an order of magnitude. Using a novel
method that is able to model the transport of dust across the ionization front
in the presence of disc turbulence, we revisit the problem of dust delivery.
Our results show that the delivery of dust to the wind is determined by the
vertical gas flow through the disc induced by the mass loss, rather than
turbulent diffusion (unless the turbulence is strong, i.e. $\alpha \gtrsim
0.01$). Using these results we provide a simple relation between the maximum
size of particle that can be delivered to the wind and the local mass-loss rate
per unit area from the wind. This relation is independent of the physical
origin of the wind and predicts typical sizes in the 0.01 -- $1\,\mu m$ range

zero across the transition; as we discuss, this implies that LIOMs abruptly
become unstable at some critical localization length of order unity. We analyze
the LIOMs using hydrodynamic projections and isolating the part of the operator
that is associated with interactions. Equipped with this data we perform a

the remainder of the disc dominated by ambipolar diffusion) is a great
oversimplification. In simple parameterised discs, we find that the Hall effect
is typically the dominant term throughout the majority of the disc. More
importantly, we find that in much of our parameterised discs, at least two
non-ideal processes have coefficients within a factor of 10 of one another,
indicating that both are important and that naming a dominant term underplays
the importance of the other terms. Discs that were self-consistently formed in
our previous studies are also dominated by the Hall effect, and the ratio of
ambipolar diffusion and Hall coefficients is typically less than 10, suggesting
that both terms are equally important and listing a dominant term is
misleading. These conclusions become more robust once the magnetic field

photoevaporation. In this paper we present a parameter-space study of the

a range of initial conditions. We then use recently published models to
determine the mass-loss due to photoevaporation from protoplanetary discs. In

stellar densities as low as in the Galactic field, due to the presence of
intermediate-mass, and massive, stars (>5Msun). These strong radiation fields
lead to the destruction of the gas component in protoplanetary discs within 1
Myr, implying that gas giant planets must either form extremely rapidly (<1
Myr), or that they exclusively form in star-forming regions like Taurus, which
contain no intermediate-mass or massive stars. The latter scenario is in direct
tension with meteoritic evidence from the Solar system that suggests the Sun

Then, the BC anomaly is utilized to prove, in the absence of a topological

infrared-gapped theories with $2$-index (anti)symmetric fermions. We also
contrast the BC anomaly with the $0$-form anomalies and show that it is the

the BC anomaly in vector-like theories compactified on a small spacial circle.
These theories are weakly-coupled, under analytical control, and they admit a

structure with evidence of possible mutual interactions in the form of

provided a description of universal topological properties of all possible band
insulators in all space groups based on crystalline unitary symmetries and time
reversal. While this formalism filled the gap between the mathematical
classification and the practical diagnosis of topological materials, an obvious
limitation is that it only applies to weakly interacting systems-which can be
described within band theory. It is an open question to which extent this
formalism can be generalized to correlated systems that can exhibit symmetry
protected topological phases which are not adiabatically connected to any band
insulator. In this work we address the many facettes of this question by
considering the specific example of a Hubbard diamond chain. This model
features a Mott insulator, a trivial insulating phase and an obstructed atomic
limit phase. Here we discuss the nature of the Mott insulator and determine the
phase diagram and topology of the interacting model with infinite density
matrix renormalization group calculations, variational Monte Carlo simulations
and with many-body topological invariants. We then proceed by considering a
generalization of the TQC formalism to Green's functions combined with the
concept of topological Hamiltonian to identify the topological nature of the
phases, using cluster perturbation theory to calculate the Green's functions.
The results are benchmarked with the above determined phase diagram and we
discuss the applicability and limitations of the approach and its possible
extensions.

pump-probe setups to study correlated electronic materials, we review the field
theoretical formalism to compute finite frequency nonlinear electro-optical
responses in centrosymmetric systems starting from basic time dependent
perturbation theory. We express the nonlinear current kernel as a sum of
several causal response functions. These causal functions cannot be evaluated
using perturbative field theory methods, since they are not contour ordered.
Consequently, we associate each response function with a corresponding
imaginary time ordered current correlation function, since the latter can be
factorized using Wick's theorem. The mapping between the response functions and
the correlation functions, suitably analytically continued to real frequencies,
is proven exactly. We derive constraints satisfied by the nonlinear current
kernel and we prove a generalized $f$-sum rule for the nonlinear conductivity,
all of which are consequences of particle number conservation. The constraints
guarantee that the nonlinear static responses are free from spurious
divergences. We apply the theory to compute the gauge invariant nonlinear
conductivity of a system of noninteracting electrons in the presence of weak
disorder. As special cases of this generalized nonlinear response, we discuss
its third harmonic and its instantaneous terahertz Kerr signals. The formalism
can be used to compute the nonlinear conductivity in symmetry broken phases of
electronic systems such as superconductors, density waves and nematic states.

information processing in the brain is widely believed to mainly follow the
forward pre to post-synaptic neurons direction. Challenging this prevalent
view, in this paper, we emit the backpropagation-based recollection hypothesis
as follows: weak and fast fading Action Potentials following the (highest
weight) post to pre-synaptic backward pathways, mediate explicit cue-based
memory recall. This includes also the tasks of imagination, future episodic
thinking, language understanding and associating names to various stimuli.
These signals originate in highly invariant neurons, which uniquely respond to
some specific stimuli (e.g. image of a cat). They then travel backwards to
reactivate the same populations of neurons that uniquely respond to this
specific stimuli during perception, thus recreating ""offline"" an experience
that is similar. After stating our hypothesis in details, we challenge its
assumptions through a thorough literature review. We find abundant evidence
that supports most of its assumptions, including the existence of
backpropagating signals that have interesting properties. We then leverage
simulations based on existing spiking neural network models with STDP learning
to show the computational feasibility of using such a mechanism to map the
image of an object to its name with the same high accuracy as a state of the
art machine learning classifier. Although not yet a theory, we believe this
hypothesis presents a paradigm shift that is worth further investigating: it
opens the way, among others, to new interpretations of language acquisition and
understanding, the interplay between memories encoding and retrieval, as well
as reconciling the apparently opposed views between sparse coding and
distributed representations.

understand the capabilities and limitations of JWST when attempting to detect
atmospheric constituents for potentially Earth-like worlds orbiting cool stars.
Here, we explore coupled climate-chemistry atmospheric models for Earth-like
planets orbiting a grid of M dwarf hosts. Using a newly-developed and validated
JWST instrument model - the JWST Exoplanet Transit Simulator (JETS) - we
investigate the detectability of key biosignature and habitability indicator
gaseous species for a variety of relevant instruments and observing modes.
Spectrally-resolved detection scenarios as well as cases where the spectral

considering information gained over an entire observable spectral range. When
considering the entire spectral coverage of an instrument/mode, detections of
methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen and water at signal-to-noise ratio 5 could be
achieved with observations of several tens of transits (or less) for cloud-free
Earth-like worlds orbiting mid- to late-type M dwarfs at system distances of up
to 10-15 pc. When compared to previous results, requisite exposure times for
gas species detection depend on approaches to quantifying the spectral impact
of the species as well as underlying photochemical model assumptions. Thus,
constraints on atmospheric abundances, even if just upper limits, by JWST have

flows involving large density contrasts, using a Volume-of-Fluid method. We
employ the conservative formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations for immiscible fluids in order to ensure consistency between the
discrete transport of mass and momentum in both fluids. This strategy is
implemented on a uniform 3D Cartesian grid with a staggered configuration of
primitive variables, wherein a geometrical reconstruction based mass advection
is carried out on a grid twice as fine as that for the momentum. The
implementation is in the spirit of Rudman (1998) [41], coupled with the
extension of the direction-split time integration scheme of Weymouth & Yue
(2010) [46] to that of conservative momentum transport. The resulting numerical
method ensures discrete consistency between the mass and momentum propagation,
while simultaneously enforcing conservative numerical transport to arbitrary
levels of precision in 3D. We present several quantitative comparisons with
benchmarks from existing literature in order to establish the accuracy of the
method, and henceforth demonstrate its stability and robustness in the context
of a complex turbulent interfacial flow configuration involving a falling

their corresponding fusion categories) and Conformal Field Theory (CFT).
Besides being a mathematically interesting topic on its own, subfactors have
also attracted the attention of physicists, since there is a conjectured
correspondence between these and CFTs. Although there is quite a persuasive
body of evidence for this conjecture, there are some gaps: there exists a set
of exceptional subfactors with no known counterpart CFT. Hence, it is necessary
to develop new techniques for building a CFT from a subfactor. Here, it is
useful to study the underlying mathematical structure in more detail: The even
parts of every subfactor give rise to two Unitary Fusion Categories (UFCs), and
it is a promising direction to study quantum spin systems constructed from
these categories to find a connection to CFTs. The simplest example that
requires new techniques for building a CFT is the Haagerup subfactor, since it
is the smallest subfactor with index larger than 4. In this thesis, we
investigate the question whether there is a CFT corresponding to the Haagerup
subfactor via lattice models in one and two dimensions. The first task here is
to find the F-symbols of the fusion category since these are crucial
ingredients for the construction of a physical model in all of the models we
consider in this thesis. We then investigate microscopic models such as the
golden chain model and the Levin-Wen model in order to find evidence for a
corresponding CFT. We find that there is no evidence for a corresponding CFT
from the investigation of the UFCs directly and it is necessary to expand these
studies to the corresponding unitary modular tensor category, which can, for
instance, be obtained via the excitations of the Levin-Wen model.

property of outflows powered by reflection-driven Alfven-wave (AW) turbulence,
in which outward-propagating AWs partially reflect, and counter-propagating AWs
interact to produce a cascade of fluctuation energy to small scales, which
leads to turbulent heating. Approximating the sub-Alfvenic region as
isothermal, I first present a simplified calculation of the mass outflow rate,
asymptotic wind speed, and coronal temperature that neglects conductive losses
and the wave pressure force. I then develop a more detailed model of the
transition region, corona, and solar wind that accounts for the heat flux from
the coronal base into the transition region and momentum deposition by AWs. I
solve analytically for this heat flux by balancing, within the transition
region, conductive heating against internal-energy losses from radiation, pdV
work, and advection. The density at the coronal base is determined by locally
balancing turbulent heating and radiative cooling. I solve the equations of the

Through analyzing stellar kinematics of N-body model snapshots of a galaxy

  Transformer","24 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A biomedical relation statement is commonly expressed in multiple sentences
and consists of many concepts, including gene, disease, chemical, and mutation.
To automatically extract information from biomedical literature, existing
biomedical text-mining approaches typically formulate the problem as a
cross-sentence n-ary relation-extraction task that detects relations among n
entities across multiple sentences, and use either a graph neural network (GNN)
with long short-term memory (LSTM) or an attention mechanism. Recently,
Transformer has been shown to outperform LSTM on many natural language
processing (NLP) tasks. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that
combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with Graph
Transformer (BERT-GT), through integrating a neighbor-attention mechanism into
the BERT architecture. Unlike the original Transformer architecture, which
utilizes the whole sentence(s) to calculate the attention of the current token,
the neighbor-attention mechanism in our method calculates its attention
utilizing only its neighbor tokens. Thus, each token can pay attention to its
neighbor information with little noise. We show that this is critically
important when the text is very long, as in cross-sentence or abstract-level
relation-extraction tasks. Our benchmarking results show improvements of 5.44%
and 3.89% in accuracy and F1-measure over the state-of-the-art on n-ary and
chemical-protein relation datasets, suggesting BERT-GT is a robust approach
that is applicable to other biomedical relation extraction tasks or datasets.

sources: high frequencies by inter-particle shocks and low frequencies by
global motion and large scale deformation. To unravel these different
mechanisms, an experimental study has been performed on the seismic waves
emitted by dry quasi steady granular flows. The emitted seismic waves were
recorded using shock accelerometers and the flow dynamics were captured with a
fast camera. The mechanical characteristics of the particle shocks were
analyzed, along with the duration between shocks and the correlations in the
particle motion. The high-frequency seismic waves (1-50 kHz) were found to
originate from particle shocks and waves trapped in the flowing layer. The
low-frequency waves (20-60 Hz) were generated by the oscillations of the
particles along their trajectories, i.e. from cycles of dilation/compression
during the shear. The profiles of granular temperature (i.e. the square of
particle velocity fluctuations) and average velocity were measured and related
to the average properties of the flow as well as to the slope angle and flow
thickness. These profiles were then used in a simple steady granular flow model
to predict the radiated seismic energy and the energetic efficiency, i.e. the
fraction of the flow potential energy converted to seismic energy. Scaling laws
relating the seismic power, the shear strain rate and the inertial number were
derived. In particular, the emitted seismic power is proportional to the
granular temperature, which is also related to the mean flow velocity.

protection when training machine learning models among distributed clients
collaboratively, recent studies have pointed out that the naive FL is
susceptible to gradient leakage attacks. In the meanwhile, Differential Privacy
(DP) emerges as a promising countermeasure to defend against gradient leakage
attacks. However, the adoption of DP by clients in FL may significantly
jeopardize the model accuracy. It is still an open problem to understand the
practicality of DP from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we make the
first attempt to understand the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the
number of conducted iterations. Based on the FedAvg algorithm, we formally
derive the convergence rate with DP noises in FL. Then, we theoretically
derive: 1) the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge as the number of
global iterations (GI) approaches infinity; 2) the method to set the number of
local iterations (LI) to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. By
further substituting the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms into the derived
convergence rate respectively, we show that: 3) The DP based FedAvg with the
Laplace mechanism cannot converge, but the divergence rate can be effectively
prohibited by setting the number of LIs with our method; 4) The learning error
of the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian mechanism can converge to a constant
number finally if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI. To verify our
theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments using two real-world
datasets. The results not only validate our analysis results, but also provide
useful guidelines on how to optimize model accuracy when incorporating DP into
FL

instability of soft slender tubes under surface tension and axial stretching.
The primary questions pondered here are: under what loading conditions, if any,
can bifurcation into circumferential buckling modes occur, and do such
solutions dominate localisation and periodic axial modes? Three distinct
boundary conditions are considered; in case 1 the tube's curved surfaces are
traction free and under surface tension, whilst in cases 2 and 3 the inner and
outer surfaces (respectively) are fixed to prevent radial displacement and
surface tension. A linear bifurcation analysis is conducted to determine
numerically the existence of circumferential mode solutions. In case 1 we focus
on the tensile stress regime given the preference of slender compressed tubes
towards Euler buckling over axial wrinkling. We show that tubes under several
loading paths are highly sensitive to circumferential modes; in contrast,
localised and periodic axial modes are absent, suggesting that the
circumferential buckling is dominant by default. In case 2, circumferential
mode solutions are associated with negative surface tension values and thus are
physically implausible. Circumferential buckling solutions are shown to exist
in case 3 for tensile and compressive axial loads, and we demonstrate for
multiple loading scenarios their dominance over localisation and periodic axial
modes within specific parameter regimes.

computationally challenging, as the massive size of the images causes excessive
strain on all parts of the computing pipeline. This paper proposes a novel deep
learning-based methodology for improving the computational efficiency of
histology image classification. The proposed approach is robust when used with
images that have reduced input resolution and can be trained effectively with
limited labeled data. Pre-trained on the original high-resolution (HR) images,
our method uses knowledge distillation (KD) to transfer learned knowledge from
a teacher model to a student model trained on the same images at a much lower
resolution. To address the lack of large-scale labeled histology image
datasets, we perform KD in a self-supervised manner. We evaluate our approach
on two histology image datasets associated with celiac disease (CD) and lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Our results show that a combination of KD and
self-supervision allows the student model to approach, and in some cases,
surpass the classification accuracy of the teacher, while being much more
efficient. Additionally, we observe an increase in student classification
performance as the size of the unlabeled dataset increases, indicating that
there is potential to scale further. For the CD data, our model outperforms the
HR teacher model, while needing 4 times fewer computations. For the LUAD data,
our student model results at 1.25x magnification are within 3% of the teacher
model at 10x magnification, with a 64 times computational cost reduction.
Moreover, our CD outcomes benefit from performance scaling with the use of more
unlabeled data. For 0.625x magnification, using unlabeled data improves
accuracy by 4% over the baseline. Thus, our method can improve the feasibility
of deep learning solutions for digital pathology with standard computational
hardware.

the range 3750-7100 {\AA}. The ratios of the production rates C2/CN and C3/CN
correspond to the typical comets, not depleted in the carbon-chain. A complex
structure of the coma was detected in both observational periods. In January
2017, the dust was in general concentrated near the nucleus, the dust/gas ratio
was 2.9 in the r-sdss filter, however, this ratio was larger than 1 at
distances 3000-40000 km from the nucleus. We found that about 75% of the flux
of the reflected light in the central pixel was due to the nucleus, whereas the
nucleus's flux contributed 48% in the total intensity of the 2000 km area of
the coma. We found that after correction for the dust coma contamination the
nucleus magnitude is 18.8m+/-0.2m.

technologies has been presented as the proposed system to solve all the
weaknesses of current systems. Distributed ledger technologies are completely
decentralized and there is no centralization on them by any institution.
Distributed ledger technologies have different variants. Among distributed
ledger technologies, blockchain technology has been used in the proposed rating
system because of its support for smart contracts. In the proposed online
rating system, the Ethereum platform has been chosen from different blockchain
platforms that have a public permission network. In this system, the raters
cannot rate unless they submit a request to the system and be authorized to
take part in the online product rating process. The important feature of the
Ethereum platform is its support for smart contracts, which can be used to
write the rating contract in the Solidity language. Also, using Proof of
Authority consensus mechanisms, all rating transactions are approved by the
surveyors. Since in the real Ethereum system, each rating transaction is sent
to the network by the raters, some gas must be paid for each rating
transaction. However, since this method is expensive, TestNet blockchain can be
used in the rating system. Finally, the proposed rating system was used for
rating the restaurants of a website and its features were tested.

our relaxed axion minihalos can be described by the Navarro-Frenk-White

physically-motivated model. We develop a semi-analytic formula to fit the mass
function from our simulation, which agrees broadly at different redshifts and
only differs at factor of two level from classic halo mass functions. This
analytic mass function allows us to consider uncertainties in the
post-inflation axion scenario, as well as extrapolate our high-redshift

  Our work estimates the present-day abundance of axion substructures, as is
necessary for predicting their effect on cosmological microlensing caustics and

probes can reach recent sensitivity forecasts, they may be sensitive to the

uncertainties pertaining to axion strings. For pulsar timing, the most
significant caveat is whether axion minihalos are disrupted by stars, which our
estimates show is mildly important at the most relevant masses. Finally, as our
gravitational simulations are scale invariant, the results can be extended to
models where the dark matter is comprised of other axion-like particles and

AI, and other high performance computing (HPC) fields to extract knowledge from
datasets. Each dataset requires tailored NN model architecture, but designing
structures by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Neural
architecture search (NAS) automates the design of NN architectures. NAS
attempts to find well-performing NN models for specialized datsets, where
performance is measured by key metrics that capture the NN capabilities (e.g.,
accuracy of classification of samples in a dataset). Existing NAS methods are
resource intensive, especially when searching for highly accurate models for
larger and larger datasets.
  To address this problem, we propose a performance estimation strategy that
reduces the resources for training NNs and increases NAS throughput without
jeopardizing accuracy. We implement our strategy via an engine called PEng4NN
that plugs into existing NAS methods; in doing so, PEng4NN predicts the final
accuracy of NNs early in the training process, informs the NAS of NN
performance, and thus enables the NAS to terminate training NNs early. We
assess our engine on three diverse datasets (i.e., CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST,
and SVHN). By reducing the training epochs needed, our engine achieves
substantial throughput gain; on average, our engine saves 61% to 82% of
training epochs, increasing throughput by a factor of 2.5 to 5 compared to a
state-of-the-art NAS method. We achieve this gain without compromising
accuracy, as we demonstrate with two key outcomes. First, across all our tests,

chromospheric lines. Theoretical and numerical modeling suggest that they are
produced by the propagation of shock waves. According to these models and early
observations, umbral flashes are associated with upflows. However, recent
studies have reported umbral flashes in downflowing atmospheres. We aim to
understand the origin of downflowing umbral flashes. We explore how the
existence of standing waves in the umbral chromosphere impacts the generation
of flashed profiles. We performed numerical simulations of wave propagation in
a sunspot umbra with the code MANCHA. The Stokes profiles of the Ca II 8542
\AA\ line were synthesized with NICOLE. For freely-propagating waves, the
chromospheric temperature enhancements of the oscillations are in phase with
velocity upflows. In this case, the intensity core of the Ca II 8542 \AA\
atmosphere is heated during the upflowing stage of the oscillation. If we
consider a different scenario with a resonant cavity, the wave reflections at
the sharp temperature gradient of the transition region lead to standing
oscillations. In this situation, temperature fluctuations are shifted backward
and temperature enhancements partially coincide with the downflowing stage of
the oscillation. In umbral flashes produced by standing oscillations, the
reversal of the emission feature is produced when the oscillation is
downflowing. The chromospheric temperature keeps increasing while the
atmosphere is changing from a downflow to an upflow. During the appearance of
flashed Ca II 8542 \AA\ cores, the atmosphere is upflowing most of the time,
and only 38\% of the flashed profiles are associated with downflows. We find a
scenario that remarkably explains the recent empirical findings of downflowing
umbral flashes as a natural consequence of the presence of standing
oscillations above sunspot umbrae.

uncertainties caused by natural disasters have dramatically increased in recent
years. Several of these disasters (e.g., Hurricane Sandy, Mississippi River
Flooding, Hurricane Harvey) severely disrupted the U.S. freight transport
network, and consequently, the supply chain. To account for these network
uncertainties, a stochastic freight traffic assignment model is formulated. An
algorithmic framework, involving the sample average approximation and gradient
projection algorithm, is proposed to solve this challenging problem. The
developed methodology is tested on the U.S. intermodal network with freight
flow data from the Freight Analysis Framework. The experiments consider four
types of natural disasters that have different risks and impacts on the
transportation network: earthquake, hurricane, tornado, and flood. The results
demonstrate the feasibility of the model and algorithmic framework to obtain

are higher compared to the base case without uncertainty. The increase in
freight ton-miles is the highest under the flooding scenario; this is due to
the fact that there are more states in the flood-risk areas and they are

spectra and photometric images were obtained using the focal reducer SCORPIO
attached to the prime focus of the 6-m telescope BTA (SAO RAS, Russia). The
spectra cover the wavelength range of 4200-7000 {\AA}. No emissions of C2 and
CO+, which are expected in this wavelength region, were detected above 3 sigma
level. An upper limit in gas production rate of C2 is expected to be 1.1*10^24
mol*s^-1. The continuum shows a reddening effect with the normalized gradient
of reflectivity along dispersion of 5.1% per 1000 {\AA}. The color indices
(B-V)=0.89 and (V-R) = 0.42 for the nucleus region or (B-V)=0.68 and (V-R)=0.39
for the coma region, which are derived from the photometric data, also evidence
that the color of the cometary nucleus and dust are redder with respect to the
Sun. The dust coma like a spiral galaxy adge on was fitted using a Monte Carlo
model.

in the SED500 and the r-sdss filters near the nucleus but dropped sharply to
~0.2 and ~1 at the distance ~2500 km, respectively. Then these ratios began to
increase at distances ~12000 km from the nucleus, the ratio was ~0.3 (SED500)

changes in physical properties of the dust particles with the distance from the

this, hexagonal cartogram maps (hexbin) used to spatially map COVID-19
mortality and visualise association with patient-level data on demographics and

the parabola $x^2$ is almost surely achieved at a unique location. This result
was proved a decade later by Corwin and Hammond; Moreno Flores, Quastel and
Remenik; and Pimentel. Up to scaling, the Airy$_2$ process minus the parabola
$x^2$ arises as the fixed time spatial marginal of the KPZ fixed point when
started from narrow wedge initial data. We extend this maximizer uniqueness
result to the fixed time spatial marginal of the KPZ fixed point when begun
from any element of a very broad class of initial data.
  None of these results rules out the possibility that at random times, the KPZ
fixed point spatial marginal violates maximizer uniqueness. To understand this
possibility, we study the probability that the KPZ fixed point has, at a given
time, two or more locations where its value is close to the maximum, obtaining
quantitative upper and lower bounds in terms of the degree of closeness for a
very broad class of initial data. We also compute a quantity akin to the joint
density of the locations of two maximizers and the maximum value. As a
consequence, the set of times of maximizer non-uniqueness almost surely has
Hausdorff dimension at most two-thirds.
  Our analysis relies on the exact formula for the distribution function of the
KPZ fixed point obtained by Matetski, Quastel and Remenik, the variational
formula for the KPZ fixed point involving the Airy sheet constructed by
Dauvergne, Ortmann and Vir\'ag, and the Brownian Gibbs property for the

porosities of 10-40%, corresponding to effective thermal inertias of 400-800 J
m^{-2} K^{-1} s^{-1/2}. Combined with past infrared results, as well as
modeling presented here of a previously-unpublished Galileo PPR nighttime
infrared observation, the multi-wavelength constraints are consistent with a
compaction profile whereby the porosity drops from ~85% at the surface to
10{+30/-10}% at depth over a compaction length scale of tens of cm. We present
maps of temperature residuals from the best-fit global models which indicate
localized variations in thermal surface properties at some (but not all) dark

Equatorial regions are warmer than predicted by the model, in particular near

This relation is satisfied by a spinor plane wave and it is consistent with the

boundary equilibrium $x^*$ is a system $F$ that is affine one side of the
boundary and constant on the other side. We prove $x^*$ is exponentially stable
for $f$ if and only if it is exponentially stable for $F$ when the constant
component of $F$ is not tangent to the boundary. We then show exponential
stability and asymptotic stability are in fact equivalent for $F$. We also show
exponential stability is preserved under small perturbations to the pieces of
$F$. Such results are well known for homogeneous systems. To prove the results
here additional techniques are required because the two components of $F$ have
different degrees of homogeneity. The primary function of the results is to
reduce the problem of the stability of $x^*$ from the general Filippov system
$f$ to the simpler system $F$. Yet in general this problem remains difficult.
We provide a four-dimensional example of $F$ for which orbits appear to
converge to $x^*$ in a chaotic fashion. By utilising the presence of both
homogeneity and sliding motion the dynamics of $F$ can in this case be reduced
to the combination of a one-dimensional return map and a scalar function.

this work, we report the study of STT driven DW motion in ferrimagnetic

In addition, a reversal of the domain wall motion direction is observed when
the magnetic compensation composition is crossed. This striking feature,
related to the change of direction of the spin polarization with respect to
that of the net magnetization, is clarified by ab initio band structure
calculations.

only require training of linear output weights whilst the internal reservoir is
formed of fixed randomly connected neurons. With a correctly scaled
connectivity matrix, the neurons' activity exhibits the echo-state property and
responds to the input dynamics with certain timescales. Tuning the timescales
of the network can be necessary for treating certain tasks, and some
environments require multiple timescales for an efficient representation. Here
we explore the timescales in hierarchical ESNs, where the reservoir is
partitioned into two smaller linked reservoirs with distinct properties. Over
three different tasks (NARMA10, a reconstruction task in a volatile
environment, and psMNIST), we show that by selecting the hyper-parameters of
each partition such that they focus on different timescales, we achieve a
significant performance improvement over a single ESN. Through a linear
analysis, and under the assumption that the timescales of the first partition
are much shorter than the second's (typically corresponding to optimal
operating conditions), we interpret the feedforward coupling of the partitions
in terms of an effective representation of the input signal, provided by the
first partition to the second, whereby the instantaneous input signal is
expanded into a weighted combination of its time derivatives. Furthermore, we
propose a data-driven approach to optimise the hyper-parameters through a
gradient descent optimisation method that is an online approximation of
backpropagation through time. We demonstrate the application of the online
learning rule across all the tasks considered.

fine-tuning a language model by using policy gradient reinforcement learning,
directly optimizing for better generation. We apply this approach to minimizing

""exaggerating"" the semantic effect of the class in a query image. We adopted a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate a progressive set of
perturbations to a query image, such that the classification decision changes
from its original class to its negation. We used counterfactual explanations
from our framework to audit a classifier trained on a chest x-ray dataset with
multiple labels. We proposed clinically-relevant quantitative metrics such as
cardiothoracic ratio and the score of a healthy costophrenic recess to evaluate
our explanations.
  We conducted a human-grounded experiment with diagnostic radiology residents
to compare different styles of explanations (no explanation, saliency map,
cycleGAN explanation, and our counterfactual explanation) by evaluating
different aspects of explanations: (1) understandability, (2) classifier's
decision justification, (3) visual quality, (d) identity preservation, and (5)
overall helpfulness of an explanation to the users. Our results show that our
counterfactual explanation was the only explanation method that significantly
improved the users' understanding of the classifier's decision compared to the
no-explanation baseline. Our metrics established a benchmark for evaluating
model explanation methods in medical images. Our explanations revealed that the
classifier relied on clinically relevant radiographic features for its
diagnostic decisions, thus making its decision-making process more transparent

that the derived masses of the component stars are $M_{\rm WR}$ = $9.3\pm1.6

applicability in real-world settings, it is important that they be able to

computing even an epsilon-optimal joint policy is a NEXP complete problem.
Nevertheless, a recently rediscovered insight -- that a team of agents can
coordinate via common knowledge -- has given rise to algorithms capable of
finding optimal joint policies in small common-payoff games. The Bayesian
action decoder (BAD) leverages this insight and deep reinforcement learning to
scale to games as large as two-player Hanabi. However, the approximations it
uses to do so prevent it from discovering optimal joint policies even in games
small enough to brute force optimal solutions. This work proposes CAPI, a novel
algorithm which, like BAD, combines common knowledge with deep reinforcement
learning. However, unlike BAD, CAPI prioritizes the propensity to discover
optimal joint policies over scalability. While this choice precludes CAPI from
scaling to games as large as Hanabi, empirical results demonstrate that, on the
games to which CAPI does scale, it is capable of discovering optimal joint
policies even when other modern multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms
are unable to do so. Code is available at https://github.com/ssokota/capi .

critical to gastroenterologist's response to some life-threatening diseases.
Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has revolutionized traditional endoscopy
procedure by allowing gastroenterologists visualize the entire GI tract
non-invasively. Once the tiny capsule is swallowed, it sequentially capture
images of the GI tract at about 2 to 6 frames per second (fps). A single video
can last up to 8 hours producing between 30,000 to 100,000 images. Automating
the detection of frames containing specific lesion in WCE video would relieve
gastroenterologists the arduous task of reviewing the entire video before
making diagnosis. While the WCE produces large volume of images, only about 5\%
of the frames contain lesions that aid the diagnosis process. Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) based models have been very successful in various image
classification tasks. However, they suffer excessive parameters, are sample
inefficient and rely on very large amount of training data. Deploying a CNN
classifier for lesion detection task will require time-to-time fine-tuning to
generalize to any unforeseen category. In this paper, we propose a metric-based
learning framework followed by a few-shot lesion recognition in WCE data.
Metric-based learning is a meta-learning framework designed to establish
similarity or dissimilarity between concepts while few-shot learning (FSL) aims
to identify new concepts from only a small number of examples. We train a
feature extractor to learn a representation for different small bowel lesions
using metric-based learning. At the testing stage, the category of an unseen
sample is predicted from only a few support examples, thereby allowing the
model to generalize to a new category that has never been seen before. We
demonstrated the efficacy of this method on real patient capsule endoscopy
data.

studies suggest that $\sim$4 M$_{Jup}$ may be a border between two separate
formation scenarios (e.g., core accretion and disk instability) and that
massive giant planets share similar formation mechanisms as lower-mass brown
dwarfs. NGTS-13b is just above 4 M$_{Jup}$ making it an important addition to
the statistical sample needed to understand the differences between various
classes of substellar companions. The high metallicity, [Fe/H] = 0.25 $\pm$

with a revolving beam of ions, and propose goals for the research and
development required to enable future quantum computers with 1000 times more
qubits than available today. The challenge of creating such a large-scale
quantum system while maintaining the necessary coherence of the qubits and the
high fidelity of quantum logic operations is significant. Performing analog
quantum simulations may be an achievable initial goal for such a device.
Quantum simulations of complex quantum systems will move forward both the
fundamental science and the applied research. Nuclear and particle physics,
many-body quantum systems, lattice gauge theories, and nuclear structure
calculations are just a few examples in which a large-scale quantum simulation
system would be a very powerful tool to move forward our understanding of

arbitrary numbers of phases and components. Each phase has a background fluid
called the pure phase, each pair of phases is immiscible, and components are
dissolvable in some specific phases. The model is developed based on the
multiphase Phase-Field model including the contact angle boundary condition,
the diffuse domain approach, and the analyses on the proposed consistency
conditions for multiphase and multicomponent flows. The model conserves the
mass of individual pure phases, the amount of each component in its dissolvable
region, and thus the mass of the fluid mixture, and the momentum of the flow.
It ensures that no fictitious phases or components can be generated and that
the summation of the volume fractions from the Phase-Field model is unity
everywhere so that there is no local void or overfilling. It satisfies a
physical energy law and it is Galilean invariant. A corresponding numerical
scheme is developed for the proposed model, whose formal accuracy is 2nd-order
in both time and space. It is shown to be consistent and conservative and its
solution is demonstrated to preserve the Galilean invariance and energy law.
Numerical tests indicate that the proposed model and scheme are effective and
robust to study various challenging multiphase and multicomponent flows.

Methods: Four simulated populations were created combining different

subject in the population received two attributes, only one of them related to
the infection process. From each population, RDS samples with different sizes
were obtained. Similarly, RDS samples were obtained from a real-world dataset.
Three logistic regression estimators were applied to assess the association
between the attributes and the infection status, and subsequently the observed
coverage of each was measured. Results: The type of connectivity had more
impact on estimators performance than the clusterization level. In simulated
datasets, unweighted logistic regression estimators emerged as the best option,
although all estimators showed a fairly good performance. In the real dataset,
the performance of weighted estimators presented some instabilities, making
them a risky option. Conclusion: An unweighted logistic regression estimator is
a reliable option to be applied to RDS samples, with similar performance to
random samples and, therefore, should be the preferred option.

major advances are frequently in the news.
  The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common
than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic
heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation
for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector
spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor
product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial
neural networks.
  This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including
examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed
include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal
projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators,
and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval,
categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation,
inference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition.
  Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware.
Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and
some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can
help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these
overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way.

quantum Tsallis entropy. Our goal in this paper is to propose a new

inspired by general Tsallis entropy. We derive an analytical lower bound for
the $q$-concurrence of any bipartite quantum entanglement state by employing
positive partial transposition criterion and realignment criterion, which shows
an interesting relationship to the strong separability criteria. The new
entanglement monotone is used to characterize bipartite isotropic states.
Finally, we provide a computational method to estimate the $q$-concurrence for
any entanglement by superposing two bipartite pure states. It shows that the
superposition operations can at most increase one ebit for the $q$-concurrence
in the case that the two states being superposed are bi-orthogonal or one-sided
orthogonal. These results reveal a series of new phenomena about the
entanglement, which may be interesting in quantum communication and quantum

if it does not contain two edges whose intersection has size exactly $\ell$. If
in addition it does not contain two edges whose intersection has size greater

\v{S}i\v{n}ajov\'{a} proved a lower bound for the independence number of
$(n,k,\ell)$-systems that is sharp in order of magnitude for fixed $2 \le \ell
\le k-1$. We consider the same question for the larger class of
$(n,k,\ell)$-omitting systems.
  For $k\le 2\ell+1$, we believe that the behavior is similar to the case of
$(n,k,\ell)$-systems and prove a nontrivial lower bound for the first open case
$\ell=k-2$. For $k>2\ell+1$ we give new lower and upper bounds which show that
the minimum independence number of $(n,k,\ell)$-omitting systems has a very
different behavior than for $(n,k,\ell)$-systems. Our lower bound for
$\ell=k-2$ uses some adaptations of the random greedy independent set
algorithm, and our upper bounds (constructions) for $k> 2\ell+1$ are obtained
from some pseudorandom graphs.
  We also prove some related results where we forbid more than two edges with a
prescribed common intersection size and this leads to some applications in
Ramsey theory. For example, we obtain good bounds for the Ramsey number
$r_{k}(F^{k},t)$, where $F^{k}$ is the $k$-uniform Fan. Here the behavior is
quite different than the case $k=2$ which reduces to the classical graph Ramsey

explanation of which is vividly debated. One popular class of models posits
electronic phase separation, where the superconducting phase fraction decreases
with doping, while some competing phase (e.g. ferromagnetic) progressively
takes over. A problem with this scenario is that all the way up to the dome
edge the superconducting transition remains sharp, according to mutual
inductance measurements. However, the physically relevant scale is the Pearl
penetration depth, $\Lambda_{P}$, and this technique probes the sample on a
length scale $L$ that is much larger than $\Lambda_{P}$. In the present paper,
we use local scanning SQUID measurements that probe the susceptibility of the
sample on the scale $L << \Lambda_{P}$. Our SQUID maps show uniform landscapes
of susceptibility and excellent overall agreement of the local penetration
depth data with the bulk measurements. These results contribute an important
piece to the puzzle of how high-temperature superconductivity vanishes on the

estimate treatment effect in groups of patients defined by an intercurrent
status, i.e. in groups defined by a post-randomization variable only observed
in one arm and potentially associated with the outcome. However, status
information might be missing even for a non-negligible number of patients in
the experimental arm. For this setting, a novel weighted principal stratum
approach is presented: Data from patients with missing intercurrent event
status were re-weighted based on baseline covariates and additional
longitudinal information. A theoretical justification of the proposed approach
is provided for different types of outcomes, and assumptions allowing for
causal conclusions on treatment effect are specified and investigated.
Simulations demonstrated that the proposed method yielded valid inference and
was robust against certain violations of assumptions. The method was shown to
perform well in a clinical study with ADA status as an intercurrent event.

augmentor can fuse global information from inputs and learn common
morphological patterns in clefts, leading to augmented cleft features. In
addition, it can generate outputs with varying dimensions, making it flexible
to be integrated in any deep network. The proposed label augmentor augments the
label of each voxel from a value to a vector, which contains both the
segmentation label and boundary label. This allows the network to learn
important shape information and to produce more informative cleft
representations. Based on the proposed feature augmentor and label augmentor,
We build the CleftNet as a U-Net like network. The effectiveness of our methods
is evaluated on both online and offline tasks. Our CleftNet currently ranks \#1
on the online task of the CREMI open challenge. In addition, both quantitative
and qualitative results in the offline tasks show that our method outperforms
the baseline approaches significantly.

realize technique innovation. The systems are controlled such that their states
follow the desired manners to realize different quantum protocols. However, the
decoherence caused by the system-environment interactions causes the states
deviating from the desired manners. How to protect quantum resources under the
coexistence of active control and passive decoherence is of significance.
Recent studies have revealed that the decoherence is determined by the feature
of the system-environment energy spectrum: Accompanying the formation of bound
states in the energy spectrum, the decoherence can be suppressed. It supplies a
guideline to control decoherence. Such idea can be generalized to systems under
periodic driving. By virtue of manipulating Floquet bound states in the
quasienergy spectrum, coherent control via periodic driving dubbed as Floquet
engineering has become a versatile tool not only in controlling decoherence,
but also in artificially synthesizing exotic topological phases. We will review
the progress on quantum control in open and periodically driven systems.
Special attention will be paid to the distinguished role played by the bound
states and their controllability via periodic driving in suppressing
decoherence and generating novel topological phases.

start with simple but typical physical situations that the target functions are

physical observables in an enlarged Hilbert space with multiple replicas, such
as the Loshimidt echo and the Renyi entropy. The main finding is that an
accurate approximation is possible only when the input wave functions in the
dataset do not exhaust the entire Hilbert space that the quantum circuit acts
on, and more precisely, the Hilbert space dimension of the former has to be
less than half of the Hilbert space dimension of the latter. In some cases,
this requirement can be satisfied automatically because of the intrinsic
properties of the dataset, for instance, when the input wave function has to be
symmetric between different replicas. And if this requirement cannot be
satisfied by the dataset, we show that the expressivity capabilities can be
restored by adding one ancillary qubit where the wave function is always fixed
at input. Our studies point toward establishing a quantum neural network

optimization problems over nonsymmetric convex cones. The implementation is
based on the authors' corrected analysis of a primal-dual interior-point method
of Skajaa and Ye. This method enables optimization over any convex cone as long
as a logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier is available for the
cone or its dual. This includes many nonsymmetric cones, for example,
hyperbolicity cones and their duals (such as sum-of-squares cones),
semidefinite and second-order cone representable cones, power cones, and the
exponential cone. Besides enabling the solution of problems which cannot be
cast as optimization problems over a symmetric cone, it also offers performance
advantages for problems whose symmetric cone programming representation
requires a large number of auxiliary variables or has a special structure that
can be exploited in the barrier computation.
  The worst-case iteration complexity of alfonso is the best known for
non-symmetric cone optimization: $O(\sqrt{\nu}\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations to
reach an $\epsilon$-optimal solution, where $\nu$ is the barrier parameter of
the barrier function used in the optimization.
  alfonso can be interfaced with a Matlab function (supplied by the user) that
computes the Hessian of a barrier function for the cone. For convenience, a
simplified interface is also available to optimize over the direct product of
cones for which a barrier function has already been built into the software.
This interface can be easily extended to include new cones. Both interfaces are
illustrated by solving linear programs. The oracle interface and the efficiency
of alfonso are also demonstrated using a design of experiments problem in which
the tailored barrier computation greatly decreases the solution time compared
to using state-of-the-art conic optimization software.

attention based Bi-LSTM to learn the sequence embedding in an unsupervised
fashion, and combine them with intuitive features generated by risk experts to
form a hybrid feature representation. We also propose a GPU powered HDBSCAN
(pHDBSCAN) algorithm, which is an engineering optimization for the original

In addition, rule extraction method is applied to extract patterns from risky

FinDeepBehaviorCluster as a complementary risk management strategy to the

  Image Classification","19 pages, 13 figures",,"10.1109/TGRS.2021.3079123",,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hyperspectral images involve abundant spectral and spatial information,
playing an irreplaceable role in land-cover classification. Recently, based on
deep learning technologies, an increasing number of HSI classification
approaches have been proposed, which demonstrate promising performance.
However, previous studies suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) the architecture
of most deep learning models is manually designed, relies on specialized
knowledge, and is relatively tedious. Moreover, in HSI classifications,
datasets captured by different sensors have different physical properties.
Correspondingly, different models need to be designed for different datasets,
which further increases the workload of designing architectures; 2) the
mainstream framework is a patch-to-pixel framework. The overlap regions of
patches of adjacent pixels are calculated repeatedly, which increases
computational cost and time cost. Besides, the classification accuracy is
sensitive to the patch size, which is artificially set based on extensive
investigation experiments. To overcome the issues mentioned above, we firstly
propose a 3D asymmetric neural network search algorithm and leverage it to
automatically search for efficient architectures for HSI classifications. By
analysing the characteristics of HSIs, we specifically build a 3D asymmetric
decomposition search space, where spectral and spatial information are
processed with different decomposition convolutions. Furthermore, we propose a
new fast classification framework, i,e., pixel-to-pixel classification
framework, which has no repetitive operations and reduces the overall cost.
Experiments on three public HSI datasets captured by different sensors
demonstrate the networks designed by our 3D-ANAS achieve competitive
performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, while having a much
faster inference speed.

compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations to the corresponding 3D full Euler
equations. Our results are twofold. First, we prove that the 3D compressible
Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations admit a family of smooth solutions that
converge to the planar rarefaction wave solution of the 3D compressible Euler
equations with arbitrary strength. Second, we obtain a uniform convergence rate
in terms of the viscosity and heat-conductivity coefficients. For this
multi-dimensional problem, we first need to introduce the hyperbolic wave to
recover the physical dissipations of the inviscid rarefaction wave profile as
in our previous work [29] on the two-dimensional (2D) case. However, due to the
3D setting that makes the analysis significantly more challenging than the 2D
problem, the hyperbolic scaled variables for the space and time could not be
used to normalize the dissipation coefficients as in the 2D case. Instead, the
analysis of the 3D case is carried out in the original non-scaled variables,
and consequently the dissipation terms are more singular compared with the 2D
scaled case. Novel ideas and techniques are developed to establish the uniform
estimates. In particular, more accurate {\it a priori} assumptions with respect
to the dissipation coefficients are crucially needed for the stability
analysis, and some new observations on the cancellations of the physical
structures for the flux terms are essentially used to justify the 3D limit.
Moreover, we find that the decay rate with respect to the dissipation
coefficients is determined by the nonlinear flux terms in the original
variables for the 3D limit in this paper, but fully determined by the error
terms in the scaled variables for the 2D case in [29].

interferometers have emerged as the main tool for measurement of transmitted
wavefronts, their application is greatly limited, as they are typically
designed for operation at specific wavelengths. In a previous study, we
proposed a method for determining the wavefront transmitted by an optical
system at any wavelength in a certain band. Although this method works well for
most monochromatic systems, where the image plane is at the focal point for the
transmission wavelength, for general multi-color systems, it is more practical
to measure the wavefront at the defocused image plane. Hence, in this paper, we
have developed a complete method for determining transmitted wavefronts in a
broad bandwidth at any defocused position, enabling wavefront measurements for
multi-color systems. Here, we assume that in small ranges, the Zernike
coefficients have a linear relationship with position, such that Zernike
coefficients at defocused positions can be derived from measurements performed
at the focal point. We conducted experiments to verify these assumptions,
validating the new method. The experimental setup has been improved so that it
can handle multi-color systems, and a detailed experimental process is
summarized. With this technique, application of broadband transmission
wavefront measurement can be extended to most general optical systems, which is
of great significance for characterization of achromatic and apochromatic

provided by a surgeon. The manual resizing, however, may be inaccurate and
significantly add to the operating time. This paper introduces a fast and
non-contact approach for intraoperatively determining the exact contour of the
skull resection and automatically resizing the implant to fit the resection
area. Our approach includes four steps: First, a patient's defect information
is acquired by a 3D scanner. Second, the scanned defect is aligned to the CCI
by registering the scanned defect to the reconstructed CT model. Third, a
cutting toolpath is generated from the contour of the scanned defect. Lastly,
the large CCI is resized by a cutting robot to fit the resection area according
to the given toolpath. To evaluate the resizing performance of our method, six
different resection shapes were used in the cutting experiments. We compared
the performance of our method to the performances of surgeon's manual resizing

known involution operator, measuring the parity of the eigenfunctions. An
experimentally relevant modification of the QRM, the asymmetric (or biased)
quantum Rabi model (AQRM) is no longer invariant under this operator, but shows
nevertheless characteristic degeneracies of its spectrum for half-integer
values of $\epsilon$, the parameter governing the asymmetry. In an interesting
recent work (arXiv:2010.02496), an operator has been identified which commutes
with the Hamiltonian $H_{\epsilon}$ of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model for
$\epsilon=\frac{\ell}{2} \, (\ell\in \mathbb{Z})$ and appears to be the
analogue of the parity in the symmetric case. We prove several important
properties of this operator, notably, that it is algebraically independent of
the Hamiltonian $H_{\epsilon}$ and that it essentially generates the commutant
of $H_{\epsilon}$. Then, the expected $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry manifests the
fact that the commuting operator can be captured in the two-fold cover of the
algebra generated by $H_{\epsilon}$, that is, the polynomial ring in
$H_{\epsilon}$.

of its great impact on detectors' performance. However, none of these works
focus on label assignment in dense pedestrian detection. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective assigning strategy called Loss-aware Label
Assignment (LLA) to boost the performance of pedestrian detectors in crowd
scenarios. LLA first calculates classification (cls) and regression (reg)
losses between each anchor and ground-truth (GT) pair. A joint loss is then
defined as the weighted summation of cls and reg losses as the assigning
indicator. Finally, anchors with top K minimum joint losses for a certain GT
box are assigned as its positive anchors. Anchors that are not assigned to any
GT box are considered negative. Loss-aware label assignment is based on an
observation that anchors with lower joint loss usually contain richer semantic
information and thus can better represent their corresponding GT boxes.
Experiments on CrowdHuman and CityPersons show that such a simple label
assigning strategy can boost MR by 9.53% and 5.47% on two famous one-stage
detectors - RetinaNet and FCOS, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness
of LLA.

benchmark in US dollars, thus interest rate term structure models need to be
updated to reflect the key features exhibited by the dynamics of SOFR and the
forward rates implied by SOFR futures. Historically, interest rate term
structure modelling has been based on rates of substantially longer time to
maturity than overnight, but with SOFR the overnight rate now is the primary
market observable. This means that the empirical idiosyncrasies of the
overnight rate cannot be ignored when constructing interest rate models in a
SOFR-based world.
  As a rate reflecting transactions in the Treasury overnight repurchase
market, the dynamics of SOFR are closely linked to the dynamics of the
Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR), which is the interest rate most directly
impacted by US monetary policy target rate decisions. Therefore, these rates
feature jumps at known times (Federal Open Market Committee meeting dates), and
market expectations of these jumps are reflected in prices for futures written
on these rates. On the other hand, forward rates implied by Fed Funds and SOFR
futures continue to evolve diffusively. The model presented in this paper
reflects the key empirical features of SOFR dynamics and is calibrated to
futures prices. In particular, the model reconciles diffusive forward rate
dynamics with piecewise constant paths of the target short rate.

integrity and authenticity of CNNs because compromised models can produce
incorrect outputs and behave maliciously. In this paper, we propose a
self-contained tamper-proofing method, called DeepiSign, to ensure the
integrity and authenticity of CNN models against such manipulation attacks.
DeepiSign applies the idea of fragile invisible watermarking to securely embed
a secret and its hash value into a CNN model. To verify the integrity and
authenticity of the model, we retrieve the secret from the model, compute the
hash value of the secret, and compare it with the embedded hash value. To
minimize the effects of the embedded secret on the CNN model, we use a
wavelet-based technique to transform weights into the frequency domain and
embed the secret into less significant coefficients. Our theoretical analysis
shows that DeepiSign can hide up to 1KB secret in each layer with minimal loss
of the model's accuracy. To evaluate the security and performance of DeepiSign,
we performed experiments on four pre-trained models (ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet,
and MobileNet) using three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenet) against
three types of manipulation attacks (targeted input poisoning, output
poisoning, and fine-tuning). The results demonstrate that DeepiSign is
verifiable without degrading the classification accuracy, and robust against
representative CNN manipulation attacks.

under the challenging black-box setting, the attack success rate, i.e., the

image augmentation methods, we found that random transformation of image

critical current and the corresponding junction resistance exhibit a hysteretic

as a strong Josephson coupling state. Through the control of this hysteresis,

is an important clue for user interest modeling, since short reading dwell time
usually indicates low and even negative interest. Thus, incorporating the
negative feedback inferred from the dwell time of news reading can improve the
quality of user modeling. In this paper, we propose a neural news
recommendation approach which can incorporate the implicit negative user
feedback. We propose to distinguish positive and negative news clicks according
to their reading dwell time, and respectively learn user representations from
positive and negative news clicks via a combination of Transformer and additive
attention network. In addition, we propose to compute a positive click score

highly unbalanced across varieties, and the combination of growing conditions
is sparse, we employ multi-task learning to borrow information from similar

followed by pressurisation of fluids. The thermal and mechanical pressurisation
of fluids, enhanced by the low permeability of the fault, reduces the energy

promote earthquake rupture propagation and slip because of their low

encrypted traffic flow between two endpoints is interrupted, decrypted and
analysed by the middleboxes. The MitM approach is straightforward and is used
by many organisations, but there are both practical and privacy concerns. Due
to the cost of the MitM appliances and the latency incurred in the
encrypt-decrypt processes, enterprises continue to seek solutions that are less
costly. There were discussion on the many efforts required to configure MitM.
Besides, MitM violates end-to-end privacy guarantee, raising privacy concerns

collisions with higher probability than dissimilar items.
  We study LSH for (not necessarily convex) polygons, and use it to give
efficient data structures for similar shape retrieval. Arkin et al. represent
polygons by their ""turning function"" - a function which follows the angle
between the polygon's tangent and the $ x $-axis while traversing the perimeter
of the polygon. They define the distance between polygons to be variations of
the $ L_p $ (for $p=1,2$) distance between their turning functions. This metric
is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling (and the selection of the
initial point on the perimeter) and therefore models well the intuitive notion
of shape resemblance.
  We develop and analyze LSH near neighbor data structures for several
variations of the $ L_p $ distance for functions (for $p=1,2$). By applying our
schemes to the turning functions of a collection of polygons we obtain
efficient near neighbor LSH-based structures for polygons. To tune our
structures to turning functions of polygons, we prove some new properties of
these turning functions that may be of independent interest.

independent interest. Find the vertical translation of a function $ f $ that is
closest in $ L_1 $ distance to a function $ g $. We prove tight bounds on the

effective, and easy-to-use training algorithm. We show that mWh strikes a good
balance between exploration and exploitation by gradually replacing mixup with
basic data augmentation. It can achieve a strong baseline with less training
time than original mixup and without searching for optimal hyper-parameter,
i.e., mWh acts as mixup without hesitation. mWh can also transfer to CutMix,
and gain consistent improvement on other machine learning and computer vision
tasks such as object detection. Our code is open-source and available at

fundamental for all the control methods, but it is unclear how control impacts
mathematics. This is the first part of our paper that attempts to give an
answer with focus on solving linear algebraic equations (LAEs) from the
perspective of systems and control, where it mainly introduces the
controllability-based design results. By proposing an iterative method that
integrates a learning control mechanism, a class of tracking problems for
iterative learning control (ILC) is explored for the problem solving of LAEs. A
trackability property of ILC is newly developed, by which analysis and
synthesis results are established to disclose the equivalence between the
solvability of LAEs and the controllability of discrete control systems. Hence,
LAEs can be solved by equivalently achieving the perfect tracking tasks of
resulting ILC systems via the classic state feedback-based design and analysis
methods. It is shown that the solutions for any solvable LAE can all be
calculated with different selections of the initial input. Moreover, the
presented ILC method is applicable to determining all the least squares
solutions of any unsolvable LAE. In particular, a deadbeat design is
incorporated to ILC such that the solving of LAEs can be completed within
finite iteration steps. The trackability property is also generalized to
conventional two-dimensional ILC systems, which creates feedback-based methods,
instead of the common used contraction mapping-based methods, for the design
and convergence analysis of ILC.

imaging systems. Many algorithms have been developed over the past
half-century. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced new
possibilities for a robust and fast PR. An emerging technique called deep
unfolding provides a systematic connection between conventional model-based
iterative algorithms and modern data-based deep learning. Unfolded algorithms,
which are powered by data learning, have shown remarkable performance and
convergence speed improvement over original algorithms. Despite their
potential, most existing unfolded algorithms are strictly confined to a fixed
number of iterations when layer-dependent parameters are used. In this study,
we develop a novel framework for deep unfolding to overcome existing
limitations. Our development is based on an unfolded generalized expectation
consistent signal recovery (GEC-SR) algorithm, wherein damping factors are left
for data-driven learning. In particular, we introduce a hypernetwork to
generate the damping factors for GEC-SR. Instead of learning a set of optimal
damping factors directly, the hypernetwork learns how to generate the optimal
damping factors according to the clinical settings, thereby ensuring its
adaptivity to different scenarios. To enable the hypernetwork to adapt to
varying layer numbers, we use a recurrent architecture to develop a dynamic
hypernetwork that generates a damping factor that can vary online across
layers. We also exploit a self-attention mechanism to enhance the robustness of
the hypernetwork. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms existing ones in terms of convergence speed and accuracy and still
works well under very harsh settings, even under which many classical PR
algorithms are unstable.

radiographic patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) from knee lateral view
radiographs.
  Design: Knee lateral view radiographs were extracted from The Multicenter
Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) (n = 18,436 knees). Patellar region-of-interest
(ROI) was first automatically detected, and subsequently, end-to-end deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained and validated to detect the
status of patellofemoral OA. Patellar ROI was detected using
deep-learning-based object detection method. Manual PFOA status assessment
provided in the MOST dataset was used as a classification outcome for the CNNs.
Performance of prediction models was assessed using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the average precision (AP)
obtained from the precision-recall (PR) curve in the stratified 5-fold cross
validation setting.
  Results: Of the 18,436 knees, 3,425 (19%) had PFOA. AUC and AP for the
reference model including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), the total Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and
tibiofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade to predict PFOA were 0.806 and 0.478,
respectively. The CNN model that used only image data significantly improved
the prediction of PFOA status (ROC AUC= 0.958, AP= 0.862).
  Conclusion: We present the first machine learning based automatic PFOA
detection method. Furthermore, our deep learning based model trained on patella
region from knee lateral view radiographs performs better at predicting PFOA
than models based on patient characteristics and clinical assessments.

dependence structure of large multivariate data sets, but lacks scalable and

beta-mixture shrinkage prior, computationally more efficient than the spike and
slab prior, for sparse covariance matrices and establish its minimax optimality
in high-dimensional settings. The proposed prior consists of beta-mixture
shrinkage and gamma priors for off-diagonal and diagonal entries, respectively.
To ensure positive definiteness of the resulting covariance matrix, we further
restrict the support of the prior to a subspace of positive definite matrices.
We obtain the posterior convergence rate of the induced posterior under the
Frobenius norm and establish a minimax lower bound for sparse covariance
matrices. The class of sparse covariance matrices for the minimax lower bound
considered in this paper is controlled by the number of nonzero off-diagonal
elements and has more intuitive appeal than those appeared in the literature.
The obtained posterior convergence rate coincides with the minimax lower bound
unless the true covariance matrix is extremely sparse. In the simulation study,
we show that the proposed method is computationally more efficient than
competitors, while achieving comparable performance. Advantages of the
shrinkage prior are demonstrated based on two real data sets.

yielding state-of-the-art model compression. Most approaches take a fully
trained model, apply different heuristics to determine the optimal
bit-precision for different layers of the network, and retrain the network to
regain any drop in accuracy. Based on Activation Density (AD)-the proportion of
non-zero activations in a layer-we propose an in-training quantization method.
Our method calculates bit-width for each layer during training yielding a mixed
precision model with competitive accuracy. Since we train lower precision
models during training, our approach yields the final quantized model at lower
training complexity and also eliminates the need for re-training. We run
experiments on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImagenet on
VGG19/ResNet18 architectures and report the accuracy and energy estimates for
the same. We achieve ~4.5x benefit in terms of estimated
multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) reduction while reducing the training complexity
by 50% in our experiments. To further evaluate the energy benefits of our
proposed method, we develop a mixed-precision scalable Process In Memory (PIM)
hardware accelerator platform. The hardware platform incorporates shift-add
functionality for handling multi-bit precision neural network models.
Evaluating the quantized models obtained with our proposed method on the PIM
platform yields ~5x energy reduction compared to 16-bit models. Additionally,
we find that integrating AD based quantization with AD based pruning (both
conducted during training) yields up to ~198x and ~44x energy reductions for
VGG19 and ResNet18 architectures respectively on PIM platform compared to

[C1] and [C2] might not be satisfied by neural rankers. Given the success of

small systems and followed by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
calculations that target the lowest hundreds of states $\{E(N)\}$ at system
size $N$ instead of the ground state. Progressively larger $N$ reaches $T <
0.05t$ in correlated models with electron transfer $t$ between first neighbors
and bandwidth $4t$. The size dependence of the many-fermion basis is explicitly
included for arbitrary interactions by scaling the partition function. The
remaining size dependence is then entirely due to the energy spectrum
$\{E(N)\}$ of the model. The ED/DMRG method is applied to Hubbard and extended

software engineers' daily life was disrupted and abruptly forced into remote
working from home. This change deeply impacted typical working routines,
affecting both well-being and productivity. Moreover, this pandemic will have
long-lasting effects in the software industry, with several tech companies
allowing their employees to work from home indefinitely if they wish to do so.
Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and understand how a typical working day
looks like when working from home and how individual activities affect software
developers' well-being and productivity. We performed a two-wave longitudinal
study involving almost 200 globally carefully selected software professionals,
inferring daily activities with perceived well-being, productivity, and other
relevant psychological and social variables. Results suggest that the time
software engineers spent doing specific activities from home was similar when
working in the office. However, we also found some significant mean
differences. The amount of time developers spent on each activity was unrelated
to their well-being, perceived productivity, and other variables. We conclude
that working remotely is not per se a challenge for organizations or
developers.

  orbits","Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Dec 19, 2020","A&A 646, A182 (2021)","10.1051/0004-6361/202037738",,"astro-ph.EP nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamical studies of asteroid populations in retrograde orbits, that is with
orbital inclinations greater than 90 degrees, are interesting because the
origin of such orbits is still unexplained. Generally, the population of
retrograde asteroids includes mostly Centaurs and transneptunian objects
(TNOs). A special case is the near-Earth object (343158) 2009 HC82 from the
Apollo group. Another interesting object is the comet 333P/LINEAR, which for
several years was considered the second retrograde object approaching Earth.
Another comet in retrograde orbit, 161P Hartley/IRAS appears to be an object of
similar type. Thanks to the large amount of observational data for these two
comets, we tested various models of cometary non-gravitational forces applied
to their dynamics.
  The goal was to estimate which of non-gravitational perturbations could
affect the stability of retrograde bodies. In principle, we study the local
stability by measuring the divergence of nearby orbits.
  We numerically determined Lyapunov characteristic indicators (LCI) and the
associated Lyapunov times (LT). This time, our calculations were extended by
more advanced models of non-gravitational perturbations (i.e. Yarkovsky drift
and in selected cases cometary forces). This allowed us to estimate chaos in
the Lyapunov sense.
  We found that the Yarkovsky effect for obliquities of $\gamma=0^{\circ}$ and
$\gamma=180^{\circ}$ can change the LT substantially. In most cases, for the
prograde rotation, we received more stable solutions. Moreover, we confirmed
the role of retrograde resonances in this process. Additionally, the studied
cometary effects also significantly influence the long-term behaviour of the
selected comets. The LT can reach values from 100 to over 1000 years.
Conclusions. All of our results indicate that the use of models with
non-gravitational effects for retrograde bodies is clearly justified.

predictive resource allocation in machine type communications (MTC). In this
paper, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning approach is proposed
for event-driven source traffic prediction. The source traffic prediction
problem can be formulated as a sequence generation task where the main focus is
predicting the transmission states of machine-type devices (MTDs) based on
their past transmission data. This is done by restructuring the transmission
data in a way that the LSTM network can identify the causal relationship
between the devices. Knowledge of such a causal relationship can enable
event-driven traffic prediction. The performance of the proposed approach is
studied using data regarding events from MTDs with different ranges of entropy.
Our model outperforms existing baseline solutions in saving resources and
accuracy with a margin of around 9%. Reduction in Random Access (RA) requests
by our model is also analyzed to demonstrate the low amount of signaling
required as a result of our proposed LSTM based source traffic prediction

resummation of an entire subseries. Infinitesimal perturbations are enough to
restore the ergodic properties of the system, and decrease residual finite-size

an effective electron (hole) mass of 0.31 (0.48) m$_{0}$. We find the
lowest-energy excitation at 0.2 eV below the fundamental gap, reflecting a
sizeable electron-hole attraction. Since the transition from the valence band
maximum (VBM, $\Gamma$ point) is, however, dipole forbidden the onset is
characterized by weak excitations from transitions around it. The first intense
excitation appears about 0.32 eV above. Interestingly, this value coincides
with an experimental value obtained by ellipsometry (4.80 eV) which is higher
than the onset from optical absorption spectroscopy (4.35 eV). The latter
discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the weak transitions that define the
optical gap are not resolved by the ellipsometry measurement. The absorption
edge shows a strong dependency on the light polarization, reflecting the
character of the involved valence states. Temperature-dependent measurements
show a redshift of the optical gap by about 120 meV by increasing the

provides a simple procedure to extract the fracture energy without depending on
finite element calculations. Validation tests are done on

and our analytical model to interpret the data. We find a very good agreement
between the toughness determined by both methods. The stable nature of crack
growth in our improved TDCB specimens results in a precise control of the crack
speed. This feature is employed to go one step further and characterize the
variations of toughness with crack speed. We propose an original optimization
procedure for the determination of the material parameters characterizing the
kinetic law describing the toughness rate dependency. Overall, the approach

equation in a class of non periodically perforated domains. In this paper, we
examine the case of the Stokes system. We consider a porous medium in which the
characteristic distance between two holes, denoted by $\epsilon$, is
proportional to the characteristic size of the holes. It is well known (see
[1],[17] and [19]) that, when the holes are periodically distributed in space,
the velocity converges to a limit given by the Darcy's law when the size of the
holes tends to zero. We generalize these results to the setting of [8]. The
non-periodic domains are defined as a local perturbation of a periodic
distribution of holes. We obtain classical results of the homogenization theory
in perforated domains (existence of correctors and regularity estimates uniform
in $\epsilon$) and we prove $H^2$--convergence estimates for particular force
fields.

  Equations",,"Fluids, MDPI, 2021",,,"math.AP physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computation of gas dispersal in urban places or hilly grounds requires a
large amount of computer time when addressed with conventional multidimensional
models. Those are usually based on two-phase flow or Navier-Stokes equations.
Different classes of simplified models exist. Among them, two-layer shallow
water models are interesting to address large-scale dispersion. Indeed,
compared to conventional multidimensional approaches, 2D simulations are
carried out to mimic 3D effects. The computational gain in CPU time is
consequently expected to be tremendous. However, such models involve at least
three fundamental difficulties. The first one is related to the lack of
hyperbolicity of most existing formulations, yielding serious consequences
regarding wave propagation. The second is related to the non-conservative terms
in the momentum equations. Those terms account for interactions between fluid
layers. Recently, these two difficulties have been addressed in Chiapolino and
Saurel (2018) and an unconditional hyperbolic model has been proposed along
with a Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) type Riemann solver dealing with the
non-conservative terms. In the same reference, numerical experiments showed
robustness and accuracy of the formulation. In the present paper, a third
difficulty is addressed. It consists of the determination of appropriate drag
effect formulation. Such effects also account for interactions between fluid
layers and become of particular importance when dealing with heavy-gas
dispersion. With this aim, the model is compared to laboratory experiments in
the context of heavy gas dispersal in quiescent air. It is shown that the model
accurately reproduces experimental results thanks to an appropriate drag force
correlation. This function expresses drag effects between the heavy and light
gas layers. It is determined thanks to various experimental configurations of
dam-break test problems.

pre-processing, in terms of gas content and SFR, as a function of density in
cosmic filaments. We have observed the two first CO transitions in 163 galaxies
with the IRAM-30m telescope, and added 82 more measurements from the
literature, for a sample of 245 galaxies in the filaments around Virgo. We
gathered HI-21cm measurements from the literature, and observed 69 galaxies
with the Nan\c{c}ay telescope, to complete our sample. We compare our filament
galaxies with comparable samples from the Virgo cluster and with the isolated
galaxies of the AMIGA sample. We find a progression from field galaxies to
filament and cluster ones for decreasing SFR, increasing fraction of galaxies
in the quenching phase, increasing proportion of early-type galaxies and
decreasing gas content. Galaxies in the quenching phase, defined as having SFR
below 1/3 of the main sequence rate, are only between 0-20\% in the isolated
sample, while they are 20-60\% in the filaments and 30-80\% in the Virgo
cluster. Processes that lead to star formation quenching are already at play in
filaments. They depend mostly on the local galaxy density, while the distance
to the filament spine is a secondary parameter. While the HI to stellar mass
ratio decreases with local density by ~1 dex in the filaments, and ~2 dex in
Virgo with respect to the field, the decrease is much less for the H$_2$ to
stellar mass ratio. As the environmental density increases, the gas depletion
time decreases, since the gas content decreases faster than the SFR. This
suggests that gas depletion significantly precedes star formation quenching.

properties of electron spins is critical to realize such applications, but is
also challenging: inferring such data from single-spin studies requires many
measurements to obtain meaningful results, while ensemble measurements
typically give averaged results that hide critical information. Here, we report
a comprehensive study of the coherence of near-surface bismuth donor spins in

frequency shifts caused by a metallic electrode to make spatial maps of spin
coherence as a function of depth and position relative to the electrode. By
measuring magnetic-field-insensitive clock transitions we separate magnetic
noise caused by surface spins from charge noise. Our results include
quantitative models of the strain-split spin resonance spectra and extraction
of paramagnetic impurity concentrations at the silicon surface. The interplay
of these decoherence mechanisms for such near-surface electron spins is
critical for their application in quantum technologies, while the combination
of the strain splitting and clock transition extends the coherence lifetimes by
up to two orders of magnitude, reaching up to 300 ms at a mean depth of only

endowment of the resources, the aim of this paper is to characterize the set of
robust sustainable thresholds, that is, the thresholds for which there exists
some control path, along with its corresponding state trajectory, satisfying
for all possible uncertainty scenarios, prescribed mixed constraints
parametrized by such thresholds. This set provides useful information to users

Generally, their determination in the $(x,y,z)$ volume is not possible due to
the lack of a reliable estimation of the gas pressure, particularly in regions
of the solar surface harboring strong magnetic fields. We aim to develop a new

the correct behavior of the newly developed code with spectropolarimetric
observations of two sunspots recorded with the spectropolarimeter (SP)

fast and complete an entire rotation within a few minutes. These small and
fast-rotating bodies are thought to be monolithic objects because the
gravitational force due to their small size is not strong enough to counteract
the strong centripetal force caused by the fast rotation. Additionally, it is
not clear whether the fast spin prevents dust and small particles (regolith)
from being kept on their surface. Aims: We develop a model for constraining the
thermal conductivity of the surface of the small, fast-rotating near-Earth
asteroids. This model may suggest whether regolith is likely present on these
objects. Methods: Our approach is based on the comparison of the measured
Yarkovsky drift and a predicted value using a theoretical model that depends on
the orbital, physical and thermal parameters of the object. The necessary
parameters are either deduced from statistical distribution derived for
near-Earth asteroids population or determined from observations with associated
uncertainty. With this information, we performed Monte Carlo simulations and
produced a probability density distribution for the thermal conductivity.
Results: Applying our model to the superfast rotator asteroid (499998) 2011 PT,
we find that the measured Yarkovsky drift can only be achieved when the thermal
conductivity $K$ of the surface is low. The resulting probability density
function for the conductivity is bimodal, with two most likely values being
around 0.0001 and 0.005 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. Based on this, we find that the
probability that $K$ is lower than 0.1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ is at least 95\%.
This low thermal conductivity might indicate that the surface of 2011 PT is
covered with a thermal insulating layer, composed of a regolith-like material
similar to lunar dust.

state-of-the-art backbone and training supervision subject to the real-world
face recognition demand; for performance analysis and comparison, the standard

some newly-emerged challenges, such as the masked face recognition caused by
the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, which draws increasing attention in
practical applications. A feasible and elegant solution is to build an
easy-to-use unified framework to meet the above demands. To this end, we

system with periodic sensory stimuli. Neural signals recorded using a variety
of techniques will then include phase-locked oscillations at the stimulation
frequency. The analysis of such data often involves standard univariate
statistics such as T-tests, conducted on the Fourier amplitude components
(ignoring phase), either to test for the presence of a signal, or to compare
signals across different conditions. However, the assumptions of these tests
will sometimes be violated because amplitudes are not normally distributed, and
furthermore weak signals might be missed if the phase information is discarded.
An alternative approach is to conduct multivariate statistical tests using the
real and imaginary Fourier components. Here the performance of two multivariate
extensions of the T-test are compared: Hotelling's $T^2$ and a variant called
$T^2_{circ}$. A novel test of the assumptions of $T^2_{circ}$ is developed,
based on the condition index of the data (the square root of the ratio of
eigenvalues of a bounding ellipse), and a heuristic for excluding outliers
using the Mahalanobis distance is proposed. The $T^2_{circ}$ statistic is then
extended to multi-level designs, resulting in a new statistical test termed
$ANOVA^2_{circ}$. This has identical assumptions to $T^2_{circ}$, and is shown
to be more sensitive than MANOVA when these assumptions are met. The use of
these tests is demonstrated for two publicly available empirical data sets, and
practical guidance is suggested for choosing which test to run. Implementations
of these novel tools are provided as an R package and a Matlab toolbox, in the
hope that their wider adoption will improve the sensitivity of statistical
inferences involving periodic data.

phase transitions. Remarkably, the isostructural Mott transition in Cr-doped
V2O3 between paramagnetic metallic and insulating phase observed in bulk has
been elusive in thin film compounds so far. Here, via continuous lattice
deformations induced by heteroepitaxy we demonstrate a room temperature Mott
metal-insulator transition in 1.5% Cr-doped and pure V2O3 thin films. By means
of a controlled epitaxial strain, not only the structure but also the intrinsic
electronic and optical properties of the thin films are stabilized at different
intermediate states between the metallic and insulating phases, inaccessible in
bulk materials. This leads to films with unique features such as a colossal
change in room temperature resistivity (DR/R up to 100,000 %) and a broad range
of optical constant values, as consequence of a strain-modulated bandgap. We
propose a new phase diagram for pure and Cr-doped V2O3 thin films with the
engineered in-plane lattice constant as a tuneable parameter. Our results
demonstrate that controlling phase transitions in correlated systems by
epitaxial strain offers a radical new approach to create the next generation of

  First, we study fixed subgroups of automorphisms of right-angled Artin and
Coxeter groups. If $\varphi$ is an untwisted automorphism of a RAAG, or an
arbitrary automorphism of a RACG, we prove that ${\rm Fix}~\varphi$ is finitely
generated and undistorted. Up to replacing $\varphi$ with a power, we show that
${\rm Fix}~\varphi$ is quasi-convex with respect to the standard word metric.
This implies that ${\rm Fix}~\varphi$ is separable and a special group in the
sense of Haglund-Wise.
  By contrast, there exist ""twisted"" automorphisms of RAAGs for which ${\rm
Fix}~\varphi$ is undistorted but not of type $F$ (hence not special), of type
$F$ but distorted, or even infinitely generated.
  Secondly, we introduce the notion of ""coarse-median preserving"" automorphism
of a coarse median group, which plays a key role in the above results. We show
that automorphisms of RAAGs are coarse-median preserving if and only if they
are untwisted. On the other hand, all automorphisms of Gromov-hyperbolic groups
and right-angled Coxeter groups are coarse-median preserving. These facts also
yield new or more elementary proofs of Nielsen realisation for RAAGs and RACGs.
  Finally, we show that, for every special group $G$ (in the sense of
Haglund-Wise), every infinite-order, coarse-median preserving outer
automorphism of $G$ can be realised as a homothety of a finite-rank median
space $X$ equipped with a ""moderate"" isometric $G$-action. This generalises the
classical result, due to Paulin, that every infinite-order outer automorphism
of a hyperbolic group $H$ projectively stabilises a small $H$-tree.

sample of early-type stars with and without planets via spectral synthesis.
Results. We compared the chemical pattern of the stars in our sample (13 stars
with planets and 24 stars without detected planets) with those of lambda Bootis
and other chemically peculiar stars. We have found four lambda Bootis stars in
our sample, two of which present planets and circumstellar disks (HR 8799 and
HD 169142) and one without planets detected (HD 110058). We have also
identified the first lambda Bootis star orbited by a brown dwarf (zeta Del).
This interesting pair lambda Bootis star + brown dwarf could help to test
stellar formation scenarios. We found no unique chemical pattern for the group
of early-type stars bearing giant planets. However, our results support, in
principle, a suggested scenario in which giant planets orbiting
pre-main-sequence stars possibly block the dust of the disk and result in a
lambda Bootis-like pattern. On the other hand, we do not find a lambda Bootis
pattern in different hot-Jupiter planet host stars, which do not support the
idea of possible accretion from the winds of hot-Jupiters, recently proposed in
the literature. Then, other mechanisms should account for the presence of the
lambda Bootis pattern between main-sequence stars. Finally, we suggest that the
formation of planets around lambda Bootis stars such as HR 8799 and HD 169142
is also possible through the core accretion process and not only gravitational
instability [abridged]

for active atmospheric circulation, raising critical questions about mechanisms
driving the circulation, its fundamental nature, and time variability. Our
previous work demonstrated the crucial role of cloud radiative feedback on
driving a vigorous atmospheric circulation using local models that assume a
Cartesian geometry and constant Coriolis parameters. In this study, we explore
the properties of the global dynamics. We show that, under relatively strong
dissipation in the bottom layers of the model, horizontally isotropic vortices
are prevalent at mid-to-high latitudes while large-scale zonally propagating
waves are dominant at low latitudes near the observable layers. The equatorial
waves have both eastward and westward phase speeds, and the eastward components
with typical speeds of a few hundred m/s usually dominate the equatorial time
variability. Lightcurves of the global simulations show variability with
amplitudes from 0.5 percent to a few percent depending on the rotation period
and viewing angle. The time evolution of simulated lightcurves is critically
affected by the equatorial waves, showing wave beating effects and differences
in the lightcurve periodicity to the intrinsic rotation period. The vertical
extent of clouds is the largest at the equator and decreases poleward due to
the increasing influence of rotation with increasing latitude. Under weaker
bottom dissipation, strong and broad zonal jets develop and modify wave
propagation and lightcurve variability. Our modeling results help to explain
the puzzling time evolution of observed lightcurves, a slightly shorter period
of variability in IR than in radio wavelengths, and the viewing angle
dependence of variability amplitude and IR colors.

readily-available information, and delineated the remaining challenges. We
analyzed data from 3557 basins (83% dammed) over the contiguous United States
and noted strong impacts of reservoir purposes, degree of regulation (dor), and
diversion on streamflow modeling. While a model trained on a widely-used
reference-basin dataset performed poorly for non-reference basins, the model
trained on the whole dataset presented a median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
coefficient (NSE) of 0.74. The zero-dor, small-dor (with storage of
approximately a month of average streamflow or less), and large-dor basins were
found to have distinct behaviors, so migrating models between categories
yielded catastrophic results, which means we must not treat small-dor basins as
reference ones. However, training with pooled data from different sets yielded
optimal median NSEs of 0.72, 0.79, and 0.64 for these respective groups,
noticeably stronger than existing models. These results support a coherent
modeling strategy where smaller dams (storing about a month of average
streamflow or less) are modeled implicitly as part of basin rainfall-runoff

cooperators if they correctly declare their value added tax (VAT), and are
defectors otherwise. Each player's payoff is influenced by the amount evaded
and the subjective probability of being inspected by tax authorities. Since
transactions between companies must be declared by both the buyer and seller, a
strategy adopted by one influences the other's payoff. We study the model with
a well-mixed population and different scale-free networks. Model parameters
were calibrated using real-world data of VAT declarations by businesses
registered in the Canary Islands region of Spain. We analyzed several scenarios
of audit probabilities for high and low transactions and their prevalence in
the population, as well as social rewards and penalties to find the most
efficient policy to increase the proportion of cooperators. Two major insights
were found. First, increasing the subjective audit probability for low
transactions is more efficient than increasing this probability for high
transactions. Second, favoring social rewards for cooperators or alternative
penalties for defectors can be effective policies, but their success depends on
the distribution of the audit probability for low and high transactions.

have a cost associated with every program which denotes the cost of matching a

these two problems -- MINMAX is polynomial time solvable whereas MINSUM is
NP-hard and hard to approximate within a constant factor unless P = NP even

method that can be employed to predict survival in such situations. PRC
comprises three modeling steps: First, the trajectories described by the
longitudinal predictors are flexibly modeled through the specification of
multivariate mixed effects models. Second, subject-specific summaries of the
longitudinal trajectories are derived from the fitted mixed models. Third, the
time to event outcome is predicted using the subject-specific summaries as
covariates in a penalized Cox model. To ensure a proper internal validation of
the fitted PRC models, we furthermore develop a cluster bootstrap optimism
correction procedure that allows to correct for the optimistic bias of apparent
measures of predictiveness. PRC and the CBOCP are implemented in the R package
pencal, available from CRAN. After studying the behavior of PRC via
simulations, we conclude by illustrating an application of PRC to data from an
observational study that involved patients affected by Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, where the goal is predict time to loss of ambulation using

  Problem","Fig 1 updated since first version (corrected panel 3 which previously
  replicated panel 2)",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background and motivation: Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is a rapidly
developing field. Historically most application has been made to games (such as
chess, Atari games, and go). Deep RL is now reaching the stage where it may
offer value in real world problems, including optimisation of healthcare
systems. One such problem is where to locate ambulances between calls in order
to minimise time from emergency call to ambulance on-scene. This is known as
the Ambulance Location problem.
  Aim: To develop an OpenAI Gym-compatible framework and simulation environment
for testing Deep RL agents.
  Methods: A custom ambulance dispatch simulation environment was developed
using OpenAI Gym and SimPy. Deep RL agents were built using PyTorch. The
environment is a simplification of the real world, but allows control over the
number of clusters of incident locations, number of possible dispatch
locations, number of hospitals, and creating incidents that occur at different
locations throughout each day.
  Results: A range of Deep RL agents based on Deep Q networks were tested in
this custom environment. All reduced time to respond to emergency calls
compared with random allocation to dispatch points. Bagging Noisy Duelling Deep
Q networks gave the most consistence performance. All methods had a tendency to
lose performance if trained for too long, and so agents were saved at their
optimal performance (and tested on independent simulation runs).
  Conclusions: Deep RL agents, developed using simulated environments, have the
potential to offer a novel approach to optimise the Ambulance Location problem.
Creating open simulation environments should allow more rapid progress in this
field.

2D Rashba spin-orbit coupled systems with Zeeman splitting and in 3D
noncentrosymmetric metals using modified spin current operator by inclusion of
the anomalous velocity. The linear spin Hall current arises due to the
anomalous velocity of charge carriers induced by the Berry curvature. The
nonlinear spin current occurs due to the band velocity and/or the anomalous
velocity. For 2D Rashba systems, the background spin current saturates at high
Fermi energy (independent of the Zeeman coupling), linear spin current exhibits
a plateau at the Zeeman gap and nonlinear spin currents are peaked at the gap
edges. The magnitude of the nonlinear spin current peaks enhances with the
strength of Zeeman interaction. The linear spin current is polarized out of
plane, while the nonlinear ones are polarized in-plane. We witness pure
anomalous nonlinear spin current with spin polarization along the direction of
propagation. In 3D noncentrosymmetric metals, background and linear spin
currents are monotonically increasing functions of Fermi energy, while
nonlinear spin currents vary non-monotonically as a function of Fermi energy
and are independent of the Berry curvature. These findings may provide useful
information to manipulate spin currents in Rashba spin-orbit coupled systems.

experimentally investigate the enhancement effect of plasmonic gratings in the

scattering (SECARS). PDGs are designable azimuthally chirped gratings that
provide broadband and spatially dispersed plasmonic enhancement. Therefore,
they offer the opportunity to observe and compare the overall enhancement from
different combinations of enhancement in individual input and output beams. We
first confirm PDG's capability of spatially separating the input and output
enhancement in linear surface-enhanced fluorescence and Raman scattering. We
then investigate spatially resolved enhancement in nonlinear SECARS, where
coherent interaction of the pump, Stokes, and anti-Stokes beams is enhanced by
the plasmonic gratings. By mapping the SECARS signal and analyzing the
azimuthal angle-dependent intensity, we characterize the enhancement at
individual frequencies. Together with theoretical analysis, we show that while
simultaneous enhancement in the input and output beams is important for SECARS,
the enhancement in the pump and anti-Stokes beams plays a more critical role in
the overall enhancement than that in the Stokes beam. This work provides an
insight into the enhancement mechanism of plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy, which
is important for the design and optimization of plasmonic gratings. The PDG
platform may also be applied to study enhancement mechanisms in other nonlinear
light-matter interactions or the impact of plasmonic gratings on the
fluorescence lifetime.

camera pipelines, aiming to reconstruct clean color images from noisy luminance
readings. In this paper, we propose and study Wild-JDD, a novel learning
framework for joint demosaicking and denoising in the wild. In contrast to
previous works which generally assume the ground truth of training data is a
perfect reflection of the reality, we consider here the more common imperfect
case of ground truth uncertainty in the wild. We first illustrate its
manifestation as various kinds of artifacts including zipper effect, color
moire and residual noise. Then we formulate a two-stage data degradation
process to capture such ground truth uncertainty, where a conjugate prior
distribution is imposed upon a base distribution. After that, we derive an
evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss to train a neural network that approximates
the parameters of the conjugate prior distribution conditioned on the degraded
input. Finally, to further enhance the performance for out-of-distribution
input, we design a simple but effective fine-tuning strategy by taking the
input as a weakly informative prior. Taking into account ground truth
uncertainty, Wild-JDD enjoys good interpretability during optimization.
Extensive experiments validate that it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes on
joint demosaicking and denoising tasks on both synthetic and realistic raw
datasets.

with a high effective coupling coefficient. Furthermore, compact models are
used to make the design process less time-consuming for designers. These models
are based on the equivalent circuit theory for the PMUT. A cell of 107 um in
radius, 5 um in thickness of Lead Zirconate Titanium (PZT), and 10 um in
thickness of silicon (Si) is found to have a 4% of effective coupling
coefficient among the highest values for a clamped edge boundary conditions.
Simulation results show a frequency of 2.84 MHz as resonance. In case of an
array, mutual impedance and numerical modeling are used to estimate the

transducer and the number of cells are computed with the Rayleigh distance and
neglecting the cross-talk among cells, respectively. The designed transducer
consists of 7x7 cells in an area of 3.24 mm2. The transducer is able to deliver
an acoustic intensity of 7.185 mW/mm2 for a voltage of 19.5 V for powering
brain implants seated in the motor cortex and striatum of the mice's brain. The
maximum acoustic intensity occurs at a distance of 2.5 mm in the near field

chiroptical analysis is demonstrated. Under linearly polarized excitation, an
elliptical nanohole in a thin gold film can generate a localized chiral optical
field for chiroptical analysis and simultaneously serve as a near-field optical
trap to capture dielectric and plasmonic nanospheres. In particular, the
trapping potential is enantioselective for dielectric nanospheres, i.e., the
hole traps or repels the dielectric nanoparticles depending on the sample
chirality. For plasmonic nanospheres, the trapping potential well is much
deeper than that for dielectric particles, rendering the enantioselectivity
less pronounced. This platform is suitable for chiral analysis with
nanoparticle-based solid-state extraction and pre-concentration. Compared to
plasmonic chiroptical sensing using chiral structures or circularly polarized
light, elliptical nanoholes are a simple and effective platform, which is
expected to have a relatively low background because chiroptical noise from the
structure or chiral species outside the nanohole is minimized. The usage of
linearly polarized excitation also makes the platform easily compatible with a
commercial optical microscope.

at a distance close to the Milky Way virial radius. Early shallow
color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) indicated that it possibly hosted an
intermediate-age or even young stellar population, which is unusual for a
galaxy of this mass. In this paper, we present new ACS/HST CMDs reaching the
oldest main sequence turnoff with excellent photometric precision, and derive a
precise star formation history (SFH) for this galaxy through CMD-fitting. This
SFH shows that the bulk of the stellar mass in Eri II formed in an extremely
short star formation burst at the earliest possible time. The derived star
formation rate profile has a width at half maximum of 500 Myr and reaches a
value compatible with null star formation 13 Gyr ago. However, tests with mock
stellar populations and with the CMD of the globular cluster M92 indicate that
the star formation period could be shorter than 100 Myr.
  From the quantitative determination of the amount of mass turned into stars
in this early star formation burst (~2x10^5 Msun) we infer the number of SNe
events and the corresponding energy injected into the interstellar medium. For
reasonable estimates of the EriII virial mass and values of the coupling
efficiency of the SNe energy, we conclude that EriII could be quenched by SNe
feedback alone, thus casting doubts on the need to invoke cosmic reionization
as the preferred explanation for the early quenching of old UFD galaxies.

these issues, PEP 484 introduced optional type annotations for Python. As
retrofitting types to existing codebases is error-prone and laborious, machine
learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to enable automatic type
inference based on existing, partially annotated codebases. However, previous
ML-based approaches are trained and evaluated on human-provided type
annotations, which might not always be sound, and hence this may limit the
practicality for real-world usage. In this paper, we present Type4Py, a deep
similarity learning-based hierarchical neural network model. It learns to
discriminate between similar and dissimilar types in a high-dimensional space,
which results in clusters of types. Likely types for arguments, variables, and
return values can then be inferred through the nearest neighbor search. Unlike
previous work, we trained and evaluated our model on a type-checked dataset and
used mean reciprocal rank (MRR) to reflect the performance perceived by users.
The obtained results show that Type4Py achieves an MRR of 77.1%, which is a
substantial improvement of 8.1% and 16.7% over the state-of-the-art approaches

$T_\mathrm{e,c}$ below 9$~$keV, the post-disruption runaway current is
predicted to be insensitive to the initial temperature, in agreement with
experimental observations. Yet in hotter plasmas with $T_\mathrm{e,c} >
10~\mathrm{keV}$, hot-tail runaway can be increased by up to an order of
magnitude, contributing considerably to the total post-disruption runaway
current. In ASDEX Upgrade high temperature runaway experiments, however, no
runaway current is observed at the end of the disruption, despite favourable
conditions for both primary and secondary runaway.

disorder in CZTS while a clear consensus between theoretical and experimental

approximation, we take into account the progressive nature of Cu-Zn disorder in
CZTS: we obtain the phonon frequencies at zone-center within the density
functional perturbation theory formalism, and further compute the Raman spectra
for the disordered phases, achieving a consensus between theory and experiment.
These calculations confirm the presence of complete disorder in Cu-Zn 2$a$,
2$c$ and 2$d$ Wyckoff sites. They also show that the Raman intensities of two

quickly and in situ from a turbulent clumpy disc. Subsequently, thin discs
formed slowly within them from leftovers of the turbulent phase and from
material accreted through cold flows and minor mergers. In this letter, I
propose an observational test to verify this hypothesis. By combining thick
disc and total stellar masses of edge-on galaxies with galaxy stellar mass
functions calculated in the redshift range of $z\leq3.0$, I derived a positive
correlation between the age of the youngest stars in thick discs and the
stellar mass of the host galaxy; galaxies with a present-day stellar mass of
$\mathcal{M}_\star(z=0)<10^{10}\,\mathcal{M}_\odot$ have thick disc stars as
young as $4-6\,{\rm Gyr}$, whereas the youngest stars in the thick discs of
Milky-Way-like galaxies are $\sim10\,{\rm Gyr}$ old. I tested this prediction
against the scarcely available thick disc age estimates, all of them are from
galaxies with $\mathcal{M}_\star(z=0)\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathcal{M}_\odot$, and I
find that field spiral galaxies seem to follow the expectation. On the other
hand, my derivation predicts ages that are too low for the thick discs in
lenticular galaxies, indicating a fast early evolution for S0 galaxies. I
propose the idea of conclusively testing whether thick discs formed quickly and
in situ by obtaining the ages of thick discs in field galaxies with masses of
$\mathcal{M}_\star(z=0)\sim10^{9.5}\,\mathcal{M}_\odot$ and by checking whether
they contain $\sim5\,{\rm Gyr}$-old stars.

bolometric luminosity and produces strong, narrow, X-ray reflection features.
The softer component is responsible for the underlying broader reflection
features. The data are compatible with the harder component having a large
scale height, located downstream the disk truncation radius, and reflecting
mostly from remote parts of the disk. The softer component forms a corona above
the disk up to some transition radius. Our findings can explain the changes of
the characteristic variability time scales, found in other works, as being
driven by the changes of the disk characteristic radii.

Galactocentric radius $R$, we model $p([\alpha/\text{Fe}])$ as a sum of two
Gaussians, representing ""low-$\alpha$"" and ""high-$\alpha$"" populations with
scale heights $z_1=0.45\,\text{kpc}$ and $z_2=0.95\,\text{kpc}$, respectively.
By accounting for age-dependent and $z$-dependent selection effects in APOGEE,
we infer the [$\alpha$/Fe] distributions that would be found for a fair sample
of long-lived stars covering all $z$. Near the Solar circle, this distribution
is bimodal at sub-solar [Fe/H], with the low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ peaks
clearly separated by a minimum at intermediate [$\alpha$/Fe]. In agreement with
previous results, we find that the high-$\alpha$ population is more prominent
at smaller $R$, lower [Fe/H], and larger $|z|$, and that the sequence
separation is smaller for Si and Ca than for Mg, O, and S. We find significant
intrinsic scatter in [$\alpha$/Fe] at fixed [Fe/H] for both the low-$\alpha$
and high-$\alpha$ populations, typically $\sim 0.04$-dex. The means,
dispersions, and relative amplitudes of this two-Gaussian description, and the
dependence of these parameters on $R$, [Fe/H], and $\alpha$-element, provide a
quantitative target for chemical evolution models and a test for hydrodynamic
simulations of disk galaxy formation. We argue that explaining the observed

spawned new research which culminated in novel applications using it today.
Although the safety and liveness properties of PBFT-type protocols have been
rigorously analyzed, when it comes to practical performance only empirical
results - often in artificial settings - are known and imperfections on the
communication channels are not specifically considered. In this work we present
the first performance model for PBFT specifically considering the impact of
unreliable channels and the use of different transport protocols over them. We
also did extensive simulations to verify the model and to gain more insight on
the impact of deployment parameters on the overall transaction time. We show
that the usage of UDP can lead to significant speedup for PBFT protocols
compared to TCP when tuned accordingly even over lossy channels. Finally, we
compared the simulation to a real implementation and measure the benefits of a
developed improvement directly. We found that the impact on the design of the
network layer has been overlooked in the past but offers some additional room
for improvement when it comes to practical performance. In this work we are

described by a graphical model, where variables are represented by nodes on a
graph and an edge between two nodes is used to indicate their conditional

high-dimensional setting, typically using penalty functions to induce sparsity

Bayesian methods have been proposed for such problems more recently, where the
prior takes care of the sparsity structure. These methods have the natural
ability to also automatically quantify the uncertainty of the inference through
the posterior distribution. Theoretical studies of Bayesian procedures in
high-dimension have been carried out recently. Questions that arise are,
whether the posterior distribution contracts near the true value of the
parameter at the minimax optimal rate, whether the correct lower-dimensional
structure is discovered with high posterior probability, and whether a credible
region has adequate frequentist coverage. In this paper, we review these
properties of Bayesian and related methods for several high-dimensional models

on complementary directional and hyperplanar reductions. The deviation from
cubicity at each step of the reduction process is evaluated by a parameter
called lattice rhombicity, which is simply the sum of the absolute values of

attention, which is composed of a channel attention module and a spatial
attention module. Specifically, the proposed fusion approach mainly comprises
three key components: feature extraction, feature fusion and image
reconstruction. We firstly utilize seven convolutional blocks to extract the
image features from source images. Then, the extracted convolutional features
are fused by the proposed fusion strategy in the feature fusion layer. Finally,
the fused image features are reconstructed by four convolutional blocks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach for multi-focus

K- and M-dwarf planet atmospheres into chemical equilibria that substantially
deviate from their pre-flare regimes, whereas G-dwarf planet atmospheres
quickly return to their baseline states. Interestingly, simulated O$_2$-poor
and O$_2$-rich atmospheres experiencing flares produce similar mesospheric
nitric oxide abundances, suggesting that stellar flares can highlight otherwise
undetectable chemical species. Applying a radiative transfer model to our CCM
results, we find that flare-driven transmission features of bio-indicating
species, such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid, show
particular promise for detection by future instruments.

potential energy surface of pure cage to structure seeker. Further analysis of
different properties of the global minima, reveal that the extra electron

distributed on the cage and increases the encapsulation energy; thereby
stabilizing the system. We also provide estimates of the stability for

significant research attention over the last several years, driven by a broad
range of important applications and enabled by advancements in materials and
surface nanoengineering. Researchers have investigated the effect of
temperature on droplet-surface interactions, which poses additional challenges
when liquid nucleation manifests itself, due to ensuing condensation into the
surface texture that compromises its anti-wetting behavior. Maintaining surface
transparency at the same time poses an additional and significant challenge.
Often, the solutions proposed are limited by working temperatures or are
detrimental to visibility through the surface. Here we introduce a scalable
method employing plasmonic photothermal metasurface composites, able to harvest
sunlight and naturally heat the surface, sustaining water repellency and
transparency under challenging environmental conditions where condensation and
fogging would otherwise be strongly promoted. We demonstrate that these
surfaces, when illuminated by sunlight, can prevent impalement of impacting
water droplets, even when the droplet to surface temperature difference is
50{\deg}C, by suppressing condensate formation within the texture, maintaining
transparency. We also show how the same transparent metasurface coating could
be combined and work collaboratively with hierarchical micro- and nanorough
textures, resulting in simultaneous superior pressure-driven impalement
resistance and avoidance of water nucleation and related possible frosting in
supercooled conditions. Our work can find a host of applications as a
sustainable solution against impacting water on surfaces such as windows,
eyewear, and optical components.

makes it possible to relate the source of erroneous predictions to either the

(ISMR) at least one season in advance has great socio-economic value. It
represents a lifeline for about a sixth of the world's population. The ISMR
prediction remained a challenging problem with the sub-critical skills of the
dynamical models attributable to limited understanding of the interaction among
clouds, convection, and circulation. The variability of cloud hydrometeors
(cloud ice and cloud water) in different time scales (3-7 days, 10-20 days and
30-60 days bands) are examined from re-analysis data during Indian summer
monsoon (ISM). Here, we also show that the 'internal' variability of cloud
hydrometeors (particularly cloud ice) associated with the ISM sub-seasonal
(synoptic + intra-seasonal) fluctuations is partly predictable as they are
found to be tied with slowly varying forcing (e.g., El Ni\~no and Southern
Oscillation). The representation of deep convective clouds, which involve ice
phase processes in a coupled climate model, strongly modulates ISMR variability
in association with global predictors. The results from the two sensitivity
simulations using coupled global climate model (CGCM) are provided to
demonstrate the importance of the cloud hydrometeors on ISM rainfall
predictability. Therefore, this study provides a scientific basis for improving
the simulation of the seasonal ISMR by improving the physical processes of the
cloud on a sub-seasonal time scale and motivating further research in this
direction.

the gel is basically driven by the local balancing between active injection and
viscous dissipation, without any signal of non-linear hydrodynamical transfer

  ""Beyond Next Step Bias: Trajectory Simulation for Understanding Recommender
  System Behavior""",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Imagine a food recommender system -- how would we check if it is
\emph{causing} and fostering unhealthy eating habits or merely reflecting
users' interests? How much of a user's experience over time with a recommender
is caused by the recommender system's choices and biases, and how much is based
on the user's preferences and biases? Popularity bias and filter bubbles are
two of the most well-studied recommender system biases, but most of the prior
research has focused on understanding the system behavior in a single
recommendation step. How do these biases interplay with user behavior, and what
types of user experiences are created from repeated interactions?
  In this work, we offer a simulation framework for measuring the impact of a
recommender system under different types of user behavior. Using this
simulation framework, we can (a) isolate the effect of the recommender system
from the user preferences, and (b) examine how the system performs not just on
average for an ""average user"" but also the extreme experiences under atypical
user behavior. As part of the simulation framework, we propose a set of
evaluation metrics over the simulations to understand the recommender system's
behavior. Finally, we present two empirical case studies -- one on traditional
collaborative filtering in MovieLens and one on a large-scale production
recommender system -- to understand how popularity bias manifests over time.

colimit"", whereby one replaces parts of a diagram by their colimits. We make
this intuition precise by means of the ""partial evaluations"" sitting in the
so-called bar construction of monads. The (pseudo)monads of interest for
forming colimits are the monad of diagrams and the monad of small presheaves,
both on the (huge) category CAT of locally small categories. Throughout,
particular care is taken to handle size issues, which are notoriously delicate
in the context of free cocompletion.
  We spell out, with all 2-dimensional details, the structure maps of these
pseudomonads. Then, based on a detailed general proof of how the
""restriction-of-scalars"" construction of monads extends to the case of
pseudoalgebras over pseudomonads, we define a morphism of monads between them,
which we call ""image"". This morphism allows us in particular to generalize the
idea of ""confinal functors"" i.e. of functors which leave colimits invariant in
an absolute way. This generalization includes the concept of absolute colimit
as a special case.
  The main result of this paper spells out how a pointwise left Kan extension
of a diagram corresponds precisely to a partial evaluation of its colimit. This
categorical result is analogous to what happens in the case of probability
monads, where a conditional expectation of a random variable corresponds to a
partial evaluation of its center of mass.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Differentially private (DP) machine learning allows us to train models on
private data while limiting data leakage. DP formalizes this data leakage
through a cryptographic game, where an adversary must predict if a model was
trained on a dataset D, or a dataset D' that differs in just one example.If
observing the training algorithm does not meaningfully increase the adversary's
odds of successfully guessing which dataset the model was trained on, then the
algorithm is said to be differentially private. Hence, the purpose of privacy
analysis is to upper bound the probability that any adversary could
successfully guess which dataset the model was trained on.In our paper, we
instantiate this hypothetical adversary in order to establish lower bounds on
the probability that this distinguishing game can be won. We use this adversary
to evaluate the importance of the adversary capabilities allowed in the privacy
analysis of DP training algorithms.For DP-SGD, the most common method for
training neural networks with differential privacy, our lower bounds are tight
and match the theoretical upper bound. This implies that in order to prove
better upper bounds, it will be necessary to make use of additional
assumptions. Fortunately, we find that our attacks are significantly weaker
when additional (realistic)restrictions are put in place on the adversary's
capabilities.Thus, in the practical setting common to many real-world
deployments, there is a gap between our lower bounds and the upper bounds
provided by the analysis: differential privacy is conservative and adversaries
may not be able to leak as much information as suggested by the theoretical
bound.

Their periods cover a range from 5 yr to more than 500 yr; and their spectral

more than 4 MSun down to 0.2 MSun. They are located at distances between
approximately 12 and 200 pc, mostly at low Galactic latitude.

emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based
on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits
anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons.
Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which
link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines
for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation
with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support
their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for
the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series
forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the
emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders
can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when
limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).
Originality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict
mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective
level has received scarce attention. We take a step forward by proposing a
forecasting approach for analyzing the mental health of a given population (or
group of individuals) at a larger scale. Practical implications. We believe
that this work contributes to a better understanding of how psychological
processes related to crisis manifest in social media, being a valuable asset
for the design, implementation and monitoring of health prevention and
communication policies.

orbital dynamics of selected high-inclination objects. BVRI photometric
observations were performed in 2019-2020 using the 2.0m telescope at the
Terskol Observatory and the 2.6m telescope at the Crimean Astrophysical

was studied using numerical simulations. We obtained new photometric
observations of six high-inclination objects. All of the objects have similar
$B-V$, $V-R$, $R-I$ colours, which are close to those of moderately red TNOs
and grey Centaurs. The photometric data that were extracted from the all-sky
surveys also correspond to moderately red surfaces of high-inclination objects.
No signs of ultra-red material on the surface of high-inclination asteroids
were found, which supports the results of previous works. The comet C/2018 DO4

associated with particles that were ejected from the cometary nucleus. For
objects 2013 LU28, 2015 KZ120, and 2020 EP we estimated future and past
lifetimes on their orbits. It appears that the orbits of considered objects are
strongly chaotic, and with the available accuracy of the orbital elements no
reliable predictions can be made about their distant past or future. The
lifetimes of high-inclination objects turned out to be highly non-sensitive to
the precision of the orbital elements, and to the Yarkovsky orbital drift.

electrostatic and gradient energies, in contrast to the key role of the
anti-symmetric Dzyalozhinskii-Moriya interaction in magnetic skyrmions. With
the discovery of topologically-stable polar skyrmions, it is of both
fundamental and practical interest to understand the microscopic nature and the
possibility of temperature- and strain-driven phase transitions in ensembles of
such polar skyrmions. Here, we explore the reversible transition from a
skyrmion state (topological charge of -1) to a two-dimensional, tetratic
lattice of merons (with topological charge of -1/2) upon varying the
temperature and elastic boundary conditions in [(PbTiO3)16/(SrTiO3)16]8
lifted-off membranes. This topological phase transition is accompanied by a
change in chirality, from zero-net chirality (in meronic phase) to
net-handedness (in skyrmionic phase). To map these changes microscopically
required developing new imaging methods. We show how scanning convergent beam
electron diffraction provides a robust measure of the local polarization
simultaneously with the strain state at sub-nm resolution, while also directly
mapping the chirality of each skyrmion. Using this, we demonstrate strain as a
crucial order parameter to drive isotropic-to-anisotropic structural
transitions of chiral polar skyrmions to non-chiral merons, validated with
X-ray reciprocal space mapping and theoretical phase-field simulations. These
results revealed by our new measurement methods provide the first illustration
of systematic control of rich variety of topological dipole textures by
altering the mechanical boundary conditions, which may offer a promising way to
control their functionalities in ferroelectric nanodevices using the local and
spatial distribution of chirality and order.

2014 performed with AstroSat and XMM-Newton, respectively. Both observations
show extremely variable soft and hard X-ray emission that are correlated with
each other. In the 2014 data set, the source retains its general behaviour of
""softer when brighter"" while the 2017 observation exhibits a ""harder when
brighter"" nature. Such changing behaviour is rare in AGNs and is usually
observed in the black hole binary systems. The ""harder when brighter"" is
confirmed with the anti-correlation between the photon index and the 0.3-10 keV
power-law flux. This suggests a possible change in the accretion mode from
standard to the advection-dominated flow. Additionally, both the observations
show soft X-ray excess below 2 keV over the power-law continuum. This excess
was fitted with a single or multiple blackbody component(s). The origin of soft
excess during the 2017 observation is likely due to the cool Comptonization as
the photon index changes with time. On the other hand, the broad iron line and
delayed UV emission during the 2014 observation strongly suggest that X-ray
illumination onto the accretion disk and reflection and reprocessing play a
significant role in this AGN.

challenging with traditional shear geometries. Here we show that the
rheological properties of a sample experiencing `slow' evaporation can be
monitored in a time-resolved fashion by using a zero normal-force controlled
protocol in a parallel-plate geometry. Solvent evaporation from the sample
leads to a decrease of the normal force, which is compensated at all times by a
decrease of the gap height between the plates. As a result, the sample
maintains a constant contact area with the plates despite the significant
decrease of its volume. We validate the method under both oscillatory and
continuous shear by accurately monitoring the viscosity of water-glycerol
mixtures experiencing evaporation and a relative volume decrease as large as
70%. Moreover, we apply this protocol to dehydrating suspensions. Specifically,
we monitor a dispersion of charged silica nanoparticles undergoing a glass
transition induced by evaporation. While the decrease in gap height provides a
direct estimate of the increasing particle volume fraction, oscillatory and
continuous shear measurements allow us to monitor the suspension's evolving
viscoelastic properties in real-time. Overall, our study shows that a zero

sliding-induced relaxation and quiescent recovery. \textbf{Methods} Our

hydrogels on smooth poly(methyl methacrylate) surfaces over a variety of

fixed sliding velocity, the friction coefficient decays exponentially and
reaches a steady-state value. The time constant associated with this decay
varies exponentially with the sliding velocity, and is sensitive to any
precedent frictional shearing of the interface. This process is reversible;
upon cessation of sliding, the friction coefficient recovers to its original
state. We also show that the initial direction of shear can be imprinted as an
observable ""memory"", and is visible after 24 hrs of repeated frictional
shearing. \textbf{Conclusions} We attribute this behavior to nanoscale
extension and relaxation dynamics of the near-surface polymer network, leading

vastly higher energies than any other particles ever observed. Their origin and
chemical composition remain a mystery. As we show here, the large- and
intermediate-angular-scale anisotropies observed by the Pierre Auger
Observatory are a powerful tool for understanding the origin of UHECRs. Without
specifying any particular production mechanism, but only postulating that the
source distribution follows the matter distribution of the local Universe, a
good accounting of the magnitude, direction and energy dependence of the dipole
anisotropy at energies above $8 \times 10^{18}$ eV is obtained, after taking
into account the impact of energy losses during propagation (the ""GZK

Galactic magnetic field (GMF). This is a major step toward the long-standing
hope of using UHECR anisotropies to constrain UHECR composition and magnetic
fields. The observed dipole anisotropy is incompatible with a pure proton
composition in this scenario. With a more accurate treatment of energy losses,
it should be possible to further constrain the cosmic-ray composition and

usefully represented as abstract networks that encode the system's units and
inter-unit interactions. Understanding how physical rules shape the topological
structure of those networks can clarify a system's function and enhance our
ability to design, guide, or control its behavior. In the emerging area of
quantum network science, a key challenge lies in distinguishing between the
topological properties that reflect a system's underlying physics and those
that reflect the assumptions of the employed conceptual model. To elucidate and
address this challenge, we study networks that represent non-equilibrium
quantum-electronic transport through quantum antidot devices -- an example of
an open, mesoscopic quantum system. The network representations correspond to
two different models of internal antidot states: a single-particle,
non-interacting model and an effective model for collective excitations
including Coulomb interactions. In these networks, nodes represent accessible
energy states and edges represent allowed transitions. We find that both models
reflect spin conservation rules in the network topology through bipartiteness
and the presence of only even-length cycles. The models diverge, however, in
the minimum length of cycle basis elements, in a manner that depends on whether
electrons are considered to be distinguishable. Furthermore, the two models
reflect spin-conserving relaxation effects differently, as evident in both the
degree distribution and the cycle-basis length distribution. Collectively,
these observations serve to elucidate the relationship between network
structure and physical constraints in quantum-mechanical models. More

(ILSSP), in which non-identical machines work in parallel with non-triangular
sequence-dependent setup costs and times, setup carry-over and capacity
limitation. The aim of the studied ILSSP, here called ILSSP-NT on parallel
machines, is to determine a production planning and tasks sequencing that meet
period demands without delay and in such a way that the total costs of
production, machine setup and inventory are minimized. The dearth of literature
on the ILSSP-NT, despite the increasing amount of applications in the
industrial sector, mainly in the food processing industry, motivated us to
conduct this study. In this paper, we propose efficient methods to solve the
ILSSP-NT on parallel machines. The methods virtually consist in the
hybridization of the relax-and-fix and fix-and-optimize methods with the
path-relinking and kernel search heuristics. To assess how well the heuristics
solve the ILSSP-NT on parallel machines, we compared their results with those
of the CPLEX solver with a fixed CPU time limit. The proposed matheuristics
significantly outperformed CPLEX in most of the tested instances.

terrestrial thunderstorms is attributed to the formation of parapositronia'
clouds. Unbound electron-positron pairs and positronia can be created by strong
electromagnetic fields produced in interactions of electrically charged
objects, in particular, in collisions of heavy nuclei. Kinematics of this
process favours abundant creation of the unbound electron-positron pairs with
very small masses and the confined parapositronia states which decay directly
to two 511 keV quanta. Therefore we propose to consider interactions of
electromagnetic fields of colliding heavy ions as a source of low-mass pairs
which can transform to 511 keV quanta. Intensity of their creation is enlarged
by the factor Z$^4$ (Z is the electric charge of a heavy ion) compared to
protons with Z=1. These processes are especially important at very high
energies of nuclear collisions because their cross sections increase
proportionally to cube of the logarithm of energy and can even exceed the cross
sections of strong interactions which may not increase faster than the squared
logarithm of energy. Moreover, production of extremely low-mass $e^+e^-$-pairs
in ultraperipheral nuclear collisions is strongly enhanced due to the
Sommerfeld-Gamow-Sakharov (SGS) factor which accounts for mutual Coulomb
attraction of non-relativistic electrons to positrons in case of low
pair-masses. This attraction may lead to their annihilation and, therefore, to
the increased intensity of 511 keV photons. It is proposed to confront the
obtained results to forthcoming experimental data at NICA collider.

tight constraint on the aperture and FoV size. To mitigate this limitation, we
propose to fill the gaps between the primary and the secondary with high index

material reduces ray angle and height, consequently the incident ray angle can
be increased, i.e., the FoV angle is extended. Defining telephoto ratio as the
ratio of lens thickness to focal length, we achieve telephoto ratios as small
as 0.43 for a visible Cassegrain thin lens and 1.20 for an infrared Cassegrain
thin lens. To achieve an arbitrary FoV coverage, we present an strategy by
integrating multiple thin lenses on one plane with each unit covering a

to their ability to push the sensitivity of a measurement apparatus beyond the
limits of classical states. While their creation in light has become a standard
technique, the production of squeezed states of the collective excitations in
gases of ultracold atoms, the phonons of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), is a
comparably recent problem. This task is continuously gaining relevance with a
growing number of proposals for BEC-based quantum metrological devices and the
possibility to apply them in the detection of gravitational waves. The
objective of this thesis is to find whether the recently described effect of an
oscillating external potential on a uniform BEC can be exploited to generate
two-mode squeezed phonon states, given present day technology. This question
brings together elements of a range of fields beyond cold atoms, such as
general relativity and Efimov physics. To answer it, the full transformation
caused by the oscillating potential on an initially thermal phononic state is
considered, allowing to find an upper bound for the magnitude of this
perturbation as well as to quantify the quality of the final state with respect
to its use in metrology. These findings are then applied to existing
experiments to judge the feasibility of the squeezing scheme and while the
results indicate that they are not well suited for it, a setup is proposed that
allows for its efficient implementation and seems within experimental reach. In
view of the vast parameter space leaving room for optimization, the considered
mechanism could find applications not only in the gravitational wave detector
that originally motivated this work, but more generally in the field of quantum
metrology based on ultracold atoms.

Mn-doped VI3 exhibits an unusual bipolar magnetic semiconductor property (BMS).
This unique combination of strong ferromagnetism and 100% spin polarization

one, and whose corresponding energy density mimics the one of the cosmological

(times three) is precisely the exponent of the momentum in the kinetic term. We
show that this inverse momentum operator appears in fractional quantum
mechanics and it is the inverse of the Riesz fractional derivative. The
observed vacuum energy can be obtained through the integral of the Fermi-Dirac

Finally, a possible thermal production and fate of fractional dark energy is
investigated.

deviation increase of the ancestral country female-male difference in schooling
is associated with 17.2% and 2.5% of a standard deviation increase in the

perspective in education uncovers a new channel for cultural transmission among
families, we interpret the findings as evidence of cultural persistence among
first generations and partial cultural assimilation of second generations.
Moreover, Disaggregation into country-groups reveals different paths for this
transmission: descendants of immigrants of lower-income countries show fewer
attachments to the gender opinions of their home country. Average local
education of natives can facilitate the acculturation process. Immigrants

industrial revolution 4.0. The combination of IoT, cloud computing and
healthcare can contribute in ensuring well-being of people. One important
challenge of IoT network is maintaining privacy and to overcome security
threats. This paper provides a systematic review of the security aspects of
IoT. Firstly, the application of IoT in industrial and medical service
scenarios are described, and the security threats are discussed for the
different layers of IoT healthcare architecture. Secondly, different types of
existing malware including spyware, viruses, worms, keyloggers, and trojan
horses are described in the context of IoT. Thirdly, some of the recent malware
attacks such as Mirai, echobot and reaper are discussed. Next, a comparative
discussion is presented on the effectiveness of different machine learning
algorithms in mitigating the security threats. It is found that the k-nearest
neighbor (kNN) machine learning algorithm exhibits excellent accuracy in
detecting malware. This paper also reviews different tools for ransomware
detection, classification and analysis. Finally, a discussion is presented on
the existing security issues, open challenges and possible future scopes in
ensuring IoT security.

instruments are widely used for characterizing the earth's subsurface
properties. They facilitate the extraction of natural resources such as oil and
gas. LWD instruments require real-time inversions of electromagnetic
measurements to estimate the electrical properties of the earth's subsurface
near the well and possibly correct the well trajectory. Deep Neural Network
(DNN)-based methods are suitable for the rapid inversion of borehole
resistivity measurements as they approximate the forward and inverse problem
offline during the training phase and they only require a fraction of a second
for the evaluation (aka prediction). However, the inverse problem generally
admits multiple solutions. DNNs with traditional loss functions based on data
misfit are ill-equipped for solving an inverse problem. This can be partially
overcome by adding regularization terms to a loss function specifically
designed for encoder-decoder architectures. But adding regularization seriously
limits the number of possible solutions to a set of a priori desirable physical
solutions. To avoid this, we use a two-step loss function without any
regularization. In addition, to guarantee an inverse solution, we need a
carefully selected measurement acquisition system with a sufficient number of
measurements. In this work, we propose a DNN-based iterative algorithm for
designing such a measurement acquisition system. We illustrate our DNN-based
iterative algorithm via several synthetic examples. Numerical results show that
the obtained measurement acquisition system is sufficient to identify and
characterize both resistive and conductive layers above and below the logging
instrument. Numerical results are promising, although further improvements are
required to make our method amenable for industrial purposes.

two algorithms to extract the key operators, the Markov and the memory kernel,
using time series of a reduced set of observables in a dynamical system. We
adopted the Lorenz `96 system as a test problem and solved for the operators,
which exhibit complex behaviors which are unlikely to be captured by
traditional modeling approaches, in Mori-Zwanzig analysis. The nontrivial
Generalized Fluctuation Dissipation relationship, which relates the memory

numerically verified as a validation of the solved operators. We present
numerical evidence that the Generalized Langevin Equation, a key construct in

it is unwise to use the capstan equation (i.e. belt-friction models in general)
to calculate the friction between in-vivo skin and fabrics. This is due to the
fact that such models assume a rigid foundation, while human soft-tissue is
deformable, and thus, a portion of the applied force to the fabric is expended
on deforming the soft-tissue, which in turn leads to the illusion of a higher
coefficient of friction when using belt-friction models.

refraction based on synthetic gauge fields, which affect classical waves as if
they were charged particles in electromagnetic fields, but this has not
hitherto been demonstrated in experiment. Here, we report on the experimental
demonstration of gauge-field-induced negative refraction in a twisted bilayer
acoustic metamaterial. The bilayer twisting produces a synthetic gauge field
for sound waves propagating within a projected two-dimensional geometry, with
the magnitude of the gauge field parameterized by the choice of wavenumber
along the third dimension. Waveguiding with backward propagating modes is also
demonstrated in a trilayer configuration that implements strong gauge fields.
These results provide an alternative route to achieving negative refraction in

remote locations with limited transmission capacity. As a result, it can lead
to major curtailments of the free resource when the network is congested.
Therefore, energy storage system (ESS) is considered as a viable solution to
store energy and address the intermittent nature of RES though ESS is often

suffer from limited transmission capacity due to network congestion. Currently,
grid operators overlook network flexibility as a congestion management tool in

benefits of introducing network reconfiguration (NR) as a preventive and
corrective action for transmission flexibility in day-ahead stochastic
