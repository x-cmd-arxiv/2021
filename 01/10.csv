the most important challenges is how to efficiently compute the similarities
between different vessel trajectories. The computation of vessel trajectory
similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data
mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based
methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and
sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To
eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which
automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional
auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory
images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices
while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel
trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations
of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory
similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities
between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the
raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have
demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional
trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be
guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation
results.

is common in biology. The resulting colonies of the invading cells are often
observed to exhibit intricate patterns whose morphology and dynamics can depend
on a number of factors, particularly the mechanical properties of the substrate
and the motility of the individual cells. We use simulations of a minimal 2D
model of self-propelled rods moving through with a passive compliant medium
consisting of particles that offer elastic resistance before being plastically
displaced from their equilibrium positions. It is observed that the
motility-induced clustering of active (self-propelled) particles is crucial for
understanding the morphodynamics of colonisation. Clustering enables motile
colonies to spread faster than they would have as isolated particles. The
colonisation rate depends non-monotonically on substrate stiffness with a
distinct maximum at a non-zero value of substrate stiffness. This is observed
to be due to a change in the morphology of clusters. Furrow networks created by
the active particles have a fractal-like structure whose dimension varies
systematically with substrate stiffness but is less sensitive to particle
activity. The power-law growth exponent of the furrowed area is smaller than
unity, suggesting that, to sustain such extensive furrow networks, colonies
must regulate their overall growth rate.

The associated angular momentum is large, yet the mechanism of its generation
and its dependence on the mass of fragments remain poorly understood. In this
Letter, we provide the first microscopic calculations of angular momentum
distributions in fission fragments for a wide range of fragment masses. For the
benchmark case of $^{239}$Pu($n_{\text{th}}$,f), we find that the angular
momentum of the fragments is largely determined by the nuclear shell structure
and deformation, and that the heavy fragments therefore typically carry less
angular momentum than their light partners. We use the fission model
$\tt{FREYA}$ to simulate the emission of neutrons and photons from the
fragments. The dependence of the angular momenta on fragment mass after the
emission of neutrons and statistical photons is linear for the heavy fragments
and either constant or weakly linear for the light fragments, consistent with
the universal sawtooth pattern suggested by recent experimental data. Finally,
we observe that using microscopic angular momentum distributions modifies the
number of emitted photons significantly.

In this paper, we address the problem of active fire detection using deep

enjoying an enormous success in many fields, but their use for active fire
detection is relatively new, with open questions and demand for datasets and
architectures for evaluation. This paper addresses these issues by introducing
a new large-scale dataset for active fire detection, with over 150,000 image
patches (more than 200 GB of data) extracted from Landsat-8 images captured
around the world in August and September 2020, containing wildfires in several
locations. The dataset was split in two parts, and contains 10-band spectral
images with associated outputs, produced by three well known handcrafted
algorithms for active fire detection in the first part, and manually annotated
masks in the second part. We also present a study on how different
convolutional neural network architectures can be used to approximate these
handcrafted algorithms, and how models trained on automatically segmented
patches can be combined to achieve better performance than the original
algorithms - with the best combination having 87.2% precision and 92.4% recall

canonical map is of maximal dimension, satisfies $K_X^n \ge 2 (p_g-n)$. We
investigate the very interesting extremal situation $K_X^n=2(p_g-n)$, which
appears in a number of geometric situations. Since these extremal varieties are
natural higher dimensional analogues of Horikawa surfaces, we name them
Horikawa varieties. These varieties have been previously dealt with inthe works
of Fujita and Kobayashi. We carry out further studies of Horikawa varieties,
proving new results on various geometric and topological issues concerning
them. In particular, we prove that the geometric genus of those Horikawa
varieties whose image under the canonical map is singular is bounded. We give
an analogous result for polarized hyperelliptic subcanonical varieties, in
particular, for polarized Calabi-Yau and Fano varieties. The pleasing
numerology that emerges puts Horikawa's result on surfaces in a broader
perspective. We obtain a structure theorem for Horikawa varieties and explore
their pluriregularity. We use this to prove optimal results on projective
normality of pluricanonical linear systems. We study the fundamental groups of
Horikawa varieties, showing that they are simply connected, even if $Y$ is

determined from the computer simulations. In any domain, the probability
distribution can be described by the asymptote $~k^{-3/2}$ at moderate values
of $k$ if the spatial size of the block is less than the smallest
characteristic size of the domain. For large blocks, the exponential asymptote
$exp(-const \, k a^2/d_{as}^2)$ is valid, $d_{as}$ being the asymptotic domain
length (a is the monomer unit size). The number average block lengths and their
dispersities change linearly with the block length for lamellae, cylinders, and
balls, when the domain is characterized by a single characteristic size. If the
domain is described by more than one size, the number average block length can
grow nonlinearly with the domain sizes and the length das can depend on all of

also find that the RUWE goodness-of-fit statistic reported in Gaia EDR3 is
highly sensitive to unresolved companions (tertiaries in the case of our EB
sample) as well as to photocenter motion of the binaries themselves. RUWE is
nearly perfectly correlated ($r^2=0.82$) with photocenter motions down to
$\lesssim$0.1 mas, and surprisingly this correlation exists entirely within the
nominal ""good"" RUWE range of 1.0--1.4. This suggests that RUWE values even
slightly greater than 1.0 may signify unresolved binaries in Gaia, and that the
RUWE value can serve as a quantitative predictor of the photocenter motion.

played by molecular interactions on the thermomechanical properties. To
investigate the glass transition temperature (Tg) of SEBS, PP and their blends
at different ratio, the unit cell of the polymer molecular structure of each

exo-Earth and exo-planets. We say that the impact of the exo-Moon is
stabilising if upon the addition of the exo-Moon the range of obliquity

The exo-Earth is assumed to be rigid, axially symmetric and almost spherical,

inertia being a small parameter of the problem. Assuming the orbits of the
celestial bodies to be quasiperiodic, we apply time averaging to study rotation
of the exo-Earth at times large compared to the respective periods.
Non-resonant frequencies are assumed. We identify a class of systems for which

in scientific communities around the world. As these phenomena directly affect
our lives and seemingly more and more as our societies and communication
channels evolve it becomes ever so important for us to understand the
intricacies of opinion dynamics in the modern era. Here we extend an existing
echo chambers model with activity driven agents onto a bi-layer topology and
study the dynamics of the polarised state as a function of interlayer
couplings. Different cases of such couplings are presented - unidirectional
coupling that can be reduced to a mono-layer facing an external bias, symmetric
and non-symmetric couplings. We have assumed that initial conditions impose
system polarisation and agent opinions are different for both layers. Such a
pre-conditioned polarised state can sustain without explicit homophilic
interactions provided the coupling strength between agents belonging to
different layers is weak enough. For a strong unidirectional or attractive
coupling between two layers a discontinuous transition to a radicalised state
takes place when mean opinions in both layers are the same. When coupling
constants between the layers are of different signs the system exhibits
sustained or decaying oscillations. Transitions between these states are
analysed using a mean field approximation and classified in the framework of
bifurcation theory.

TESS data, TIC 168789840, also known as TYC 7037-89-1, the first known sextuple
system consisting of three eclipsing binaries. The target was observed in
Sectors 4 and 5 during Cycle 1, with lightcurves extracted from TESS Full Frame
Image data. It was also previously observed by the WASP survey and ASAS-SN. The
system consists of three gravitationally-bound eclipsing binaries in a
hierarchical structure of an inner quadruple system with an outer binary
subsystem. Follow-up observations from several different observatories were
conducted as a means of determining additional parameters. The system was
resolved by speckle interferometry with a 0.""42 separation between the inner
quadruple and outer binary, inferring an estimated outer period of ~2 kyr. It
was determined that the fainter of the two resolved components is an 8.217 day
eclipsing binary, which orbits the inner quadruple that contains two eclipsing
binaries with periods of 1.570 days and 1.306 days. MCMC analysis of the
stellar parameters has shown that the three binaries of TIC 168789840 are
""triplets"", as each binary is quite similar to the others in terms of mass,
radius, and Teff. As a consequence of its rare composition, structure, and
orientation, this object can provide important new insight into the formation,
dynamics, and evolution of multiple star systems. Future observations could
reveal if the intermediate and outer orbital planes are all aligned with the
planes of the three inner eclipsing binaries.

we show that the flux is in the Sobolev space $H^1(\Omega)^N$ and that the
optimal proportion of the materials is derivable in the orthogonal direction to

linking numbers modulo $k$. Such linking numbers can be viewed as coordinates
which embeds all link complement states into $\mathbb{Z}_k ^{\otimes n(n-1)/2}$
and the complexity is identified as the distance with respect to a particular

propose a numerical approximation using its associated ordinary differential

show that the ODE approximation achieves a $2$-Wasserstein error of
$\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}\big(d^{\frac{1}{3}}/\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{3}}\big)$ steps under
the standard smoothness and strong convexity assumptions on the target
distribution. This matches the complexity of the randomized midpoint method
proposed by Shen and Lee [NeurIPS 2019] which was shown to be order optimal by
Cao, Lu and Wang. However, the main feature of the proposed numerical method is
that it can utilize additional smoothness of the target log-density $f$. More
concretely, we show that the ODE approximation achieves a $2$-Wasserstein error
of $\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}\big(d^{\frac{2}{5}}/\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{5}}\big)$ and
$\mathcal{O}\big(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}}\big)$ steps when Lipschitz
continuity is assumed for the Hessian and third derivative of $f$. By
discretizing this ODE using a third order Runge-Kutta method, we can obtain a
practical MCMC method that uses just two additional gradient evaluations per
step. In our experiment, where the target comes from a logistic regression,
this method shows faster convergence compared to other unadjusted Langevin MCMC
algorithms.

provides a complementary tool to numerical simulations, as it enables us to
generate very quickly fairly realistic velocity fields and magnetic fields, the
statistics of which are controllable with intuitive parameters. Therefore our

maybe even more than the model itself, it is the very procedure that matters
the most: our model is modular, in the sense that it is constructed gradually,
with intuitive and physically motivated steps, so that it is prone to many

saturates thereafter, in agreement with experiments. The calculated DMI shows a
spread in values around the experimental mean, depending on the atomic
configuration of the cap layer interface. The saturation is attributed to the
vanishing of spin orbit coupling energy at the cap layer and the simultaneous
constancy at the bottom interface. Additionally, we predict the DMI in
Pt/GdCo/X (X=Ta, W, Ir) and find that W in the cap layer favors a higher DMI
than Ta and Ir that can be attributed to the difference in d-band alignment
around the Fermi level. Our results open up exciting combinatorial
possibilities for controlling the DMI in ferrimagnets towards nucleating and
manipulating ultrasmall high-speed skyrmions.

  We take a beyond worst-case view and instead consider tournaments which are
""close to uniform"": the outcome of all matches are independent, and no team is
believed to win any match with probability exceeding $1/2+\varepsilon$. We show
that Randomized Single Elimination Bracket [Schneider et al., 2017] and a new
tournament rule we term Randomized Death Match have the property that no pair

least-square (WLS) algorithm and solved using iterative methods such as
Gauss-Newton methods. However, iterative methods have become more sensitive to
system operating conditions than ever before due to the deployment of
intermittent renewable energy sources, low carbon technologies (e.g., electric
vehicles), and demand response programs. Appropriate PSSE approaches are
required to avoid pitfalls of the WLS-based PSSE computations for accurate
prediction of operating conditions. This paper proposes a data-driven real-time
PSSE using a deep ensemble learning algorithm. In the proposed approach, the
ensemble learning setup is formulated with dense residual neural networks as
base-learners and multivariate-linear regressor as meta-learner. Historical
measurements and states are utilised to train and test the model. The trained
model can be used in real-time to estimate power system states (voltage
magnitudes and phase angles) using real-time measurements. Most of current
data-driven PSSE methods assume the availability of a complete set of
measurements, which may not be the case in real power system data-acquisition.
This paper adopts multivariate linear regression to forecast system states for
instants of missing measurements to assist the proposed PSSE technique. Case
studies are performed on various IEEE standard benchmark systems to validate
the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms
existing data-driven PSSE methods techniques.

representing six key influencing factors affecting pandemic spread: social
demographics of counties, population activities, mobility within the counties,
movement across counties, disease attributes, and social network structure.
Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups according to their
population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three
stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening
stage. The study aims to answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which
the importance of heterogeneous features evolves in different stages; (2) The
extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varies across counties
with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to
determine weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social
demographic features, such as gross domestic product, population density, and
minority status maintained high-importance features throughout stages of
COVID-19 across the 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility features
had the highest importance in county clusters with higher population densities;
(3) The feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social
connectedness index), had higher importance in the models for counties with
higher population densities. The results show that the data-driven machine
learning models could provide important insights to inform policymakers
regarding feature importance for counties with various population densities and
in different stages of a pandemic life cycle.

conventional GCN models that carry out node-based attentions within each layer,
the proposed SPAGAN conducts path-based attention that explicitly accounts for
the influence of a sequence of nodes yielding the minimum cost, or shortest
path, between the center node and its higher-order neighbors. SPAGAN therefore
allows for a more informative and intact exploration of the graph structure and
further {a} more effective aggregation of information from distant neighbors
into the center node, as compared to node-based GCN methods. We test SPAGAN on
the downstream classification task on several standard datasets, and achieve
performances superior to the state of the art. Code is publicly available at

of strong toroidal magnetic flux from the solar interior. Modeling of such
events has focused on the dynamics of compact magnetic entities, colloquially
known as ""flux tubes"", often considered to be isolated magnetic structures
embedded in an otherwise field-free environment. In this paper, we show that
relaxing such idealized assumptions can lead to surprisingly different
dynamics. We consider the rise of tube-like flux concentrations embedded in a
large-scale volume-filling horizontal field in an initially quiescent
adiabatically-stratified compressible fluid. In a previous letter, we revealed
the unexpected major result that concentrations that have their twist aligned
with the background field at the bottom of the tube are more likely to rise
than the opposite orientation (for certain values of the parameters). This bias
leads to a selection rule which, when applied to solar dynamics, is in
agreement with the observations known as the solar hemispheric helicity rule(s)
(SHHR). Here, we examine this selection mechanism in more detail than was
possible in the earlier letter. We explore the dependence on the parameters via
simulations, delineating the Selective Rise Regime (SRR), where the bias
operates. We provide a theoretical model to predict and explain the simulation
dynamics. Furthermore, we create synthetic helicity maps from Monte Carlo
simulations to mimic the SHHR observations and demonstrate that our mechanism
explains the observed scatter in the rule and its variation over the solar
cycle.

We center our study on the Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) dataset, a
gold standard collection of images depicting pediatric facial expressions along
with 100 human labels per image. To test the feasibility of crowdsourcing to
generate these labels, we used Microworkers to acquire labels for 207 CAFE

a short crowd filtration process. We then train two versions of a classifiers
on soft-target CAFE labels using the original 100 annotations provided with the
dataset: (1) a classifier trained with traditional one-hot encoded labels, and
(2) a classifier trained with vector labels representing the distribution of
CAFE annotator responses. We compare the resulting softmax output distributions
of the two classifiers with a 2-sample independent t-test of L1 distances
between the classifier's output probability distribution and the distribution
of human labels. While agreement with CAFE is weak for unfiltered crowd
workers, the filtered crowd agree with the CAFE labels 100% of the time for
many emotions. While the F1-score for a one-hot encoded classifier is much
higher (94.33% vs. 78.68%) with respect to the ground truth CAFE labels, the
output probability vector of the crowd-trained classifier more closely
resembles the distribution of human labels (t=3.2827, p=0.0014). Reporting an
emotion probability distribution that accounts for the subjectivity of human

that exist in this domain are usually recorded with a handheld camera which can
be shaky or even moving, posing a challenge for traditional feature
representation approaches for activity detection which mistakenly capture the
camera's motion as a feature. To address these issues, we first document the
advantages and limitations of current feature representation techniques for
activity recognition when applied to head banging detection. We then propose a
feature representation consisting exclusively of head pose keypoints. We create
a computer vision classifier for detecting head banging in home videos using a
time-distributed convolutional neural network (CNN) in which a single CNN
extracts features from each frame in the input sequence, and these extracted
features are fed as input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. On the
binary task of predicting head banging and no head banging within videos from
the Self Stimulatory Behaviour Dataset (SSBD), we reach a mean F1-score of
90.77% using 3-fold cross validation (with individual fold F1-scores of 83.3%,
89.0%, and 100.0%) when ensuring that no child who appeared in the train set
was in the test set for all folds. This work documents a successful technique
for training a computer vision classifier which can detect human motion with
few training examples and even when the camera recording the source clips is
unstable. The general methods described here can be applied by designers and
developers of interactive systems towards other human motion and pose
classification problems used in mobile and ubiquitous interactive systems.

the Aretakis constants and instability in a parallel-transported frame along a
null geodesic, i.e., some components of the higher-order covariant derivatives
of the field in the parallel-transported frame are constant or unbounded at the
late time, respectively. Because $AdS_2$ is maximally symmetric, any null
hypersurfaces have the same geometrical properties. Thus, if we prepare
parallel-transported frames along any null hypersurfaces, we can show that the
same instability emerges not only on the future Poincar\'e horizon but also on
any null hypersurfaces. This implies that the Aretakis instability in $AdS_2$
is the result of singular behaviors of the higher-order covariant derivatives
of the fields on the whole $AdS$ infinity, rather than a blow-up on a specific
null hypersurface. It is also discussed that the Aretakis constants and
instability are related to the conformal Killing tensors. We further explicitly
demonstrate that the Aretakis constants can be derived from ladder operators
constructed from the spacetime conformal symmetry.

compressed hydrides H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$ at high pressures over 150 GPa has
aroused great interest in reducing the stabilization pressure of
superconducting hydrides. For cerium hydride CeH$_9$ recently synthesized at
80$-$100 GPa, our first-principles calculations reveal that the strongly
hybridized electronic states of Ce 4$f$ and H 1$s$ orbitals produce the
topologically nontrivial Dirac nodal lines around the Fermi energy $E_F$, which
are protected by crystalline symmetries. By hole doping, $E_F$ shifts down
toward the topology-driven van Hove singularity to significantly increase the
density of states, which in turn raises a superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$ from 74 K up to 136 K at 100 GPa. The hole-doping
concentration can be controlled by the incorporation of Ce$^{3+}$ ions with
varying their percentages, which can be well electronically miscible with Ce
atoms in the CeH$_9$ matrix because both Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce behave similarly as
cations. Therefore, the interplay of symmetry, band topology, and hole doping
contributes to enhance $T_c$ in compressed CeH$_9$. This mechanism to enhance
$T_c$ can also be applicable to another superconducting rare earth hydride
LaH$_{10}$.

Gr\""obner bases of zero-dimensional ideals. The improvement scales down the
phenomenon of intermediate expression swell as well as the complexity of
Buchberger's algorithm to a significant degree. The idea is to compute a new
type of bases over principal ideal rings instead of over fields like Gr\""obner
bases. The generalizations of Buchberger's algorithm from over fields to over
rings are abundant in the literature. However they are limited to either
computations of strong Gr\""obner bases or modular computations of the numeral
coefficients of ideal bases with no essential improvement on the algorithmic
complexity. In this paper we make pseudo-divisions with multipliers to enhance
computational efficiency. In particular, we develop a new methodology in
determining the authenticity of the factors of the pseudo-eliminant, i.e., we
compare the factors with the multipliers of the pseudo-divisions instead of the
leading coefficients of the basis elements. In order to find out the exact form
of the eliminant, we contrive a modular algorithm of proper divisions over
principal quotient rings with zero divisors. The pseudo-eliminant and proper
eliminants and their corresponding bases constitute a decomposition of the
original ideal. In order to address the ideal membership problem, we elaborate
on various characterizations of the new type of bases. In the complexity
analysis we devise a scenario linking the rampant intermediate coefficient
swell to B\'ezout coefficients, partially unveiling the mystery of hight-level
complexity associated with the computation of Gr\""obner bases. Finally we make
exemplary computations to demonstrate the conspicuous difference between
Gr\""obner bases and the new type of bases.

  The intuitive answer is that it makes no difference, since you are equally

However, a naive expected value calculation implies you gain by switching,

needed for causal identification. Finally, we apply the algorithm on Tuebingen

by sensing the visual scene from multiple perspectives and have recently
emerged as a promising technology to boost the performance of human-machine
systems such as biometrics and affective computing. Despite the significant
success of LF representation for constrained facial image analysis, this
technology has never been used for face and expression recognition in the wild.
In this context, this paper proposes a new deep face and expression recognition
solution, called CapsField, based on a convolutional neural network and an
additional capsule network that utilizes dynamic routing to learn hierarchical
relations between capsules. CapsField extracts the spatial features from facial
images and learns the angular part-whole relations for a selected set of 2D
sub-aperture images rendered from each LF image. To analyze the performance of
the proposed solution in the wild, the first in the wild LF face dataset, along
with a new complementary constrained face dataset captured from the same
subjects recorded earlier have been captured and are made available. A subset
of the in the wild dataset contains facial images with different expressions,
annotated for usage in the context of face expression recognition tests. An
extensive performance assessment study using the new datasets has been
conducted for the proposed and relevant prior solutions, showing that the
CapsField proposed solution achieves superior performance for both face and
expression recognition tasks when compared to the state-of-the-art.

$3\times 3$ matrix spectral problem, but also being absence of stationary phase
points, which give rise to difficulty on the asymptotic analysis with
stationary phase method or classical Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. In
this paper, we study the long time asymptotics and asymptotic stability of
$N$-soliton solutions of the initial value problem for the three-wave equation
in the solitonic region \begin{align}
  &p_{ij,t}-n_{ij}p_{ij,x}+\sum_{k=1}^{3}(n_{kj}-n_{ik})p_{ik}p_{kj}=0,
  &p_{ij}(x, 0)=p_{ij,0}(x), \quad x \in \mathbb{R},\ t>0,\ i,j,k=1,2,3,

  &for\ i\neq j,\ p_{ij}=-\bar{p}_{ji}, \ n_{ij}=-n_{ji}, \end{align} where
$n_{ij}$ are constants. The study makes crucial use of the inverse scattering
transform as well as of the $\overline\partial$ generalization of Deift-Zhou
steepest descent method for oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems. Based on
the spectral analysis of the Lax pair associated with the three-wave equation
and scattering matrix, the solution of the Cauchy problem is characterized via
the solution of a RH problem. Further we derive the leading order approximation
to the solution $p_{ij}(x, t)$ for the three-wave equation in the solitonic
region of any fixed space-time cone. The asymptotic expansion can be
characterized with an $N(I)$-soliton whose parameters are modulated by a sum of
localized soliton-soliton interactions as one moves through the region; the
residual error order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ from a $\overline\partial$ equation.
Our results provide a verification of the soliton resolution conjecture and
asymptotic stability of N-soliton solutions for three-wave equation.

The cavities appear as such in X-ray images because the external medium has
been swept up, leaving a hot but low density bubble surrounding the radio
lobes. We explore here the predicted thermal X-ray emission from a large set of
high-resolution three dimensional simulations of radio galaxies driven by
supersonic jets. We assume adiabatic non-relativistic hydrodynamics with
injected straight and precessing jets of supersonic gas emitted from nozzles.
Images of X-ray Bremsstrahlung emission tend to generate oval cavities in the
soft keV bands and leading arcuate structures in hard X-rays. However, the
cavity shape is sensitive to the jet-ambient density contrast, varying from
concave-shaped at $\eta = 0.1$ to convex for $\eta = 0.0001$ where $\eta$ is
the jet/ambient density ratio.
  We find lateral ribs in the soft X-rays in certain cases and propose this as
an explanation for those detected in the vicinity of Cygnus\,A. In bi-lobed or
X-shaped sources and in curved or deflected jets, the strongest X-ray emission
is not associated with the hotspot but with the relic lobe or deflection
location. This is because the hot high-pressure and dense high-compression
regions do not coincide. Directed toward the observer, the cavity becomes a
deep round hole surrounded by circular ripples. With short radio-mode outbursts
with a duty cycle of 10\% , the intracluster medium simmers with low Mach
number shocks widely dissipating the jet energy in between active jet episodes.

LTO exhibits an unexpected SIT instead of a metallic behavior despite an

the normal state resistance curve, suggesting a first-order phase transition.
We speculate that the SIT and the thermal hysteresis stem from the enhanced
$3d$ electron correlations and the formation of orbital ordering by comparing
the transport and structural results of LTO with the other spinel oxide

obstructions to vacuum decay. For simplicity, we focused on massless scalar
fields and false vacua with a flat geometry. In this paper, we generalize those
findings to massive scalar fields with the same gravitational interactions,
namely an Einstein-Hilbert term, a quadratic Ricci scalar, and a non-minimal
coupling. We find that the scalar field reaches its asymptotic value faster
than in the massless case, in principle allowing for a wider range of theories
that may accommodate vacuum decay. Nonetheless, this hardly affects the
viability of the bounce in the scenarios here considered. We also briefly
consider other physically interesting theories by including higher-order
kinetic terms and changing the number of spacetime dimensions.

magnetohydrodynamics equations with a gray radiation transfer equation. The
main challenge is that the radiation travels at the speed of light while the
magnetohydrodynamics changes with the time scale of the fluid. The time scales
of these two processes can vary dramatically. In order to use mesh sizes and
time steps that are independent of the speed of light, asymptotic preserving
(AP) schemes in both space and time are desired. In this paper, we develop an
AP scheme in both space and time for the RMHD system. Two different scalings
are considered. One results in an equilibrium diffusion limit system, while the
other results in a non-equilibrium system. The main idea is to decompose the
radiative intensity into three parts, each part is treated differently with
suitable combinations of explicit and implicit discretizations guaranteeing the
favorable stability conditionand computational efficiency. The performance of
the AP method is presented, for both optically thin and thick regions, as well
as for the radiative shock problem.

extraction, aiming to detect the relation information between entity pairs in
unstructured natural language text and generate structured data in the form of
entity-relation triple. Although distant supervision methods can effectively
alleviate the problem of lack of training data in supervised learning, they
also introduce noise into the data, and still cannot fundamentally solve the
long-tail distribution problem of the training instances. In order to enable
the neural network to learn new knowledge through few instances like humans,
this work focuses on few-shot relation classification (FSRC), where a
classifier should generalize to new classes that have not been seen in the
training set, given only a number of samples for each class. To make full use
of the existing information and get a better feature representation for each
instance, we propose to encode each class prototype in an adaptive way from two
aspects. First, based on the prototypical networks, we propose an adaptive
mixture mechanism to add label words to the representation of the class
prototype, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to
integrate the label information into features of the support samples of each
class so as to get more interactive class prototypes. Second, to more
reasonably measure the distances between samples of each category, we introduce
a loss function for joint representation learning to encode each support
instance in an adaptive manner. Extensive experiments have been conducted on
FewRel under different few-shot (FS) settings, and the results show that the
proposed adaptive prototypical networks with label words and joint
representation learning has not only achieved significant improvements in

experiments. For one, Bayesian inference is a powerful approach to include
knowledge from experiment in improving computational models. ML-based methods
can also be used to handle problems that are formally intractable using
conventional approaches, such as exhaustive characterization of state-to-state

reactive networks as they occur in combustion has become possible using
machine-learned neural network potentials. This review provides an overview of
the questions that can and have been addressed using machine learning

  first presented at a workshop in December, 2019",,,,"cs.IT cs.NA math.IT math.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of recovering a signal $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ from a set of
magnitude measurements $y_i=|\langle \mathbf{a}_i, \mathbf{x} \rangle |, \;
i=1,\ldots,m$ is referred as phase retrieval, which has many applications in
fields of physical sciences and engineering. In this paper we show that the
smoothed amplitude flow model for phase retrieval has benign geometric
structure under the optimal sampling complexity. In particular, we show that
when the measurements $\mathbf{a}_i\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are Gaussian random
vectors and the number of measurements $m\ge Cn$, our smoothed amplitude flow
model has no spurious local minimizers with high probability, ie., the target
solution $\mathbf{x}$ is the unique global minimizer (up to a global phase) and
the loss function has a negative directional curvature around each saddle
point. Due to this benign geometric landscape, the phase retrieval problem can
be solved by the gradient descent algorithms without spectral initialization.
Numerical experiments show that the gradient descent algorithm with random
initialization performs well even comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms
with spectral initialization in empirical success rate and convergence speed.

robustly and reliably. While CueNet V1 has a single input image, the approach
with CueNet V2 was to take three consecutive 240 x 180-pixel images as an input
and transform them into a probability heatmap for the cueball's location. The
network was tested with a separate video that contained all sorts of

CueNet V1 predicted the correct cueball location in 99.6% of all frames, while
CueNet V2 had 99.8% accuracy.

tilted from the principal c axis by ~40{\deg}. The close relation of the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy to the crystal structure was documented. In

six-fold-like signal below the Curie temperature TC. With further cooling,
another six-fold-like signal with an angular shift of ~30{\deg} grows

For an input graph with prizes on the vertices and costs on the edges, the aim
of these problems is to find a connected subgraph such that the cost of its
edges does not exceed a given budget and its collected prize is maximum. A
vertex prize is collected when the vertex is visited, but the price can also be
partially collected if the vertex is covered, where an unvisited vertex is
covered by a visited one if the latter belongs to the former's neighbourhood. A
capacity limit is imposed on the number of vertices that can be covered by the
same visited vertex. Potential application areas include network design and
intermodal transportation. We develop a branch-and-cut framework and a Benders
decomposition for the exact solution of the problems in this class. We observe
that the former algorithm results in shorter computational times on average,
but also that the latter can outperform the former for specific instance
settings. Finally, we validate our algorithmic frameworks for the cases where
the subgraph is a tour and a tree, and for these two cases we also identify
novel symmetry-breaking inequalities.

  Communication System in Misalignment",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an indoor visible light communication (VLC) system with
multiple transmitters and receivers. Due to diffusivity of LED light beams,
photodiode receive signals from many directions. We use one concave and one
convex lens as optical antenna, and obtain the optimal lens structure by
optimizing which corresponds to the minimum condition number of channel gain
matrix. In this way the light emitted by different LED can be separated well
from each other then minimize signal interference. However, interference
increases in the case of system deviation, so we explore the system mobility.
Then subsequent signal processing is carried out, including signal combining
and successive interference cancellation (SIC). We combine the same signal
received by different receivers to improve signal to interference noise ratio
(SINR). And SIC can effectively restore interference and eliminate its impact.
The simulation results show that channel capacity can be increased by more than
5 times and up to 20 times under the condition of receiver and transmitter
alignment. In the case of movement, channel capacity can also be increased by
about 4 times on average. Moreover, the mobile range of system is also
significantly expanded.

fundamental step in the recovering of the 3D single-particle structure is to
align its 2D projections; thus, the construction of a canonical representation

clustering which fails to capture the continuous nature of image rotation,
others suffer from low-quality image reconstruction. We propose a novel method

transcendent, cf. \cite{LW,ACQ}. For general $n\geq 2$, a novel higher order
finite temperature Airy kernel has recently emerged in physics literature
\cite{DMS} and we show that the corresponding edge law in momentum space is now
governed by a distinguished Painlev\'e-II integro-differential hierarchy. Our
analysis is based on operator-valued Riemann-Hilbert techniques which produce a
Lax pair for an operator-valued Painlev\'e-II ODE system that naturally encodes
the aforementioned hierarchy. As byproduct, we establish a connection of the
integro-differential Painlev\'e-II hierarchy to a novel integro-differential
mKdV hierarchy.

regressions when the volatility of the innovations is random and
non-stationary. The volatility of many economic and financial time series
displays persistent changes and possible non-stationarity. However, the theory
of the bootstrap for such models has focused on deterministic changes of the
unconditional variance and little is known about the performance and the
validity of the bootstrap when the volatility is driven by a non-stationary
stochastic process. This includes near-integrated volatility processes as well
as near-integrated GARCH processes. This paper develops conditions for
bootstrap validity in time series regressions with non-stationary, stochastic
volatility. We show that in such cases the distribution of bootstrap statistics
(conditional on the data) is random in the limit. Consequently, the
conventional approaches to proving bootstrap validity, involving weak
convergence in probability of the bootstrap statistic, fail to deliver the
required results. Instead, we use the concept of `weak convergence in
distribution' to develop and establish novel conditions for validity of the
wild bootstrap, conditional on the volatility process. We apply our results to
several testing problems in the presence of non-stationary stochastic
volatility, including testing in a location model, testing for structural
change and testing for an autoregressive unit root. Sufficient conditions for
bootstrap validity include the absence of statistical leverage effects, i.e.,
correlation between the error process and its future conditional variance. The
results are illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations, which indicate that the
wild bootstrap leads to size control even in small samples.

Paul trap: it implies the use for this purpose of cold buffer atoms in the
region of atom-ion confinement-induced resonance (CIR). The problem is that the
unavoidable micromotion of the ion and the long-range nature of its interaction
with the environment of colder atoms in a hybrid atomic-ion trap prevent its
sympathetic cooling. We show that the destructive effect of ion micromotion on
its sympathetic cooling can however be suppressed in the vicinity of the
atom-ion CIR. The origin of this is the ""fermionization"" of the atom-ion wave
function near CIR, where the atom-ion pair behaves as a pair of noninteracting
identical fermions. This prevents the complete approach of the atom with the
ion near resonance and does not enhance the ion micromotion, which interferes
with its sympathetic cooling. We investigate the effect of sympathetic cooling
around CIRs in atom-ion and atom-atom confined collisions within the
qusiclassical-quantum approach using the Li-Yb$^+$ and Li-Yb confined systems
as an example. In this approach, the Schr\""odinger equation for a cold light
atom is integrated simultaneously with the classical Hamilton equations for a
hotter heavy ion or atom during collision. We have found the region near the

non-relativistic limit, the normal solutions correspond to the usual Coulomb
spectrum, whereas the abnormal ones do not have non-relativistic counterparts
-- they are absent in the Schr\""odinger equation framework. We have studied, in
the formalism of the light-front dynamics, the Fock-space content of the
abnormal solutions. It turns out that, in contrast to the normal ones, the
abnormal states are dominated by the massless exchange particles (by 90 \% or
more), what provides a natural explanation of their decoupling from the
two-body Schr\""odinger equation. Assuming that one of the massive constituents
is charged, we have calculated the electromagnetic elastic form factors of the
normal and abnormal states, as well as the transition form factors. The results
on form factors confirm the many-body nature of the abnormal states, as found
from the Fock-space analysis. The abnormal solutions have thus properties
similar to those of hybrid states, made here essentially of two massive
constituents and several or many massless exchange particles. They could also
be interpreted as the Abelian scalar analogs of the QCD hybrid states. The
question of the validity of the ladder approximation of the model is also
examined.

inference using unlocalized fast radio bursts is degenerate to the distribution

intergalactic baryon content and the fast radio burst redshift distribution
with the use of Bayesian statistics by comparing the likelihood of different
models to reproduce the observed statistics in order to infer the most likely
models. In addition to two models of the intergalactic medium, we consider
contributions from the local environment of the source, assumed to be a
magnetar, as well as a representative ensemble of host and intervening
galaxies. Results: Assuming that the missing baryons reside in the ionized
intergalactic medium, our results suggest that the redshift distribution of
observed fast radio bursts peaks at $z \lesssim 0.6$. However, conclusions from
different instruments regarding the intergalactic baryon content diverge and
thus require additional changes to the observed distribution of host redshifts,

text classification, there are at least three major challenges yet to be
addressed: adversarial robustness, explainability, and personalization. Here we
attempt to tackle these challenges by designing a new training scheme for model
compression and adversarial robustness, including the optimization of an
explainable feature mapping objective, a knowledge distillation objective, and
an adversarially robustness objective. The resulting compressed model is
personalized using on-device private training data via fine-tuning. We perform
extensive experiments to compare our approach with both compact RNN (e.g.,

interests drift as they progress through the course, and forum contents evolve
as students or instructors update them. In our paper, we propose to predict
future interest trajectories of students. Our model consists of two key
operations: 1) Update operation and 2) Projection operation. Update operation
models the inter-dependency between the evolution of student and thread using
coupled Recurrent Neural Networks when the student posts on the thread. The
projection operation learns to estimate future embedding of students and
threads. For students, the projection operation learns the drift in their
interests caused by the change in the course topic they study. The projection
operation for threads exploits how different posts induce varying interest
levels in a student according to the thread structure. Extensive
experimentation on three real-world MOOC datasets shows that our model
significantly outperforms other baselines for thread recommendation.

information about the object constituents by the material-specific energy
dependence of x-ray attenuation. The authors have investigated a
photon-counting spectral imaging system with two energy bins for
contrast-enhanced mammography. System optimization and the potential benefit
compared to conventional non-energy-resolved absorption imaging was studied.
  Methods: A framework for system characterization was set up that included
quantum and anatomical noise and a theoretical model of the system was
benchmarked to phantom measurements.
  Results: Optimal combination of the energy-resolved images corresponded
approximately to minimization of the anatomical noise, which is commonly
referred to as energy subtraction. In that case, an ideal-observer
detectability index could be improved close to 50% compared to absorption
imaging in the phantom study. Optimization with respect to the
signal-to-quantum-noise ratio, commonly referred to as energy weighting,
yielded only a minute improvement. In a simulation of a clinically more
realistic case, spectral imaging was predicted to perform approximately 30%
better than absorption imaging for an average glandularity breast with an
average level of anatomical noise. For dense breast tissue and a high level of
anatomical noise, however, a rise in detectability by a factor of 6 was
predicted. Another ~70-90% improvement was found to be within reach for an
optimized system.
  Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography is feasible and
beneficial with the current system, and there is room for additional
improvements. Inclusion of anatomical noise is essential for optimizing
spectral imaging systems.

connectivity analysis in complex systems. The lsAGC algorithm combines
dimension reduction with source time-series augmentation and uses predictive
time-series modeling for estimating directed causal relationships among
time-series. This method is a multivariate approach, since it is capable of
identifying the influence of each time-series on any other time-series in the
presence of all other time-series of the underlying dynamic system. We
quantitatively evaluate the performance of lsAGC on synthetic directional
time-series networks with known ground truth. As a reference method, we compare
our results with cross-correlation, which is typically used as a standard
measure of connectivity in the functional MRI (fMRI) literature. Using
extensive simulations for a wide range of time-series lengths and two different
signal-to-noise ratios of 5 and 15 dB, lsAGC consistently outperforms
cross-correlation at accurately detecting network connections, using Receiver
Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis, across all tested time-series
lengths and noise levels. In addition, as an outlook to possible clinical
application, we perform a preliminary qualitative analysis of connectivity
matrices for fMRI data of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients and typical
controls, using a subset of 59 subjects of the Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange II (ABIDE II) data repository. Our results suggest that lsAGC, by
extracting sparse connectivity matrices, may be useful for network analysis in
complex systems, and may be applicable to clinical fMRI analysis in future
research, such as targeting disease-related classification or regression tasks
on clinical data.

camera for person segmentation and so on. Accelerating the semantic
segmentation models on the mobile and edge devices are practical needs for the
industry. Recent years have witnessed the wide availability of CNN
(Convolutional Neural Networks) accelerators. They have the advantages on power
efficiency, inference speed, which are ideal for accelerating the semantic
segmentation models on the edge devices. However, the CNN accelerator chips
also have the limitations on flexibility and memory. In addition, the CPU load
is very critical because the CNN accelerator chip works as a co-processor with
a host CPU. In this paper, we optimize the semantic segmentation model in order
to fully utilize the limited memory and the supported operators on the CNN
accelerator chips, and at the same time reduce the CPU load of the CNN model to
zero. The resulting model is called GnetSeg. Furthermore, we propose the
integer encoding for the mask of the GnetSeg model, which minimizes the latency
of data transfer between the CNN accelerator and the host CPU. The experimental
result shows that the model running on the 224mW chip achieves the speed of

decades. However, most of its study results remain in the research paper and
cannot truly play a role in the securities market. One of the main reasons
leading to this situation is that the prediction error(PE) based evaluation
results have statistical flaws. Its prediction results cannot represent the
most critical financial direction attributes. So it cannot provide investors
with convincing, interpretable, and consistent model performance evaluation
results for practical applications in the securities market. To illustrate, we
have used data selected from 20 stock datasets over six years from the Shanghai
and Shenzhen stock market in China, and 20 stock datasets from NASDAQ and NYSE
in the USA. We implement six shallow and deep neural networks to predict stock
prices and use four prediction error measures for evaluation. The results show
that the prediction error value only partially reflects the model accuracy of
the stock price prediction, and cannot reflect the change in the direction of
the model predicted stock price. This characteristic determines that PE is not
suitable as an evaluation indicator of NNSPP. Otherwise, it will bring huge
potential risks to investors. Therefore, this paper establishes an experiment
platform to confirm that the PE method is not suitable for the NNSPP
evaluation, and provides a theoretical basis for the necessity of creating a
new NNSPP evaluation method in the future.

resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often
overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to

it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to
