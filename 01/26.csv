approach based on Sentence BERT model and retrofitting algorithm to compute
relatedness between any two biomedical concepts. Materials and Methods: We
generated concept vectors by encoding concept preferred terms using ELMo, BERT,
and Sentence BERT models. We used BioELMo and Clinical ELMo. We used Ontology
Knowledge Free (OKF) models like PubMedBERT, BioBERT, BioClinicalBERT, and
Ontology Knowledge Injected (OKI) models like SapBERT, CoderBERT, KbBERT, and
UmlsBERT. We trained all the BERT models using Siamese network on SNLI and STSb
datasets to allow the models to learn more semantic information at the phrase
or sentence level so that they can represent multi-word concepts better.
Finally, to inject ontology relationship knowledge into concept vectors, we
used retrofitting algorithm and concepts from various UMLS relationships. We
evaluated our hybrid approach on four publicly available datasets which also
includes the recently released EHR-RelB dataset. EHR-RelB is the largest
publicly available relatedness dataset in which 89% of terms are multi-word
which makes it more challenging. Results: Sentence BERT models mostly
outperformed corresponding BERT models. The concept vectors generated using the
Sentence BERT model based on SapBERT and retrofitted using UMLS-related
concepts achieved the best results on all four datasets. Conclusions: Sentence
BERT models are more effective compared to BERT models in computing relatedness
scores in most of the cases. Injecting ontology knowledge into concept vectors
further enhances their quality and contributes to better relatedness scores.

analog, digital, and communication resources for their interaction with the
physical environment. CPS are the backbone of enterprise, industrial, and

targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks
targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical
nature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced
leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover
vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation
under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on
CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately
represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible
attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model
formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware,
software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct
high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system's performance
under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using
scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability
prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching
framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS
is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The
key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can
be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more
resilient and secure CPS.

smaller protogroups with fewer members have been reported. LAGER-z7OD1 shows an
elongated shape and consists of two subprotoclusters, which would have merged
into one massive cluster with a present-day mass of $3.7 \times 10^{15}$ solar
masses. The total volume of the ionized bubbles generated by its member
galaxies is found to be comparable to the volume of the protocluster itself,

are calibration issues that require corrections to the published values and
uncertainties. AIMS. We want to characterize the behavior of the uncertainties
of the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. We also aim to provide a procedure for the
calculation of distances to stars and stellar clusters. METHODS. We reanalyze
some of the data in the calibration papers for QSO and LMC parallaxes and
combine those results with measurements for six bright GCs. We calculate the
angular covariance of EDR3 parallaxes at small separations based on the LMC
results and combine it with the results for larger angles using QSOs to obtain
an analytical formula for the angular covariance over the whole sky. The
results for the six GCs are used to validate the parallax bias correction as a
function of magnitude, color, and ecliptic latitude and to determine the
constant used to convert internal uncertainties to external ones. RESULTS. The
angular covariance at zero separation is 106.2 muas^2, yielding a minimum
uncertainty for EDR3 parallaxes of 10.3 muas for individual stars. That value
can be only slightly reduced for GCs after considering the behavior of the
angular covariance of the parallaxes for small separations. The Lindegren et
al. parallax bias correction works quite well, except for the brighter
magnitudes, suggesting improvements may be possible there. The value of k is
1.1-1.7 and depends on G. Stars with moderately large values of RUWE can still
provide useful parallaxes albeit with larger values of k. We give accurate and
precise Gaia EDR3 distances to the six GCs and for the specific case of 47 Tuc
we are able to beat the angular covariance limit and derive a high-precision
distance of 4.53+-0.06 kpc. Finally, a recipe for the derivation of distances
to stars and stellar clusters using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes is given. [ABRIDGED]

the propagation of ultrashort electromagnetic pulses through the CNT array. The
dynamics of the pulse is described by a nonlinear equation for the vector
potential of the electromagnetic field (it takes the form of a 3D

equations and averaged over the period of the HF control field. By means of
systematic simulations, we demonstrate that, depending on the amplitude and
frequency of the HF control, the ultrashort pulse approaching the barrier layer
either passes it or bounces back. The layer's transmissivity for the incident
pulse is significantly affected by the amplitude and frequency of the HF
control field, with the reflection coefficient nearly vanishing in intervals

of the electromagnetically-induced transparency. Having passed the barrier, the
ultrashort pulse continues to propagate, keeping its spatiotemporal integrity.
The results may be used for the design of soliton valves, with the

perform entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, which can
exploit the dependency between the two tasks to mitigate the error propagation
problem suffered by the pipeline model. Current efforts on joint entity and
relation extraction focus on enhancing the interaction between entity
recognition and relation extraction through parameter sharing, joint decoding,
or other ad-hoc tricks (e.g., modeled as a semi-Markov decision process, cast
as a multi-round reading comprehension task). However, there are still two
issues on the table. First, the interaction utilized by most methods is still
weak and uni-directional, which is unable to model the mutual dependency
between the two tasks. Second, relation triggers are ignored by most methods,
which can help explain why humans would extract a relation in the sentence.
They're essential for relation extraction but overlooked. To this end, we
present a Trigger-Sense Memory Flow Framework (TriMF) for joint entity and
relation extraction. We build a memory module to remember category
representations learned in entity recognition and relation extraction tasks.
And based on it, we design a multi-level memory flow attention mechanism to

These structures have attracted considerable attention due to their topological
stability and promising applicability in nanodevices, since they can be
displaced with spin-polarized currents. However, for the comprehensive
implementation of skyrmions in devices, it is imperative to also attain control
over their geometrical position. Here we show that, through thickness
modulations introduced in the host material, it is possible to constrain
three-dimensional skyrmions to desired regions. We investigate skyrmion
structures in rectangular FeGe platelets with micromagnetic finite element
element simulations. First, we establish a phase diagram of the minimum-energy
magnetic state as a function of the external magnetic field strength and the
film thickness. Using this understanding, we generate preferential sites for
skyrmions in the material by introducing dot-like ""pockets"" of reduced film
thickness. We show that these pockets can serve as pinning centers for the
skyrmions, thus making it possible to obtain a geometric control of the
skyrmion position. This control allows stabilizing skyrmions at positions and
in configurations that they would otherwise not attain. Our findings may have
implications for technological applications in which skyrmions are used as
units of information that are displaced along racetrack-type shift register
devices.

further explored the effect of the waveguide background on localization

the suspended section of the sheet) always lie in this gap, and the frequencies
of oscillations decrease by increasing radius of the membrane as $(R+R_i)^{-2}$
with nonezero effective increase of radius $R_i>0$. The modeling of the sheet
dynamics has shown that small periodic transversal displacements of the
substrate lead to resonant vibrations of the membranes at frequencies close to
eigenfrequencies of nodeless vibrations of membranes with a circular symmetry.
The energy distribution of resonant vibrations of the membrane has a circular
symmetry and several nodal circles, whose number $i$ coincides with the number
of the resonant frequency. The frequencies of the resonances decrease by
increasing the radius of the membrane as $(R+R_i)^{\alpha_i}$ with exponent
$\alpha_i<2$. The lower rate of resonance frequency decrease is caused by the
anharmonicity of membrane vibrations.

feature fusion either in the single encoder or the decoder stage, which hardly
guarantees sufficient cross-modal fusion ability. In this paper, we make the
first attempt in addressing RGB-D SOD through 3D convolutional neural networks.
The proposed model, named RD3D, aims at pre-fusion in the encoder stage and
in-depth fusion in the decoder stage to effectively promote the full
integration of RGB and depth streams. Specifically, RD3D first conducts
pre-fusion across RGB and depth modalities through an inflated 3D encoder, and
later provides in-depth feature fusion by designing a 3D decoder equipped with
rich back-projection paths (RBPP) for leveraging the extensive aggregation
ability of 3D convolutions. With such a progressive fusion strategy involving
both the encoder and decoder, effective and thorough interaction between the
two modalities can be exploited and boost the detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that RD3D
performs favorably against 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD approaches in terms of
four key evaluation metrics. Our code will be made publicly available:

Here, we demonstrate that globally coupled identical oscillators can express a
range of coexistence patterns more comprehensive than chimeras. A hierarchy of
such states evolves from the fully synchronized solution in a series of

collide with their own mirror-images in phase space -- rendering the motion
chaotic, destroying some of the clusters and thereby producing even more
intricate coexistence patterns. A sequence of such attractor collisions can
ultimately lead to full incoherence of only single asynchronous oscillators.
Chimera states, with one large synchronized cluster and else only single

irrespective of discussed aspects by comparing different revisions of the same

entertainment, and others. We then propose two tasks: (a) assessing which claim
of a revision pair is better, and (b) ranking all versions of a claim by

referential signalling games with realistic images has attracted a lot of
attention recently. The majority of work has focused on using fixed, pretrained
image feature extraction networks which potentially bias the information the
agents learn to communicate. In this work, we consider a signalling game
setting in which a `sender' agent must communicate the information about an
image to a `receiver' who must select the correct image from many distractors.
We investigate the effect of the feature extractor's weights and of the task
being solved on the visual semantics learned by the models. We first
demonstrate to what extent the use of pretrained feature extraction networks
inductively bias the visual semantics conveyed by emergent communication
channel and quantify the visual semantics that are induced.
  We then go on to explore ways in which inductive biases can be introduced to
encourage the emergence of semantically meaningful communication without the
need for any form of supervised pretraining of the visual feature extractor. We
impose various augmentations to the input images and additional tasks in the
game with the aim to induce visual representations which capture conceptual
properties of images. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that
communication systems which capture visual semantics can be learned in a
completely self-supervised manner by playing the right types of game. Our work
bridges a gap between emergent communication research and self-supervised

sheets bear a director field $\mathbf{m}$ imprinted in them (usually, uniformly

order (e.g. by illumination or heating). This paper illustrates an attempt to
compute the bending energy of a NPN sheet and to show which role it can play in
determining the activated shape. Our approach is approximate: the activated
surface consists of flat sectors connected by ridges, where the unit normal
jumps and the bending energy is concentrated. By increasing the number of
ridges, we should get closer to the real situation, where the activated surface
is smooth and the bending energy is distributed on it. The method is applied to
a disk with imprinted a spiraling hedgehog. It is shown that upon activation

loads to neighbouring BSs to avoid the outage. The stability of cascade load
balancing is important because unstable networks can cause high inefficiency.
The research challenge is to prove the stability conditions for any arbitrarily

function. Our previous work has proven the conditions for stability for
stationary networks near equilibrium for any load balancing dynamic and

system around the fixed equilibrium solutions. This approach is insufficient
for dynamic networks with changing equilibrium and estimating the Region of

the present work are twofold. First, we extend the approach to deal with
annular domains by introducing a suitable transformation of the coordinate
system. Second, we discuss the extension to general two-dimensional geometries:
towards this end, we introduce a spectral element approximation, which relies
on a partition $\{ \Omega_{q} \}_{q=1} ^{N_{\rm dd}}$ of the domain $\Omega$
such that $\Omega_1,\ldots,\Omega_{N_{\rm dd}}$ are isomorphic to the unit
square. We further show that our spectral element approximation can cope with
parameterized geometries. We present rigorous mathematical analysis to justify
our proposal; furthermore, we present numerical results for a heat-transfer
problem in an annular domain, a potential flow past a rotating symmetric
airfoil, and an inviscid transonic compressible flow past a non-symmetric
airfoil, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Chlorphyll-a measurements give us an idea of the algae concentrations in the
ocean, which lets us monitor ocean health. However, a common problem is that
the satellites used to gather the data are commonly obstructed by clouds and
other artifacts. This means that time series data from satellites can suffer
from spatial data loss.
  There are a number of algorithms that are able to reconstruct the missing
parts of these images to varying degrees of accuracy, with Data INterpolating
Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) being the current standard. However,
DINEOF is slow, suffers from accuracy loss in temporally homogenous waters,
reliant on temporal data, and only able to generate a single potential

  We propose a machine learning approach to reconstruction of Chlorophyll-a

competitive with but slightly less accurate than DINEOF. We show the benefits

applied to a wealth of problems in high-energy physics. For instance, in a
previous work we have reported that using ML techniques one can extract the
Multiparton Interactions (MPI) activity from minimum-bias pp data. Using the
available LHC data on transverse momentum spectra as a function of
multiplicity, we reported the average number of MPI ($\langle N_{\rm mpi}
\rangle$) for minimum-bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ and 13\,TeV. In
this work, we apply the same analysis to a new set of data. We report that
$\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$ amounts to $3.98 \pm 1.01$ for minimum-bias pp
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$\,TeV. These complementary results suggest a modest
center-of-mass energy dependence of $\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$. The study is
further extended aimed at extracting the multiplicity dependence of $\langle
N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$ for the three center-of-mass energies. We show that our
results qualitatively agree with existing ALICE measurements sensitive to MPI.
Namely, $\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$ increases approximately linearly with the
charged-particle multiplicity. But, it deviates from the linear dependence at
large charged-particle multiplicities. The deviation from the linear trend can
be explained in terms of a bias towards harder processes given the multiplicity
selection at mid-pseudorapidity. The results reported in this paper provide
additional evidence of the presence of MPI in pp collisions, and they can be
useful for a better understanding of the heavy-ion-like behaviour observed in
pp data.

a mean shear and an unstable buoyancy gradient between two streams of different

the former or the latter may dominate the turbulence and mixing between the two

identification of two distinct turbulent regimes: an early regime, dominated by
the mean shear, and a later regime dominated by the buoyancy. The main
theoretical result consists of the identification of a cross-over time-scale
that discerns between the shear- and the buoyancy-dominated turbulence. This
cross-over time depends on three large-scale constants of the flow, namely the
buoyancy difference, the velocity difference between the two streams, and the
gravitational acceleration. We validate our theory against direct numerical

decisive answers to the remaining open questions in cosmology. Early attempts
at modelling it analytically focused on using perturbation theory. However,
small-scale effects introduced by gravitational collapse cannot be described
perturbatively and this failure of perturbation theory is reflected even on the
largest scales. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS)
has emerged as a consistent method for describing LSS on large scales by
introducing counterterms that account for the effects of small-scale dynamics.
So far studies of the EFT have mostly focused on the two and three point
functions with little attention devoted to the four point function or
trispectrum. The trispectrum probes cubic interactions arising from non-linear
clustering, biasing, and primordial non-Gaussianities, and constitutes a key
element of the covariance matrix of the power spectrum. In this paper, we
present explicit calibrations of the EFT counterterms for the one-loop
trispectrum. Specifically, we find clear evidence for non-zero EFT corrections.
We define two one-parameter ans\""{a}tze for the counterterm of the one-loop
propagator and show that they provide a good correction to the residual at
scales below k~0.07 h/Mpc. We then take the amplitudes of the linear and
quadratic counterkernels calculated in our previous paper on the bispectrum and
use them in the remaining counterterms, establishing consistency of the
counterterms in the two, three and four point function. We also show that the
commonly used EdS approximation for the growth of the density fields leads to
errors that are of the same magnitude as loop corrections to the trispectrum on
large scales.

motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape,
(2) the impact of individuals' personal growth as they become part of OSS
communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals' demographics.
Our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation
increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations,

also found that contributing to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to

secure integrated circuits. Initially, I make a small introduction on hardware
attacks on smart cards and some of the reasons behind them. Subsequently, I
introduce the production phases of chips that are integrated to smart cards and
try to identify the costs affecting each one of them. I proceed to identify how
adding security features on such integrated circuits may affect the costs of
their development and production. I then make a more thorough investigation on
the costs of developing a hardware attack for such chips and try to estimate
the potential damages and losses of such an attack. I also go on to examine
potential ways of reducing the cost of production for secure chips, while
identifying the difficulties in adopting them.
  This essay ends with the conclusion that adding security features to chips
meant to be used for secure applications is well worth it, because the costs of
developing attacks are of comparable amounts to the costs of developing and
producing a chip and the potential damages and losses caused by such attacks
can be way higher than these costs. Therefore, although the production and
development of integrated circuits come at a certain cost and security
introduces further additional costs, security is inherently unavoidable in such
chips. Finally, I additionally identify that security is an evolving concept
and does not aim to make a chip totally impenetrable, as this may be
impossible, but to lower the potential risks, including that of being
compromised, to acceptable levels. Thus, a balance needs be found between the
level of security and the levels of cost and risk.

scales -- from atomistics to significantly larger continuum scales -- thus
overcoming a key limitation of classical atomic-scale simulation techniques
while solely relying on atomic-scale input (in the form of interatomic
potentials). An associated challenge lies in bridging across time scales to
overcome the time scale limitations of atomistics. To address the biggest
challenge, bridging across both length and time scales, only a few techniques
exist, and most of those are limited to conditions of constant temperature.
Here, we present a new strategy for the space-time coarsening of an atomistic
ensemble, which introduces thermomechanical coupling. We investigate the
quasistatics and dynamics of a crystalline solid described as a lattice of
lumped correlated Gaussian phase packets occupying atomic lattice sites. By
definition, phase packets account for the dynamics of crystalline lattices at
finite temperature through the statistical variances of atomic momenta and
positions. We show that momentum-space correlation allows for an exchange
between potential and kinetic contributions to the crystal's Hamiltonian.
Consequently, local adiabatic heating due to atomic site motion is captured.
Moreover, within the quasistatic approximation the governing equations reduce
to the minimization of thermodynamic potentials such as Helmholtz free energy
(depending on the fixed variables), and they yield the local equation of state.
We further discuss opportunities for describing atomic-level thermal transport
using the correlated Gaussian phase packet formulation and the importance of
interatomic correlations. Such a formulation offers a promising avenue for a
finite-temperature non-equilibrium quasicontinuum method that may be combined
with thermal transport models.

denoising methods for channel estimation that depend on either (i)~channel

address these limitations, we present a frequency-domain denoising method based
on a reinforcement learning framework that does not need a priori channel
knowledge and pre-labeled data. Our methodology includes a new successive
channel denoising process based on channel curvature computation, for which we
obtain a channel curvature magnitude threshold to identify unreliable channel
estimates. Based on this process, we formulate the denoising mechanism as a
Markov decision process, where we define the actions through a geometry-based
channel estimation update, and the reward function based on a policy that
reduces mean squared error (MSE). We then resort to Q-learning to update the
channel estimates. Numerical results verify that our denoising algorithm can
successfully mitigate noise in channel estimates. In particular, our algorithm
provides a significant improvement over the practical least squares (LS)
estimation method and provides performance that approaches that of the ideal
linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation with perfect knowledge of
channel statistics.

to the opening of a charge density wave gap at the Fermi level. The FBC then
depends linearly on the phase offset of the potential with a quantized slope
determined by the period. Furthermore, different possible values for the FBC at
a fixed phase offset label different degenerate ground states of the system
that cannot be connected adiabatically. Next, we turn to the fractional quantum
Hall effect (FQHE) at odd filling factors $\nu=1/(2l+1)$, where $l$ is an

intrinsic properties of bulk materials. We find this question is prominent in
thin films of a rarely studied cuprate DBCO. We synthesize DBCO films by oxide
molecular beam epitaxy and study them by in situ ARPES and SI-STM. Both ARPES
and SI-STM show that the surface DBCO layer is different from the bulk of the

limited in the number of qubits and the types of quantum states. We report
violations of Bell inequalities on IBM Quantum devices based on the scalable

of path graphs up to 57 and 21 qubits on the 65-qubit and 27-qubit IBM Quantum

point out that quantum circuits for star graph states of size N can be realized
with circuits of depth $O(\sqrt n)$ on subdivided honeycomb lattices which are
the topology of the 65-qubit IBM Quantum device. Our experiments show
encouraging results on the ability of existing quantum devices to prepare

obscuration. For exoplanet observations consisting of transit, or eclipse,
spectroscopy this causes gaps in the light curve, which reduces the information
content and can diminish the science return of the observation. Terminus, a
time-domain simulator, has been developed to model the occurrence of these gaps
to predict the potential impact on future observations. The simulator is
capable of radiometrically modelling exoplanet observations as well as
producing light curves and spectra. Here, Terminus is baselined on the Twinkle

Unlike typical solids and fluids, granular media can simultaneously display

This multi-phase behavior increases the difficulty of accurately modeling these

as DEM (Discrete Element Method), capture this behavior by modeling the media
at the grain scale, but there is often interest in the macro-scale
characterizations of such systems. We examine the efficacy of a macro-scale
continuum approach in modeling and understanding the physics of various
macroscopic phenomena in a variety of granular intrusion cases using two basic
frictional yielding constitutive models. We compare predicted granular force
response and material flow to experimental data in four quasi-2D intrusion
cases: (1) depth-dependent force response in horizontal submerged-intruder
motion; (2) separation dependent drag variation in parallel-plate
vertical-intrusion; (3) initial-density-dependent drag fluctuations in free
surface plowing, and (4) flow zone development during vertical plate intrusions
in under-compacted granular media. Our continuum modeling approach captures the
flow process and drag forces while providing key meso- and macro-scopic
insights. The modeling results are then compared to experimental data. Our
study highlights how continuum modeling approaches provide an alternative for
efficient modeling as well as a conceptual understanding of various granular

higher dimension generators. These include a generator in the irreducible hook
representation of the Lorentz group, which gauges the shift symmetry (or
ambiguity) of the spin connection. This gauging is possible even in the purely
bosonic theory, where it leads to a Lorentz curvature whose only non-vanishing
pieces are the physical ones: the generalized Einstein tensor and the
generalized scalar curvature. A relation to the super-Maxwell$_\infty$ algebra
is proposed. The superspace Bianchi identities are solved up through dimension
two, and the component supersymmetry transformations and equations of motion
are explicitly (re)derived.

that the emission is non-thermal. The intensity of the diffuse emission
increases toward PSR J2229+6114 in the same way as radio emission, and it is in
contrast with gamma-ray emission concentrated on a molecular cloud. The X-ray
photon index does not change with the distance from the pulsar and it indicates
that radiative cooling is ineffective and particle diffusion is not extremely
slow. The X-ray and radio emissions seem to be of leptonic origin and the
parent electrons may originate from the pulsar or its wind nebula. The
gamma-ray emission appears to be of hadronic origin because of its spacial

calculated assuming the interstellar medium (ISM) size distribution and a

Here, we use simple dust evolution models that incorporate grain growth and
transport to calculate the time evolution of mean opacity of dust grains as a
function of distance from the star. Dust dynamics and size distribution are
sensitive to the assumed value of the turbulence strength $\alpha_{\rm t}$ and
the velocity at which grains fragment $v_{\rm frag}$. For moderate-to-low
turbulence strengths of $\alpha_{\rm t} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ and substantial
differences in $v_{\rm frag}$ for icy and ice-free grains, we find a spatially
non-uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size distribution that deviate
significantly from the ISM values, in agreement with previous studies. The
effect of a non-uniform dust-to-gas ratio on the Rosseland mean opacity
dominates over that of the size distribution. This spatially varying -- that is
non-monotonic -- dust-to-gas ratio creates a region in the protoplanetary disk
that is optimal for producing hydrogen-rich planets, potentially explaining the
apparent peak in gas giant planet occurrence rate at intermediate distances.
The enhanced dust-to-gas ratio within the ice line also suppresses gas
accretion rates onto sub-Neptune cores, thus stifling their tendency to undergo
runaway gas accretion within disk lifetimes. Finally, our work corroborates the
idea that low mass cores with large primordial gaseous envelopes

$(g-2)_\mu$, the minimal requirements of perturbative unitarity guarantee new
charged states below $\mathcal{O}(100 {\rm TeV})$, but this is strongly
disfavoured by stringent constraints on charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV)
decays. Reasonable BSM theories that satisfy CLFV bounds by obeying Minimal
Flavour Violation (MFV) and avoid generating two new hierarchy problems require
the existence of at least one new charged state below $\sim 10$ TeV. This
strongly motivates the construction of high-energy muon colliders, which are
guaranteed to discover new physics: either by producing these new charged
states directly, or by setting a strong lower bound on their mass, which would
empirically prove that the universe is fine-tuned and violates the assumptions
of MFV while somehow not generating large CLFVs. The former case is obviously
the desired outcome, but the latter scenario would perhaps teach us even more
about the universe by profoundly revising our understanding of naturalness,
cosmological vacuum selection, and the SM flavour puzzle.

is the M\""{o}bius coefficient of the integer $k$: the RH is indeed true if the
Mertens function goes asymptotically as $M(x) \sim x^{1/2 + \epsilon}$, where
$\epsilon$ is an arbitrary strictly positive quantity. This behavior can be
established on the basis of a new probabilistic approach based on the global
properties of Mertens function. To this aim we derive a series of probabilistic
results concerning the prime number distribution along the series of
square-free numbers which shows that the Mertens function is subject to a
normal distribution. We also show that the validity of the RH also implies the
validity of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the Dirichlet $L$-functions.
Next we study the local properties of the Mertens function, i.e. its variation
induced by each M\""{o}bius coefficient restricted to the square-free numbers.
We perform a massive statistical analysis on these coefficients, applying to
them a series of randomness tests of increasing precision and complexity, for a
total number of eighteen different tests. The successful outputs of all these

probabilistic argument and the large battery of statistical tests, we can
conclude that while a violation of the RH is strictly speaking not impossible,

distribution impacts structure formation in the non-linear regime. In
particular, we investigate the impact on the halo-mass and subhalo-mass
functions, as well as on astrophysical observables such as satellite and
cluster-number counts. We find that many of the standard expectations no longer
hold in situations in which this velocity distribution takes a highly
non-trivial, even multi-modal shape. For example, we find that the nominal
free-streaming scale alone becomes insufficient to characterize the effect of
free-streaming on structure formation. In addition, we propose a simple
one-line conjecture which can be used to ""reconstruct"" the primordial
dark-matter velocity distribution directly from the shape of the halo-mass
function. Although our conjecture is completely heuristic, we show that it
successfully reproduces the salient features of the underlying dark-matter
velocity distribution even for non-trivial distributions which are highly
non-thermal and/or multi-modal, such as might occur for non-minimal dark
sectors. Moreover, since our approach relies only on the halo-mass function,
our conjecture provides a method of probing dark-matter properties even for
scenarios in which the dark and visible sectors interact only gravitationally.

(SFRHs) from the IllustrisTNG model to a series of varied assumptions for the
BNS DTD to make predictions for the BNS merger host galaxy mass function. These
predictions offer two outcomes: (i) in the near term: influence BNS merger
event follow-up strategy by scrutinizing where most BNS merger events are
expected to occur and (ii) in the long term: constrain the DTD for BNS merger
events once the host galaxy mass function is observationally well determined.
From our fiducial model analysis, we predict that 50% of BNS mergers will occur
in host galaxies with stellar mass between $10^{10} - 10^{11}$ $M_\odot$, 68%
between $4 \times 10^{9} - 3\times 10^{11}$ $M_\odot$, and 95% between $4

employed does not have a strong effect on the peak of the host mass function.
However, varying the DTD provides enough spread that the true DTD can be
determined from enough electromagnetic observations of BNS mergers. Knowing the
true DTD can help us determine the prevalence of BNS systems formed through
highly eccentric and short separation fast-merging channels and can constrain

mixing in pressure-balanced multiphase clouds, and demonstrate example
applications using Enzo-E (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Under this
formalism, the high-dimensional description of the system's state at a given
time is simplified to the joint distribution of mass over pressure ($P$) and
entropy ($K=P/\rho^\gamma$). As a result, this approach provides a way for
(empirically and analytically) quantifying the impact of different initial
conditions and sets of physics on the system evolution. We find that mixing
predominantly alters the distribution along the $K$ direction and illustrate
how the formalism can be used to model mixing and cooling for fluid elements
originating in the cloud. We further confirm and generalize a previously
suggested criterion for cloud growth in the presence of radiative cooling, and
demonstrate that the shape of the cooling curve, particularly at the low
temperature end, can play an important role in controlling condensation.
Moreover, we discuss the capacity of our approach to generalize such a
criterion to apply to additional sets of physics, and to build intuition for
the impact of subtle higher order effects not directly addressed by the
criterion.

that is likely falling into the Fornax cluster for the first time. Our HI image
is sensitive to 1.4 x 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ over 44.1 km s$^{-1}$, where we
detect HI in 10 galaxies and a total of 1.12 x 10$^{9}$ Msol of HI in the
intra-group medium (IGM). We search for signs of pre-processing in the 12 group
galaxies with confirmed optical redshifts that reside within our HI image.
There are 9 galaxies that show evidence of pre-processing and we classify the
pre-processing status of each galaxy, according to their HI morphology and gas
(atomic and molecular) scaling relations. Galaxies yet to experience
pre-processing have extended HI disks, a high HI content with a H$_2$-to-HI
ratio an order of magnitude lower than the median for their stellar mass.
Galaxies currently being pre-processed display HI tails, truncated HI disks
with typical gas ratios. Galaxies in the advanced stages of pre-processing are
HI deficient. If there is any HI, they have lost their outer HI disk and
efficiently converted their HI to H$_2$, resulting in H$_2$-to-HI ratios an
order of magnitude higher than the median for their stellar mass. The central,
massive galaxy in our group underwent a 10:1 merger 2 Gyr ago, and ejected 6.6
- 11.2 x 10$^{8}$ Msol of HI that we detect as clouds and streams in the IGM,
some forming coherent structures up to 220 kpc in length. We also detect giant
(100 kpc) ionised hydrogen (H$\alpha$) filaments in the IGM, likely from cool
gas being removed (and ionised) from an infalling satellite. The H$\alpha$
filaments are situated within the hot halo of NGC 1316 and some regions contain
HI. We speculate that the H$\alpha$ and multiphase gas is supported by magnetic
pressure (possibly assisted by the AGN), such that the hot gas can condense and
form HI that survives in the hot halo for cosmological timescales.

the local Universe, the Leo ring, is still debated 38 years after its
discovery. Its existence is alternatively attributed to leftover primordial gas
with some low level of metal pollution versus enriched gas stripped during a
galaxy-galaxy encounter. Taking advantage of MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer) operating at the VLT, we performed optical integral field
spectroscopy of 3 HI clumps in the Leo ring where ultraviolet continuum
emission has been found. We detected, for the first time, ionized hydrogen in
the ring and identify 4 nebular regions powered by massive stars. These nebulae
show several metal lines ([OIII],[NII],[SII]) which allowed reliable measures
of metallicities, found to be close to or above the solar value. Given the
faintness of the diffuse stellar counterparts, less than 3 percent of the
observed heavy elements could have been produced locally in the main body of
the ring and not much more than 15 percent in the HI clump towards M96. This
inference, and the chemical homogeneity among the regions, convincingly
demonstrates that the gas in the ring is not primordial, but has been
pre-enriched in a galaxy disk, then later removed and shaped by tidal forces
and it is forming a sparse population of stars.

the regions outside of 1 AU. For this reason, it is now believed that
magnetized winds could be the dominant mechanism driving accretion in these
systems. However, there is today no self-consistent way to describe discs
subject to a magnetized wind, in a way similar to the $\alpha$ disc model. In
this article, I explore in a systematic way the parameter space of wind-driven
protoplanetary discs and present scaling laws which can be used in reduced
models \`a la alpha-disc. Methods: I compute a series of self-similar wind
solutions, assuming the disc is dominated by ambipolar and Ohmic diffusions.
These solution are obtained by looking for stationary solutions in the
finite-volume code PLUTO using a relaxation method and continuation. Results:
Self-similar solutions are obtained for values of plasma beta ranging from 10^2
to 10^8, for several Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion strengths. Mass accretions
rates of the order of 10^{-8} Msun/yr are obtained for poloidal field strength
beta=O(10^4) or equivalently 1 mG at 10 AU. The resulting magnetic lever arms
are typically lower than 2, possibly reaching 1.5 in weakest field cases.
Finally, I provide a complete set of scaling laws and semi-analytical wind
solutions, which can be used to fit and interpret observations. Conclusions:
Magnetized winds are unavoidable in protoplanetary discs as soon as they are
embedded in an ambient poloidal magnetic field. Very detailed disc microphysics
are not always needed to describe them, and simplified models such as
self-similar solutions manage to capture most of the physics seen in full 3D
simulations. The remaining difficulty to get a complete theory of wind-driven
accretion lies in the transport of the large scale field, which remains poorly
constrained and not well understood.

reconstruct the surface from Delaunay triangulation of point cloud. DeepDT
learns to predict inside/outside labels of Delaunay tetrahedrons directly from
a point cloud and corresponding Delaunay triangulation. The local geometry
features are first extracted from the input point cloud and aggregated into a
graph deriving from the Delaunay triangulation. Then a graph filtering is
applied on the aggregated features in order to add structural regularization to
the label prediction of tetrahedrons. Due to the complicated spatial relations
between tetrahedrons and the triangles, it is impossible to directly generate
ground truth labels of tetrahedrons from ground truth surface. Therefore, we
propose a multi-label supervision strategy which votes for the label of a
tetrahedron with labels of sampling locations inside it. The proposed DeepDT
can maintain abundant geometry details without generating overly complex
surfaces, especially for inner surfaces of open scenes. Meanwhile, the
generalization ability and time consumption of the proposed method is
acceptable and competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DeepDT.

observation signal is investigated through the lens of regret optimization.
Classical filter designs, such as $\mathcal H_2$ (Kalman) and $\mathcal
H_\infty$, minimize the average and worst-case estimation errors, respectively.
As a result $\mathcal H_2$ filters are sensitive to inaccuracies in the
underlying statistical model, and $\mathcal H_\infty$ filters are overly
conservative since they safeguard against the worst-case scenario. We propose
instead to minimize the \emph{regret} in order to design filters that perform
well in different noise regimes by comparing their performance with that of a
clairvoyant filter. More explicitly, we minimize the largest deviation of the
squared estimation error of a causal filter from that of a non-causal filter
that has access to future observations. In this sense, the regret-optimal
filter will have the best competitive performance with respect to the
non-causal benchmark filter no matter what the true signal and the observation
process are. For the important case of signals that can be described with a
time-invariant state-space, we provide an explicit construction for the regret
optimal filter in the estimation (causal) and the prediction (strictly-causal)
regimes. These solutions are obtained by reducing the regret filtering problem
to a Nehari problem, i.e., approximating a non-causal operator by a causal one
in spectral norm. The regret-optimal filters bear some resemblance to Kalman
and $H_\infty$ filters: they are expressed as state-space models, inherit the
finite dimension of the original state-space, and their solutions require
solving algebraic Riccati equations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
regret minimization inherently interpolates between the performances of the
$H_2$ and $H_\infty$ filters and is thus a viable approach for filter design.

A way to reduce the channel fluctuations is to design a precoding scheme that
equalizes the effective channel gain seen by the users. Conjugate beamforming
(CB) poorly contributes to harden the effective channel at the users. In this
work, we propose a variant of CB dubbed enhanced normalized CB (ECB), in that
the precoding vector consists of the conjugate of the channel estimate
normalized by its squared norm. For this scheme, we derive an exact closed-form

channel estimation errors, pilot reuse and user's lack of channel state

devise an optimal max-min fairness power allocation based only on large-scale
fading quantities. ECB greatly boosts the channel hardening enabling the users
to reliably decode data relying only on statistical CSI. As the provided
effective channel is nearly deterministic, acquiring CSI at the users does not
yield a significant gain.

responsible for the current 26.7{\deg}-tilt of Saturn's spin axis. We aim to
quantify the level of generality of this result and to measure the most likely
sets of parameters. We also aim to determine the obliquity that Saturn will
reach in the future.
  Methods: We explore a broad range of parameters and propagate numerically the
orientation of Saturn's spin axis both backward and forward in time.
  Results: In the adiabatic regime, the likelihood of reproducing Saturn's
current spin-axis orientation is maximised for primordial obliquities between
about 2{\deg} and 7{\deg}. For a slightly faster migration than expected from
radio-science experiments, non-adiabatic effects even allow for exactly null
primordial obliquities. Starting from such small tilts, Saturn's spin axis can
evolve up to its current state provided that: i) the semi-major axis of Titan
changed by more than 5% of its current value, and ii) its migration rate does
not exceed 10 times the nominal measured rate. In comparison, observational
data suggest that the increase of Titan's semi-major axis exceeded 50% over 4
Gyrs, and error bars imply that the current migration rate is unlikely to be
larger than 1.5 times its nominal value.
  Conclusions: If Titan did migrate substantially before today, tilting Saturn
from a small obliquity is not only possible, but it is the most likely
scenario. Saturn's obliquity is expected to be still increasing today and could
exceed 65{\deg} in the future. Maximising the likelihood would also put strict
constraints on Saturn's polar moment of inertia. However, the possibility
remains that Saturn's primordial obliquity was already large, for instance as a
result of a massive collision. The unambiguous distinction between these two
scenarios would be given by a precise measure of Saturn's polar moment of
inertia.

mass and star formation rate ($M_{\star}$ and SFR). For the same cells, we also
have estimates of the neutral ($M_{\rm HI}$) and molecular ($M_{\rm H_2}$) gas

one between the molecular-to-neutral mass ratio and the total gas mass ($M_{\rm

spatially resolved MS, and {\it ii)} the one between
$\log(M_{\rm{H_2}}/M_{\star})$ and $\log(M_{\rm{HI}}/M_{\star})$. For both
methods, we find that $M_{\rm H_2}$/$M_{\rm HI}$ within the optical radius
slightly decreases with redshift, contrary to common expectations of galaxies
becoming progressively more dominated by molecular hydrogen at high redshifts.

requirement for valid modeling and inference in such scenarios, yet is
challenging to address when there are complex latent structures. In this
article, we propose a class of identifiable multilayer (potentially deep)

We establish the identifiability of Bayesian pyramids by developing novel
transparent conditions on the pyramid-shaped deep latent directed graph. The
proposed identifiability conditions can ensure Bayesian posterior consistency
under suitable priors. As an illustration, we consider the two-latent-layer
model and propose a Bayesian shrinkage estimation approach. Simulation results
for this model corroborate the identifiability and estimability of model
parameters. Applications of the methodology to DNA nucleotide sequence data
uncover useful discrete latent features that are highly predictive of sequence
types. The proposed framework provides a recipe for interpretable unsupervised
learning of discrete data, and can be a useful alternative to popular machine
learning methods.

cryptographic password hashes is able to mount an offline-brute force attack
against each user's password. Offline brute-force attacks against passwords are
increasingly commonplace and the danger is amplified by the well documented
human tendency to select low-entropy password and/or reuse these passwords
across multiple accounts. Moderately hard password hashing functions are often
deployed to help protect passwords against offline attacks by increasing the
attacker's guessing cost. However, there is a limit to how ""hard"" one can make
the password hash function as authentication servers are resource constrained
and must avoid introducing substantial authentication delay. Observing that
there is a wide gap in the strength of passwords selected by different users we
introduce DAHash (Distribution Aware Password Hashing) a novel mechanism which
reduces the number of passwords that an attacker will crack. Our key insight
ishat a resource-constrained authentication server can dynamically tune the
hardness parameters of a password hash function based on the (estimated)
strength of the user's password. We introduce a Stackelberg game to model the
interaction between a defender (authentication server) and an offline attacker.
Our model allows the defender to optimize the parameters of DAHash e.g.,
specify how much effort is spent to hash weak/moderate/high strength passwords.
We use several large scale password frequency datasets to empirically evaluate
the effectiveness of our differentiated cost password hashing mechanism. We
find that the defender who uses our mechanism can reduce the fraction of
passwords that would be cracked by a rational offline attacker by around 15%.

calculations of the dimensionless line strengths and associated

million spectral lines compiled from the NIST, CHIANTI, CMFGEN, and TOPbase

(varying over 11 orders of magnitude). Historically, the force multiplier
function has been described by a power-law function of optical depth. We
revisit this assumption by fitting alternative functions that include a
saturation to a constant value (Gayley's $\bar{Q}$ parameter) in the
optically-thin limit. This alternate form is a better fit than the power-law
form, and we use it to calculate example mass-loss rates for massive
main-sequence stars. Because the power-law force multiplier does not continue
to arbitrarily small optical depths, we find a sharp decrease, or quenching, of
line-driven winds for stars with effective temperatures less than about 15,000

our study suggests that evidence of stellar group expansion is confined only to
OBP-near and Brice\~no-1 whereas the rest of the groups in the complex show
more complicated motions. Interestingly, the stars in the two groups lie at the
center of a dust shell, as revealed via an extant 3D dust map. The exact
mechanism that produces such coherent motions remains unclear, while the
observed radial expansion and dust shell suggest that massive stellar feedback
could have influenced the star formation history of these groups.

spectroscopy with 248nm and 193nm light. For CH$_3$Cl and CH$_3$Br monolayers
adsorbed on C$_6$H$_6$, two photodissociation pathways can be identified:
neutral photodissociation similar to the gas-phase, and a dissociative electron
attachment (DEA) pathway due to photoelectrons from the metal. The same methyl
halides adsorbed on a C$_6$F$_6$ thin film display only neutral
photodissociation, with the DEA pathway entirely absent due to intermolecular
quenching via a LUMO-derived electronic band in the C$_6$F$_6$ thin film. For
CH$_3$I adsorbed on a C$_6$F$_6$ thin film, illumination with 248nm light
results in CH$_3$ photofragments departing due to neutral photodissociation via
the A-band absorption. When CH$_3$I monolayers on C$_6$H$_6$ thin films are
illuminated at the same wavelength, additional new photodissociation pathways
are observed that are due to absorption in the molecular film with energy
transfer leading to dissociation of the CH$_3$I molecules adsorbed on top. The
proposed mechanism for this photodissociation is via a charge-transfer complex
for the C$_6$H$_6$ layer and adsorbed CH$_3$I.

AMS employs Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) to near-simultaneously run and evaluate
multiple models against live traffic, allocating the most traffic to the
best-performing models while decreasing traffic to those with poorer online
performance, thereby minimizing the impact of inferior models on overall

we extend the concept to global optimization of stretching, as this forms a

it can be defined via a finite sequence of discrete maps, or a finite-time flow

two-dimensions, we formulate the global optimization problem as one over a

to share their visual perception with the human operators. In a harsh remote
collaboration setting, data compression techniques such as autoencoder can be
utilized to obtain and transmit the data in terms of latent variables in a
compact form. In addition, to ensure real-time runtime performance even under
unstable environments, an anytime estimation approach is desired that can
reconstruct the full contents from incomplete information. In this context, we
propose a method for imputation of latent variables whose elements are
partially lost. To achieve the anytime property with only a few dimensions of
variables, exploiting prior information of the category-level is essential. A
prior distribution used in variational autoencoders is simply assumed to be
isotropic Gaussian regardless of the labels of each training datapoint. This
type of flattened prior makes it difficult to perform imputation from the
category-level distributions. We overcome this limitation by exploiting a
category-specific multi-modal prior distribution in the latent space. The
missing elements of the partially transferred data can be sampled, by finding a
specific modal according to the remaining elements. Since the method is
designed to use partial elements for anytime estimation, it can also be applied
for data over-compression. Based on the experiments on the ModelNet and
Pascal3D datasets, the proposed approach shows consistently superior
performance over autoencoder and variational autoencoder up to 70% data loss.

a 2D Bounding Box (BBox) and object parameters, a 3D distance to the object can
be calculated directly using 3D reprojection; however, such methods are prone
to significant errors because an error from the 2D detection can be amplified
in 3D. In addition, it is also challenging to apply such methods to a real-time
system due to the computational burden. In the case of the traditional
multi-object detection methods, %they mostly pay attention to existing works
have been developed for specific tasks such as object segmentation or 2D BBox

multi-object detector structure. We let the predictors catch the distance prior
using anchor distance and train the network based on the distance. The
predictors can be characterized to the objects located in a specific distance
range. By propagating the distance prior using a distance anchor to the
predictors, it is feasible to perform the precise distance estimation and
real-time execution simultaneously. The proposed method achieves about 30 FPS
speed, and shows the lowest RMSE compared to the existing methods.

Aircraft System (UAS) carry out a wide variety of missions (e.g. moving humans

of the future. One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely
managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density
of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed
online. We propose Learning-'N-Flying (LNF) a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance
(CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on-the-fly and allows autonomous UAS
managed by different operators to safely carry out complex missions,
represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially
formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for two UAS as a
mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online.
Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining: a) learning-based
decision-making, and b) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF
extends L2F to cases where there are more than two UAS on a collision path.
Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online
(computation time in the order of milliseconds), and under certain assumptions
has failure rates of less than 1% in the worst-case, improving to near 0% in
more relaxed operations. We show the applicability of our scheme to a wide
variety of settings through multiple case studies.

""brain injury criterion"". A brain injury criterion takes some descriptor of the
head's motion as input and yields a prediction for that motion's potential for
causing mTBI as the output. The inputs are descriptors of the head's motion
that are usually synthesized from accelerometer and gyroscope data. In the
context of brain injury criterion the head is modeled as a rigid body. We
present an algorithm for determining the complete motion of the head using data
from only four head mounted tri-axial accelerometers. In contrast to inertial
measurement unit based algorithms for determining rigid body motion the
presented algorithm does not depend on data from gyroscopes; which consume much
more power than accelerometers. Several algorithms that also make use of data
from only accelerometers already exist. However, those algorithms, except for
the recently presented AO-algorithm [Rahaman MM, Fang W, Fawzi AL, Wan Y,

field in terms of the body frame, which in general is unknown. Compared to the

overcome the effect of antiviral drugs. As a result, the efficacy of most
antiviral drugs is short-lived. To include this effect, we modify the Neumann

varies in time, the differential equations introduced in the previous model
systems are rewritten to study the correlation between the viral load and
antiviral drug. The effect of antiviral drug that either prevents infection or
stops the production of a virus is explored. First, the efficacy of the drug is
considered to decreases monotonously as time progresses. In this case, our
result depicts that when the efficacy of the drug is low, the viral load
decreases and increases back in time revealing the effect of the antiviral
drugs is short-lived. On the other hand, for the antiviral drug with high
efficacy, the viral load, as well as the number of infected cells, monotonously
decreases while the number of uninfected cells increases. The dependence of the
critical drug efficacy on time is also explored. Moreover, the correlation
between viral load, the antiviral drug, and CTL response is also explored. In
this case, not only the dependence for the basic reproduction ratio on the
model parameters is explored but also we analyze the critical drug efficacy as

the important ones, which is similar to the attention mechanism. In this paper,
we propose an attention mechanism that acts on spectrum (SAM). The network can
assign appropriate weights to each frequency component to achieve adaptive
filtering. We use L1 regularization to further enhance the frequency screening
capability of SAM. We also propose a segmented-SAM (SSAM) to avoid the loss of
time domain information caused by using the spectrum of the whole sequence. In
which, a tumbling window is introduced to segment the original data. Then SAM
is applied to each segment to generate new features. We propose a heuristic
strategy to search for the appropriate number of segments. Experimental results
show that SSAM can produce better feature representations, make the network
converge faster, and improve the robustness and classification accuracy.

learning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where
tasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity
(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to
avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence
of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have
been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and
systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To
better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the
settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art
methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at
different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental
methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the
performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as ""review"" trick and nearest
class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we
observe iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb
outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR
performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb
performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also
strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,
this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method
across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are
beneficial, and when augmented with the ""review"" trick and NCM classifier, MIR
produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to
its ultimate goal of matching offline training.

the advent of mid-infrared femtosecond laser pulses, such as high-order

bandgap can be finely manipulated by femtosecond laser pulses as a function of
field polarization direction with respect to the lattice, in addition to the
field's intensity. It is the modification of bandgap that enables the ultrafast
PI processes to take place in dielectrics. We further demonstrate the validity
of the Keldysh theory in describing PI in dielectrics in the few TW/cm2 regime.

about a state, and there are multiple agents interacting in a game who are
privately informed about their types. Each agent's utility depends on all
agents' types and actions, as well as (linearly) on the state. To optimally
screen the agents, the designer first asks agents to report their types and
then sends a private action recommendation to each agent whose distribution
depends on all reported types and the state. We show that there always exists
an optimal mechanism which is laminar partitional. Such a mechanism partitions
the state space for each type profile and recommends the same action profile
for states that belong to the same partition element. Furthermore, the convex
hulls of any two partition elements are such that either one contains the other
or they have an empty intersection. In the single-agent case, each state is
either perfectly revealed or lies in an interval in which the number of
different signal realizations is at most the number of different types of the
agent plus two. A similar result is established for the multi-agent case.

achievable payoff could be as low as one over the number of types fraction of
the optimal payoff. Along the way, we shed light on the solutions of
optimization problems over distributions subject to a mean-preserving

researchers have proposed various hardware platforms, such as battery-swapping

However, these methods assume unlimited energy. In this paper, we explore

heuristically. In our derivation, the thermodynamic inconsistency is clarified

individual senses occurring; and secondly, that for a given occurrence of a
word, one of its senses tends to be much more plausible in the context than the
others. We evaluate PolyLM on WSI, showing that it performs considerably better

Learned index structures -- in which the core components of classical indexes
are replaced with machine learning models -- have recently been suggested to
significantly improve performance for read-only range queries. However, a
recent benchmark study shows that learned indexes only achieve limited
performance improvements for real-world data on modern hardware. More
specifically, a learned model cannot learn the micro-level details and
fluctuations of data distributions thus resulting in poor accuracy; or it can
fit to the data distribution at the cost of training a big model whose
parameters cannot fit into cache. As a consequence, querying a learned index on
real-world data takes a substantial number of memory lookups, thereby degrading
performance. In this paper, we adopt a different approach for modeling a data
distribution that complements the model fitting approach of learned indexes. We
propose Shift-Table, an algorithmic layer that captures the micro-level data
distribution and resolves the local biases of a learned model at the cost of at
most one memory lookup. Our suggested model combines the low latency of lookup
tables with learned indexes and enables low-latency processing of range
queries. Using Shift-Table, we achieve a speedup of 1.5X to 2X on real-world
datasets compared to trained and tuned learned indexes.

the physical origin of measurement statistics in the prepare and measure

quantum keys and certifying randomness, to mention a few applications, but,
surprisingly, no general methods to do so are known. We progress on this

to find a large set of incompatible measurements that cannot be used to

applying BN structure learning algorithms can reveal new insights that would
otherwise remain unknown. However, these algorithms are less effective when the
input data are limited in terms of sample size, which is often the case when
working with real data. This paper focuses on purely machine learned and purely
knowledge-based BNs and investigates their differences in terms of graphical
structure and how well the implied statistical models explain the data. The
tests are based on four previous case studies whose BN structure was determined
by domain knowledge. Using various metrics, we compare the knowledge-based
graphs to the machine learned graphs generated from various algorithms
implemented in TETRAD spanning all three classes of learning. The results show
that, while the algorithms produce graphs with much higher model selection
score, the knowledge-based graphs are more accurate predictors of variables of
interest. Maximising score fitting is ineffective in the presence of limited
sample size because the fitting becomes increasingly distorted with limited

scores and yet deviate considerably from the true graph. This highlights the
value of causal knowledge in these cases, as well as the need for more
appropriate fitting scores suitable for limited data. Lastly, the experiments
also provide new evidence that support the notion that results from simulated

processing units (GPUs) to meet stringent timing constraints. However, despite
the wide adoption of GPUs, efficiently scheduling multiple GPU applications
while providing rigorous real-time guarantees remains a challenge. In this
paper, we propose RTGPU, which can schedule the execution of multiple GPU
applications in real-time to meet hard deadlines. Each GPU application can have
multiple CPU execution and memory copy segments, as well as GPU kernels. We
start with a model to explicitly account for the CPU and memory copy segments
of these applications. We then consider the GPU architecture in the development
of a precise timing model for the GPU kernels and leverage a technique known as
persistent threads to implement fine-grained kernel scheduling with improved
performance through interleaved execution. Next, we propose a general method
for scheduling parallel GPU applications in real time. Finally, to schedule
multiple parallel GPU applications, we propose a practical real-time scheduling
algorithm based on federated scheduling and grid search (for GPU kernel
segments) with uniprocessor fixed priority scheduling (for multiple CPU and
memory copy segments). Our approach provides superior schedulability compared
with previous work, and gives real-time guarantees to meet hard deadlines for
multiple GPU applications according to comprehensive validation and evaluation
on a real NVIDIA GTX1080Ti GPU system.

convective dynamics in the solar photosphere, though few direct observations of
individual source events have been made and their detailed characteristics are
still unknown. Wave source identification requires measurements that can
reliably discriminate the local wave signal from the background convective
motions and resonant modal power. This is quite challenging as these 'noise'
contributions have amplitudes several orders of magnitude greater than the
sources and the propagating wave fields they induce. In this paper, we employ a
high-temporal-frequency filter to identify sites of acoustic emission in a
radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The properties of the filter were
determined from a convolutional neural network trained to identify the
two-dimensional acoustic Green's function response of the atmosphere, but once
defined, it can be directly applied to an image time series to extract the
signal of local wave excitation, bypassing the need for the original neural
network. Using the filter developed, we have uncovered previously unknown
properties of the acoustic emission process. In the simulation, acoustic events
are found to be clustered at mesogranular scales, with peak emission quite
deep, about 500 km below the photosphere, and sites of very strong emission can
result from the interaction of two supersonic downflows that merge at that
depth. We suggest that the method developed, when applied to high-resolution
high-cadence observations, such as those forthcoming with Daniel K. Inouye
Solar Telescope (DKIST), will have important applications in chromospheric

covariate-specific NBS and find determinants of variation in NBS. Our approach
is able to accommodate informative cost censoring through inverse probability
weighting techniques, and addresses confounding through a semiparametric

advantages over the customary standard velocity moments of fi(v), forwhich
there is only one mean flow velocity. For example, the standard thermal energy
momentof a pair of equal and opposite cold particle beams is non-zero even
though each beam has zero thermal energy. We therefore call this thermal energy
pseudo-thermal. By contrast, a multi-beam moment of two or more beams has no
pseudo-thermal energy. We develop three different ways of decomposing into a
sum and finding multi-beam moments for both a multi-beam fi(v) measured by MMS
in the dayside magnetosphere during reconnection and a multi-beam fi(v) found
in a PIC simulation of magnetotail reconnection. The three methods are: A
visual method in which the velocity centroid of each beam is estimated and its
density determined self-consistently; A k-means method in which particles in a
particle-representation of fi(v) are sorted into a minimum energy configuration
of N (= k) clusters; A nonlinear least squares method based on a fit to a sum

neutrino decoupling in the early Universe, thus modifying $N_{\rm eff}$. We
parameterize those operators up to dimension-7 in the effective field theory

the collision term integrals. From precision measurements of $N_{\rm eff}$, the
most stringent constraint is obtained for the dimension-6 vector-type
neutrino-electron operator, whose scale is constrained to be above about 195
(331) GeV from Planck (CMB-S4). We find our results complementary to other

In many applications, the fact that a symmetric lens might also be represented
as a cospan of asymmetric lenses is important, especially for implementation
purposes. However, the composition of symmetric lenses does not preserve the
property that the lenses can be represented by cospans -- two such symmetric
lenses may (and frequently do) compose to form a symmetric lens which cannot be
represented as a cospan of asymmetric lenses. Thus preserving the factorisation
to show how cospans of asymmetric lenses might be used in implementations
becomes important. In 2018, the first work on multilenses was begun.
Multilenses can be represented as multi-spans of asymmetric lenses (often
called 'wide spans', these are spans with an arbitrary finite number of legs).
In this paper we analyse a small but realistic example of a supply chain in
which the cospan representations would be 'composed away' by ordinary symmetric
lens composition, and introduce a new kind of composition which we call
'fusion' in which two ordinary symmetric lenses (spans with two legs) fuse to
form a multilens with three legs preserving the cospan representations, and
more generally, two symmetric multilenses, spans with say m and n legs, fuse to
form a symmetric multilens with m+n-1 legs, again preserving cospan
representations.

design stages is that altering the design is significantly less costly and more
effective than when hardware and software have already been developed.
Engineering cyber-physical systems requires the construction of several
different types of models, each representing a different view, which include
stakeholder requirements, system behavior, and the system architecture.
Furthermore, each of these models can be represented at different levels of
abstraction. Formal reasoning has improved the precision and expanded the
available types of analysis in assuring correctness of requirements, behaviors,
and architectures. However, each is usually modeled in distinct formalisms and
corresponding tools. Currently, this disparity means that a system designer
must manually check that the different models are in agreement. Manually
editing and checking models is error prone, time consuming, and sensitive to
any changes in the design of the models themselves. Wiring diagrams and related
theory provide a means for formally organizing these different but related
modeling views, resulting in a compositional modeling language for
cyber-physical systems. Such a categorical language can make concrete the
relationship between different model views, thereby managing complexity,
allowing hierarchical decomposition of system models, and formally proving
consistency between models.

for 5G. However, the performance is not very satisfactory with moderate code
length. Heuristic or deep-learning-aided (DL-aided) flip algorithms have been
developed to tackle this problem. The key for successful flip decoding is to
accurately identify error bit positions. In this work, we propose a new flip
algorithm with help of differentiable neural computer (DNC). New state and
action encoding are developed for better DNC training and inference efficiency.
The proposed method consists of two phases: i) a flip DNC (F-DNC) is exploited
to rank most likely flip positions for multi-bit flipping; ii) if decoding
still fails, a flip-validate DNC (FV-DNC) is used to re-select error bit
positions for successive flip decoding trials. Supervised training methods are
designed accordingly for the two DNCs. Simulation results show that proposed
DNC-aided SCL-Flip (DNC-SCLF) decoding demonstrates up to 0.34dB coding gain

robotic sensor network for efficiently monitoring a spatial field. It is
proposed to employ Gaussian process to model a spatial phenomenon and predict
it at unmeasured positions, which enables the sampling optimization problem to
be formulated by the use of the log determinant of a predicted covariance
matrix at next sampling locations. The control, movement and nonholonomic
dynamics constraints of the mobile sensors are also considered in the adaptive
sampling optimization problem. In order to tackle the nonlinearity and
nonconvexity of the objective function in the optimization problem we first
exploit the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (L-ADMM)
method that can effectively simplify the objective function, though it is
computationally expensive since a nonconvex problem needs to be solved exactly
in each iteration. We then propose a novel approach called the successive
convexified ADMM (SC-ADMM) that sequentially convexify the nonlinear dynamic
constraints so that the original optimization problem can be split into convex
subproblems. It is noted that both the L-ADMM algorithm and our SC-ADMM
approach can solve the sampling optimization problem in either a centralized or
a distributed manner. We validated the proposed approaches in 1000 experiments
in a synthetic environment with a real-world dataset, where the obtained
results suggest that both the L-ADMM and SC- ADMM techniques can provide good
accuracy for the monitoring purpose. However, our proposed SC-ADMM approach
computationally outperforms the L-ADMM counterpart, demonstrating its better
practicality.

In this paper, a novel Spatial Human Accessibility graph for Planning and
Environment Analysis (SHAPE) is introduced that brings together the technical
challenges of discrete representations of digital models, with human-based
metrics for evaluating the environment. SHAPE: does not need labeled geometry
as input, works with multi-level buildings, captures surface variations (e.g.,
slopes in a terrain), and can be used with existing graph theory (e.g.,
gravity, centrality) techniques. SHAPE uses ray-casting to perform a search,
generating a dense graph of all accessible locations within the environment and
storing the type of travel required in a graph (e.g., up a slope, down a step).
The ability to simultaneously evaluate and plan paths from multiple human
factors is shown to work on digital models across room, building, and
topography scales. The results enable designers and planners to evaluate
options of the built environment in new ways, and at higher fidelity, that will
lead to more human-friendly and accessible environments.

leads to a sample complexity of $\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\delta^{8})$ samples to
find a policy that is within an error of $\delta$ from the \emph{global

both the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum
Monte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used

interaction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous
Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the
effective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional
electron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field
factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the
electron gas at metallic densities.
  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At
the compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)
term and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron
interaction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large
cancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than
either term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the
electron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static
electron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less
repulsive for electrons with parallel spins.
  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background
is shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As a
simple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using
the measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.
The net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors
$0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly repulsive for the
other alkali metals.

Conventional work in temporal video segmentation and action detection focuses

segment videos into meaningful temporal chunks. This segmentation happens
naturally, without pre-defined event categories and without being explicitly

dimension in the same way it applies along the three space dimensions?
Relativity says it should; current practice says no. With recent advances in
measurement at the attosecond scale it is now possible to decide this question
experimentally.
  The most direct test is to measure the time-of-arrival of a quantum particle:
if the HUP applies in time, then the dispersion in the time-of-arrival will be
measurably increased.
  We develop an appropriate metric of time-of-arrival in the standard case;
extend this to include the case where there is uncertainty in time; then
compare. There is -- as expected -- increased uncertainty in the
time-of-arrival if the HUP applies along the time axis. The results are fully
constrained by Lorentz covariance, therefore uniquely defined, therefore
falsifiable.
  So we have an experimental question on our hands. Any definite resolution
would have significant implications with respect to the role of time in quantum
mechanics and relativity. A positive result would also have significant
practical applications in the areas of quantum communication, attosecond
physics (e.g. protein folding), and quantum computing.

challenges. The currently available datasets either have very short videos or
have few long videos of only a particular type. We introduce a new benchmarking
video dataset called VISIOCITY (VIdeo SummarIzatiOn based on Continuity, Intent
and DiversiTY) which comprises of longer videos across six different categories
with dense concept annotations capable of supporting different flavors of video
summarization and other vision problems. For long videos, human reference
summaries necessary for supervised video summarization techniques are difficult
to obtain. We explore strategies to automatically generate multiple reference
summaries from indirect ground truth present in VISIOCITY. We show that these
summaries are at par with human summaries. We also present a study of different
desired characteristics of a good summary and demonstrate how it is normal to
have two good summaries with different characteristics. Thus we argue that
evaluating a summary against one or more human summaries and using a single
measure has its shortcomings. We propose an evaluation framework for better
quantitative assessment of summary quality which is closer to human judgment.
Lastly, we present insights into how a model can be enhanced to yield better
summaries. Sepcifically, when multiple diverse ground truth summaries can
exist, learning from them individually and using a combination of loss
functions measuring different characteristics is better than learning from a

measured spectra using various spectroscopic techniques, including optical
spectroscopy. EBSDFs, known as glue functions, have a magnetic origin. Here, we
investigated EBSDFs obtained from the measured optical spectra of hole-doped
cuprates with wide doping levels, from underdoped to overdoped cuprates. The
average frequency of an EBSDF provides the timescale for the spin fluctuations
to form Cooper pairs. This timescale is directly associated with retarded
interactions between electrons. Using this timescale and Fermi velocity, a
reasonable superconducting coherence length, which reflects the size of the
Cooper pair, can be extracted. The obtained coherence lengths were consistent
with those measured via other experimental techniques. Therefore, the formation
of Cooper pairs in cuprates can be explained by spin fluctuations, the
timescales of which appear in EBSDFs. Consequently, EBSDFs provide crucial
information on the timescale of the microscopic mechanism of Cooper pair
formation.

localization, their vast majority faces the problem of degrading performance

techniques require precise indoor floor plans and fail to provide satisfactory
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity self-calibrating indoor

proposed model for the flows over periodic hills. The correlation coefficients
of the RANS unclosed terms predicted by the LANN model can be made larger than
0.96 in an a priori analysis, and the relative error of the unclosed terms can
be made smaller than 18%. In an a posteriori analysis, detailed comparisons are
made on the results of RANS simulations using the LANN and Spalart-Allmaras
(SA) models. It is shown that the LANN model performs better than the SA model
in the prediction of the average velocity, wall-shear stress and average
pressure, which gives the results that are essentially indistinguishable from
the direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The LANN model trained in low
Reynolds number Re = 2800 can be directly applied in the cases of high Reynolds
numbers Re = 5600, 10595, 19000, 37000 with accurate predictions. Furthermore,

generally assumed the salinity to be Earth-like. However, according to
observations and geochemical constraints, the salinity of Enceladus' ocean is
likely to be lower, and importantly, it is probably low enough to reverse the
sign of thermal expansivity. We investigate the ocean circulation and
stratification of Enceladus' ocean using a combination of theoretical arguments
and simulations using the MITgcm. We find that, if the salinity is high, the
whole ocean is unstratified, and convection dominates the entire ocean.
However, if the salinity is low enough, there exists a stratified layer in the
upper ocean, whose thickness depends on the magnitude of the turbulent vertical
diffusivity, which remains poorly constrained. Such a layer can suppress the
vertical flux of heat and tracers, thereby affecting the heat flux to the ice
shell and leading to a vertical tracer mixing time scale across the stratified
layer of at least hundreds of years. This time scale is inconsistent with a
previous estimate of vertical ocean mixing of several years, based on the size
of detected silica nanoparticles in the plumes, leading us to conclude that
either the salinity of Enceladus' ocean is higher than previously suggested or
the interpretation of silica nanoparticle observations has to be reconsidered.

knowledge graphs (KGs). It is a pivotal step for integrating KGs to increase
knowledge coverage and quality. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase of
EA frameworks. However, state-of-the-art solutions tend to rely on labeled data
for model training. Additionally, they work under the closed-domain setting and
cannot deal with entities that are unmatchable. To address these deficiencies,
we offer an unsupervised framework that performs entity alignment in the open
world. Specifically, we first mine useful features from the side information of
KGs. Then, we devise an unmatchable entity prediction module to filter out
unmatchable entities and produce preliminary alignment results. These
preliminary results are regarded as the pseudo-labeled data and forwarded to
the progressive learning framework to generate structural representations,
which are integrated with the side information to provide a more comprehensive
view for alignment. Finally, the progressive learning framework gradually
improves the quality of structural embeddings and enhances the alignment
performance by enriching the pseudo-labeled data with alignment results from
the previous round. Our solution does not require labeled data and can

  Evolution in Amorphous Silicon: An Investigation from Atomistic Time Scales
  to Experimental Time Scales",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The annealing treatment in the advanced manufacturing process, e.g.,
laser-assisted manufacturing, determines the final state of glasses which is
critical to its thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. Energy barriers
analysis based on the potential energy surface offers an effective way to study
the microscopic evolution of the inherent structures during the annealing
process in a broadening timescale range, i.e., from atomistic timescale ( ~ ps)
to experimental timescale (~ s). Here, we find the distribution activation
energy barriers in the potential energy surface can be divided into three
regimes 1, the distribution mainly follows the Rayleigh distribution when the
annealing rate Rdot < 1e15 K/s; 2, two different modes, i.e., an exponentially
decaying mode and a Rayleigh distribution mode, are found in the spectra when
the annealing rate 1e15 K/s < Rdot < instant; 3, the spectra is almost
following the exponentially decaying mode when the system is under the instant
annealing process. However, the spectra of relaxation energy barriers only show
an exponentially decaying mode with a decreasing decay parameter. A multi
timescale model for any specific annealing rate, which is beyond the limit of
the conventional atomistic simulations, i.e., molecular dynamics simulations,
is then proposed based on the distribution of the energy barriers. Such a model
enables quantitative explanations and predictions of the heat release during
the annealing process of the nanocalorimetry measurements or laser-assisted
manufacturing.

focusing on various HCIs of a single atomic element, keeps the number of
candidate clock transitions as large as possible. Following this strategy, we
identify four adjacent charge states of nickel HCIs that offer as many as six
optical transitions. Experimentally, we demonstrated the essential capability
of producing these ions in the low-energy compact Shanghai-Wuhan Electron Beam
Ion Trap. We measured the wavelengths of four magnetic-dipole ($M$1) and one
electric-quadrupole ($E$2) clock transitions with an accuracy of several ppm
with a novel calibration method; two of these lines were observed and
characterized for the first time in controlled laboratory settings. Compared to
the earlier determinations, our measurements improved wavelength accuracy by an
order of magnitude. Such measurements are crucial for constraining the range of
laser wavelengths for finding the ""needle in a haystack"" narrow lines. In
addition, we calculated frequencies and quality factors, evaluated sensitivity
of these six transitions to the hypothetical variation of the electromagnetic
fine structure constant $\alpha$ needed for fundamental physics applications.
We argue that all the six transitions in nickel HCIs offer intrinsic immunity
to all common perturbations of quantum oscillators, and one of them has the
projected fractional frequency uncertainty down to the remarkable level of
10$^{-19}$.

the optimal privatization scheme that minimizes the $\alpha$-lift in the

information $S$, the ratio $l(s,x) = \frac{p(s|x)}{p(s)} $ denotes the `lift'
of the posterior belief on $S$ and quantifies data privacy. The $\alpha$-lift
is proposed as the $L_\alpha$-norm of the lift: $\ell_{\alpha}(x) = \|
(\cdot,x) \|_{\alpha} = (E[l(S,x)^\alpha])^{1/\alpha}$. This is a tunable
measure: When $\alpha < \infty$, each lift is weighted by its likelihood of
appearing in the dataset (w.r.t. the marginal probability $p(s)$); For $\alpha
= \infty$, $\alpha$-lift reduces to the existing maximum lift. To generate the
sanitized data $Y$, we adopt the privacy watchdog method using $\alpha$-lift:
Obtain $\mathcal{X}_{\epsilon}$ containing all $x$'s such that
$\ell_{\alpha}(x) > e^{\epsilon}$; Apply the randomization $r(y|x)$ to all $x
\in \mathcal{X}_{\epsilon}$, while all other $x \in \mathcal{X} \setminus

$\ell_{\alpha}(y)$, it is shown that the Sibson mutual information
$I_{\alpha}^{S}(S;Y)$ is proportional to $E[ \ell_{\alpha}(y)]$. We further
define a stronger measure $\bar{I}_{\alpha}^{S}(S;Y)$ using the worst-case
$\alpha$-lift: $\max_{y} \ell_{\alpha}(y)$. We prove that the optimal
randomization $r^*(y|x)$ that minimizes both $I_{\alpha}^{S}(S;Y)$ and
$\bar{I}_{\alpha}^{S}(S;Y)$ is $X$-invariant, i.e., $r^*(y|x) = R(y), \forall
x\in \mathcal{X}_{\epsilon}$ for any probability distribution $R$ over $y \in

inverse modeling in materials science. Generally speaking, there are two broad
modeling paradigms in scientific applications: forward and inverse. While the
forward modeling estimates the observations based on known parameters, the
inverse modeling attempts to infer the parameters given the observations.
Inverse problems are usually more critical as well as difficult in scientific
applications as they seek to explore the parameters that cannot be directly
observed. Inverse problems are used extensively in various scientific fields,
such as geophysics, healthcare and materials science. However, it is
challenging to solve inverse problems, because they usually need to learn a
one-to-many non-linear mapping, and also require significant computing time,
especially for high-dimensional parameter space. Further, inverse problems
become even more difficult to solve when the dimension of input (i.e.
observation) is much lower than that of output (i.e. parameters). In this work,
we propose a framework consisting of generative adversarial networks and
mixture density networks for inverse modeling, and it is evaluated on a
materials science dataset for microstructural materials design. Compared with
baseline methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework can
overcome the above-mentioned challenges and produce multiple promising

that learns data distribution through adversarial training. However, recent
experiments indicated that GANs are difficult to train due to the requirement
of optimization in the high dimensional parameter space and the zero gradient
problem. In this work, we propose a Self Sparse Generative Adversarial Network
(Self-Sparse GAN) that reduces the parameter space and alleviates the zero
gradient problem. In the Self-Sparse GAN, we design a Self-Adaptive Sparse
Transform Module (SASTM) comprising the sparsity decomposition and feature-map
recombination, which can be applied on multi-channel feature maps to obtain
sparse feature maps. The key idea of Self-Sparse GAN is to add the SASTM
following every deconvolution layer in the generator, which can adaptively
reduce the parameter space by utilizing the sparsity in multi-channel feature
maps. We theoretically prove that the SASTM can not only reduce the search
space of the convolution kernel weight of the generator but also alleviate the
zero gradient problem by maintaining meaningful features in the Batch
Normalization layer and driving the weight of deconvolution layers away from
being negative. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best
FID scores for image generation compared with WGAN-GP on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, STL-10, mini-ImageNet, CELEBA-HQ, and LSUN bedrooms, and the relative
decrease of FID is 4.76% ~ 21.84%.

The (100)/(010)-oriented $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ phases form a self-organized 3D

annealing of the substrate or using a few monolayer-thick $SrRuO_{3}$ as the
blocking layer for oxygen vacancy diffusion enables growing high-quality
single-crystalline $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ (001) thin film exhibiting an atomically

evaporation of volatile Bismuth (Bi), which hinders the epitaxial growth. Our
work provides a general guideline for high-quality thin film growth of

resolved STEM study of a fully strained BWO film revealed collective in-plane
polar off-centering displacement of W atoms. We estimated the spontaneous

${\mu}C cm^{-2}$, which is in good agreement with the bulk polarization value.
Furthermore, we found that pristine film is composed of type-I and type-II
domains, with mutually orthogonal polar axes. Complementary PFM measurements
further elucidated that the coexisting type-I and type-II domains formed a
multidomain state that consisted of 90$\deg$ domain walls (DWs) alongside
multiple head-to-head and tail-to-tail 180$\deg$ DWs. Application of an

ramified stripe. As the skyrmion number density increases, individual skyrmion

often cited when designing smart home applications is the resilience of these

mischievous data points that force machine learning models to generate wrong

vulnerability of radar-based CNNs to adversarial attacks, and where these
radar-based CNNs have been designed to recognize human gestures. Through
experiments with four unique threat models, we show that radar-based CNNs are
susceptible to both white- and black-box adversarial attacks. We also expose
the existence of an extreme adversarial attack case, where it is possible to
change the prediction made by the radar-based CNNs by only perturbing the
padding of the inputs, without touching the frames where the action itself
occurs. Moreover, we observe that gradient-based attacks exercise perturbation
not randomly, but on important features of the input data. We highlight these
important features by making use of Grad-CAM, a popular neural network
interpretability method, hereby showing the connection between adversarial

study the cross-modal impact of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS)

and visual perceptual thresholds of human subjects across a swath of different
nGVS levels in order to determine if a subject-specific best nGVS level
elicited a reduction in thresholds as compared the no noise condition (sham).
Results: We found an 18% improvement in visual thresholds (p = 0.026). Among

we experimentally study the floatability of a less viscous water drop on the

bridge this gap, this work designed and validated personalized models of
arousal and valence for children with ASD using a multi-session in-home dataset

supervised domain adaptation (s-DA), the personalized models were able to trade
off between the limited individual data and the more abundant less personal

the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays from some gamma-ray bursts

about 20000 s after the burst onset the VHE gamma-ray emission was detected by
H.E.S.S. with ~ 5 sigma significance. This event had unusual features of having
much smaller isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy than typical long GRBs and
achromatic peaks in X-ray and optical afterglow at about 1400 s. Here we
propose an off-axis jet scenario that explains these observational results. In
this model, the relativistic beaming effect is responsible for the apparently
small isotropic gamma-ray energy and spectral peak energy. Using a jetted
afterglow model, we find that the narrow jet, which has the initial Lorentz
factor of 350 and the initial jet opening half-angle of 0.015 rad, viewed
off-axis can describe the observed achromatic behavior in the X-ray and optical
afterglow. Another wide, baryon-loaded jet is necessary for the later-epoch
X-ray and radio emissions. According to our model, the VHE gamma rays observed
by H.E.S.S. at 20000 s may come from the narrow jet through the synchrotron
self-Compton process.

small population, however, such predation-driven Allee effects cannot occur for
the model with type I functional response. It generally occurs when a
generalist predator targets some specific prey. However, apart from the lethal
effects of predation, there are some non-lethal effects in the presence of
predator. Due to the fear of predation, positive density dependence growth may
be observed at low population density, because of reduced foraging activities.
Moreover, this non-lethal effect can be carried over generations. In the
present manuscript, we investigate the role of predation fear and its
carry-over effects in prey-predator model. First, we study the single species
model in global perspective. We have shown that depending on the birth rate,
our single species model describes three types of growth dynamics, namely,
strong Allee dynamics, weak Allee dynamics and logistic dynamics. Then we
consider the explicit dynamics of predator, with type I functional response.
Basic dynamical properties, as well as global stability of each equilibria have
been discussed. From our analysis, we can observe that both the fear and its
carry-over effects have significant role in the stability of the coexistence
equilibrium, even if for the model with type I functional response. The
phenomenon paradox of enrichment can be observed in our model, which cannot be
observed in the classical prey-predator model with type I functional response.
However, we can see that such phenomenon can be ruled out by choosing suitable
non-lethal effect parameters. Therefore, our study shows how non-lethal effects
change the dynamics of a competition model, and has important biological
insights, specially for the understanding of the dynamics of small populations.

${\mathbb R}^N$. This can be viewed as a finite-dimensional approximation of
kernel ridge regression (KRR), or as a stylized model for neural networks in
the so called lazy training regime.
  We define a class of problems satisfying certain spectral conditions on the
underlying kernels, and a hypercontractivity assumption on the associated
eigenfunctions. These conditions are verified by classical high-dimensional
examples. Under these conditions, we prove a sharp characterization of the
error of random features ridge regression. In particular, we address two
fundamental questions: $(1)$~What is the generalization error of KRR? $(2)$~How
big $N$ should be for the random features approximation to achieve the same
error as KRR?
  In this setting, we prove that KRR is well approximated by a projection onto
the top $\ell$ eigenfunctions of the kernel, where $\ell$ depends on the sample
size $n$. We show that the test error of random features ridge regression is
dominated by its approximation error and is larger than the error of KRR as
long as $N\le n^{1-\delta}$ for some $\delta>0$. We characterize this gap. For
$N\ge n^{1+\delta}$, random features achieve the same error as the
corresponding KRR, and further increasing $N$ does not lead to a significant
change in test error.

investigated. We focus on LNSVs with in-plane magnetic anisotropy in their free

breakdown can be postponed considerably (practical infinity) by iDMI. More
interestingly, the originally unstable traveling mode is also stabilized by
iDMI with high saturation velocity thus serves as fast carrier of information.
For parallel polarizers, the Walker limit is increased and the corresponding

applications, such as autonomous driving and intelligent robots. Currently,
most of existing work treat the pedestrian trajectory as a series of fixed
two-dimensional coordinates. However, in real scenarios, the trajectory often
exhibits randomness, and has its own probability distribution. Inspired by this
observed fact, also considering other movement characteristics of pedestrians,
we propose one simple and intuitive movement description, probability
trajectory, which maps the coordinate points of pedestrian trajectory into
two-dimensional Gaussian distribution in images. Based on this unique
description, we develop one novel trajectory prediction method, called social
probability. The method combines the new probability trajectory and powerful
convolution recurrent neural networks together. Both the input and output of
our method are probability trajectories, which provide the recurrent neural
network with sufficient spatial and random information of moving pedestrians.
And the social probability extracts spatio-temporal features directly on the
new movement description to generate robust and accurate predicted results. The
experiments on public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

  International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE'21)",,,,"cs.ET cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main memory access latency has not much improved for more than two
decades while the CPU performance had been exponentially increasing until
recently. Approximate memory is a technique to reduce the DRAM access latency
in return of losing data integrity. It is beneficial for applications that are
robust to noisy input and intermediate data such as artificial intelligence,
multimedia processing, and graph processing. To obtain reasonable outputs from
applications on approximate memory, it is crucial to protect critical data
while accelerating accesses to non-critical data. We refer the minimum size of
a continuous memory region that the same error rate is applied in approximate
memory to as the approximation granularity. A fundamental limitation of
approximate memory is that the approximation granularity is as large as a few
kilo bytes. However, applications may have critical and non-critical data
interleaved with smaller granularity. For example, a data structure for graph
nodes can have pointers (critical) to neighboring nodes and its score
(non-critical, depending on the use-case). This data structure cannot be
directly mapped to approximate memory due to the gap between the approximation
granularity and the granularity of data criticality. We refer to this issue as
the granularity gap problem. In this paper, we first show that many
applications potentially suffer from this problem. Then we propose a framework
to quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead of a possible method to
avoid this problem using known techniques. The evaluation results show that the
performance overhead is non-negligible compared to expected benefit from
approximate memory, suggesting that the granularity gap problem is a
significant concern.

domain with a specific set of semantic labels and can hardly be adapted into
other scenarios (e.g., sharing discrepant label granularity) without extensive
re-training. Learning a single universal parsing model by unifying label
annotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity is a
crucial but rarely addressed topic. This poses many fundamental learning
challenges, e.g., discovering underlying semantic structures among different
label granularity or mining label correlation across relevant tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose a graph reasoning and transfer learning framework,
named ""Graphonomy"", which incorporates human knowledge and label taxonomy into
the intermediate graph representation learning beyond local convolutions. In
particular, Graphonomy learns the global and structured semantic coherency in
multiple domains via semantic-aware graph reasoning and transfer, enforcing the
mutual benefits of the parsing across domains (e.g., different datasets or
co-related tasks). The Graphonomy includes two iterated modules: Intra-Graph
Reasoning and Inter-Graph Transfer modules. The former extracts the semantic
graph in each domain to improve the feature representation learning by
propagating information with the graph; the latter exploits the dependencies
among the graphs from different domains for bidirectional knowledge transfer.
We apply Graphonomy to two relevant but different image understanding research
topics: human parsing and panoptic segmentation, and show Graphonomy can handle
both of them well via a standard pipeline against current state-of-the-art
approaches. Moreover, some extra benefit of our framework is demonstrated,
e.g., generating the human parsing at various levels of granularity by unifying

chain of four accelerators in cascade to support the collider. As an important
part of the SPPC conceptual study, the longitudinal beam dynamics was studied
systematically, which includes the dynamics in the collider and its complex
injector chain. First, the bunch filling scheme of the SPPC complex was
designed on the basis of various constraints such as the technical challenges
of the kicker magnets, limited extraction energy per injection and so on. Next,
the study on the longitudinal dynamics in the collider focused on the RF scheme
to meet the requirements for luminosity and mitigate relevant instabilities. A
higher harmonic RF system (800 MHz) together with the basic RF system (400 MHz)
to form a dual-harmonic RF system was employed to mitigate collective
instabilities and increase the luminosity by producing shorter bunches. In
addition, the longitudinal matchings between the bunches in the different
accelerator stages were studied, with special attention to the space charge
effects and the beam loading effect in the two lower energy rings (p-RCS and
MSS), which result in an optimization of the RF schemes. A set of
self-consistent beam and RF parameters for the SPPC complex was obtained. The
collider and the three proton synchrotrons of the injector chain have
unprecedented features, thus this study demonstrates how a future proton-proton

distribution which, however, is quite a common case in real-world scenarios.
Previous methods tackle the problem from either the aspect of input space
(re-sampling classes with different frequencies) or loss space (re-weighting
classes with different weights), suffering from heavy over-fitting to tail
classes or hard optimization during training. To alleviate these issues, we
propose a more fundamental perspective for long-tailed recognition, i.e., from
the aspect of parameter space, and aims to preserve specific capacity for
classes with low frequencies. From this perspective, the trivial solution
utilizes different branches for the head, medium, and tail classes
respectively, and then sums their outputs as the final results is not feasible.
Instead, we design the effective residual fusion mechanism -- with one main
branch optimized to recognize images from all classes, another two residual
branches are gradually fused and optimized to enhance images from medium+tail
classes and tail classes respectively. Then the branches are aggregated into
final results by additive shortcuts. We test our method on several benchmarks,

non-Gaussian signature for the three-point function of the inflaton. Taking
into account that Hubble scale is around the scale of grand unified theory
(GUT), this opens a possibility that the GUT scale signatures, which are very
hard to be discovered at collider, might be detectable by using information
from the precise observations of cosmic microwave background. We discuss a
detactability of the $X, Y$ gauge boson present in any GUT in a framework of
cosmological collider physics. Calculating one-loop contributions of $X, Y$
gauge bosons to the inflaton three-point functions, we find a remarkable result
that one-loop diagram with interactions originated from the mass terms of $X,
Y$ gauge bosons provides an enhancement factor expressed by the ratio between
the $X, Y$ gauge boson mass and Hubble scale as $(m_X/H)^4$. In an estimation
of the non-Gaussianity, this factor is crucial and its impact on the
detactability of $X, Y$ gauge bosons is discussed.

reverberant environments based on deep generative modeling. Localization in
reverberant environments remains an open challenge. Even with large data
volumes, the number of labels available for supervised learning in reverberant
environments is usually small. We address this issue by performing
semi-supervised learning (SSL) with convolutional variational autoencoders
(VAEs) on reverberant speech signals recorded with microphone arrays. The VAE
is trained to generate the phase of relative transfer functions (RTFs) between
microphones, in parallel with a direction of arrival (DOA) classifier based on
RTF-phase. These models are trained using both labeled and unlabeled RTF-phase
sequences. In learning to perform these tasks, the VAE-SSL explicitly learns to
separate the physical causes of the RTF-phase (i.e., source location) from
distracting signal characteristics such as noise and speech activity. Relative
to existing semi-supervised localization methods in acoustics, VAE-SSL is
effectively an end-to-end processing approach which relies on minimal
preprocessing of RTF-phase features. As far as we are aware, our paper presents
the first approach to modeling the physics of acoustic propagation using deep
generative modeling. The VAE-SSL approach is compared with two signal
processing-based approaches, steered response power with phase transform
(SRP-PHAT) and MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC), as well as fully
supervised CNNs. We find that VAE-SSL can outperform the conventional
approaches and the CNN in label-limited scenarios. Further, the trained VAE-SSL
system can generate new RTF-phase samples, which shows the VAE-SSL approach
learns the physics of the acoustic environment. The generative modeling in
VAE-SSL thus provides a means of interpreting the learned representations.

Moseley and Wang defined the \emph{Revenue} objective to handle similarity

weights), while Cohen-Addad et al. defined the \emph{Dissimilarity} objective
to handle dissimilarity information. In this paper, we prove structural lemmas
for both objectives allowing us to convert any HC tree to a tree with constant

performances of analog applications. These distances can be viewed as random

size and properties of the system at stake. A few studies have focused on the
first moments of return time statistics for the best analog, fixing an
objective of maximum distance from this analog to the target state. However,
for practical use and to reduce estimation variance, applications usually
require not just one, but many analogs. In this paper, we evaluate from a
theoretical standpoint and with numerical experiments the probability

accurate estimation of treatment effects on time-to-event outcomes in the

tackle this longitudinal treatment effect estimation problem, we have developed
a time-variant causal survival (TCS) model that uses the potential outcomes
framework with an ensemble of recurrent subnetworks to estimate the difference
in survival probabilities and its confidence interval over time as a function
of time-dependent covariates and treatments. Using simulated survival datasets,
the TCS model showed good causal effect estimation performance across scenarios
of varying sample dimensions, event rates, confounding and overlapping.
However, increasing the sample size was not effective in alleviating the
adverse impact of a high level of confounding. In a large clinical cohort
study, TCS identified the expected conditional average treatment effect and
detected individual treatment effect heterogeneity over time. TCS provides an
efficient way to estimate and update individualized treatment effects over
time, in order to improve clinical decisions. The use of a propensity score
layer and potential outcome subnetworks helps correcting for selection bias.
However, the proposed model is limited in its ability to correct the bias from
unmeasured confounding, and more extensive testing of TCS under extreme
scenarios such as low overlapping and the presence of unmeasured confounders is
desired and left for future work.

closely parallels that of the familiar 3d CS one. In spite of these formal
resemblance, the gauge invariance properties of the 4d CS model differ
considerably. The 4d CS action is fully gauge invariant if the underlying base
4fold has no boundary. When it does, the action is gauge variant, the gauge
variation being a boundary term. If certain boundary conditions are imposed on
the gauge fields and gauge transformations, level quantization can then occur.
In the canonical formulation of the theory, it is found that, depending again
on boundary conditions, the 4d CS model is characterized by surface charges
obeying a non trivial Poisson bracket algebra. This is a higher counterpart of
the familiar WZNW current algebra arising in the 3d model. 4d CS theory thus
exhibits rich holographic properties. The covariant Schroedinger quantization
of the 4d CS model is performed. A preliminary analysis of 4d CS edge field

Variations of the GeV light curve lead those in the radio. Lepto-hadronic and
purely hadronic models in the frame of shock acceleration predict proton
acceleration or cooling timescales that are ruled out by the short variability
timescales and delays observed in Mrk 421. Instead the observations match the
predictions of leptonic models.

we show that only the one with a positive specific heat contributes to the

electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in this background, and show
that the corresponding equations are separable. Interestingly, the solutions
pile up in the form of Landau levels, and hence are characterized by a single

scalar and gravitational perturbations. On the other hand, electromagnetic
perturbations depend on a free parameter whose determination is problematic. We
find that all the scalar and gravitational QNM frequencies lie in the lower

of an encoder structure and a predictor structure. The encoder is to find a
good representation in the input data for the learning task. The predictor is
to use the latent representation to predict the final output. To enhance the

accuracy in software effort estimation (SEE). The researchers and practitioners
are striving to identify which machine learning estimation technique gives more
accurate results based on evaluation measures, datasets and the other relevant
attributes. The authors of related research are generally not aware of
previously published results of machine learning effort estimation techniques.
The main aim of this study is to assist the researchers to know which machine
learning technique yields the promising effort estimation accuracy prediction
in the software development. In this paper, the performance of the machine
learning ensemble technique is investigated with the solo technique based on
two most commonly used accuracy evaluation metrics. We used the systematic
literature review methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters. This
includes searching for the most relevant papers, applying quality assessment
criteria, extracting data and drawing results. We have evaluated a
state-of-the-art accuracy performance of 28 selected studies (14 ensemble, 14

reliable accuracy metrics for performance evaluation of accuracy among two
techniques to report the research questions stated in this study. We found that
machine learning techniques are the most frequently implemented in the
construction of ensemble effort estimation (EEE) techniques. The results of
this study revealed that the EEE techniques usually yield a promising
estimation accuracy than the solo techniques.

large effective radii. Spectroscopic measurements of a few UDGs have revealed a
low dark matter content, based on the internal motion of stars or globular
clusters (GCs). This is in contrast to the large number of GCs found for these
systems, from which it would be expected to correspond to a large dark matter
halo mass. Here we present HST+ACS observations for the UDG MATLAS-2019 in the
NGC5846 group. Using the F606W and F814W filters, we trace the GC population
two magnitudes below the peak of the GC luminosity function (GCLF). Employing
Bayesian considerations, we identify 26+-6 GCs associated with the dwarf,
yielding a large specific frequency of S_N=58+-14. We use the turnover of the
GCLF to derive a distance of 21+-2 Mpc, which is consistent with the NGC5846
group of galaxies. Due to the superior image quality of the HST, we are able to
resolve the GCs and measure their sizes, which are consistent with the sizes of
GCs around Local Group galaxies. Using the linear relation between the total
mass of galaxies and of GCs, we derive a halo mass of 0.9(+-0.2) *10^11 M_solar
(M_solar/L_solar>1000). The high abundance of GCs, together with the small
uncertainties, make MATLAS-2019 one of the most extreme UDGs, which likely sets
an upper limit of the number of GCs for UDGs.

play a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain.
However, classical reservoir computing requires manual adjustments of global
network parameters, particularly of the spectral radius of the recurrent
synaptic weight matrix. It is hence not clear if the spectral radius is
accessible to biological neural networks.
  Using random matrix theory, we show that the spectral radius is related to
local properties of the neuronal dynamics whenever the overall dynamical state
is only weakly correlated. This result allows us to introduce two local
homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms, termed flow control and variance
control, that implicitly drive the spectral radius towards the desired value
under working conditions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two adaptation mechanisms under
different external input protocols and the network performance after adaptation
by training the network to perform a time-delayed XOR operation on binary
sequences. As our main result, we found that flow control reliably regulates
the spectral radius for different types of input statistics. Precise tuning is
however negatively affected when interneural correlations are substantial.
Furthermore, we found a consistent task performance over a wide range of input
strengths/variances. Variance control did however not yield the desired
spectral radii with the same precision, being less consistent across different
input strengths.
  Given the effectiveness and remarkably simple mathematical form of flow
control, we conclude that self-consistent local control of the spectral radius
via an implicit adaptation scheme is an interesting and biological plausible
alternative to conventional methods using setpoint homeostatic feedback
controls of neural firing.

reduce the search cost on large 3D CT datasets, most NAS-based works use the

inaccurate model estimation. In this work, we propose an efficient Evolutionary

possibly delayed reward for its actions. Often, those rewards are handcrafted

performance of an agent often depends on the design of the reward signal. In
particular, in domains where states by nature only have an ordinal ranking and
where meaningful distance information between game state values is not

10-100$G. Magnetic fields in extrasolar giant planets are detectable by future
radio observations in $\gtrsim 10$MHz and the spectropolarimetry of atomic
lines. In contrast, the elusive interiors of exoplanets remain largely unknown.
Here we consider the possibility of inferring the existence of the innermost
cores of extrasolar giant planets through the detection of planetary magnetic
fields. We simulated the long-term thermal evolution of close-in giant planets
with masses of $0.2-10M_\mathrm{Jup}$ to estimate their magnetic field
strengths. A young, massive gas giant tends to have a strong magnetic field.
The magnetic field strength of a hot Jupiter is insensitive to its core mass,
whereas the core strongly affects the emergence of a planetary dynamo in a hot
Saturn. No dynamo-driven magnetic field is generated in a hot Saturn with no
core or a small one until $\sim 10-100$Myr if metallization of hydrogen occurs
at $\gtrsim 1-1.5$Mbar. The magnetic field strength of an evolved gas giant
after $\sim 100\mathrm{Myr}$ is almost independent of the stellar incident
flux. Detecting the magnetic field of a young, hot Saturn as a good indicator
of its core may be challenging because of the weakness of radio signals and the
shielding effect of plasma in the Earth's ionosphere. Hot Jupiters with
$\gtrsim 0.4M_\mathrm{Jup}$ can be promising candidates for future ground-based
radio observations.

considerably from one pathology to another. Current methods are supervised and
require numerous annotated images for each pathology, a strenuous task. To
tackle anatomical variability, Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods are
proposed, detecting anomalies as outliers of a healthy model learned using a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Previous work on UAD adopted a 2D approach,
meaning that MRIs are processed as a collection of independent slices. Yet, it
does not fully exploit the spatial information contained in MRI. Here, we
propose to perform UAD in a 3D fashion and compare 2D and 3D VAEs. As a side
contribution, we present a new loss function guarantying a robust training.
Learning is performed using a multicentric dataset of healthy brain MRIs, and
segmentation performances are estimated on White-Matter Hyperintensities and
tumors lesions. Experiments demonstrate the interest of 3D methods which
outperform their 2D counterparts.

advantage of the relative insensitivity of the beam combination process to

relations are extracted.We found that 30 per cent of the systems in the current

studied, some have an extremely low mass ratio (q < 0.1) or an ultra-short
orbital period (Porb < 0.25 d), which are expected to show evidence of mass
transfer progress. The evolutionary status of these components is discussed
with the aid of correlation diagrams and their physical and orbital parameters

of very short orbital periods confirms the very slow nature of the merging

additional proof of identification. Although RBA is recommended in the NIST
digital identity guidelines, it has so far been used almost exclusively by
major online services. This is partly due to a lack of open knowledge and
implementations that would allow any service provider to roll out RBA

  To close this gap, we provide a first in-depth analysis of RBA

unique features on a real-world online service for over 1.8 years. Based on our
collected data set, we provide (i) a behavior analysis of two RBA
implementations that were apparently used by major online services in the wild,
(ii) a benchmark of the features to extract a subset that is most suitable for
RBA use, (iii) a new feature that has not been used in RBA before, and (iv)
factors which have a significant effect on RBA performance. Our results show
that RBA needs to be carefully tailored to each online service, as even small
configuration adjustments can greatly impact RBA's security and usability
properties. We provide insights on the selection of features, their weightings,
and the risk classification in order to benefit from RBA after a minimum number

  acknowledgments added; v4: published version",,"10.1093/ptep/ptab063",,"hep-th astro-ph.CO gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity in the single-field
non-attractor inflation models from the viewpoint of the cosmological soft
theorem. In the single-field attractor models, inflaton's trajectories with
different initial conditions effectively converge into a single trajectory in
the phase space, and hence there is only one \emph{clock} degree of freedom
(DoF) in the scalar part. Its long-wavelength perturbations can be absorbed
into the local coordinate renormalization and lead to the so-called
\emph{consistency relation} between $n$- and $(n+1)$-point functions. On the
other hand, if the inflaton dynamics deviates from the attractor behavior, its
long-wavelength perturbations cannot necessarily be absorbed and the
consistency relation is expected not to hold any longer. In this work, we
derive a formula for the squeezed bispectrum including the explicit correction
to the consistency relation, as a proof of its violation in the non-attractor
cases. First one must recall that non-attractor inflation needs to be followed
by attractor inflation in a realistic case. Then, even if a specific
non-attractor phase is effectively governed by a single DoF of phase space
(represented by the exact ultra-slow-roll limit) and followed by a single-DoF
attractor phase, its transition phase necessarily involves two DoF in dynamics
and hence its long-wavelength perturbations cannot be absorbed into the local
coordinate renormalization. Thus, it can affect local physics, even taking
account of the so-called \emph{local observer effect}, as shown by the fact
that the bispectrum in the squeezed limit can go beyond the consistency
relation. More concretely, the observed squeezed bispectrum does not vanish in
general for long-wavelength perturbations exiting the horizon during a
non-attractor phase.

is applied. Their flow consists of periods of elastic loading interrupted by
rapid stress drops, or avalanches, coming from microscopic rearrangements known
as shear transformations (STs). Here we show that the spatial extent of
avalanches in a steadily sheared amorphous solid has a profound effect on the
distribution of local residual stresses $x$. We find that in this distribution,
the most unstable sites are located in a system size dependent plateau. While
the entrance into the plateau is set by the lower cutoff of the mechanical
noise produced by individual STs, the departure from the usually assumed
power-law (pseudogap) form $P(x) \sim x^{\theta}$ comes from far field effects
related to spatially extended rearrangements. Interestingly, we observe that
the average value of weakest sites $\langle x_{min} \rangle$ is located in an
intermediate power law regime between the pseudogap and the plateau regimes,
whose exponent decreases with system size. Our findings imply a new scaling

  pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, some approaches are proposed to harness deep convolutional networks
to facilitate superpixel segmentation. The common practice is to first evenly
divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate
each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of
convolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly
perceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.
Consequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when
inferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel
\textbf{A}ssociation \textbf{I}mplantation (AI) module to enable the network to
explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.
The proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the
surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the
padded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an
implantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid
level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation
comparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary
precision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network
discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could
benefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary
pixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our
method could not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but maintain
satisfactory inference efficiency.

recent years, fast approximate algorithms for discord search have been proposed
in order to compensate for the increasing size of the time series. It is more
interesting, however, to find quick exact solutions. In this research, we
improved HOT SAX by exploiting two main ideas: the warm-up process, and the
similarity between sequences close in time. The resulting algorithm, called HOT
SAX Time (HST), has been validated with real and synthetic time series, and
successfully compared with HOT SAX, RRA, SCAMP, and DADD. The complexity of a
discord search has been evaluated with a new indicator, the cost per sequence
(cps), which allows one to compare searches on time series of different
lengths. Numerical evidence suggests that two conditions are involved in
determining the complexity of a discord search in a non-trivial way: the length
of the discords, and the noise/signal ratio. In the case of complex searches,
HST can be more than 100 times faster than HOT SAX, thus being at the forefront
of the exact discord search.

blockchains. However, in the past, there have been few measurement studies on
measuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between existing
blockchains using multiple metrics and granularities. This paper presents a new
comparison study of the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the
two most prominent blockchains, with various decentralization metrics and
different granularities within the time dimension. Specifically, we measure the
degree of decentralization in the two blockchains during 2019 by computing the
distribution of mining power with three metrics (Gini coefficient, Shannon
entropy, and Nakamoto coefficient) as well as three granularities (days, weeks,
and months). Our measurement results with different metrics and granularities
reveal the same trend that, compared with each other, the degree of
decentralization in Bitcoin is higher, while the degree of decentralization in
Ethereum is more stable. To obtain the cross-interval information missed in the
fixed window based measurements, we propose the sliding window based
measurement approach. The corresponding results demonstrate that the use of
sliding windows could reveal additional cross-interval information overlooked
by the fixed window based measurements, thus enhancing the effectiveness of
measuring decentralization in terms of continuous trends and abnormal
situations. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can
facilitate future studies of decentralization in blockchains.

number violating neutrino-less double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in the
isotope $\mathrm{^{130}Te}$. In this work we present the latest results on two
searches for the double beta decay (DBD) of $\mathrm{^{130}Te}$ to the first
$0^{+}_2$ excited state of $\mathrm{^{130}Xe}$: the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and
the Standard Model-allowed two-neutrinos double beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$).
Both searches are based on a 372.5 kg$\times$yr TeO$_2$ exposure. The
de-excitation gamma rays emitted by the excited Xe nucleus in the final state
yield a unique signature, which can be searched for with low background by
studying coincident events in two or more bolometers. The closely packed
arrangement of the CUORE crystals constitutes a significant advantage in this
regard. The median limit setting sensitivities at 90\% Credible Interval (C.I.)
of the given searches were estimated as $\mathrm{S^{0\nu}_{1/2} = 5.6 \times
10^{24} \: \mathrm{yr}}$ for the ${0\nu\beta\beta}$ decay and
$\mathrm{S^{2\nu}_{1/2} = 2.1 \times 10^{24} \: \mathrm{yr}}$ for the
${2\nu\beta\beta}$ decay. No significant evidence for either of the decay modes
was observed and a Bayesian lower bound at $90\%$ C.I. on the decay half lives
is obtained as: $\mathrm{(T_{1/2})^{0\nu}_{0^+_2} > 5.9 \times 10^{24} \:
\mathrm{yr}}$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ mode and
$\mathrm{(T_{1/2})^{2\nu}_{0^+_2} > 1.3 \times 10^{24} \: \mathrm{yr}}$ for the
$2\nu\beta\beta$ mode. These represent the most stringent limits on the DBD of
$^{130}$Te to excited states and improve by a factor $\sim5$ the previous
results on this process.

increasing the payload size with fixed pilot size; and the scaling laws of both

flow-induced hemolysis by improving the design of next-generation biomedical
machinery. Emphasis is given to the formulation of a continuous adjoint
complement to a power-law hemolysis prediction model dedicated to efficiently
identifying the shape sensitivity to hemolysis. The computational approach is
verified against the analytical solutions of a benchmark problem and computed
sensitivity derivatives are validated by a finite differences study on a

ionized medium components, spatially resolved by the VLT-MUSE spectroscopy, and
link them to the molecular gas by incorporating sub-mm ALMA observations. We
measure the fluxes of strong emission lines, allowing us to determine the
physical conditions of the warm ionized gas. The ionized gas flux brightness
peak corresponds to the location of the supermassive black hole and the system
shows a diffuse warm ionized gas tail extending 30 kpc in N-E direction. The
ionized and molecular gas are co-spatial and co-moving, with the gaseous
component in the tail falling inward, providing fuel for star formation and
accretion-powered nuclear activity. The gas is ionized by a mix of star
formation and other energetic processes which give rise to LINER-like emission,
with active galactic nuclei emission dominant only in the BCG core. We measure
a star formation rate of 97 Msun/yr, with its peak at the BCG core. However,
star formation accounts for only 50-60% of the energetics needed to ionize the
warm gas. In situ star formation generated by thermally unstable intracluster
medium cooling and/or dry mergers dominate the stellar mass growth at z<0.5 and
these mechanisms account for the build-up of 20% of the mass of the system. Our
measurements reveal that the most central regions of the BCG contain the lowest

traditional IR where the queries are short. Furthermore, we compile and release
two datasets based on the relationships between EU directives and UK
legislation. We experiment on these datasets using a typical two-step pipeline
approach comprising a pre-fetcher and a neural re-ranker. Experimenting with
various pre-fetchers from BM25 to k nearest neighbors over representations from
several BERT models, we show that fine-tuning a BERT model on an in-domain
classification task produces the best representations for IR. We also show that
neural re-rankers under-perform due to contradicting supervision, i.e., similar
query-document pairs with opposite labels. Thus, they are biased towards the
pre-fetcher's score. Interestingly, applying a date filter further improves the
performance, showcasing the importance of the time dimension.

are driving several industry sectors to take a proactive role in future
district heating and cooling networks in cities. For instance, supermarkets and
data centers have been assessing the reuse of waste heat as an extra source for
the district heating network, which would offset the additional investment in
heat pumps. This innovative business model requires complete deregulation of
the district heating market to allow industrial heat producers to provide waste
heat as an additional source in the district heating network. This work
proposes the application of innovative market designs for district heating
networks, inspired by new practices seen in the electricity sector. More
precisely, pool and market designs are addressed, comparing centralized and
decentralized market proposals. An illustrative case of a Nordic district
heating network is used to assess the performance of each market design, as
well as the potential revenue that different heat producers can obtain by
participating in the market. An important conclusion of this work is that the
proposed market designs are in line with the new trends, encouraging the
inclusion of new excess heat recovery players in district heating networks.

early-type dwarf galaxies in galaxy clusters. Venhola et al. analysed
correlations between colour and surface brightness for galaxies in the Fornax
cluster binned by luminosity or stellar mass. In the bins with $M_\star<10^8
{\rm M}_\odot$, the authors identified a correlation of redness with fainter
surface brightness and interpreted it as a consequence of the quenching of star
formation by ram pressure stripping in the dwarf galaxies. We carry out a
corresponding analysis for the Virgo cluster and find great similarities in
these correlations between surface brightness and colour for the two clusters,
despite expected differences in the strength of the ram pressure. Furthermore,
we extend the analysis to a wider range of optical colours for both clusters
and contrast the results with expectations for fading and reddening stellar
populations. Overall the slopes of the surface brightness-colour relations are
consistent with these models. In addition the sizes of the early- and late-type
galaxies at these low masses are comparable. These two results are compatible
with a transformation scenario. However, when analysing early- and late-type
galaxies separately, the consistency of the slope of the surface
brightness-colour relations with the model expectations for fading and
reddening stellar population applies only to the late types. The lack of this
imprint for the early-type dwarfs calls for some additional explanation, for
which we discuss several possibilities. Finally, the Virgo cluster is an
atypical cluster with a low fraction of quiescent early-type galaxies at all
galaxy masses despite its large cluster mass. (abridged)

model in the homogeneous network called 2SIH2R, in which there are both
spreader1(people who spread the rumor) and spreader2(people who spread the

mechanism to quantify the level of people's cognitive abilities and the

different methods: i) including co-tunneling processes, ii) using the
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism and iii) using the Feynman-Vernon

violate the bounds derived in the weak-coupling regime, providing us with clear
signatures of high order coherent processes visible in the thermal

the hypothesis that the radio bubbles/X-ray chimneys are the manifestation of
an energetic outflow driven by multiple core-collapsed supernovae in the
nuclear stellar disk, where numerous massive stars are known to be present. Our
simulations are run with different combinations of two main parameters, the
supernova birth rate and the strength of a global magnetic field being
vertically oriented with respect to the disk. The simulation results show that
a hot gas outflow can naturally form and acquire a vertically elongated shape
due to collimation by the magnetic pressure. In particular, the simulation with
an initial magnetic field strength of 80 $\mu$G and a supernova rate of 1
$kyr^{-1}$ can well reproduce the observed morphology, internal energy and
X-ray luminosity of the bubbles after an evolutionary time of 330 kyr. On the
other hand, a magnetic field strength of 200 $\mu$G gives rise to an overly
elongated outflow that is inconsistent with the observed bubbles. The
simulations also reveal that, inside the bubbles, mutual collisions between the
shock waves of individual supernovae produce dense filaments of locally
amplified magnetic field. Such filaments may account for a fraction of the

of a ploidy profile which allows us to formalize it in terms of a multiplicity
vector indexed by the species the dataset is comprised of. Using the framework
of a phylogenetic network, we present a closed formula for computing the hybrid
number (i.e. the minimal number of polyploidization events required to explain
a ploidy profile) of a large class of ploidy profiles. This formula relies on
the construction of a certain phylogenetic network from the simplification
sequence of a ploidy profile and the hybrid number of the ploidy profile with
which this construction is initialized. Both of them can be computed easily in
case the ploidy numbers that make up the ploidy profile are not too large. To
help illustrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it to a simplified
version of a publicly available Viola dataset.

cascaded multi-modal deep learning network (DNN), in the context of
self-driving cars. DNNs have achieved high performance in 3D object detection,
but they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These attacks have
been heavily investigated in the RGB image domain and more recently in the
point cloud domain, but rarely in both domains simultaneously - a gap to be
filled in this paper. We use a single 3D mesh and differentiable rendering to
explore how perturbing the mesh's geometry and texture can reduce the
robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks. We attack a prominent cascaded
multi-modal DNN, the Frustum-Pointnet model. Using the popular KITTI benchmark,
we showed that the proposed universal multi-modal attack was successful in
reducing the model's ability to detect a car by nearly 73%. This work can aid
in the understanding of what the cascaded RGB-point cloud DNN learns and its
vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

of the wide upper main sequence and main sequence turn-off observed in the

or a range of stellar rotation rates, or a combination of these two effects.
Comparing the observed CMD with Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic stellar
populations, we derive that the morphology of NGC1831 can be fully explained in
the context of the rotation velocity scenario, under the assumption of a
bimodal distribution for the rotating stars, with ~40% of stars being
slow-rotators ($\Omega$ / $\Omega_{crit}$ < 0.5) and the remaining ~ 60% being
fast rotators ($\Omega$ / $\Omega_{crit}$ > 0.9). We derive the dynamical
properties of the cluster, calculating the present cluster mass and escape
velocity, and predicting their past evolution starting at an age of 10 Myr. We
find that NGC1831 has an escape velocity $v_{esc}$ = 18.4 km/s, at an age of 10
Myr, above the previously suggested threshold of 15 km/s, below which the
cluster cannot retain the material needed to create second-generation stars.
These results, combined with those obtained from the CMD morphology analysis,
indicate that for the clusters whose morphology cannot be easily explained only
in the context of the rotation velocity scenario, the threshold limit should be
at least ~ 20 km/s.

knowledge supports not only reasoning about requirements dependencies, but also
various automated engineering tasks such as seamless derivation of test cases.
However, causality extraction from natural language is still an open research
challenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable
performance. We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two-step
problem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or
not. Second, we need to understand and extract their causal relations. At
present, though, we lack knowledge about the form and complexity of causality
in requirements, which is necessary to develop a suitable approach addressing
these two problems. We conduct an exploratory case study with 14,983 sentences
from 53 requirements documents originating from 18 different domains and shed
light on the form and complexity of causality in requirements. Based on our

This constitutes a first step towards causality extraction from NL

among other things, that causality is, in fact, a widely used linguistic
pattern to describe system behavior, as about a third of the analyzed sentences

mid-July 2018 with several faint rebrightenings afterwards. With a peak flux of
approximately 4 Crab in the \(20-50\) keV, energy range the source was
monitored across the electromagnetic spectrum with detections from radio to
hard X-ray frequencies. Using these multi-wavelength observations, we analyzed
quasi-simultaneous observations from 12 April, near the peak of the outburst
(\(\sim 23\) March). Spectral analysis of the hard X-rays found a \(kT_e \sim
30 \) keV and \( \tau \sim 2\) with a \texttt{CompTT} model, indicative of an
accreting black hole binary in the hard state. The flat/inverted radio spectrum
and the accretion disk winds seen at optical wavelengths are also consistent
with the hard state. Then we constructed a spectral energy distribution
spanning \(\sim 12\) orders of magnitude using modelling in \texttt{JetSeT}.
The model is composed of an irradiated disk with a Compton hump and a leptonic
jet with an acceleration region and a synchrotron-dominated cooling region.
\texttt{JetSeT} finds the spectrum is dominated by jet emission up to
approximately \(10^{14}\) Hz after which disk and coronal emission dominate.
The acceleration region has a magnetic field of \( B \sim 1.6 \times 10^4 \) G,
a cross section of \(R \sim 2.8 \times 10^{9} \) cm, and a flat radio spectral
shape naturally obtained from the synchroton cooling of the accelerated
electrons. The jet luminosity of \(> 8 \times 10^{37} \) erg/s (\(>
0.15L_{Edd}\)) compared to an accretion luminosity of \( \sim 6 \times
10^{37}\) erg/s, assuming a distance of 3 kpc. Because these two values are
comparable, it is possible the jet is powered predominately via accretion with
only a small contribution needed from the Blanford-Znajek mechanism from the
reportedly slowly spinning black hole.

compound of this class is Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ge, and its discovery is the result of
first principles theory combined with experimental synthesis and

among materials listed in the ICSD database. From ab-initio theory of the
defect free material it is predicted that the saturation magnetization is 1.71
T, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is 1.44 MJ/m$^3$, and the Curie
temperature is 700 K. Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ge samples were then synthesized and
characterised with respect to structure and magnetism. The crystal structure
was found to be the MgZn$_2$-type, with partial disorder of Co and Ge on the
crystallographic lattice sites. From magnetization measurements a saturation
polarization of 0.86 T at 10 K was detected, together with a uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of 1.18 MJ/m$^3$, and the Curie
temperature of $T_{\rm C}$ = 359 K. These magnetic properties make
Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ge a very promising material as a rare-earth free permanent magnet,
and since we can demonstrate that magnetism depends critically on the amount of
disorder of the Co and Ge atoms, a further improvement of the magnetism is
possible. From the theoretical works, a substitution of Ge by neighboring
elements suggest two other promising materials - Co$_3$Mn$_2$Al and
Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ga. We demonstrate here that the class of compounds based on
$T_3$Mn$_2$X (T = Co or alloys between Fe and Ni; X=Ge, Al or Ga) in the

accretion regime (i.e., $L_{\rm X}\lesssim 10^{36}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$), the
accretion flow in the inner region around the NS is expected to be existed in
the form of the hot accretion flow, e.g., the advection-dominated accretion
flow (ADAF) as that in black hole X-ray binaries. Following our previous
studies in Qiao $\&$ Liu 2020a and 2020b on the ADAF accretion around NSs, in
this paper, we investigate the radiative efficiency of NSs with an ADAF
accretion in detail, showing that the radiative efficiency of NSs with an ADAF
accretion is much lower than that of $\epsilon \sim {\dot M GM\over
R_{*}}/{\dot M c^2}\sim 0.2$ despite the existence of the hard surface. As a
result, given a X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ (e.g., between 0.5 and 10 keV),
$\dot M$ calculated by $\dot M=L_{\rm X}{R_{*}\over {GM}}$ is lower than the
real $\dot M$ calculated within the framework of the ADAF accretion. The real
$\dot M$ can be more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of
calculated by $\dot M=L_{\rm X}{R_{*}\over {GM}}$ with appropriate model
parameters. Finally, we discuss that if applicable, the model of ADAF accretion
around a NS can be applied to explain the observed millisecond X-ray pulsation
in some NS-LMXBs (such as PSR J1023+0038, XSS J12270-4859 and IGR J17379-3747)
at a lower X-ray luminosity of a few times of $10^{33}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$, since
at this X-ray luminosity the calculated $\dot M$ with the model of ADAF
accretion can be high enough to drive a fraction of the matter in the accretion
flow to be channelled onto the surface of the NS forming the X-ray pulsation.

to propagate the state-set ahead in time; and (2) an online estimation phase
consisting of a time update and a measurement update. It is assumed that known

that phase-locked, multimode phonon lasing can be established in a multimode

We find that the long-term frequency stability is significantly improved in the

a path towards highly stable ultra-compact oscillators, pulsed phonon lasing,

risk prediction models. We evaluate how framing affects model performance and
model learning in four different approaches previously applied in published
artificial-intelligence (AI) models.
  Setting and participants: We analysed structured secondary healthcare data
from 221,283 citizens from four Danish municipalities who were 18 years of age
or older.
  Results: The four models had similar population level performance (a mean
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 to 0.82), in
contrast to the mean average precision, which varied greatly from 0.007 to
0.385. Correspondingly, the percentage of missing values also varied between
framing approaches. The on-clinical-demand framing, which involved samples for
each time the clinicians made an early warning score assessment, showed the
lowest percentage of missing values among the vital sign parameters, and this
model was also able to learn more temporal dependencies than the others. The
Shapley additive explanations demonstrated opposing interpretations of SpO2 in
the prediction of sepsis as a consequence of differentially framed models.
  Conclusions: The profound consequences of framing mandate attention from
clinicians and AI developers, as the understanding and reporting of framing are
pivotal to the successful development and clinical implementation of future AI
technology. Model framing must reflect the expected clinical environment. The
importance of proper problem framing is by no means exclusive to sepsis
prediction and applies to most clinical risk prediction models.

small datasets are Active Learning and Transfer Learning. The former helps to
optimally use a limited budget to label new data. The latter uses large
pre-trained models as feature extractors and enables the design of complex,
non-linear models even on tiny datasets. Combining these two approaches is an
effective, state-of-the-art method when dealing with small datasets.
  In this paper, we share an intriguing observation: Namely, that the
combination of these techniques is particularly susceptible to a new kind of
data poisoning attack: By adding small adversarial noise on the input, it is
possible to create a collision in the output space of the transfer learner. As
a result, Active Learning algorithms no longer select the optimal instances,
but almost exclusively the ones injected by the attacker. This allows an
attacker to manipulate the active learner to select and include arbitrary
images into the data set, even against an overwhelming majority of unpoisoned
samples. We show that a model trained on such a poisoned dataset has a
significantly deteriorated performance, dropping from 86\% to 34\% test
accuracy. We evaluate this attack on both audio and image datasets and support
our findings empirically. To the best of our knowledge, this weakness has not

strong Coulomb repulsion in the superconductor is unknown, but of importance in
applications such as topological superconducting qubits and multi-channel

the singlet many-body state into a two-body state. It also breaks the
electron-hole energy symmetry of the excitations, which thereby lose their

TikTok, Weibo and YouTube). This dataset has been made available to the
research community. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 97.6% in

Zhu-Nakamura theory into the EGME, we are able to treat nonadiabatic passages
beyond the simple Landau-Zener approximation, along with corresponding
treatments of zero-point energy and tunnelling probability. To evaluate this
NA-EGME approach, we carried out detailed studies of the UV photodynamics of
the volatile organic compound C6-hydroperoxyaldehyde (C6-HPALD) using
on-the-fly ab initio molecular dynamics and trajectory surface hopping. For
this multi-chromophore molecule, we show that the EGME is able to
quantitatively capture important aspects of the dynamics, including kinetic
timescales, and diabatic trapping. Such an approach provides a promising and
efficient strategy for treating the long-time dynamics of photo-excited
molecules in regimes which are difficult to capture using atomistic on-the-fly

be classified in two different ways. One is in terms of the mirror Chern
number, an integer that counts the number of protected Dirac cones in the
Brillouin zone of high-symmetry surfaces. The other is via a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
index that distinguishes between systems that have a nonzero quantized orbital
magnetoelectric coupling (""axion-odd""), and those that do not (""axion-even"");
this classification can also be induced by other symmetries in the magnetic
point group, including time reversal and inversion. A systematic
characterization of the axion $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology has previously been
obtained by representing the valence states in terms of hybrid Wannier
functions localized along one chosen crystallographic direction, and inspecting
the associated Wannier band structure. Here we focus on mirror symmetry, and
extend that characterization to the mirror Chern number. We choose the
direction orthogonal to the mirror plane as the Wannierization direction, and
show that the mirror Chern number can be determined from the winding numbers of
the touching points between Wannier bands on mirror-invariant planes, and from
the Chern numbers of flat bands pinned to those planes. In this representation,
the relation between the mirror Chern number and the axion $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index
is readily established. The formalism is illustrated by means of $\textit{ab

tight-binding calculations for a toy model.

tremendous research attention for decades. Recent years, data-driven methods
with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are continuously pushing stereo
matching to new heights. However, data-driven methods require large amount of
training data, which is not an easy task for real stereo data due to the
annotation difficulties of per-pixel ground-truth disparity. Though synthetic
dataset is proposed to fill the gaps of large data demand, the fine-tuning on
real dataset is still needed due to the domain variances between synthetic data
and real data. In this paper, we found that in synthetic datasets,
close-to-real-scene texture rendering is a key factor to boost up stereo
matching performance, while close-to-real-scene 3D modeling is less important.
We then propose semi-synthetic, an effective and fast way to synthesize large
amount of data with close-to-real-scene texture to minimize the gap between
synthetic data and real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained with our proposed semi-synthetic datasets achieve significantly better
performance than with general synthetic datasets, especially on real data

end-to-end (E2E) training of deep networks usually suffers from high GPUs
memory footprint. This paper aims to address this problem by revisiting the
locally supervised learning, where a network is split into gradient-isolated
modules and trained with local supervision. We experimentally show that simply
training local modules with E2E loss tends to collapse task-relevant
information at early layers, and hence hurts the performance of the full model.
To avoid this issue, we propose an information propagation (InfoPro) loss,
which encourages local modules to preserve as much useful information as
possible, while progressively discard task-irrelevant information. As InfoPro
loss is difficult to compute in its original form, we derive a feasible upper
bound as a surrogate optimization objective, yielding a simple but effective
algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed method boils down to minimizing
the combination of a reconstruction loss and a normal cross-entropy/contrastive
term. Extensive empirical results on five datasets (i.e., CIFAR, SVHN, STL-10,
ImageNet and Cityscapes) validate that InfoPro is capable of achieving
competitive performance with less than 40% memory footprint compared to E2E
training, while allowing using training data with higher-resolution or larger
batch sizes under the same GPU memory constraint. Our method also enables
training local modules asynchronously for potential training acceleration. Code

fluctuations could effect the momentum spectrum of soft pions.
  We first formulate the appropriate stochastic hydrodynamic equations close to
the $O(4)$ critical point. Then, working in mean field, we determine the
correlation functions of the stress tensor and the currents which result from
this stochastic real time theory, and use these correlation functions to
determine the scaling behavior of the transport coefficients. The hydrodynamic
theory also describes the propagation of pion waves, fixing the scaling
behavior of the dispersion curve of soft pions. We present scaling functions
for the shear viscosity and the charge conductivities near the pseudo-critical
point, and estimate the absolute magnitude of the critical fluctuations to
these parameters and the bulk viscosity.
  Using the calculated pion dispersion curve, we estimate the expected critical
enhancement of soft pion yields, and this estimate provides a plausible
explanation for the excess seen in experiment relative to ordinary hydrodynamic

evidences suggesting the association of more massive black holes with
absorption line systems. Our results indicate a bi-modality of ld~in Eddington
units (ld/ledd) with broad line objects tend to have a higher accretion rate
(ld/ledd$>$0.01). We have found that ld/ledd and Compton dominance (CD, the
ratio of the inverse Compton to synchrotron peak luminosities) are positively
correlated at $>$5$\sigma$ confidence level, suggesting that the latter can be
used to reveal the state of accretion in blazars. Based on this result, we
propose a CD based classification scheme. Sources with CD$>$1 can be classified
as High-Compton Dominated or HCD blazars, whereas, that with CD$\lesssim$1 are
Low-Compton Dominated (LCD) objects. This scheme is analogous to that based on
the mass accretion rate proposed in the literature, however, it overcomes the
limitation imposed by the difficulty in measuring ld and mbh for objects with
quasi-featureless spectra. We conclude that the overall physical properties of

processes and by considering grain-surface chemistry, including grain
evaporation, thermal ionization of alkali metals, and thermionic emission from
grains. The ionization degree at nH ~ 1e15-1e19 /cm^3 becomes up to eight
orders of magnitude higher than that obtained in the previous model, owing to
the thermionic emission and thermal ionization of K and Na, which have been
neglected so far. Although magnetic fields dissipate owing to ambipolar
diffusion or Ohmic loss at nH < 1e15 /cm^3, the fields recover strong coupling
to the gas at nH ~ 1e15 /cm^3, which is lower by a few orders of magnitude

these results is the analysis of data which lie in Riemannian manifolds. Their
aim is to bring about general, meaningful, and applicable tools, which can be
used to model, and to learn from such ""Riemannian data"", as well as to analyse
the various algorithms which may be required in this kind of pursuit (for
sampling, optimisation, stochastic approximation, ...). The world of Riemannian
data and algorithms can be quite different from its Euclidean counterpart, and
this difference is the source of mathematical problems, addressed in my thesis.
The first chapter provides some taylor-made geometric constructions, to be used
in the thesis, while subsequent chapters (there are four more of them), address
a series of issues, which arise from unresolved challenges, in the recent
literature. A one-page guide, on how to read the thesis, is to be found right
after the table of contents.

identity management for User Equipment (UE) and RAN elements, and enable mutual
authentication to all entities while enabling on-demand point-to-point
communication with accountable billing service add-on on public network. Also,
a potential operating model with thorough decentralization of RAN is
envisioned. The paper also proposed a distributed privacy-preserving P2P
communication approach, as one of the core use cases for future mobile

network-based security and privacy management. The results show that BE-RAN
significantly improves communication and computation overheads compared to the

time-dependent ab-initio numerical computations are pursued encompassing the
generation, propagation, and dissipation of waves. We consider longitudinal
waves operating among arrays of flux tubes as well as acoustic waves pertaining
to nonmagnetic stellar regions. Additionally, flux enhancements for the
longitudinal waves are also taken into account as supplied by transverse tube
waves. The Ca II K fluxes are computed (multi-ray treatment) assuming partial
redistribution as well as time-dependent ionization. The self-consistent
treatment of time-dependent ionization (especially for hydrogen) greatly
impacts the atmospheric temperatures and electron densities (especially behind
the shocks); it also affects the emergent Ca II fluxes. Particularly, we focus
on the influence of magnetic heating on the stellar atmospheric structure and
the emergent Ca II emission, as well as the impact of nonlinearities. Our study
shows that a higher photospheric magnetic filling factor entails a larger Ca II
emission; however, an increased initial wave energy flux (e.g., associated with
mode coupling) is of little difference. Comparisons of our theoretical results
with observations will be conveyed in forthcoming Paper II.

radial distribution and mass-loss rate can shed light on the structure
formation in galaxies. To further investigate the evolutionary path of these
galaxies, we construct their star formation history (SFH) using the LPV stars,
which are at the final stages of their evolution and therefore experience

especially within the context of hierarchical models. Besides having a large
impact on the star formation history, mergers are also able to influence gas
motions at the centre of galaxies and trigger an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).
In this paper, we present a case study of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 2992, which
together with NGC 2993 forms the early-stage merger system Arp 245. Using
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) integral field unit (IFU) data from the
inner 1.1 kpc of the galaxy we were able to spatially resolve the stellar
populations, the ionisation mechanism and kinematics of ionised gas. From full
spectral synthesis, we found that the stellar population is primarily composed
by old metal-rich stars (t $\geq$ 1.4 Gyr, $Z \geq 2.0$\zsun), with a
contribution of at most 30 per cent of the light from a young and metal-poor
population (t $\leq$ 100 Myr, $Z \leq 1.0$\zsun). We detect \halpha and \hbeta
emission from the Broad Line Region (BLR) with a Full Width at Half Maximum
(FWHM) of $\sim$ 2000\kms. The Narrow Line Region (NLR) kinematics presents two
main components: one from gas orbiting the galaxy disk and a blueshifted
(velocity $\approx$ -200\kms) outflow, possibly correlated with the radio
emission, with mass outflow rate of $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a
kinematic power of $\sim$ 2 $\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (\Eout/\Lbol
$\approx$ 0.2 per cent). We also show even though the main ionisation mechanism
is the AGN radiation, ionisation by young stars and shocks may also contribute
to the emission line ratios presented in the innermost region of the galaxy.

case of inpainting and denoising, even when no clean training data is
available. In particular, we show how neural networks can be trained to perform
all of these tasks simultaneously. While, deep autoencoders implemented by way
of neural networks have demonstrated potential for denoising and anomaly
detection, standard autoencoders have the drawback that they require access to
clean data for training. However, recent work in Robust Deep Autoencoders
(RDAEs) shows how autoencoders can be trained to eliminate outliers and noise
in a dataset without access to any clean training data. Inspired by this work,
we extend RDAEs to the case where data are not only noisy and have outliers,
but also only partially observed. Moreover, the dataset we train the neural
network on has the properties that all entries have noise, some entries are
corrupted by large mistakes, and many entries are not even known. Given such an
algorithm, many standard tasks, such as denoising, image inpainting, and
unobserved entry imputation can all be accomplished simultaneously within the
same framework. Herein we demonstrate these techniques on standard machine
learning tasks, such as image inpainting and denoising for the MNIST and
CIFAR10 datasets. However, these approaches are not only applicable to image
processing problems, but also have wide ranging impacts on datasets arising
from real-world problems, such as manufacturing and network processing, where
noisy, partially observed data naturally arise.

believed that only the disruption of a binary system by a supermassive black
hole at the Galactic center (GC), that is, the so-called Hills mechanism, is
capable of accelerating stars to beyond the Galactic escape velocity. In the
meantime, however, driven by the Gaia space mission, there is mounting evidence
that many of the most extreme high-velocity early-type stars at high Galactic
latitudes do originate in the Galactic disk and not in the GC. Moreover, the
ejection velocities of these extreme disk-runaway stars exceed the predicted
limits of the classical scenarios for the production of runaway stars. Based on
proper motions from the Gaia early data release 3 and on recent and new
spectrophotometric distances, we studied the kinematics of 30 such extreme
disk-runaway stars, allowing us to deduce their spatial origins in and their
ejection velocities from the Galactic disk with unprecedented precision. Only
three stars in the sample have past trajectories that are consistent with an
origin in the GC, most notably S5-HVS1, which is the most extreme object in the
sample by far. All other program stars are shown to be disk runaways with
ejection velocities that sharply contrast at least with classical ejection
scenarios. They include HVS5 and HVS6, which are both gravitationally unbound
to the Milky Way. While most stars originate from within a galactocentric
radius of 15kpc, which corresponds to the observed extent of the spiral arms, a
group of five stars stems from radii of about 21-29kpc. This indicates a
possible link to outer Galactic rings and a potential origin from infalling
satellite galaxies.

their inability to control the size of the test, and their power properties. By
contrast, the USP test is guaranteed to control the size of the test at the
nominal level for all sample sizes, has no issues with small (or zero) cell
counts, and is able to detect distributions that violate independence in only a
minimal way. The test statistic is derived from a $U$-statistic estimator of a
natural population measure of dependence, and we prove that this is the unique
minimum variance unbiased estimator of this population quantity. The practical
utility of the USP test is demonstrated on both simulated data, where its power

nonthermal or fast electrons causes to reduce the possibility for the formation
of the subsonic SWs, and thus convert subsonic SWs into supersonic ones. It is

problematic, in that they signal a breakdown in the theory. We address the
question of how to interpret this breakdown, restricting our attention to
classical considerations (though our work has ramifications for more general
classical metric theories of gravity, as well). In particular, we argue for a
new claim: spacetime singularities in general relativity signal indeterminism.
  The usual manner in which indeterminism is formulated for physical theories
can be traced back to Laplace. This formulation is based on the non-uniqueness
of future (or past) states of a physical system -- as understood in the context
of a physical theory -- as a result of the specification of an antecedent state
(or, respectively, of a subsequent state). We contend that for physical
theories generally, this formulation does not comprehensively capture the
relevant sense of a lack of determination. And, in particular, it does not
comprehensively capture the sense(s) in which a lack of determination (and so,
indeterminism) arises due to spacetime singularities in general relativity.
  We thus present a novel, broader formulation, in which indeterminism in the
context of some physical theory arises whenever one of the three following
conditions holds: future (and/or past) states are (i) not unique -- as for
Laplacian notions of indeterminism; (ii) not specified; or (iii) `incoherent'
-- that is, they fail to satisfy certain desiderata that are internal to the
theory and/or imposed from outside the theory. We apply this formulation to
salient features of singularities in general relativity and show that this
broader sense of indeterminism can comprehensively account for (our
interpretation of) the breakdown signaled by their occurrence.

documents, i.e., we wish to solve evaluation tasks directly on the compressed
data, without decompression. As compressed forms of the documents we use
straight-line programs (SLPs) -- a lossless compression scheme for textual data
widely used in different areas of theoretical computer science and particularly
well-suited for algorithmics on compressed data. In terms of data complexity,
our results are as follows. For a regular spanner M and an SLP S that
represents a document D, we can solve the tasks of model checking and of
checking non-emptiness in time O(size(S)). Computing the set M(D) of all
span-tuples extracted from D can be done in time O(size(S) size(M(D))), and
enumeration of M(D) can be done with linear preprocessing O(size(S)) and a
delay of O(depth(S)), where depth(S) is the depth of S's derivation tree. Note
that size(S) can be exponentially smaller than the document's size |D|; and,
due to known balancing results for SLPs, we can always assume that depth(S) =
O(log(|D|)) independent of D's compressibility. Hence, our enumeration
algorithm has a delay logarithmic in the size of the non-compressed data and a
preprocessing time that is at best (i.e., in the case of highly compressible
documents) also logarithmic, but at worst still linear. Therefore, in a
big-data perspective, our enumeration algorithm for SLP-compressed documents
may nevertheless beat the known linear preprocessing and constant delay
algorithms for non-compressed documents.

on the BDI (birth and death with immigration) process. We showed that random
processes defined by this model can capture the essence of the stochastic,
often erratic, behavior of the infection process. The most significant finding
was that it is negative binomial distributed with small r, hence it is
geometrically distributed with an exceedingly long tail. This leads to a much
larger disparity in the epidemic patterns than has been known to the modeling
community. In Part 2 we conduct simulation experiments by implementing an
event-driven simulator. Several independent runs are presented to verify the
findings reported in Part 1. The enormous variations among the sample paths
obtained from several consecutive and independent runs with statistically
identical conditions confirm our analysis. Note that the epidemic pattern that
we observe is merely one sample path taken out of infinitely many paths. Thus,
one such path cannot represent the ensemble of the underlying random process.
By plotting the simulation runs in the semi-log scale, we can see that the
probabilistic chances in the early phase of the infection process determine the
behavior of the process. Once the process has reached a considerable number,
the weak law of large numbers sets in, and the process behaves less erratically
than in the early phase. One important implication of our findings is that it
would be a futile effort to attempt to identify all plausible causes of the
epidemic patterns. Mere luck may play a more significant role than most people
believe. It would be worth remarking that the BDI process might be applicable
to explain the disparity in wealth among individuals of similar earning power,
expenditure, and investment portfolio.

metabolic information. One challenge of 1H-MRS is the low Signal-Noise Ratio
(SNR). To improve the SNR, a typical approach is to perform Signal Averaging
(SA) with M repeated samples. The data acquisition time, however, is increased
by M times accordingly, and a complete clinical MRS scan takes approximately 10
minutes at a common setting M=128. Recently, deep learning has been introduced
to improve the SNR but most of them use the simulated data as the training set.
This may hinder the MRS applications since some potential differences, such as
acquisition system imperfections, and physiological and psychologic conditions
may exist between the simulated and in vivo data. Here, we proposed a new
scheme that purely used the repeated samples of realistic data. A deep learning
model, Refusion Long Short-Term Memory (ReLSTM), was designed to learn the
mapping from the low SNR time-domain data (24 SA) to the high SNR one (128 SA).
Experiments on the in vivo brain spectra of 7 healthy subjects, 2 brain tumor
patients and 1 cerebral infarction patient showed that only using 20% repeated
samples, the denoised spectra by ReLSTM could provide comparable estimated
concentrations of metabolites to 128 SA. Compared with the state-of-the-art
low-rank denoising method, the ReLSTM achieved the lower relative error and the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds in quantifying some important biomarkers. In summary,
ReLSTM can perform high-fidelity denoising of the spectra under fast

(1) word categorization, (2) phrase allocation, and (3) document

from an input document to word multi-labels to phrase allocations, and uses
statistical median to map phrase allocation to document multi-label. We compute
variable length segment coloring from overlapping phrase allocation
probabilities. These cross-level bidirectional contextual links identify
adaptive context and then produce segment coloring. We train and evaluate MSC
using the document labeled MIMIC-III clinical notes. Training is conducted
solely using document multi-labels without any information on phrases,
segments, or words. In addition to coloring a clinical note, MSC generates as
byproducts document multi-labeling and word tagging -- creation of ICD9
category keyword lists based on segment coloring. Performance comparison of MSC

justifiable document multi-labels is 64% vs 52.4% micro-average F1-score

state-of-the-art black-box models post-hoc model-independent explanation
techniques are an established solution. Popular and effective techniques, such
as IME, LIME, and SHAP, use perturbation of instance features to explain
individual predictions. Recently, Slack et al. (2020) put their robustness into

perturbation sampling employed. This weakness would allow dieselgate type
cheating of owners of sensitive models who could deceive inspection and hide
potentially unethical or illegal biases existing in their predictive models.
This could undermine public trust in machine learning models and give rise to
legal restrictions on their use.
  We show that better sampling in these explanation methods prevents malicious
manipulations. The proposed sampling uses data generators that learn the

takes advantage of the fact that the blades on a turbine are nominally

frequencies of the blades. The GPs are used to predict the edge frequencies of
one blade given that of another, after these relationships between the pairs of
blades have been learned when the blades are in a healthy state. In using this
approach, the proposed SHM methodology is able to identify when the blades
start behaving differently from one another over time. To validate the concept,
the proposed SHM system is applied to real onshore wind turbine blade data,
where some form of damage was known to have taken place. X-bar control chart
analysis of the residual errors between the GP predictions and actual
frequencies show that the system successfully identified early onset of damage
as early as six months before it was identified and remedied.

water in convective ion transport. The full model (including water) and the
electrodiffusion model (excluding water) are compared in detail to reveal an
interesting interplay between water and ion transport. In the full model,
convection due to water flow dominates inside the glial domain. This water flow
in the glia contributes significantly to the spatial buffering of potassium in
the extracellular space. Convection in the extracellular domain does not
contribute significantly to spatial buffering. Electrodiffusion is the dominant
mechanism for flows confined to the extracellular domain.

a massive giant planet. A Bayesian analysis shows that the system most likely
consists of a host star with a mass $M_{\rm h} = 0.09^{+0.14}_{-0.05}M_{\odot}$
and a massive giant planet with a mass $M_{\rm p} = 7.70^{+11.34}_{-3.90}M_{\rm

having $M_{\rm p} < 13 M_{\rm Jup}$) rests entirely on the Bayesian analysis.
Motivated by this event, we conduct an investigation to determine which
constraints meaningfully affect Bayesian analyses for microlensing events. We
find that the masses inferred from such a Bayesian analysis are determined
almost entirely by the measured value of $\theta_{\rm E}$ and are relatively
insensitive to other factors such as the direction of the event $(\ell, b)$,
the lens-source relative proper motion $\mu_{\rm rel}$, or the specific

Methods used to ensure the numerical robustness of $f_\mathrm{xc}$ are set out.
The frequency dependence of $f_\text{xc}$ is found to be due largely to its
analytic structure, i.e. its singularities at certain frequencies, which are
required in order to capture particular transitions, including those of double
excitation character. However, within the frequency range of the first few
interacting excitations, $f_\mathrm{xc}$ is approximately frequency
independent, meaning the exact adiabatic approximation $f_\mathrm{xc}(\omega =
0)$ remedies the failings of the local density approximation and random phase
approximation for these lowest transitions. The key differences between the
exact $f_\mathrm{xc}$ and its common approximations are analyzed, and cannot be
eliminated by exploiting the limited gauge freedom in $f_\mathrm{xc}$. The
optical spectrum benefits from using as accurate as possible an $f_\mathrm{xc}$

the two is of less importance.

experienced a great deal of uncertainty around the UK's continued relationship
with the EU. Many people have used social media platforms to express their
emotions about this critical event. Sentiment analysis has been recently
considered as an important tool for detecting mental well-being in Twitter
contents. However, detecting the psychological distress status in
political-related tweets is a challenging task due to the lack of explicit
sentences describing the depressive or anxiety status. To address this problem,
this paper leverages a transfer learning approach for sentiment analysis to
measure the non-clinical psychological distress status in Brexit tweets. The
framework transfers the knowledge learnt from self-reported psychological
distress tweets (source domain) to detect the distress status in Brexit tweets
(target domain). The framework applies a domain adaptation technique to
decrease the impact of negative transfer between source and target domains. The
paper also introduces a Brexit distress index that can be used to detect levels
of psychological distress of individuals in Brexit tweets. We design an
experiment that includes data from both domains. The proposed model is able to
detect the non-clinical psychological distress status in Brexit tweets with an
accuracy of 66% and 62% on the source and target domains, respectively.

syntactic. Italian lexical gemination is contrastive, so that two words may
differ by only one geminated consonant. In contrast, syntactic gemination
occurs across word boundaries, and affects the initial consonant of a word in
specific contexts, such as the presence of a monosyllabic morpheme before the
word. This study investigates the acoustic correlates of Italian lexical and
syntactic gemination, asking if the correlates for the two types are similar in
the case of stop consonants. Results confirmed previous studies showing that
duration is a prominent gemination cue, with a lengthened consonant closure and
a shortened pre-consonant vowel for both types. Results also revealed the
presence, in about 10-12% of instances, of a double stop-release burst,
providing strong support for the biphonematic nature of Italian geminated stop
consonants. Moreover, the timing of these bursts suggests a different planning
process for lexical vs. syntactic geminates. The second burst, when present, is
accommodated within the closure interval in syntactic geminates, while lexical
geminates are lengthened by the extra burst. This suggests that syntactic
gemination occurs during a post-lexical phase of production planning, after
timing has already been established.

which the gravitational metric emerges from a noncommutative U(1)-theory.
Topological T-duality, on the other hand, is a relation between two a priori
different backgrounds (with different geometries, different fluxes and even
topologically distinct manifolds) which nevertheless behave identically from a
physical point of view. For us these backgrounds are principal torus bundles on
the same base manifold. In this article we review how these theories can be
naturally understood in the light of generalized geometry. Generalized geometry
provides an unifying framework for such a systematic approach and gives rise to
the group of Courant automorphism $Diff(M) \ltimes \Omega_{closed}^{2}(M)$ for
the $TM \oplus T^*M$ bundle. Here we propose a novel geometric construction for
the T-dual of an emergent gravity theory implemented between the
$\mathbb{T}$-bundles and this duality is realized using the
Gualtieri-Cavalcanti map that establishes an isomorphism between Courant
algebroids. In the case of flat spacetime we obtain that, under mild
assumptions, the T-dual of emergent gravity is again an emergent theory of
gravity. In the general case we obtained formulas for the T-dual of an emergent
metric in a $\mathbb{T}^2$-fibration, however due to the appearance of H-flux
after T-dualizing, the theory thus obtained can no longer be considered in the
usual framework of emergent gravity. This motivates the study of emergent
gravity with non trivial H-flux.

  Application in Massive MIMO",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new neural network (NN) structure, multi-mode
reservoir computing (Multi-Mode RC). It inherits the dynamic mechanism of RC
and processes the forward path and loss optimization of the NN using tensor as
the underlying data format. Multi-Mode RC exhibits less complexity compared
with conventional RC structures (e.g. single-mode RC) with comparable
generalization performance. Furthermore, we introduce an alternating least
square-based learning algorithm for Multi-Mode RC as well as conduct the
associated theoretical analysis. The result can be utilized to guide the
configuration of NN parameters to sufficiently circumvent over-fitting issues.
As a key application, we consider the symbol detection task in
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems with massive MIMO
employed at the base stations (BSs). Thanks to the tensor structure of massive
MIMO-OFDM signals, our online learning-based symbol detection method
generalizes well in terms of bit error rate even using a limited online
training set. Evaluation results suggest that the Multi-Mode RC-based learning
framework can efficiently and effectively combat practical constraints of
wireless systems (i.e. channel state information (CSI) errors and hardware
non-linearity) to enable robust and adaptive learning-based communications over
the air.

vision. Most methods require customized extremum point schemes to obtain the
coordinates of feature points with high confidence, which often need complex
algorithmic design or a network with higher training difficulty and also ignore
the possibility that flat regions can be used as candidate regions of matching
points. In this paper, we design a region-based descriptor by combining the
context features of a deep network. The new descriptor can give a robust
representation of a point even in flat regions. By the new descriptor, we can
obtain more high confidence matching points without extremum operation. The
experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a performance
comparable to state-of-the-art.

  Metasurfaces",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have been widely applied
in various electromagnetic, optical, and quantum systems. A tailored OAM
spectrum composed of several specific modes as expected holds a promise for
expanding the degrees of freedom of the systems. However, such a broadband
high-purity tailored spectrum is difficult to be achieved by the present
devices, where the broadband amplitude manipulation has not been explored yet.
In this work, inspired by the envelope-modulation theory, an elegant and
universal way to manipulate the OAM spectrum in wide bandwidth is proposed by
using a shape-tailored metasurface. Firstly, the rotating meta-atoms on a
triangular lattice are proved to have smaller coupling distortion than that on
a square lattice, and this behavior is critical for high-purity vortex spectrum
generation by the Pancharatnam-Berry-based metasurfaces. Secondly, a universal
modulation relation is established between the spatial arrangement of
metasurfaces and the generated vortex beams. Finally, the broadband modulated
OAM spectra and the comb-like OAM spectra are theoretically and experimentally
demonstrated by the shape-tailored metasurfaces. The proposed
amplitude-modulation scheme offers a novel concept and engineering route to
manipulate the OAM spectrum in wide bandwidth, which could promote the
development of OAM-based applications.

geophysical transitions in the inner solar system planetary bodies in
association with volcanism. From a simple rocky planet thermal evolution model,
we could infer critical surface heat flux values during peak phases (~1.2 W/m2)
and cessation phases (~ 0.092 W/m2) of major volcanism in Earth, Moon, Mars,
Venus and Mercury. The above phases of volcanism are accompanied by significant
geophysical transitions like growth and decay of global planetary magnetic
fields which is likely to be related to systematic changes in core-mantle
boundary heat flux values. The above results suggest the that planets are
possibly self-organised physical systems with strong core-mantle-crust coupling
. The present study will have implications on the search for habitable
extrasolar planets.
