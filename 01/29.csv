area in neuroscience and provides a potential brain-reading technology. The
challenge lies in that visual encoding in brain is highly complex and not fully
revealed. Inspired by the theory that visual features are hierarchically
represented in cortex, we propose to break the complex visual signals into
multi-level components and decode each component separately. Specifically, we
decode shape and semantic representations from the lower and higher visual
cortex respectively, and merge the shape and semantic information to images by
a generative adversarial network (Shape-Semantic GAN). This 'divide and
conquer' strategy captures visual information more accurately. Experiments
demonstrate that Shape-Semantic GAN improves the reconstruction similarity and
image quality, and achieves the state-of-the-art image reconstruction
performance.

sensitive to the possibility and severity of rare harmful outcomes. We define
risk-sensitive safe sets as sub-level sets of the solution to a non-standard
optimal control problem, where a random maximum cost is assessed via
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). The objective function represents the maximum
extent of constraint violation of the state trajectory, averaged over a given
percentage of worst cases. This problem is well-motivated but difficult to
solve tractably because the temporal decomposition for CVaR is
history-dependent. Our primary theoretical contribution is to derive
computationally tractable under-approximations to risk-sensitive safe sets. Our
method provides a novel, theoretically guaranteed, parameter-dependent upper
bound to the CVaR of a maximum cost without the need to augment the state
space. For a fixed parameter value, the solution to only one Markov decision
process problem is required to obtain the under-approximations for any family
of risk-sensitivity levels. In addition, we propose a second definition for
risk-sensitive safe sets and provide a tractable method for their estimation
without using a parameter-dependent upper bound. The second definition is
expressed in terms of a new coherent risk functional, which is inspired by
CVaR. We demonstrate our primary theoretical contribution via numerical

Recent work has proposed models of editing processes, but these mostly focus on

we present a generic model for incremental editing of structured data (i.e.,

learns to iteratively generate tree edits (e.g., deleting or adding a subtree)

process can be formulated as consecutive, incremental tree transformations. To
show the unique benefits of modeling tree edits directly, we further propose a
novel edit encoder for learning to represent edits, as well as an imitation
learning method that allows the editor to be more robust. We evaluate our
proposed editor on two source code edit datasets, where results show that, with
the proposed edit encoder, our editor significantly improves accuracy over
previous approaches that generate the edited program directly in one pass.
Finally, we demonstrate that training our editor to imitate experts and correct

metasurface to reflect the signal from the source node to the destination node
without consuming any energy. Not only the spectral efficiency but also the
energy efficiency can be improved through RIS. Essentially, RIS can be
considered as a passive relay between the source and destination node. On the
other hand, a relay node in a traditional relay network has to be active, which
indicates that it will consume energy when it is relaying the signal or
information between the source and destination nodes. In this paper, we compare
the performances between RIS and active relay for a general multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system. To make the comparison fair and comprehensive,
both the performances of RIS and active relay are optimized with best-effort.
In terms of the RIS, transmit beamforming and reflecting coefficient at the RIS
are jointly optimized so as to maximize the end-to-end throughput. Although the
optimization problem is non-convex, it is transformed equivalently to a
weighted mean-square error (MSE) minimization problem and an alternating
optimization problem is proposed, which can ensure the convergence to a
stationary point. In terms of active relay, both half duplex relay (HDR) and
full duplex relay (FDR) are considered. End-to-end throughput is maximized via
an alternating optimization method. Numerical results are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, comparisons
between RIS and relays are investigated from the perspective of system model,
performance, deployment and controlling method.

technique called persistent homology to TL.
  In this paper, we examine the use of persistent homology in a domain
adversarial (DAd) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The
experiments show that aligning persistence alone is insufficient for transfer,
but must be considered along with the lifetimes of the topological
singularities. In addition, we found that longer lifetimes indicate robust
discriminative features and more favorable structure in data. We found that
existing divergence minimization based approaches to DA improve the topological
structure, as indicated over a baseline without these regularization
techniques. We hope these experiments highlight how topological structure can
be leveraged to boost performance in TL tasks.

processes, along with the elastic scattering response of glass-forming (GF)
liquids and the Boson peak, in a simulated Al-Sm GF material exhibiting a
fragile-strong (FS) transition. These dynamical processes are universal in
'ordinary' GF fluids and collectively describe their 'fast dynamics', and we
find these relaxation processes also arise in a GF liquid exhibiting a
fragile-strong transition. String-like particle motion, having both an
irreversible and reversible nature ('stringlets') component, occurs in the
fast-dynamics regime, corresponding to a ps timescale. String-like collective
motion associated with localized unstable modes facilitate irreversible and
intermittent particle 'jumping' events at long times associated with the JG
$\beta$-relaxation process, while stringlets associated with localized stable
modes and corresponding perfectly reversible atomic motion give rise to the
Boson peak. To further clarify the origin of the Boson peak, we calculate the
density of states for both the stringlet particles and the 'normal' particles
and find that the stringlet particles give rise to a Boson peak while the
normal atoms do not. The growth of stringlets upon heating ultimately also
leads to the 'softening' of these excitations, and the Boson peak frequency and
shear modulus drop in concert with this softening. The growth of string-like
collective motion upon heating in the fast-dynamics regime is further shown to
be responsible for the growth in the intensity of the fast relaxation process.
Relaxation in cooled liquids clearly involves a hierarchy of relaxation
processes acting on rather different time and spatial scales.

approximations that, for huge sparse feature sets, diminish the theoretical
advantages, must be used. Often, they apply stochastic gradient methods with
hyper-parameters that must be tuned on some surrogate loss, defeating
theoretical advantages of Bayesian methods. The surrogate loss, defined to
approximate the mixture, requires techniques as Monte Carlo sampling,
increasing computations per example. We propose low complexity analytical

variational inference and other methods, our methods use analytical closed

Mixtures, our methods allow for sparse problems with huge feature sets without
increasing complexity. With the analytical closed forms, there is also no need

release-acquire (RA) semantics. It has been shown that the problem is
intractable for systems with unlimited access to atomic compare-and-swap (CAS)
instructions. We show that, from a verification perspective where approximate
results help, this is overly pessimistic. We study parameterized systems
consisting of an unbounded number of environment threads executing identical
but CAS-free programs and a fixed number of distinguished threads that are
unrestricted.
  Our first contribution is a new semantics that considerably simplifies RA but
is still equivalent for the above systems as far as safety verification is
concerned. We apply this (general) result to two subclasses of our model. We
show that safety verification is only \pspace-complete for the bounded model
checking problem where the distinguished threads are loop-free. Interestingly,
we can still afford the unbounded environment. We show that the complexity
jumps to \nexp-complete for thread-modular verification where an unrestricted
distinguished `ego' thread interacts with an environment of CAS-free threads
plus loop-free distinguished threads (as in the earlier setting). Besides the
usefulness for verification, the results are strong in that they delineate the
tractability border for an established semantics.

  2020",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When an individual's DNA is sequenced, sensitive medical information becomes
available to the sequencing laboratory. A recently proposed way to hide an
individual's genetic information is to mix in DNA samples of other individuals.
We assume these samples are known to the individual but unknown to the
sequencing laboratory. Thus, these DNA samples act as ""noise"" to the sequencing
laboratory, but still allow the individual to recover their own DNA samples
afterward. Motivated by this idea, we study the problem of hiding a binary
random variable X (a genetic marker) with the additive noise provided by mixing
DNA samples, using mutual information as a privacy metric. This is equivalent
to the problem of finding a worst-case noise distribution for recovering X from
the noisy observation among a set of feasible discrete distributions. We
characterize upper and lower bounds to the solution of this problem, which are
empirically shown to be very close. The lower bound is obtained through a
convex relaxation of the original discrete optimization problem, and yields a
closed-form expression. The upper bound is computed via a greedy algorithm for
selecting the mixing proportions.

foundation, whose dimensionless stiffness is reduced from $1$ to $k$ as the
beam deflection increases. Periodic equilibrium solutions are found
analytically and are in good agreement with a numerical resolution, suggesting
that localized buckling does not appear for a finite beam. The equilibrium
paths may exhibit a limit point whose existence is related to the imperfection
size and the stiffness parameter $k$ through an explicit condition. The limit
point decreases with the imperfection size while it increases with the
stiffness parameter. We show that the decay/growth rate is sensitive to the
restoring force model. The analytical results on the limit load may be of

ingest. Input pipelines for machine learning jobs are often challenging to
implement efficiently as they require reading large volumes of data, applying
complex transformations, and transferring data to hardware accelerators while
overlapping computation and communication to achieve optimal performance. We
present tf.data, a framework for building and executing efficient input
pipelines for machine learning jobs. The tf.data API provides operators which
can be parameterized with user-defined computation, composed, and reused across
different machine learning domains. These abstractions allow users to focus on
the application logic of data processing, while tf.data's runtime ensures that
pipelines run efficiently.
  We demonstrate that input pipeline performance is critical to the end-to-end
training time of state-of-the-art machine learning models. tf.data delivers the
high performance required, while avoiding the need for manual tuning of
performance knobs. We show that tf.data features, such as parallelism, caching,
static optimizations, and non-deterministic execution are essential for high
performance. Finally, we characterize machine learning input pipelines for
millions of jobs that ran in Google's fleet, showing that input data processing
is highly diverse and consumes a significant fraction of job resources. Our
analysis motivates future research directions, such as sharing computation
across jobs and pushing data projection to the storage layer.

(EM-PIC) is a problem that is well worn, in that methods developed have been
used extensively both understanding physics and exploiting them for device
design. EM-PIC tools have largely relied on finite difference methods coupled
with particle representations of the distribution function. Refinements to
ensure consistency and charge conservation have largely been an ad-hoc efforts
specific to finite difference methods. Meanwhile, solution methods for field
solver have grown by leaps and bounds with significant performance metrics
compared to finite difference methods. Developing new EM-PIC computational
schemes that leverage modern field solver technology means re-examining
analysis framework necessary for self-consistent EM-PIC solution. In this
paper, we prescribe general rubrics for charge conservation, demonstrate how
these are satisfied in conventional finite difference PIC as well as finite
element PIC, and prescribe a novel charge conserving finite element PIC. Our
effort leverages proper mappings on to de-Rham sequences and lays a groundwork
for understanding conditions that must be satisfied for consistency. Several
numerical results demonstrate the applicability of these rubrics.

Large Magellanic Cloud's (LMC) galactic wind. By combining new Wisconsin
H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) observations ($I_{\rm H\alpha}\gtrsim10~{\rm mR}$) with
existing \hicm\ emission observations, we have (1) mapped the LMC's near-side
galactic wind over a local standard of rest (LSR) velocity range of $+50\le\rm
v_{LSR}\le+250~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, (2) determined its morphology and
extent, and (3) estimated its mass, outflow rate, and mass-loading factor. We
observe \ha\ emission from this wind to typically 1-degree off the LMC's \hi\
disk. Kinematically, we find that the diffuse gas in the warm-ionized phase of
this wind persists at both low ($\lesssim100~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) and high
($\gtrsim100~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) velocities, relative to the LMC's \hi\
disk. Furthermore, we find that the high-velocity component spatially aligns
with the most intense star-forming region, 30~Doradus. We, therefore, conclude
that this high-velocity material traces an active outflow. We estimate the mass
of the warm ($T_e\approx10^4~\rm K$) ionized phase of the near-side LMC outflow
to be $\log{\left(M_{\rm ionized}/M_\odot\right)=7.51\pm0.15}$ for the combined
low and high velocity components. Assuming an ionization fraction of 75\% and
that the wind is symmetrical about the LMC disk, we estimate that its total
(neutral and ionized) mass is $\log{\left(M_{\rm total}/M_\odot\right)=7.93}$,
its mass-flow rate is $\dot{M}_{\rm outflow}\approx1.43~M_\odot~\rm yr^{-1}$,
and its mass-loading factor is $\eta\approx4.54$. Our average mass-loading
factor results are roughly a factor of 2.5 larger than previous \ha\ imaging
and UV~absorption line studies, suggesting that those studies are missing
nearly half the gas in the outflows.

(GWB) using data from Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run
(O3) combined with upper limits from the earlier O1 and O2 runs. Unlike in
previous observing runs in the advanced detector era, we include Virgo in the
search for the GWB. The results are consistent with uncorrelated noise, and
therefore we place upper limits on the strength of the GWB. We find that the
dimensionless energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW}\leq 5.8\times 10^{-9}$ at the 95%
credible level for a flat (frequency-independent) GWB, using a prior which is
uniform in the log of the strength of the GWB, with 99% of the sensitivity
coming from the band 20-76.6 Hz; $\leq 3.4 \times 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz for a
power-law GWB with a spectral index of 2/3 (consistent with expectations for
compact binary coalescences), in the band 20-90.6 Hz; and $\leq 3.9 \times
10^{-10}$ at 25 Hz for a spectral index of 3, in the band 20-291.6 Hz. These
upper limits improve over our previous results by a factor of 6.0 for a flat
GWB. We also search for a GWB arising from scalar and vector modes, which are
predicted by alternative theories of gravity; we place upper limits on the
strength of GWBs with these polarizations. We demonstrate that there is no
evidence of correlated noise of magnetic origin by performing a Bayesian
analysis that allows for the presence of both a GWB and an effective magnetic
background arising from geophysical Schumann resonances. We compare our upper
limits to a fiducial model for the GWB from the merger of compact binaries.
Finally, we combine our results with observations of individual mergers andshow
that, at design sensitivity, this joint approach may yield stronger constraints
on the merger rate of binary black holes at $z \lesssim 2$ than can be achieved
with individually resolved mergers alone. [abridged]

supersymmetric particle (NLSP) and gravitino/axino is the lightest
superysmmetric particle (LSP). For a bino mass less than or around hundred GeV,
it can be pair produced at the future lepton colliders through $t-$channel
slepton exchange, subsequently decaying into a gravitino/axino plus a photon.
We study the prospects to look for such binos at the future colliders and find
that a bino mass around 100 GeV can be probed at the $2\sigma$ ($5\sigma$)
level for a slepton below 2 TeV (1.5 TeV) with a luminosity 3 $ab^{-1}$. For a
bino mass around 10 GeV, a slepton mass less than 4 TeV (3 TeV) can be probed
at the $2\sigma$ ($5\sigma$) level, which is much beyond the reach of the LHC
for direct slepton searches.

repeating sinusoidal imperfection in the line of a strut on a nonlinear elastic
Winkler type foundation. The imperfection is introduced by considering an
initially deformed shape which is a sine function with an half wavelength. The
restoring force is either a bi-linear or an exponential profile. Periodic
solutions of the equilibrium problem are found using three different
approaches: a semi-analytical method, an explicit solution of a Galerkin method
and a direct numerical resolution. These methods are found in very good
agreement and show the existence of a maximum imperfection size which leads to
a limit point in the equilibrium curve of the system. The existence of this
limit point is very important since it governs the appearance of localization
phenomena.
  Using the Galerkin method, we then establish an exact formula for this
maximum imperfection size and we show that it does not depend on the choice of
the restoring force. We also show that this method provides a better estimate
with respect to previous publications. The decrease of the maximum compressive
force supported by the beam as a function of the imperfection magnitude is also
determined. We show that the leading term of the development has a different
exponent than in subcritical buckling of elastic systems, and that the exponent
values depend on the choice of the restoring force.

rectangular pad anode structures are frequently employed with micro-pattern gas
detectors to reconstruct high precision space points for various tracking
applications. The particle impact point is typically determined by
interpolating the charge collected by several neighboring pads. However, to
effectively extract the inherent positional information, the lateral spacing of
the straight pads must be significantly smaller than the extent of the charge
cloud. In contrast, highly interleaved anode patterns, such as zigzags, can
adequately sample the charge with a pitch comparable to the size of the charge
cloud or even larger. This has the considerable advantage of providing the same
performance while requiring far fewer instrumented channels. Additionally, the
geometric parameters defining such zigzag structures may be tuned to provide a
uniform detector response without the need for so-called pad response
functions, while simultaneously maintaining excellent position resolution. We
have measured the position resolution of a variety of zigzag shaped anode
patterns optimized for various MPGDs, including GEM, Micromegas, and
micro-RWELL and compared this performance to the same detectors equipped with
straight pads of varying pitch. We report on the performance results of each
readout structure, evaluated under identical conditions in a test beam.

evolve inside the produced hot and dense quark gluon plasma, offering unique
opportunities to study QCD splitting processes in different backgrounds.
Induced (modified) splittings are expected to be the most relevant mechanism
driving the modifications of in-medium jets compared to vacuum jets for a wide
sets of observables. Although color coherence among different emitters has been
identified as an essential mechanism in studies of the {\it QCD antenna
radiation}, it is usually neglected in the multi-gluon medium-induced cascade.
This independent gluon emission approximation can be analytically proved to be
valid in the limit of very large media, but corrections or modifications to it
have not been computed before in the context of the evolution (or rate)
equation describing the gluon cascade. We propose a modified evolution equation
that includes corrections due to the interference of subsequent emitters. In
order to do so, we first compute a modified splitting kernel following the
usual procedure of factorizing it from the subsequent Brownian motion. The
calculation is performed in the two-gluon configuration with no overlapping
formation times, that is expected to provide the first correction to the
completely independent picture.

  Systems (AAMAS 2021)",,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Continual learning aims to provide intelligent agents capable of learning
multiple tasks sequentially with neural networks. One of its main challenging,
catastrophic forgetting, is caused by the neural networks non-optimal ability
to learn in non-stationary distributions. In most settings of the current
approaches, the agent starts from randomly initialized parameters and is
optimized to master the current task regardless of the usefulness of the
learned representation for future tasks. Moreover, each of the future tasks
uses all the previously learned knowledge although parts of this knowledge
might not be helpful for its learning. These cause interference among tasks,
especially when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this paper, we
propose a new method, named Self-Attention Meta-Learner (SAM), which learns a
prior knowledge for continual learning that permits learning a sequence of
tasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. SAM incorporates an attention
mechanism that learns to select the particular relevant representation for each
future task. Each task builds a specific representation branch on top of the
selected knowledge, avoiding the interference between tasks. We evaluate the
proposed method on the Split CIFAR-10/100 and Split MNIST benchmarks in the
task agnostic inference. We empirically show that we can achieve a better
performance than several state-of-the-art methods for continual learning by
building on the top of selected representation learned by SAM. We also show the
role of the meta-attention mechanism in boosting informative features
corresponding to the input data and identifying the correct target in the task
agnostic inference. Finally, we demonstrate that popular existing continual

precisely the types of sources targeted by previous radial velocity (RV)

correct period and phase matching the transiting planetary candidate with a
false alarm probability of less than 1 percent. After further checks, we
exploit this fact to validate HD 183579b (TOI-1055b). This planet is less than

advancing the TESS primary objective of finding 50 such worlds. We find that
this planet is amongst the most accessible small transiting planets for
atmospheric characterization. Our work highlights that the efforts to confirm

not always depend on acquiring new observations - that in some instances these

neutrals by electron impact is the major source of far-ultraviolet (FUV)
emissions at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in the southern hemisphere at
large heliocentric distances, both during quiet conditions and impacts of
corotating interaction regions observed in the summer of 2016.
  Methods. We combined multiple datasets from the Rosetta mission through a
multi-instrument analysis to complete the first forward modelling of FUV
emissions in the southern hemisphere of comet 67P and compared modelled
brightnesses to observations with the Alice FUV imaging spectrograph. We
modelled the brightness of OI1356, OI1304, Lyman-$\beta$, CI1657, and CII1335
emissions, which are associated with the dissociation products of the four
major neutral species in the coma: CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO, and O$_2$. The
suprathermal electron population was probed by RPC/IES and the neutral column
density was constrained by several instruments: ROSINA, MIRO and VIRTIS.
  Results. The modelled and observed brightnesses of the FUV emission lines
agree closely when viewing nadir and dissociative excitation by electron impact
is shown to be the dominant source of emissions away from perihelion. The
CII1335 emissions are shown to be consistent with the volume mixing ratio of CO
derived from ROSINA. When viewing the limb during the impacts of corotating
interaction regions, the model reproduces brightnesses of OI1356 and CI1657
well, but resonance scattering in the extended coma may contribute
significantly to the observed Lyman-$\beta$ and OI1304 emissions. The
correlation between variations in the suprathermal electron flux and the
observed FUV line brightnesses when viewing the comet's limb suggests electrons
are accelerated on large scales and that they originate in the solar wind. This
means that the FUV emissions are auroral in nature.

partially ordered, in the sense that infinite-range correlations of some spin

discovery of quantum spin systems which mix ordered and spin liquid-like

(SDC) if there exists a basis under which each of the quadratic forms is

related but weaker notions of simultaneous diagonalizability. Specifically, we
say that a set of quadratic forms is almost SDC (ASDC) if it is the limit of
SDC sets and d-restricted SDC (d-RSDC) if it is the restriction of an SDC set
in up to d-many additional dimensions. Our main contributions are a complete
characterization of the ASDC pairs and the nonsingular ASDC triples, as well as
a sufficient condition for the 1-RSDC property for pairs of quadratic forms.
Surprisingly, we show that every singular pair is ASDC and that almost every
pair is 1-RSDC.
  We accompany our theoretical results with preliminary numerical experiments

low cost in local processing time, are the first to achieve optimal levels of

function to be computed. Through direct algebraic approaches, we separate the
communication complexity of secure computing from the computational complexity
of the function to be computed. We examine security under both the modern
approach of computational complexity-based cryptography and the classical
approach of unconditional, information-theoretic security. We [...] support
formal proofs of claims to security, addressing an important deficiency in the
literature. Our protocols are provably secure. In the realm of
information-theoretic security, we characterize those functions which two
parties can compute jointly with absolute privacy. We also characterize those
functions which a weak processor can compute using the aid of powerful
processors without having to reveal the instances of the problem it would like

and motion information for each object in the scene. This memory is utilized
for finding matches between tracks and detections and is updated based on the
matching result. Many approaches model each target in isolation and lack the
ability to use all the targets in the scene to jointly update the memory. This
can be problematic when there are similar looking objects in the scene. In this
paper, we solve the problem of simultaneously considering all tracks during
memory updating, with only a small spatial overhead, via a novel multi-track
pooling module. We additionally propose a training strategy adapted to
multi-track pooling which generates hard tracking episodes online. We show that
the combination of these innovations results in a strong discriminative
appearance model, enabling the use of greedy data association to achieve online
tracking performance. Our experiments demonstrate real-time, state-of-the-art
performance on public multi-object tracking (MOT) datasets.

using chordal distance (CD) decomposition to obtain the balanced precoding,

that for perfect IA precoder. Moreover, energy constraints can be achieved,
while maintaining a constant rate loss without losing DoFs via tuning the CD
value and splitting factor. Simulation results verify the analysis and add that
the IA schemes based on max-SINR or mean-squared error are better suited for
SWIPT maximization than subspace or leakage minimization methods.

hosts one of the largest giant radio halos which are observed in most of the
merging clusters, and a candidate radio relic. Recently, three merger shock
fronts were detected in this cluster, explaining its extreme temperature and
complex structure. Furthermore, previous XMM-Newton and Chandra observations
hinted at the presence of a shock front that is associated with the gas
`bullet' crossing the main cluster in the west-ward direction, and which heated
the intra-cluster medium, leading to adiabatic compression of the gas behind
the 'bullet'. The goal of this paper is to report on the detection of this
shock front as revealed by the temperature discontinuity in the X-ray
XMM-Newton image, and the edge in the Very Large Array (VLA) radio image. We
also report on the detection of a relic source in the north-eastern region of
the radio halo in the KAT-7 data, confirming the presence of an extended relic
in this cluster. The brightness edge in the X-rays corresponds to a shock front
with a Mach number $M= 2.2\pm0.3$, at a distance of 0.2 Mpc from the cluster
centre. An estimate from the luminosity jump gives $M=1.9\pm0.4$. We consider a
simple explanation for the electrons at the shock front, and for the observed
discrepancy between the average spectral index of the radio halo emission and
that predicted by the $M=2.2$ shock which precedes the 'bullet'.

the fluidisation of a sessile drop of yield-stress fluid on a pre-existing
layer of the same fluid under vertical sinusoidal oscillations. We compare the
behaviours of molten chocolate and Carbopol which are both shear-thinning with
a similar yield stress but exhibit very different elastic properties. We find
that these materials spread when the forcing acceleration exceeds a threshold
which is determined by the initial deposition process. However, they exhibit
very different spreading behaviours: whereas chocolate exhibits slow long-term
spreading, the Carbopol drop rapidly relaxes its stress by spreading to a new
equilibrium shape with an enlarged footprint. This spreading is insensitive to
the history of the forcing. In addition, the Carbopol drop performs
large-amplitude oscillations with the forcing frequency, both above and below
the threshold. We investigate these viscoelastic oscillations and provide
evidence of complex nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour in the vicinity of the
spreading threshold. In fact, for forcing accelerations greater than the
spreading threshold, our drop automatically adjusts its shape to remain at the
yield stress. We discuss how our vibrated-drop experiment offers a new and
powerful approach to probing the yield transition in elastoviscoplastic fluids.

construct a general formalism that allows to compute the set of lag parameters
that may lead to any phase configuration within a linear approximation. In
particular, we devote special attention to the cases of full synchronization
and symmetric configurations. We show that the set of natural frequencies,
phase lag parameters and phases at the steady state is coupled by an equation
and a continuous spectra of solutions is feasible. In order to quantify the
system's strain to achieve that particular configuration, we define a cost
function and compute the optimal set of parameters that minimizes it. Despite
considering a linear approximation of the model, we show that the obtained
tuned parameters for the case of full synchronization enhance frequency
synchronization in the nonlinear model as well.

entity and event mentions with a FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) parser. It
subsequently performs coreference resolution, fine-grained entity typing, and
temporal relation prediction between events. By doing so, the system constructs
an event and entity focused knowledge graph. We can further apply third-party
modules for other types of annotation, like relation extraction. Our
(multilingual) first-party modules either outperform or are competitive with
the (monolingual) state-of-the-art. We achieve this through the use of
multilingual encoders like XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and leveraging
multilingual training data. LOME is available as a Docker container on Docker
Hub. In addition, a lightweight version of the system is accessible as a web
demo.

Barrett and Soham De","On the Origin of Implicit Regularization in Stochastic Gradient Descent","Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For infinitesimal learning rates, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) follows
the path of gradient flow on the full batch loss function. However moderately
large learning rates can achieve higher test accuracies, and this
generalization benefit is not explained by convergence bounds, since the
learning rate which maximizes test accuracy is often larger than the learning
rate which minimizes training loss. To interpret this phenomenon we prove that
for SGD with random shuffling, the mean SGD iterate also stays close to the
path of gradient flow if the learning rate is small and finite, but on a
modified loss. This modified loss is composed of the original loss function and
an implicit regularizer, which penalizes the norms of the minibatch gradients.
Under mild assumptions, when the batch size is small the scale of the implicit
regularization term is proportional to the ratio of the learning rate to the
batch size. We verify empirically that explicitly including the implicit
regularizer in the loss can enhance the test accuracy when the learning rate is
small.

publications. First, I investigate the distributions of the indexed literature
at various levels (research domains, countries, languages, open access).
Articles make up nearly all the documents indexed with a share of 99% of ARCI.
The Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences fields have the highest concentration
of publications. Most indexed journals are published in Egypt, Algeria, Iraq,
Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. About 8% of publications in ARCI are published in
languages other than Arabic. Second, I use an unsupervised machine learning
model, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), and the text mining algorithm of
VOSviewer to uncover the main topics in ARCI. These methods provide a better
understanding of ARCI's thematic structure. Next, I discuss how ARCI can
complement global standards in the context of a more inclusive research

challenging problem in the nonparametric function estimation. In this paper, we
propose the LABS (L\'{e}vy Adaptive B-Spline regression) model, an extension of
the LARK models, for the estimation of functions with varying degrees of
smoothness. LABS model is a LARK with B-spline bases as generating kernels. The
B-spline basis consists of piecewise k degree polynomials with k-1 continuous
derivatives and can express systematically functions with varying degrees of
smoothness. By changing the orders of the B-spline basis, LABS can
systematically adapt the smoothness of functions, i.e., jump discontinuities,
sharp peaks, etc. Results of simulation studies and real data examples support
that this model catches not only smooth areas but also jumps and sharp peaks of
functions. The proposed model also has the best performance in almost all
examples. Finally, we provide theoretical results that the mean function for
the LABS model belongs to the certain Besov spaces based on the orders of the
B-spline basis and that the prior of the model has the full support on the
Besov spaces.

only possible way in the case of beam-dump) is to simulate it in the framework
of the program for tracing particles in the experimental setup. One of the most
popular such programs is Geant4.
  Specifically, the package includes the processes of DM particles production
via electron and muon bremsstrahlung off nuclei, resonant in-flight positron
annihilation on atomic electrons and gamma to ALP (axion-like particles)
conversion on nuclei. Four types of DM mediator particles are considered:
vector, scalar, pseudoscalar and axial vector.
  In particular, for bremsstrahlung the total cross sections are calculated at
exact tree level (ETL). The code handles both the case of invisible DM mediator
decay and of visible decay into $e^+e^-$ (or into $\gamma \gamma$ in the case
of ALP).
  The software consists of a collection of different classes, inheriting from
the Geant4 framework classes, thus the expected use of this package is to
include it in a Geant4-based code for the simulation of particles propagation
and interaction in the detector.
  As an example of its usage, we discuss the results obtained from the
simulation of a typical active beam-dump experiment, considering $5 \times

thick target, showing the expected sensitivity for the four types of DM

review different QEs, and clarify their differences. In particular, we show
that the Hu-Okamoto (HO02) estimator is not the absolute optimal lensing
estimator that can be constructed out of quadratic combinations of $T, E$ and
$B$ fields. Instead, we derive the global-minimum-variance (GMV) lensing
quadratic estimator. Although this estimator can be found elsewhere in the
literature, it was erroneously described as equivalent to the HO02 estimator,
and has never been used in real data analyses. Here, we show explicitly that
the HO02 estimator is suboptimal to the GMV estimator, with a reconstruction
noise larger by up to $\sim 9\%$ for a SO-like experiment. We further show that
the QE used in the Planck, and recent SPT lensing analysis are suboptimal to
both the HO02 and GMV estimator, and would have a reconstruction noise up to
$\sim 11\%$ larger than that of the GMV estimator for a SO-like experiment. In
addition to clarifying differences between different QEs, this work should thus
provide motivation to implement the GMV estimator in future lensing analyses
relying on QEs.

which describe compact objects in the presence of a non-minimally coupled
scalar field to the Einstein tensor. These objects are black holes with scalar
hair and wormholes supporting scalar phantom matter. The evolution of test
fields in fixed asymptotically-flat backgrounds of exotic compact objects leads
to the formation of echoes in the ringdown signal, which designate the
existence of trapping regions close to the event horizon. Here, we consider
minimally-coupled test scalar fields propagating on compact object solutions of
the Horndeski action, which possess an effective cosmological constant, leading
to anti-de Sitter asymptotics, and show that echoes can form in the ringdown
waveform due to the entrapment of test fields between the photon sphere and the
effective asymptotic boundary. Although the presence of an event horizon leads
to the usual echoes with decaying amplitude, signifying modal stability of the
scalarized black hole considered, we find that test scalar fields propagating
on a scalarized wormhole solution give rise to echoes of constant and equal
amplitude to that of the initial ringdown, indicating the existence of normal
modes. Finally, we find that, near extremality, the test field exhibits a
concatenation of echoes; the primary ones are associated with the trapping
region between the photon sphere and the effective anti-de Sitter boundary
while the secondary ones are linked to the existence of a potential well at the
throat of the wormhole.

compile a catalog of 1114 Ophiuchus YSOs from the literature and crossmatch it
with the Gaia EDR3, Gaia-ESO and APOGEE-2 surveys. We apply a multivariate
classification algorithm to this catalog to identify new, co-moving population

EDR3 catalog belonging to the $\rho$ Oph region. The new sources appear to be
mainly Class III M-stars and substellar objects and are less extincted than the
known members. We find 28 previously unknown sources with disks. The analysis
of the proper motion distribution of the entire sample reveals a well-defined
bimodality, implying two distinct populations sharing a similar 3D volume. The
first population comprises young stars' clusters around the $\rho$ Ophiuchi
star and the main Ophiuchus clouds (L1688, L1689, L1709). In contrast, the
second population is older ($\sim$ 10 Myr), dispersed, has a distinct proper
motion, and is possibly from the Upper Sco group. The two populations are
moving away from each other at about 4.1 km/s, and will no longer overlap in
about 4 Myr. Finally, we flag 17 sources in the literature as impostors, which
are sources that exhibit large deviations from the average distance and proper
motion properties of the $\rho$ Oph population. Our results show the importance
of accurate 3D space and motion information for improved stellar population

gravitational potential in which they orbit and detailed observations of their
density structure can be used to place stringent constraints on fluctuations in
the potential caused by, e.g., the expected populations of dark matter subhalos
in the standard cold dark matter paradigm (CDM). Simulations of the evolution
of stellar streams in live $N$-body halos without low-mass dark-matter
subhalos, however, indicate that streams exhibit significant perturbations on
small scales even in the absence of substructure. Here we demonstrate, using
high-resolution $N$-body simulations combined with sophisticated semi-analytic
and simple analytic models, that the mass resolutions of
$10^4$--$10^5\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ commonly used to perform such simulations cause
spurious stream density variations with a similar magnitude on large scales as
those expected from a CDM-like subhalo population and an order of magnitude
larger on small, yet observable, scales. We estimate that mass resolutions of
$\approx100\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ ($\approx1\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$) are necessary for
spurious, numerical density variations to be well below the CDM subhalo
expectation on large (small) scales. That streams are sensitive to a
simulation's particle mass down to such small masses indicates that streams are
sensitive to dark matter clustering down to these low masses if a significant
fraction of the dark matter is clustered or concentrated in this way, for
example, in MACHO models with masses of $10$--$100\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$.

measurement of electrical and optical responses of 2D semiconductor-metal

optical properties of this buried interface with < 20 nm resolution. To be
specific, potential, conductance and photoluminescence at the buried
metal/MoS$_2$ interface are correlated as a function of a variety of metal
deposition conditions as well as the type of metal contacts. We observe that
direct evaporation of Au on MoS$_2$ induces a large strain of ~5% in the
MoS$_2$ which, coupled with charge transfer, leads to degenerate doping of the
MoS$_2$ underneath the contact. These factors lead to improvement of contact
resistance to record values of 138 kohm-um, as measured using local conductance
probes. This approach was adopted to characterize MoS$_2$-In/Au alloy

the federated learning (FL) framework in supervised learning. It is inspired by
practical applications in cognitive radio and recommender systems, and enjoys
features that are analogous to FL. This paper proposes a general framework of
FMAB and then studies two specific federated bandit models. We first study the
approximate model where the heterogeneous local models are random realizations
of the global model from an unknown distribution. This model introduces a new
uncertainty of client sampling, as the global model may not be reliably learned
even if the finite local models are perfectly known. Furthermore, this
uncertainty cannot be quantified a priori without knowledge of the
suboptimality gap. We solve the approximate model by proposing Federated Double
UCB (Fed2-UCB), which constructs a novel ""double UCB"" principle accounting for
uncertainties from both arm and client sampling. We show that gradually
admitting new clients is critical in achieving an O(log(T)) regret while
explicitly considering the communication cost. The exact model, where the
global bandit model is the exact average of heterogeneous local models, is then
studied as a special case. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the
order-optimal regret can be achieved independent of the number of clients with
a careful choice of the update periodicity. Experiments using both synthetic

the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Prospector Bayesian inference framework. The previous offsets of 0.2-1dex
between observed and simulated main sequence normalizations are resolved when
using the updated masses and SFRs from Prospector. The scatter is generically
smaller in TNG50 than in 3D-HST for more massive galaxies with M_*>10^10Msun,
even after accounting for observational uncertainties. When comparing resolved
star formation, we also find good agreement between TNG50 and 3D-HST: average
specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles of galaxies at all masses
and radii below, on, and above the SFMS are similar in both normalization and
shape. Most noteworthy, massive galaxies with M_*>10^10.5Msun, which have
fallen below the SFMS due to ongoing quenching, exhibit a clear central SFR
suppression, in both TNG50 and 3D-HST. In TNG this inside-out quenching is due
to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback model operating at low accretion
rates. In contrast, the original Illustris simulation, without this same
physical SMBH mechanism, does not reproduce the central SFR profile suppression
seen in data. The observed sSFR profiles provide support for the TNG quenching

M31-like hosts in TNG50, the final instalment in the IllustrisTNG suite of
cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations. MW/M31-like analogues are
defined as disky galaxies with stellar masses of Mstar = 10^10.5-11.2 Msun in
relative isolation at z = 0. By defining satellites as galaxies with Mstar >
5*10^6 Msun within 300 kpc (3D) of their host, we find a remarkable level of
diversity and host-to-host scatter across individual host galaxies. The median
(16th - 84th percentiles) TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxy hosts a total of 5 (2-11)
satellites with Mstar > 5*10^6 Msun, reaching up to Mstar ~ 10^8.5 Msun
(10^7.4-9.4 Msun). The abundance of subhaloes with Mdyn > 5*10^7 Msun is larger
by a factor of more than 10. The number of all satellites (subhaloes) ever
accreted is larger by a factor of 4-5 (3-5) than those surviving to z = 0.
Hosts with larger galaxy stellar mass, brighter K-band luminosity, larger total
halo mass, and more recent halo assembly typically have a larger number of
surviving satellites. The satellite abundances around TNG50 MW/M31-like
galaxies are consistent with similar hosts from observational surveys (e.g.
SAGA) and previous simulations (e.g. Latte). While the observed MW satellite
system falls within the TNG50 scatter across all stellar masses considered, M31
is slightly more satellite-rich than our 1 sigma scatter, possibly due to
volume and mass limitations. We find a handful of systems with both a Large and
a Small Magellanic Cloud-like satellite. There is no missing satellites problem
with TNG50.

is first dominated by in-situ star formation, and subsequently by accretion. We
analyse the radial distribution of the accreted stellar mass in ~500 galaxies
from the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum. Generally, we find
good agreement with other simulations in that higher mass galaxies have larger
accreted fractions, but we predict higher accretion fractions for low-mass
galaxies. Based on the radial distribution of the accreted and in-situ
components, we define 6 galaxy classes, from completely accretion dominated to
completely in-situ dominated, and measure the transition radii between in-situ
and accretion-dominated regions for galaxies that have such a transition. About
70% of our galaxies have one transition radius. However, we also find about 10%
of the galaxies to be accretion dominated everywhere, and about 13% to have two
transition radii, with the centre and the outskirts both being accretion
dominated. We show that these classes are strongly correlated with the galaxy
merger histories, especially with the mergers' cold gas fractions. We find high
total in-situ (low accretion) fractions to be associated with smaller, lower
mass galaxies, lower central dark matter fractions, and larger transition
radii. Finally, we show that the dips in observed surface brightness profiles
seen in many early-type galaxies do not correspond to the transition from
in-situ to accretion-dominated regions, and any inferred mass fractions are not
indicative of the true accreted mass. Instead, these dips contain information
about the galaxies' dry minor merger assembly history.

integral field unit (IFU) data from Gemini-North. We focus on the dwarf galaxy
J1220+3020, which shows no clear optical AGN signatures in its nuclear SDSS
spectrum covering the radio source. With our new IFU data, we confirm the
presence of an active BH via the AGN coronal line [Fe X] and enhanced [O I]
emission coincident with the radio source. Furthermore, we detect broad
H$\alpha$ emission and estimate a BH mass of $M_{\rm BH}=10^{4.9}M_\odot$. We
compare the narrow emission line ratios to standard BPT diagnostics and shock
models. Spatially-resolved BPT diagrams show some AGN signatures, particularly
in [O I]/H$\alpha$, but overall do not unambiguously identify the AGN. A
comparison of our data to shock models clearly indicates shocked emission
surrounding the AGN. The physical model most consistent with the data is an
active BH with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) that both
photoionizes and shock-excites the surrounding gas. We conclude that feedback
is important in radio-selected BHs in dwarf galaxies, and that radio surveys
may probe a population of low accretion-rate BHs in dwarf galaxies that cannot
be detected through optical surveys alone.

of the TNG50 simulation and measure the dust-continuum half-light radius of the
modeled galaxies, assuming a Milky Way dust type and a metallicity dependent
dust-to-metal ratio. The dust-continuum half-light radius at observed-frame 850
$\mu$m is up to $\sim$75 per cent larger than the stellar half-mass radius, but
significantly more compact than the observed-frame 1.6 $\mu$m (roughly
corresponding to H-band) half-light radius, particularly towards high
redshifts: the compactness compared to the 1.6 $\mu$m emission increases with
redshift. This is driven by obscuration of stellar light from the galaxy
centres, which increases the apparent extent of 1.6 $\mu$m disk sizes relative
to that at 850 $\mu$m. The difference in relative extents increases with
redshift because the observed-frame 1.6 $\mu$m emission stems from ever shorter
wavelength stellar emission. These results suggest that the compact
dust-continuum emission observed in $z>1$ galaxies is not (necessarily)
evidence of the buildup of a dense central stellar component. We also find that
the dust-continuum half-light radius very closely follows the radius containing
half the star formation in galaxies, indicating that single band dust-continuum
emission is a good tracer of the location of (obscured) star formation. The
dust-continuum emission is more compact than the H2 mass (for galaxies at
$z\geq 2$) and the underlying dust mass. The dust emission strongly correlates
with locations with the highest dust temperatures, which do not need to be the
locations where most H$_2$ and/or dust is located. The presented results are a
common feature of main-sequence galaxies.

each other by performing best in different parameter regimes. The
$\tt{Estimate}$ algorithm produces an additive precision estimate of the Born
rule probability of a chosen measurement outcome with the only source of
run-time inefficiency being a linear dependence on the stabilizer extent (which
scales like $\approx 1.17^t$ for $T$ gates). Our algorithm is state-of-the-art
for this task: as an example, in approximately $13$ hours (on a standard
desktop computer), we estimated the Born rule probability to within an additive
error of $0.03$, for a $50$-qubit, $60$ non-Clifford gate quantum circuit with
more than $2000$ Clifford gates. Our second algorithm, $\tt{Compute}$,
calculates the probability of a chosen measurement outcome to machine precision
with run-time $O(2^{t-r} t)$ where $r$ is an efficiently computable,
circuit-specific quantity. With high probability, $r$ is very close to $\min
\{t, n-w\}$ for random circuits with many Clifford gates, where $w$ is the
number of measured qubits. $\tt{Compute}$ can be effective in surprisingly
challenging parameter regimes, e.g., we can randomly sample Clifford+$T$
circuits with $n=55$, $w=5$, $c=10^5$ and $t=80$ $T$ gates, and then compute
the Born rule probability with a run-time consistently less than $10$ minutes

galaxies ($M_{*}=10^{7-10}M_{\odot}$) from the TNG50 run of the IllustrisTNG
suite across a vast range of environments. The key factors determining the
dwarfs' SFHs are their status as central or satellite and their stellar mass,
with centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later
times on average compared to satellites and lower mass dwarfs. The satellites
(in hosts of total mass $M_{200c,\,host}=10^{12-14.3}M_{\odot}$) assembled 90%
of their z=0 stellar mass ~$7.0_{-5.5}^{+3.3}$ Gyr ago, while the centrals did
so only ~$1.0_{-0.5}^{+4.0}$ Gyr ago. TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs
for both centrals and satellites, so that the stacked cumulative SFHs are
representative of the TNG50 dwarf populations only in an average sense and
individual dwarfs can have significantly different cumulative SFHs. Satellite
dwarfs with the highest stellar mass to host mass ratios have the latest
stellar mass assembly. Satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass, found
closer to the cluster centre, or accreted at earlier times, show significantly
earlier stellar mass assembly. These trends, as well as the shapes of the SFHs
themselves, are a manifestation of the varying proportions within a given
subsample of quenched vs. star-forming galaxies, which exhibit markedly
distinct SFH shapes. We also find a subtle effect whereby satellite dwarfs in
the most massive hosts at z=0 have higher SFRs at early times, well before
final infall into their z=0 host, compared to a control sample of centrals
mass-matched at the time of accretion. This suggests that the large-scale
environment can have a mild effect even on future satellites by providing the
conditions for enhanced SF at early epochs. Our results are useful theoretical

diagram of the closed system, giving rise to a special class of
dissipation-induced phase transitions. Such transitions take the system out of
its ground state and stabilize a higher-energy stationary state, rendering it
the sole attractor of the dissipative dynamics. In this work, we present a
unifying methodology, which we use to characterize this ubiquitous
phenomenology and its implications for the open system dynamics. Specifically,
we analyze the closed system's phase diagram, including symmetry-broken phases,
and explore their corresponding excitations' spectra. Opening the system, the
environment can overwhelm the system's symmetry-breaking tendencies, and
changes its order parameter. As a result, isolated distinct phases of similar
order become connected, and new phase-costability regions appear.
Interestingly, the excitations differ in the newly-connected regions through a
change in their symplectic norm, which is robust to the introduction of
dissipation. As a result, by tuning the system from one phase to the other
across the dissipation-stabilized region, the open system fluctuations exhibit
an exceptional point-like scenario, where the fluctuations become overdamped,
only to reappear with an opposite sign in the dynamical response function of
the system. The overdamped region is also associated with squeezing of the
fluctuations. We demonstrate the pervasive nature of such dissipation-induced
phenomena in two prominent examples, namely in parametric resonators and in
light-matter systems. Our work draws a crucial distinction between quantum
phase transitions and their zero-temperature open system counterparts.

given by the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, though there are proposed
generalizations of its symmetry algebra. Associated with each symmetry is a
charge and a flux, and the values of these charges and their changes can
characterize a spacetime. The charges of the BMS group are relativistic angular
momentum and supermomentum (which includes 4-momentum); the extensions of the
BMS algebra also include generalizations of angular momentum called ""super
angular momentum."" Several different formalisms have been used to define
angular momentum, and they produce nonequivalent expressions for the charge. It
was shown recently that these definitions can be summarized in a two-parameter
family of angular momenta, which we investigate in this paper. We find that
requiring that the angular momentum vanishes in flat spacetime restricts the
two parameters to be equal. If we do not require that the angular momentum
agrees with a common Hamiltonian definition, then we are left with a
one-parameter family of angular momenta that includes the definitions from the
several different formalisms. We then also propose a similar two-parameter
family of super angular momentum. We examine the effect of the free parameters
on the values of the angular momentum and super angular momentum from
nonprecessing binary-black-hole mergers. The definitions of angular momentum
differ at a high post-Newtonian order for these systems, but only when the
system is radiating gravitational waves. The different super-angular-momentum
definitions occur at lower orders, and there is a difference in the change of
super angular momentum even after the gravitational waves pass, which arises
because of the gravitational-wave memory effect. We estimate the size of these
effects using numerical-relativity surrogate waveforms and find they are small
but resolvable.

We investigate what happens to oscillatory features during the process of
nonlinear structure formation. We show that at the level of the power spectrum,
oscillations are smoothed out by nonlinear mode coupling, gradually
disappearing towards lower redshifts. In the halo mass function, however, the
same oscillations remain visible until the present epoch. As a consequence,
dark acoustic oscillations could be detectable in observations that are either
based on the halo mass function or on the high-redshift power spectrum. We
investigate the effect of such oscillations on different observables, namely,
the cluster mass function, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, and the
Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum. We find that dark acoustic oscillations
remain visible in all of these observables, but they are very extended and of
low amplitude, making it challenging to detect them as distinct features in the

are accretion-powered dwarf nova outbursts in cataclysmic variable systems, but
a small subset are thermonuclear-powered classical novae. Despite improved
monitoring of the Galaxy for novae from ASAS-SN and other surveys, the observed
Galactic nova rate is still lower than predictions. One way classical novae
could be missed is if they are confused with the much larger population of
dwarf novae. Here, we examine the properties of 1617 dwarf nova outbursts
detected by ASAS-SN and compare them to classical novae. We find that the mean
classical nova brightens by ~11 magnitudes during outburst, while the mean
dwarf nova brightens by only ~5 magnitudes, with the outburst amplitude
distributions overlapping by roughly 15%. For the first time, we show that the
amplitude of an outburst and the time it takes to decline by two magnitudes
from maximum are positively correlated for dwarf nova outbursts. For classical
novae, we find that these quantities are negatively correlated, but only
weakly, compared to the strong anti-correlation of these quantities found in
some previous work. We show that, even if located at large distances, only a
small number of putative dwarf novae could be mis-classified classical novae
suggesting that there is minimal confusion between these populations. Future
spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates can show whether any are indeed
classical novae.

learning systems, federated learning suffers from data heterogeneity (since the
devices sample their data from possibly different distributions), which induces
additional variance among devices during training. Various variance-reduced
training algorithms have been introduced to combat the effects of data
heterogeneity, while they usually cost additional communication resources to
deliver necessary control information. Additionally, data privacy remains a
critical issue in FL, and thus there have been attempts at bringing
Differential Privacy to this framework as a mediator between utility and
privacy requirements. This paper investigates the trade-offs between
communication costs and training variance under a resource-constrained

Geometric constraints must be carefully examined to avoid collisions and

robot-object collisions do not occur but object-object collisions have to be
avoided. The objective is minimizing the number of object transfers under the

solve monotone problems quickly, i.e., those instances that do not require

single-buffer, non-monotone instances, given a choice of an object and a
buffer. This work utilizes these primitives as local planners in an informed
search framework for more general, non-monotone instances. The search utilizes
partial solutions from the primitives to identify the most promising choice of

near-optimal paths with higher success rate, even for challenging non-monotone

detect outbreaks as early as possible by monitoring data sources which allow to
capture the occurrences of a certain disease. Recent research mainly focuses on
the surveillance of specific, known diseases, putting the focus on the
definition of the disease pattern under surveillance. Until now, only little
effort has been devoted to what we call non-specific syndromic surveillance,
i.e., the use of all available data for detecting any kind of outbreaks,
including infectious diseases which are unknown beforehand. In this work, we
revisit published approaches for non-specific syndromic surveillance and
present a set of simple statistical modeling techniques which can serve as
benchmarks for more elaborate machine learning approaches. Our experimental
comparison on established synthetic data and real data in which we injected
synthetic outbreaks shows that these benchmarks already achieve very
competitive results and often outperform more elaborate algorithms.

  Sharafeddine","Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled Vehicular Communication:
  Joint User Scheduling and Passive Beamforming",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given its ability to control and manipulate wireless environments,
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), also known as intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS), has emerged as a key enabler technology for the six-generation
(6G) cellular networks. In the meantime, vehicular environment radio
propagation is negatively influenced by a large set of objects that cause
transmission distortion such as high buildings. Therefore, this work is devoted
to explore the area of RIS technology integration with vehicular communications
while considering the dynamic nature of such communication environment.
Specifically, we provide a system model where RoadSide Unit (RSU) leverages RIS
to provide indirect wireless transmissions to disconnected areas, known as dark
zones. Dark zones are spots within RSU coverage where the communication links
are blocked due to the existence of blockages. In details, a discrete RIS is
utilized to provide communication links between the RSU and the vehicles
passing through out-of-service zones. Therefore, the joint problem of RSU
resource scheduling and RIS passive beamforming or phase-shift matrix is
formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the
minimum average bit rate. The formulated problem is mixed integer non-convex
program which is difficult to be solved and does not account for the uncertain
dynamic environment in vehicular networks. Thereby, we resort to alternative
methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to determine RSU wireless
scheduling and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to solve for the phase-shift
matrix, \textit{i.e.,} passive beamforming, of the RIS. The Markov Decision
Process (MDP) is defined and the complexity of the solution approach is
discussed. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
approach over baseline techniques.

the stochastic gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits
derived from the O3 data to constrain the cosmic string tension, $G\mu$, as a

interpolates between these two models. Our results improve upon the previous
LIGO-Virgo constraints on $G\mu$ by one to two orders of magnitude depending on
the model which is tested. In particular, for one loop distribution model, we
set the most competitive constraints to date, $G\mu\lesssim 4\times 10^{-15}$.

relatively unexplored regime of low masses (down to $M_\star\sim
10^8$M$_{\odot}$), and small sizes (down to $R_{\rm e}\sim 1.5$ kpc) and
characterize the sAM scaling relation and its redshift evolution. We have
developed a 3D methodology to constrain sAM profiles of the star-forming gas
using a forward modeling approach with \galpak{} that incorporates the effects
of beam smearing, yielding the intrinsic morpho-kinematic properties even with
limited spatial resolution data. Using mock observations from the TNG50

formation rate (SFR)-weighted $j(<r)$ profiles down to low effective
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\gtrapprox3$. We applied our methodology
blindly to a sample of 494 \OII{}-selected SFGs in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field

M_*/$M$_{\odot}<9$ mass range. We find that the (SFR-weighted) sAM relation
follows $j\propto M_\star^{\alpha}$ with an index $\alpha$ varying from
$\alpha=0.3$ to $\alpha=0.5$, from $\log M_\star/$M$_{\odot}=8$ to $\log
M_*/$M$_{\odot}=10.5$. The UDF sample supports a redshift evolution consistent
with the $(1+z)^{-0.5}$ expectation from a Universe in expansion. The scatter
of the sAM sequence is a strong function of the dynamical state with $\log
j|_{M_*}\propto 0.65 \times \log(V_{\rm max}/\sigma)$ where $\sigma$ is the
velocity dispersion at $2 R_{\rm e}$. In TNG50, SFGs also form a
$j-M_{\star}-(V/\sigma)$ plane but it correlates more with galaxy size than
with morphological parameters. Our results suggest that SFGs might experience a
dynamical transformation before their morphological transformation to becoming
passive via either merging or secular evolution.

integrate a non-parametric class of probabilistic machine learning within
discrete choice models (DCMs). Gaussian Processes (GPs) are kernel-based
algorithms that incorporate expert knowledge by assuming priors over latent
functions rather than priors over parameters, which makes them more flexible in
addressing nonlinear problems. By integrating a Gaussian Process within a LCCM
structure, we aim at improving discrete representations of unobserved
heterogeneity. The proposed model would assign individuals probabilistically to
behaviorally homogeneous clusters (latent classes) using GPs and simultaneously
estimate class-specific choice models by relying on random utility models.
Furthermore, we derive and implement an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
to jointly estimate/infer the hyperparameters of the GP kernel function and the
class-specific choice parameters by relying on a Laplace approximation and
gradient-based numerical optimization methods, respectively. The model is
tested on two different mode choice applications and compared against different
LCCM benchmarks. Results show that GP-LCCM allows for a more complex and
flexible representation of heterogeneity and improves both in-sample fit and
out-of-sample predictive power. Moreover, behavioral and economic
interpretability is maintained at the class-specific choice model level while
local interpretation of the latent classes can still be achieved, although the
non-parametric characteristic of GPs lessens the transparency of the model.

Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The Magellanic Clouds are the only
external galaxies for which this type of analysis is possible at the necessary
spatial resolution ($\sim1$ pc). We find that the mass-radius relation and mass
function of LMC clumps have power-law forms, $R \propto M^{\alpha}$ and $dN/dM
\propto M^{\beta}$, with indices $\alpha = 0.36 \pm 0.03$ and $\beta= -1.8 \pm
0.1 $ over the mass ranges $10^2 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 10^5 M_\odot$ and
$10^2 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 10^4 M_\odot$, respectively. With these
values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for the clumps (i.e., protoclusters), the
predicted index for the mass function of young LMC clusters from the FKM model
is $\beta \approx 1.7$, in good agreement with the observed index. The
situation portrayed here for clumps and clusters in the LMC replicates that in
the Milky Way.

clustering of the BOSS LOWZ sample over the radial range $0.4 \, h^{-1} \,
\mathrm{Mpc}$ to $63 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$, significantly extending what
is possible with a purely analytic modelling framework. Our full-scale analysis
yields constraints on the growth of structure that are a factor of two more
stringent than any other study on large scales at similar redshifts. We infer
$f \sigma_8 = 0.471 \pm 0.024$ at $z \approx 0.25$, and $f \sigma_8 = 0.431 \pm
0.025$ at $z \approx 0.40$; the corresponding $\Lambda$CDM predictions of the
Planck CMB analysis are $0.470 \pm 0.006$ and $0.476 \pm 0.005$, respectively.
Our results are thus consistent with Planck, but also follow the trend seen in
previous low-redshift measurements of $f \sigma_8$ falling slightly below the
$\Lambda$CDM+CMB prediction. We find that small and large radial scales yield
mutually consistent values of $f \sigma_8$, but there are $1-2.5 \sigma$ hints
of small scales ($< 10 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$) preferring lower values for
$f \sigma_8$ relative to larger scales. We analyse the constraining power of
the full range of radial scales, finding that most of the multipole information
about $f\sigma_8$ is contained in the scales $2 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}
\lesssim s \lesssim 20 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$. Evidently, once the
cosmological information of the quasi-to-nonlinear regime has been harvested,
large-scale modes contain only modest additional information about structure
growth. Finally, we compare predictions for the galaxy-galaxy lensing amplitude

management. The prevalent tail dependence coefficient (TDC), however, is known
to underestimate the degree of tail dependence and it does not capture
non-exchangeable tail dependence since it evaluates the limiting tail
probability only along the main diagonal. To overcome these issues, two novel
tail dependence measures called the maximal tail concordance measure (MTCM) and
the average tail concordance measure (ATCM) are proposed. Both measures are
constructed based on tail copulas and possess clear probabilistic
interpretations in that the MTCM evaluates the largest limiting probability
among all comparable rectangles in the tail, and the ATCM is a normalized
average of these limiting probabilities. In contrast to the TDC, the proposed
measures can capture non-exchangeable tail dependence. Analytical forms of the
proposed measures are also derived for various copulas. A real data analysis
reveals striking tail dependence and tail non-exchangeability of the return
series of stock indices, particularly in periods of financial distress.

Specifically, these are the Burr type XII distribution for speckle amplitude,
the Lomax distribution for intensity, and the generalized logistic distribution

histogram data from nine optical coherence tomography scans of various

conventional distributions such as the Rayleigh, K, and gamma distributions.
The results indicate that these newer distributions based on power laws are, in

consists of single-time averages and second-order correlators of a dichotomic
variable Q for three times. However, if such conditions are all satisfied, then
where is the quantum behaviour? In this paper, we provide an answer to this
question by considering expanded data sets obtained from finer-grained

situations in which there are violations of MR that go undetected by the

Second, we explore the pentagon inequalities (PIs) and a data set consisting of
all possible averages and second-order correlators for measurements of Q at
five times. Third, we explore the LGIs for a trichotomic variable and
measurements made with a trichotomic operator to, again, identify violations
for a spin-1 system beyond those seen with a single dichotomic variable. We
also explore the regimes in which combinations of two and three-time LGIs can
be satisfied and violated in a spin-1 system, extending recent work. We discuss

often-criticized system that many have argued violates the presumption of
""innocent until proven guilty."" Many studies have sought to understand both the
long-term effects of cash bail's use and the disparate rate of cash bail
assignments along demographic lines (race, gender, etc). However, such work is
often susceptible to problems of infra-marginality -- that the data we observe
can only describe average outcomes, and not the outcomes associated with the
marginal decision.
  In this work, we address this problem by creating a hierarchical Bayesian
model of cash bail assignments. Specifically, our approach models cash bail
decisions as a probabilistic process whereby judges balance the relative costs
of assigning cash bail with the cost of defendants potentially skipping court
dates, and where these skip probabilities are estimated based upon features of
the individual case. We then use Monte Carlo inference to sample the
distribution over these costs for different magistrates and across different
races. We fit this model to a data set we have collected of over 50,000 court
cases in the Allegheny and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania. Our analysis
of 50 separate judges shows that they are uniformly more likely to assign cash
bail to black defendants than to white defendants, even given identical
likelihood of skipping a court appearance. This analysis raises further
questions about the equity of the practice of cash bail, irrespective of its
underlying legal justification.

primordial in origin instead of the result of stellar evolution. Soon after
formation in the early universe, primordial black holes can form binaries after
decoupling from the cosmic expansion. Alternatively, primordial black holes as
dark matter could also form binaries in the late universe due to dynamical
encounters and gravitational-wave braking. A significant feature for this
channel is the possibility that some sources retain nonzero eccentricity in the
LIGO/Virgo band. Assuming all dark matter is primordial black holes with a
delta function mass distribution, $1M_\odot-1M_\odot$ binaries formed in this
late-universe channel can be detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo with their
design sensitivities at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1)$/year, where $12\%(3\%)$ of
events have eccentricity at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz,
$e^\mathrm{10Hz}\geq0.01(0.1)$, and nondetection can constrain the binary
formation rate within this model. Third generation detectors would be expected
to detect subsolar mass eccentric binaries as light as $0.01 M_\odot$ within
this channel, if they accounted for the majority of the dark matter.
Furthermore, we use simulated gravitational-wave data to study the ability to
search for eccentric gravitational-wave signals using a quasi-circular waveform
template bank with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. For a match-filtering
targeted search, assuming binaries with a delta function mass of
$0.1(1)M_\odot$ and the eccentricity distribution derived from this
late-universe formation channel, $41\%(6\%)$ of the signals would be missed
compared to the ideal detection rate due to the mismatch in the
gravitational-wave signal from eccentricity.

approach for modeling subject-specific spinal alignment and evaluated its
feasibility by comparing the predicted with the actual intervertebral joint
(IVJ) locations/orientations (ground truth) using lateral-view radiographic
images. Moreover, the predictive performance of the subject-specific models was
evaluated by comparing the predicted L1/L2 spinal loads during various
functional activities with in vivo measured data obtained from the OrthoLoad
database. IVJ locations/orientations were predicted closer to ground truth as
opposed to standard model scaling, with average location prediction errors of
0.99+/-0.68 cm on the frontal and 1.21+/-0.97 cm on the transverse axis as well
as an average orientation prediction error of 4.74{\deg}+/-2.80{\deg}.
Simulated spinal loads showed similar curve patterns but considerably larger

convolution layers to take skeleton configuration as an input to model skeleton
variations across different subjects. As a result, our network can scale up
well to large-scale motion data sets across multiple subjects and support
various applications, such as random and controllable motion synthesis, motion
denoising, and motion completion, in a unified way. Complex motions, such as
punching, kicking and, kicking while punching, are also well handled. Moreover,
our network can synthesize motions for novel skeletons not in the training

Prior
research has focused on estimating the full persistence diagram of X, a
quantity that is very expensive to compute, unstable to outliers, and far from
a sufficient statistic. We therefore propose that the correct invariant is not
the persistence diagram of X, but rather the collection of persistence diagrams
of many small subsets. This invariant, which we call ""distributed persistence,""
is perfectly parallelizable, more stable to outliers, and has a rich inverse
theory. The map from the space of point clouds (with the quasi-isometry metric)
to the space of distributed persistence invariants (with the
Hausdorff-Bottleneck distance) is a global quasi-isometry. This is a much
stronger property than simply being injective, as it implies that the inverse
of a small neighborhood is a small neighborhood, and is to our knowledge the
only result of its kind in the TDA literature. Moreover, the quasi-isometry
bounds depend on the size of the subsets taken, so that as the size of these
subsets goes from small to large, the invariant interpolates between a purely
geometric one and a topological one. Lastly, we note that our inverse results
do not actually require considering all subsets of a fixed size (an enormous
collection), but a relatively small collection satisfying certain covering
properties that arise with high probability when randomly sampling subsets.
These theoretical results are complemented by two synthetic experiments
demonstrating the use of distributed persistence in practice.

properties such as magnetic damping and anisotropy. Even though the typical
resonance frequency of a magnet ranges from gigahertz to terahertz, experiments
also report the resonance near zero frequency in a large class of magnets. Here
we revisit this phenomenon by analyzing the symmetry of the system and find
that the resonance frequency ($\omega$) follows a universal power law $\omega
\varpropto |H-H_c|^p$, where $H_c$ is the critical field at which the resonance
frequency is zero. When the magnet preserves the rotational symmetry around the
external field ($H$), $p = 1$. Otherwise, $p=1/2$. The magnon excitations are
gapped above $H_c$, gapless at $H_c$ and gapped again below $H_c$. The zero
frequency is often accompanied by a reorientation transition in the
magnetization. For the case that $p=1/2$, this transition is described by a
Landau theory for second-order phase transitions. We further show that the spin
current driven by thermal gradient and spin-orbit effects can be significantly
enhanced when the resonance frequency is close to zero, which can be measured
electrically by converting the spin current into electric signals. This may
provide an experimentally accessible way to characterize the critical field.
Our findings provide a unified understanding of the magnetization dynamics near
the critical field, and may, furthermore, inspire the study of magnon transport

computationally in model systems with assumed constitutive models (e.g.,
finite-deformation Neo-Hookean model) and viscoelastic properties determined

Kelvin-Voigt (QLKV) constitutive model, which additionally accounts for strain
stiffening, more accurately represents the viscoelastic response of soft
materials subjected to cavitation; this model has also been used to infer
viscoelastic properties at high rates. In this work, we use the QLKV model and

in larger elastic stresses and compressive stresses extending into the collapse

of the collapse phase also increases. In comparison with the conventional
Neo-Hookean model, the compressive stress has a larger magnitude, extends

review the various implementations that add dynamic typing to a statically
typed language in order to highlight the different ways of mixing static and
dynamic typing and examine possible inspirations while maintaining the gradual
nature of our type system. This paper also discusses our motivation for adding
gradual types to our language, and the practical benefits of doing so in our

(P2P) distributed gradient-descent method -- a prominent algorithm for
distributed optimization in a P2P system. In this problem, the system comprises
of multiple agents, and each agent has a local cost function. In the fault-free
case, when all the agents are honest, the P2P distributed gradient-descent
method allows all the agents to reach a consensus on a solution that minimizes
their aggregate cost. However, we consider a scenario where a certain number of
agents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may not follow an algorithm
correctly, and may share arbitrary incorrect information to prevent other
non-faulty agents from solving the optimization problem. In the presence of
Byzantine faulty agents, a more reasonable goal is to allow all the non-faulty
agents to reach a consensus on a solution that minimizes the aggregate cost of
all the non-faulty agents. We refer to this fault-tolerance goal as
$f$-resilience where $f$ is the maximum number of Byzantine faulty agents in a
system of $n$ agents, with $f < n$. Most prior work on fault-tolerance in P2P
distributed optimization only consider approximate fault-tolerance wherein,
unlike $f$-resilience, all the non-faulty agents' compute a minimum point of a
non-uniformly weighted aggregate of their cost functions. We propose a
fault-tolerance mechanism that confers provable $f$-resilience to the P2P

necessary condition of $2f$-redundancy, defined later in the paper. Moreover,

V2 - extended discussion, fixing typos",,"10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.010308",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work has demonstrated the existence of universal Hamiltonians - simple
spin lattice models that can simulate any other quantum many body system to any
desired level of accuracy. Until now proofs of universality have relied on
explicit constructions, tailored to each specific family of universal
Hamiltonians. In this work we go beyond this approach, and completely classify
the simulation ability of quantum Hamiltonians by their complexity classes. We
do this by deriving necessary and sufficient complexity theoretic conditions
characterising universal quantum Hamiltonians. Although the result concerns the
theory of analogue Hamiltonian simulation - a promising application of
near-term quantum technology - the proof relies on abstract complexity
theoretic concepts and the theory of quantum computation. As well as providing
simplified proofs of previous Hamiltonian universality results, and offering a
route to new universal constructions, the results in this paper give insight
into the origins of universality. For example, finally explaining the
previously noted coincidences between families of universal Hamiltonian and
classes of Hamiltonians appearing in complexity theory.

configurations. A simulation of grain growth in such a material therefore
requires a procedure to enumerate all possible topological transitions and
select the most energetically favorable one. Such a procedure is developed and
implemented here for a microstructure represented by a volumetric finite
element mesh. As a specific example, all possible transitions for a typical
configuration with five grains around a junction point are enumerated, and some
exceptional transitions are found to be energetically similar to the
conventional ones even for a uniform boundary energy. A general discrete

achieve efficiency by learning weights associated with local filters with a
finite spatial extent. An implication of this is that a filter may know what it
is looking at, but not where it is positioned in the image. In this paper, we
first test this hypothesis and reveal that a surprising degree of absolute
position information is encoded in commonly used CNNs. We show that zero
padding drives CNNs to encode position information in their internal
representations, while a lack of padding precludes position encoding. This
gives rise to deeper questions about the role of position information in CNNs:
(i) What boundary heuristics enable optimal position encoding for downstream
tasks?; (ii) Does position encoding affect the learning of semantic
representations?; (iii) Does position encoding always improve performance? To
provide answers, we perform the largest case study to date on the role that
padding and border heuristics play in CNNs. We design novel tasks which allow
us to quantify boundary effects as a function of the distance to the border.
Numerous semantic objectives reveal the effect of the border on semantic
representations. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of these findings on
multiple real-world tasks to show that position information can both help or
hurt performance.

proof of principle experiments have demonstrated small-scale polarisation
transfer from single NVs to hydrogen spins outside the diamond. However, the
scaling up of these results to the use of a dense NV ensemble, which is a
necessary prerequisite for achieving realistic NMR sensitivity enhancement, has
not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we present evidence for a polarising

polarisation enhancement. In the most favourable example of the interaction
with hydrogen in a solid state target, a maximum polarisation transfer rate of
$\approx 7500$ spins per second per NV is measured, averaged over an area
containing order $10^6$ NVs. Reduced levels of polarisation efficiency are
found for liquid state targets, where molecular diffusion limits the transfer.

Additionally, we highlight practical choices when implementing the algorithm,

Using simulations, we illustrate how estimating the ODTR using this

simple parametric estimators in the library of candidate algorithms; (2) using

secondary detonation in the underlying white dwarf. Our research presents a
number of high resolution, multi-dimensional, full star simulations of
thin-He-shell, sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf progenitors that undergo a

detonation more closely, including the details of the off-center secondary
ignition and asymmetric ejecta. We find considerable differences in the

coordination numbers (CNs). By analyzing the formation energy modified to
enhance the subtle energy difference between metastable structures, we find
that $XZ$ and $YZ$ with B2-type structure (CN$=$8) become energetically stable
when the $X$ and $Y$ metals form an alloy on the $Z$ metal surface. This is
consistent with the experimental results for Pb-Sn alloys on metal surfaces
such as Rh(111) and Ru(0001). Some suitable metal substrates are also predicted
to form Pb-Sn alloys.

the rheology of disordered materials, and several theoretical predictions have

theoretical predictions. Here we use computer simulations to study the yielding
transition under two different loading schemes: standard simple shear dynamics,
and self-propelled, dense active systems. In the active systems a yielding
transition is observed as expected, when the self-propulsion is increased.
However, the range of self-propulsions in which a pure liquid regime exist
appears to vanish upon approaching the so-called ""jamming point"" at which
solidity of soft-sphere packings is lost. Such an ""active yielding"" transition
shares similarities with the generic yielding transition for shear flows. A
Herschel-Bulkley law is observed in both loading scenarios, with a clear
difference in the critical scaling exponents between the two, suggesting the
existent of different universality classes for the yielding transition under
different driving conditions. In addition, we present direct measurements of
length and time scales for both driving scenarios. A comparison with
theoretical predictions from recent literature reveals poor agreement with our

growing volume of time series data from photometric surveys demands
computationally efficient methods for detecting and characterizing such
signals. The most efficient algorithms available for this purpose are those
that exploit the $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ scaling of the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). However, these methods are not optimal for non-sinusoidal signal shapes.
Template fits (or periodic matched filters) optimize sensitivity for a priori
known signal shapes but at a significant computational cost. Current
implementations of template periodograms scale as $\mathcal{O}(N_f N_{obs})$,
where $N_f$ is the number of trial frequencies and $N_{obs}$ is the number of
lightcurve observations, and due to non-convexity, they do not guarantee the
best fit at each trial frequency, which can lead to spurious results. In this
work, we present a non-linear extension of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to
obtain a template-fitting algorithm that is both accurate (globally optimal
solutions are obtained except in pathological cases) and computationally
efficient (scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N_f\log N_f)$ for a given template). The
non-linear optimization of the template fit at each frequency is recast as a
polynomial zero-finding problem, where the coefficients of the polynomial can
be computed efficiently with the non-equispaced fast Fourier transform. We show
that our method, which uses truncated Fourier series to approximate templates,

rigid units. Inspired by a natural connection between these rotating rigid

for the emergence of a non-trivial floppy mode responsible for the auxetic

fluid flow in fractured porous media. Traditional DFM uses the so-called
hybrid-dimensional approach to treat fractures explicitly as low-dimensional
entries (e.g. line entries in 2D media and face entries in 3D media) on the
interfaces of matrix cells and then couple the matrix and fracture flow systems
together based on the principle of superposition with the fracture thickness
used as the dimensional homogeneity factor. Because of this methodology, DFM is
considered to be limited on conforming meshes and thus may raise difficulties
in generating high quality unstructured meshes due to the complexity of
fracture's geometrical morphology. In this paper, we clarify that the DFM
actually can be extended to non-conforming meshes without any essential
changes. To show it clearly, we provide another perspective for DFM based on
hybrid-dimensional representation of permeability tensor to describe fractures
as one-dimensional line Dirac delta functions contained in permeability tensor.
A finite element DFM scheme for single-phase flow on non-conforming meshes is
then derived by applying Galerkin finite element method to it. Analytical
analysis and numerical experiments show that our DFM automatically degenerates
to the classical finite element DFM when the mesh is conforming with fractures.
Moreover, the accuracy and efficiency of the model on non-conforming meshes are
demonstrated by testing several benchmark problems. This model is also
applicable to curved fracture with variable thickness.

(SToRM) model for the recovery of dynamic image data from highly undersampled
measurements. The proposed generative framework represents the image time
series as a smooth non-linear function of low-dimensional latent vectors that
capture the cardiac and respiratory phases. The non-linear function is
represented using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike the popular
CNN approaches that require extensive fully-sampled training data that is not
available in this setting, the parameters of the CNN generator as well as the
latent vectors are jointly estimated from the undersampled measurements using
stochastic gradient descent. We penalize the norm of the gradient of the
generator to encourage the learning of a smooth surface/manifold, while
temporal gradients of the latent vectors are penalized to encourage the time
series to be smooth. The main benefits of the proposed scheme are (a) the quite
significant reduction in memory demand compared to the analysis based SToRM
model, and (b) the spatial regularization brought in by the CNN model. We also
introduce efficient progressive approaches to minimize the computational

their prospect in cosmology. For such events, the sky locations of sources can
be pinpointed with techniques such as identifying the host galaxies. However,
the cosmological applications of these events still suffer from the problem of
degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle. To address this
issue, a technique was proposed in previous study, i.e., using the property of
SGRBs. Based on the observations, we assume that the cosine of inclination
follows a Gaussian distribution, which may act as a prior in the Bayes analysis
to break the degeneracy. This paper investigates the effects of different
Gaussian priors and detector configurations on distance measurement and
cosmological research. We first derive a simplified Fisher information matrix
for demonstration, and then conduct quantitative analyses via simulation. By
varying the number of third-generation detectors and the scale of prior, we
generate four catalogs of 1000 events. It is shown that, in the same detecting
period, a network of detectors can recognize more and farther events than a
single detector. Besides, adopting tighter prior and employing multiple
detectors both decrease the error of luminosity distance. Also considered is
the performance of a widely adopted formula in the error budget, which turns
out to be a conservative choice in each case. As for cosmological applications,
for LCDM model, 500, 200, 600, and 300 events are required for the four
configurations to achieve 1% H_0 accuracy. With all 1000 events in each

adversarial examples. We find in this framework an interesting phenomenon
during the training of deep neural networks, called Min-Max property, that is,
the absolute values of most parameters in the convolutional layer approach zero

bigger. Based on this Min-Max property which is formulated and analyzed in a
view of random distribution, we further build a new defense model against
adversarial examples for adversarial robustness improvement. An advantage of
the built model is that it performs better than the standard one and can
combine with adversarial training to achieve an improved performance. It is
experimentally confirmed that, regarding the average accuracy of all classes,
our model is almost as same as the existing models when an attack does not

kinematic structures using the framework described in Du et al. (2019, 2020).
For example, the concept of stellar halos is generalized to weakly-rotating
structures that are composed of loosely bound stars, which can hence be
associated to both disk and elliptical type morphologies. By applying this
method to central galaxies with stellar mass $10^{10-11.5}\ M_\odot$ from the
TNG50 simulation, we identify three broadly-defined types of galaxies: ones
dominated by disk, by bulge, or by stellar halo structures. We then use the
simulation to infer the underlying connection between the growth of structures
and physical processes over cosmic time. Tracing galaxies back in time, we
recognize three fundamental regimes: an early phase of evolution ($z\gtrsim2$),
and internal and external (mainly mergers) processes that act at later times.
We find that disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies are not significantly affected
by mergers since $z\sim2$; the difference in their present-day structures
originates from two distinct evolutionary pathways, extended vs. compact, that
are likely determined by their parent dark matter halos; i.e., nature. On the
other hand, slow rotator elliptical galaxies are typically halo-dominated,
forming by external processes (e.g. mergers) in the later phase, i.e., nurture.
This picture challenges the general idea that elliptical galaxies are the same
objects as classical bulges. In observations, both bulge- and halo-dominated
galaxies are likely to be classified as early-type galaxies with compact
morphology and quiescent star formation. However, here we find them to have
very different evolutionary histories.

control of electrical and magnetic properties in high-quality SrRuO3 films. The
epitaxial strain was imposed by cubic or pseudocubic perovskite substrates
having a lattice mismatch of -1.6 to 2.3% with reference to bulk SrRuO3. The
Poisson ratio, which describes the two orthogonal distortions due to the
substrate clamping effect, is estimated to be 0.33. The Curie temperature (TC)
and residual resistivity ratios of the series of films are higher than or
comparable to the highest reported values for SrRuO3 on each substrate,
confirming the high crystalline quality of the films. A TC of 169 K is achieved
in a tensile-strained SrRuO3 film on the DyScO3 (110) substrate, which is the

occlusion, we propose to integrate deep neural networks with 3D generative
representations of objects into a unified neural architecture that we term
NeMo. In particular, NeMo learns a generative model of neural feature
activations at each vertex on a dense 3D mesh. Using differentiable rendering
we estimate the 3D object pose by minimizing the reconstruction error between
NeMo and the feature representation of the target image. To avoid local optima
in the reconstruction loss, we train the feature extractor to maximize the
distance between the individual feature representations on the mesh using
contrastive learning. Our extensive experiments on PASCAL3D+,
occluded-PASCAL3D+ and ObjectNet3D show that NeMo is much more robust to
partial occlusion and unseen pose compared to standard deep networks, while
retaining competitive performance on regular data. Interestingly, our
experiments also show that NeMo performs reasonably well even when the mesh
representation only crudely approximates the true object geometry with a
cuboid, hence revealing that the detailed 3D geometry is not needed for
accurate 3D pose estimation. The code is publicly available at

unambiguous retrieval of an object's exit-wave function with high fidelity. It
has been used with great success to study nanoscale phenomena and
spatio-temporal dynamics in solids, with sensitivity to the phase component of
electronic and magnetic textures. However, the method requires patterning a
nanostructured holography mask directly onto the sample. This invasive
fabrication process is labor-intensive and defines a fixed field of view,
limiting the range of applicable samples and diminishing the signal-to-noise
ratio at high-resolution. In this work, we propose using wavefront-shaping
X-ray diffractive optics to create a spatially structured probe with full
control of its phase at the sample plane, obviating the need for a holography
mask. We demonstrate in silico that the method can image nanoscale structures
and magnetic textures. The proposed holography route can image extended regions
of interest, enabling the investigation of a broad range of physical phenomena
at the nanoscale including magnetism and electronic phase coexistence in
quantum materials. We further envisage applications in phase-contrast imaging
of other weakly absorbing objects in the realm of soft and biological matter
research.

In this
paper, the mechanism of engine unstart is discussed from the point of view of
shock/shock interaction and deflagration-to-detonation transition. The
shock/shock interaction leads to the nonlinear, transient and discontinuous
process of the supersonic combustion flow field. This process is similar to the
deflagration-to-detonation transition process. If the velocity of
pre-combustion shock wave is faster than the velocity in the isolator, it will
propagate upstream and cause the engine unstart. The C-J detonation velocity is
defined as the stable operation boundary of scramjets, which is the maximum
shock wave produced by combustion theoretically. The scramjets will work stable
if the velocity in the isolator is faster than the corresponding C-J detonation
velocity. The combustion characteristics and propulsive performance of
scramjets is theoretically analyzed by using C-J detonation theory. For high
Mach number scramjets, the velocity in the isolator is much faster than the C-J
detonation velocity. Therefore, extra fuel and oxygen can be injected into the
combustor to increase the thrust as long as the shock wave velocity driven by
the combustion products is slower than the air velocity in the isolator. The
theoretical results agree well with the existing experimental results, which
can be used as a baseline for the development of scramjets.

predominant approach to research in software engineering has followed a
positivist science model, this approach may be sub-optimal when addressing
problems with a dominant social or cultural dimension, such as those frequently
encountered when studying work practices in a globally distributed team
setting. The investigation of such a team reported in this paper provides one
example of an alternative approach to research in a global context, through a
longitudinal interpretive field study seeking to understand how global virtual
teams mediated the use of technology. Objective: Our focus in this paper is on
the conduct of research in the context of global software activities,
particularly as applied to the actions and interactions of global virtual
teams. Method: We describe how we undertook a substantial field study of global
virtual teams, and highlight how the adopted structuration theory enabled us to
deliver effectively against our goals. Results: We believe that the approach
taken suited a research context in which situated practices were occurring over
time in a highly complex domain, ensuring that our results were both strongly
grounded and relevant to practice. It has resulted in the generation of
substantive theory and techniques that have been adapted and applied on a pilot
basis in further field settings. Conclusion: We conclude that globally
distributed teamwork presents a complex context which demands new research
approaches, beyond the limited set customarily applied by software engineering
researchers. We advocate experimenting with different research methodologies

that the generation of the vorticity due to the viscous effects are quite
dominant compared to baroclinic or compressibility effects. The moving cases
presented involve shock driven wedge problem. The fluid and wedge structure

show that the localized phase is preserved in a different limit where $N$ is
taken to infinity and the hopping $K$ is simultaneously adjusted to keep $N \,

numerical computations of the localization length showing that in the $N

localized phase if $N\,K$ is kept constant, but does not possess that phase if
$K$ is fixed. The second argument is a detailed analysis of the energy and

spins do not exhibit long distance fluctuations, i.e. such fluctuations are
massive and therefore decay exponentially, which signals conduction. In

challenging, which has not been reported in the literature to the best of our
knowledge. We use the FGM copula for modelling the dependence as it is
relatively simple for computational purposes and has empirical successes. The
marginal of the risks are considered as exponential and pareto, separately, for
the case of extreme risk and as exponential for the case of the total risk. The
effect of the degree of dependency on the VaR and CTE of the extreme and total

topology loses meaning when a protecting symmetry is broken. Defying this
intuition, we illustrate, in an interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,
how this combination of symmetry breaking and quench dynamics can give rise to
both single-particle and many-body signatures of topology. From the dynamics of
the symmetry broken state, we find that we are able to dynamically probe the
equilibrium topological phase diagram of a symmetry respecting projection of
the post-quench Hamiltonian. In the ensemble dynamics, we demonstrate how
spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the protecting symmetry can result in a
quantized many-body topological `invariant' which is not pinned under unitary
time evolution. We dub this `dynamical many-body topology' (DMBT). We show
numerically that both the pure state and ensemble signatures are remarkably
robust, and argue that these non-equilibrium signatures should be quite generic
in SPT systems, regardless of protecting symmetries or spatial dimension.

increase in the use of summarization algorithms for providing an overview of

(e.g. ROUGE scores) rely on matching algorithmic summaries to human-generated
ones. However, it has been shown that when the textual contents are
heterogeneous, e.g., when they come from different socially salient groups,
most existing summarization algorithms represent the social groups very
differently compared to their distribution in the original data. To mitigate
such adverse impacts, some fairness-preserving summarization algorithms have
also been proposed. All of these studies have considered normative notions of
fairness from the perspective of writers of the contents, neglecting the
readers' perceptions of the underlying fairness notions. To bridge this gap, in
this work, we study the interplay between the fairness notions and how readers
perceive them in textual summaries. Through our experiments, we show that
reader's perception of fairness is often context-sensitive. Moreover, standard
ROUGE evaluation metrics are unable to quantify the perceived (un)fairness of
the summaries. To this end, we propose a human-in-the-loop metric and an
automated graph-based methodology to quantify the perceived bias in textual
summaries. We demonstrate their utility by quantifying the (un)fairness of
several summaries of heterogeneous socio-political microblog datasets.

passbands for the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) second
data release (DR2), comprising 1088 pointings of two square degrees, and study
the systematic impact of metallicity in the stellar locus technique. The [Fe/H]
metallicity from LAMOST DR5 for 146184 high-quality calibration stars, defined
with S/N > 10 in J-PLUS passbands and S/N > 3 in Gaia parallax, was used to
compute the metallicity-dependent stellar locus (ZSL). The initial
homogenization of J-PLUS photometry, performed with a unique stellar locus, was
refined by including the metallicity effect in colours via the ZSL. The
variation of the average metallicity along the Milky Way produces a systematic
offset in J-PLUS calibration. This effect is well above 1% for the bluer
passbands and amounts 0.07, 0.07, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02 mag in u, J0378, J0395,
J0410, and J0430, respectively. We modelled this effect with the Milky Way
location of the J-PLUS pointing, providing also an updated calibration for
those observations without LAMOST information. The estimated accuracy in the
calibration after including the metallicity effect is at 1% level for the bluer
J-PLUS passbands and below for the rest. We conclude that photometric
calibration with the stellar locus technique is prone to significant systematic
bias along the Milky Way location for passbands bluer than lambda = 4500 A. The
updated calibration method for J-PLUS DR2 reaches 1-2% precision and 1%

variation is required for modeling the contact angle at the triple junction
between a liquid, solid and surrounding air. Our discretization is based on the
surface energy itself, rather than on the associated traction condition most

approach automatically captures surface gradients without the explicit need to
resolve them as in traction condition based approaches. We include an implicit
discretization of thermomechanical material coupling with a novel
particle-based enforcement of Robin boundary conditions associated with
convective heating. Lastly, we design a particle resampling approach needed to
achieve perfect conservation of linear and angular momentum with
AffineParticle-In-Cell (APIC) [Jiang et al. 2015]. We show that our approach

design degrees of freedom, efficiency of design methods becomes a major
concern. In recent years, machine learning methods such as artificial neural
networks have been used increasingly to speed up the design process. A main
issue of many such approaches is the need for a large corpus of training data
that are generated using high-dimensional simulations. The high computational
cost associated with training data generation largely diminishes the efficiency
gained by using machine learning methods. In this work, an adaptive artificial
neural network-based generative design approach is proposed and developed. This
method uses a generative adversarial network to generate design candidates and
thus the number of design variables is greatly reduced. To speed up the
evaluation of the objective function, a convolutional neural network is
constructed as the surrogate model for function evaluation. The inverse design
is carried out using the genetic algorithm in conjunction with two neural
networks. A novel adaptive learning and optimization strategy is proposed,
which allows the design space to be effectively explored for the search for
optimal solutions. As such the number of training data needed is greatly
reduced. The performance of the proposed design method is demonstrated on two
heat source layout design problems. In both problems, optimal designs have been
obtained. Compared with several existing approaches, the proposed approach has
the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

We observe a non-monotonic energy dependence ($\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 7.7

3.1$\sigma$ for the 0-5\% central Au+Au collisions. This is consistent with the
expectations of critical fluctuations in a QCD-inspired model. Thermal and
transport model calculations show a monotonic variation with $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm

negative values for a two-particle correlation function, $\kappa_2$, of protons
and antiprotons, which are mainly due to the effects of baryon number
conservation. Furthermore, it is found that the four-particle correlation
function, $\kappa_4$, of protons plays a role in determining the energy
dependence of proton $C_4/C_1$ below 19.6 GeV, which cannot be understood by
the effect of baryon number conservation.

a maximum pressure of 18 GPa before collapsing. The latter was identified as a
multiwall tube with an internal tube diameter of 12nm and 30 walls. This
maximum pressure is lowered depending on the internal tube diameter and the

the secret can be recovered by any $k$ or more parties while $k-1$ or fewer

these schemes, there has been very little study on optimizing the quantum
communication cost during recovery. Recently, we initiated the study of
communication efficient quantum threshold secret sharing (CE-QTS) schemes.
These schemes reduce the communication complexity in QTS schemes by accessing
$d\geq k$ parties for recovery; here $d$ is fixed ahead of encoding the secret.
In contrast to the standard QTS schemes which require $k$ qudits for recovering
each qudit in the secret, these schemes have a lower communication cost of

an information theoretic model is developed to analyse CE-QTS schemes and the

consistent output (label) space or scenario where their input (feature) spaces
are heterogeneous while the output (label) space is consistent. However, to the
best of our knowledge, there is limited study on twofold heterogeneous MTL
(THMTL) scenario where the input and the output spaces are both inconsistent or
heterogeneous. In order to handle this complicated scenario, in this paper, we
design a simple and effective multi-task adaptive learning (MTAL) network to
learn multiple tasks in such THMTL setting. Specifically, we explore and
utilize the inherent relationship between tasks for knowledge sharing from
similar convolution kernels in individual layers of the MTAL network. Then in
order to realize the sharing, we weightedly aggregate any pair of convolutional
kernels with their similarity greater than some threshold $\rho$, consequently,
our model effectively performs cross-task learning while suppresses the
intra-redundancy of the entire network. Finally, we conduct end-to-end
training. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in comparison with the state-of-the-art counterparts.

not entirely consistent with observations. Here we propose an alternative model
taking into account the influence of thermonuclear flashes on proto-WDs. We
assume that the flashes lead to asymmetrical mass ejection, which imparts a
mild kick on the proto-WDs. By simulating orbital changes of binary MSPs with

ransomware detection system, called ""Peeler"" (Profiling kErnEl -Level Events to

at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed
ransomware's inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations
performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and
correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we
develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system's kernel events and
detects ransomware attacks on the system. Our experimental results show that
Peeler achieves more than 99\% detection rate with 0.58\% false-positive rate
against 43 distinct ransomware families, containing samples from both crypto

them promptly after only one file is lost (within 115 milliseconds on average).
Peeler utilizes around 4.9\% of CPU time with only 9.8 MB memory under the

efficiently detect diverse malware families by monitoring their kernel-level

moving to new spectrum is to understand the science of radio propagation and
develop an accurate channel model. In this paper, a wideband channel
measurement campaign between 130 GHz and 143 GHz is investigated in a typical
meeting room. Directional antennas are utilized and rotated for resolving the
multi-path components (MPCs) in the angular domain. With careful system
calibration that eliminates system errors and antenna effects, a realistic
power delay profile is developed. Furthermore, a combined MPC clustering and
matching procedure with ray-tracing techniques is proposed to investigate the
cluster behavior and wave propagation of THz signals. In light of the
measurement results, physical parameters and insights in the THz indoor channel
are comprehensively analyzed, including the line-of-sight path loss, power
distributions, temporal and spatial features, and correlations among THz
multi-path characteristics. Finally, a hybrid channel model that combines
ray-tracing and statistical methods is developed for THz indoor communications.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid channel model shows good
agreement with the measurement and outperforms the conventional statistical and

today's connected world. However, recently there were many concerns about data
sharing as sharing sensitive information can jeopardize users' privacy. To
preserve the privacy, organizations use anonymization techniques to conceal
users' sensitive data. However, these techniques are vulnerable to
de-anonymization attacks which aim to identify individual records within a
dataset. In this paper, a two-tier mathematical framework is proposed for
analyzing and mitigating the de-anonymization attacks, by studying the
interactions between sharing organizations, data collector, and a prospective
attacker. In the first level, a game-theoretic model is proposed to enable
sharing organizations to optimally select their anonymization levels for
k-anonymization under two potential attacks: background-knowledge attack and
homogeneity attack. In the second level, a contract-theoretic model is proposed
to enable the data collector to optimally reward the organizations for their
data. The formulated problems are studied under single-time sharing and
repeated sharing scenarios. Different Nash equilibria for the proposed game and
the optimal solution of the contract-based problem are analytically derived for
both scenarios. Simulation results show that the organizations can optimally
select their anonymization levels, while the data collector can benefit from
incentivizing the organizations to share their data.

creation, decay of multipartite entanglement occur for different combinations

concurrence after a gradual increase from disentangled state at zero field
followed by an asymptotic decay at large fields. In contrast, for a marginally

proposed for mitigating wall clutter in indoor radar images. The algorithm
relies on the availability of clean images and corresponding noisy images
during training and requires no additional information regarding the wall
characteristics. The algorithm is evaluated on simulated Doppler-time
spectrograms and high range resolution profiles generated for diverse radar
frequencies and wall characteristics in around-the-corner radar (ACR)
scenarios. Additional experiments are performed on range-enhanced frontal
images generated from measurements gathered from a wideband RF imaging sensor.
The results from the experiments show that the StackedSDAE successfully
reconstructs images that closely resemble those that would be obtained in free

hidden layer representations within the autoencoder makes the algorithm more
robust to low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and label mismatch between clean and
corrupt data during training than the conventional single layer DAE. For
example, the denoised ACR signatures show a structural similarity above 0.75 to
clean free space images at SNR of -10dB and label mismatch error of 50%.

2019 as a strategic large-class (L-class) mission, with its expected launch in
the late 2020s using JAXA's H3 rocket. LiteBIRD plans to map the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) polarization over the full sky with unprecedented
precision. Its main scientific objective is to carry out a definitive search
for the signal from cosmic inflation, either making a discovery or ruling out
well-motivated inflationary models. The measurements of LiteBIRD will also
provide us with an insight into the quantum nature of gravity and other new
physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. To this
end, LiteBIRD will perform full-sky surveys for three years at the Sun-Earth
Lagrangian point L2 for 15 frequency bands between 34 and 448 GHz with three
telescopes, to achieve a total sensitivity of 2.16 micro K-arcmin with a
typical angular resolution of 0.5 deg. at 100GHz. We provide an overview of the

(Observatoire pour la Min\'eralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activit\'e) spectra
representative of igneous terrains of Mars. This task provided the modal
composition and grain sizes at a planetary scale. The lithology can be
summarized in five mineral maps at km-scale. We found that the low albedo
equatorial regions of the Martian surface (from 60{\deg}S to 30{\deg}N) are
globally dominated by plagioclase with average abundance ~50 vol% and pyroxenes
with total averaged abundance close to 40 vol%. An evolution of the
LCP/(LCP+HCP) ratio is observed with time at the global scale, suggesting an
evolution of the degree of partial melting throughout the Martian eras. Olivine
and Martian dust are minor components of the modelled terrains. The olivine
distribution is quite different from the other minerals because it is found on
localized areas with abundance reaching 20 vol%. A statistical approach, to
classify the pixels of the abundances maps, using k-means clustering,
highlighted seven distinct mineral assemblages on the surface. This
classification illustrates that diverse mineralogical units are found in the
Noachian and Hesperian terrains, which suggests the presence of various and
complex magmatic processes at a global scale during the two oldest eras. The
chemical composition was derived from the modal composition maps. The
OMEGA-derived chemical composition is quite consistent with several distinctive
geochemical characteristics previously considered as fingerprints of the
Martian surface. A major discrepancy is in regards to the Fe content that is
significantly smaller than soil and rock analyses from GRS and in situ
measurements. The discrepancy could be partly explained by the assumptions used
for the spectral modelling or could also indicate surface alteration rinds.

study was conducted to examine the hypothesis. To examine the association
between CT exposure and placental corticotrophin-releasing hormone (pCRH),
linear mixed effect model and hierarchical Bayesian linear model were
constructed. In Bayesian inference, by providing conditionally conjugate
priors, Gibbs sampler was used to draw MCMC samples. Piecewise linear mixed
effect model was conducted in order to adjust to the dramatic change of pCRH at
around week 20 into pregnancy. Pearson residual, QQ, ACF and trace plots were
used to justify the model adequacy. Likelihood ratio test and DIC were utilized
to model selection. The association between CT exposure and pCRH during
pregnancy is obvious. The effect of CT exposure on pCRH varies dramatically
over gestational age. Women with one childhood trauma would experience 11.9%
higher in pCRH towards the end of pregnancy than those without childhood
trauma. The increase rate of pCRH after week 20 is almost four-fold larger than
that before week 20. Frequentist and Bayesian inference produce similar
results. The findings support the hypothesis that the effect of CT exposure on
pCRH over GA exists. The effect changes dramatically at around week 20 into

of large-scale solar eruptions. Recent observations found that solar eruptions
could be initiated by a sequence of ""flux feeding,"" during which chromospheric
fibrils rise upward from below, and merge with a pre-existing prominence.
Further theoretical study has confirmed that the flux feeding mechanism is
efficient in causing the eruption of flux ropes that are wrapped by bald patch
separatrix surfaces. But it is unclear how flux feeding influences coronal flux
ropes that are wrapped by hyperbolic flux tubes (HFT), and whether it is able
to cause the flux-rope eruption. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic model to simulate the flux feeding processes in HFT
configurations. It is found that flux feeding injects axial magnetic flux into
the flux rope, whereas the poloidal flux of the rope is reduced after flux
feeding. Flux feeding is able to cause the flux rope to erupt, provided that
the injected axial flux is large enough so that the critical axial flux of the
rope is reached. Otherwise, the flux rope system evolves to a stable
equilibrium state after flux feeding, which might be even farther away from the
onset of the eruption, indicating that flux feeding could stabilize the rope
system with the HFT configuration in this circumstance.

a user based on her current accessed ones. While new-coming users continuously

produce embeddings of users and items without re-training. Given user-item
interactions can be extremely sparse, another critical task is to have
transferable SR that can transfer the knowledge derived from one domain with
rich data to another domain. In this work, we aim to present the holistic SR
that simultaneously accommodates conventional, inductive, and transferable
settings. We propose a novel deep learning-based model, Relational Temporal
Attentive Graph Neural Networks (RetaGNN), for holistic SR. The main idea of
RetaGNN is three-fold. First, to have inductive and transferable capabilities,
we train a relational attentive GNN on the local subgraph extracted from a
user-item pair, in which the learnable weight matrices are on various relations
among users, items, and attributes, rather than nodes or edges. Second,
long-term and short-term temporal patterns of user preferences are encoded by a
proposed sequential self-attention mechanism. Third, a relation-aware
regularization term is devised for better training of RetaGNN. Experiments
conducted on MovieLens, Instagram, and Book-Crossing datasets exhibit that
RetaGNN can outperform state-of-the-art methods under conventional, inductive,
and transferable settings. The derived attention weights also bring model
explainability.

UAV-enabled Internet of things (IoT) for B5G/6G networks, from a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The federated learning is an effective
framework to train a shared model between decentralized edge devices or servers
without exchanging raw data, which can help protect data privacy. In
UAV-enabled IoT networks, latency and energy consumption are two important
metrics limiting the performance of FEEL. Although most of existing works have
studied how to reduce the latency and improve the energy efficiency, few works
have investigated the impact of limited batteries at the devices on the FEEL.
Motivated by this, we study the battery-constrained FEEL, where the UAVs can
adjust their operating CPU-frequency to prolong the battery life and avoid
withdrawing from federated learning training untimely. We optimize the system
by jointly allocating the computational resource and wireless bandwidth in
time-varying environments. To solve this optimization problem, we employ a deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based strategy, where a linear combination
of latency and energy consumption is used to evaluate the system cost.
Simulation results are finally demonstrated to show that the proposed strategy
outperforms the conventional ones. In particular, it enables all the devices to
complete all rounds of FEEL with limited batteries and meanwhile reduce the
system cost effectively.

learning approaches to fairness in consequential decision making. After
challenging the validity of these assumptions in real-world applications, we
propose ways to move forward when they are violated. First, we show that group
fairness criteria purely based on statistical properties of observed data are
fundamentally limited. Revisiting this limitation from a causal viewpoint we
develop a more versatile conceptual framework, causal fairness criteria, and
first algorithms to achieve them. We also provide tools to analyze how
sensitive a believed-to-be causally fair algorithm is to misspecifications of
the causal graph. Second, we overcome the assumption that sensitive data is
readily available in practice. To this end we devise protocols based on secure
multi-party computation to train, validate, and contest fair decision
algorithms without requiring users to disclose their sensitive data or decision
makers to disclose their models. Finally, we also accommodate the fact that
outcome labels are often only observed when a certain decision has been made.
We suggest a paradigm shift away from training predictive models towards
directly learning decisions to relax the traditional assumption that labels can
always be recorded. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of
theoretically substantiated and practically feasible methods to move research
on fair machine learning closer to real-world applications.

triboelectric charging and triboelectric series based on friction-originated
thermoelectric charging effects at the interface, characterized by the material
density (${\rho}$), specific heat (c), thermal conductivity (k), and Seebeck

at the interface induces temperature variations in the materials and thus
develops electrostatic potentials that will initiate thermoelectric charging
across the interface. We find that the trends and quantities of triboelectric

clouds are simply governed by the triboelectric factor
${\xi}=S/\sqrt{{\rho}ck}$. The triboelectric figure-of-merit is expressed with
the triboelectric power K=${\xi}\sqrt{t/{\pi}}$, of which the difference can be

non-detection of any X-ray bright compact objects in these remnants when
previously studied. Five SNRs were searched for radio pulsars with the Green
Bank Telescope at 820 MHz with multiple pointings to cover the full spatial
extent of the remnants. A periodicity search plus an acceleration search up to
500 m/s^2 and a single pulse search were performed for each pointing in order
to detect potential isolated binary pulsars and single pulses, respectively. No
new pulsars were detected in the survey. However, we were able to re-detect a
known pulsar, PSR J2047+5029, near SNR G89.0+4.7. We were unable to detect the
radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J2021+4026, but we do find a flux density
limit of 0.08 mJy. Our flux density limits make our survey two to 16 times more
sensitive than previous surveys, while also covering the whole spatial extent
of the same remnants. We discuss potential explanations for the non-detection
of a pulsar in the studied SNRs and conclude that sensitivity is still the most
likely factor responsible for the lack of pulsars in some remnants.

functional renormalization group, we find that the ground state is unstable to
any modification of the disorder configuration (""disorder"" chaos) or variation
of the Luttinger parameter (""quantum"" chaos, analog to the ""temperature"" chaos

copies of the system, with slightly different disorder configurations or
Luttinger parameters, and showing that inter-copy statistical correlations are
suppressed at length scales larger than an overlap length
$\xi_{\mathrm{ov}}\sim |\epsilon|^{-1/\alpha}$ ($|\epsilon|\ll 1$ is a measure
of the difference between the disorder distributions or Luttinger parameters of
the two copies). The chaos exponent $\alpha$ can be obtained by computing
$\xi_{\mathrm{ov}}$ or by studying the instability of the Bose-glass fixed
point for the two-copy system when $\epsilon\neq 0$. The renormalized,
functional, inter-copy disorder correlator departs from its fixed-point value
-- characterized by cuspy singularities -- via a chaos boundary layer, in the
same way as it approaches the Bose-glass fixed point when $\epsilon=0$ through
a quantum boundary layer. Performing a linear analysis of perturbations about

allow us to obtain closed deterministic dynamical systems that describe the
exact time evolution of the moments of uncertain states of an important class

global convergence also allows for slowly varying amplitudes, which is useful
for applications with damped oscillations or additionally shaped harmonic

therefore these products are susceptible to food fraud and adulteration. Hence
statistical tools studying potential differences among milk samples coming from

security around the authenticity of the products. Infrared spectroscopy
techniques are widely used to collect data on milk samples and to predict milk
related traits. While these data are routinely used to predict the composition

reasonable values for the number of latent factors and clusters. The method is

long-lived chemistry. Second, as a radical, C2H is rapidly destroyed, within
<1000 yr. These two statements hint that the chemistry responsible for C2H
emission must be predominantly in the gas-phase and must be in equilibrium.
Combining new and published chemical models we find that elevating the total
volatile (gas and ice) C/O ratio is the only natural way to create a long
lived, high C2H abundance. Most of the \ce{C2H} resides in gas with a Fuv/n-gas
~ 10^-7 G0 cm^3. To elevate the volatile C/O ratio, additional carbon has to be
released into the gas to enable an equilibrium chemistry under oxygen-poor
conditions. Photo-ablation of carbon-rich grains seems the most straightforward
way to elevate the C/O ratio above 1.5, powering a long-lived equilibrium
cycle. The regions at which the conditions are optimal for the presence of high
C/O ratio and elevated C2H abundances in the gas disk set by the Fuv/n-gas ~
10^-7 G0 cm^3 condition lie just outside the pebble disk as well as possibly in

sequences. It is laborious, and can be susceptible to interobserver variation.
Prior studies have attempted to automate this process, but few have
demonstrated an integrated suite of algorithms for the end-to-end analysis of
angiograms. We report an automated analysis pipeline based on deep learning to
rapidly and objectively assess coronary angiograms, highlight coronary vessels
of interest, and quantify potential stenosis. We propose a 3-stage automated
analysis method consisting of key frame extraction, vessel segmentation, and
stenosis measurement. We combined powerful deep learning approaches such as
ResNet and U-Net with traditional image processing and geometrical analysis. We
trained and tested our algorithms on the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO) view of
the right coronary artery (RCA) using anonymized angiograms obtained from a
tertiary cardiac institution, then tested the generalizability of our technique
to the Right Anterior Oblique (RAO) view. We demonstrated an overall
improvement on previous work, with key frame extraction top-5 precision of
98.4%, vessel segmentation F1-Score of 0.891 and stenosis measurement 20.7%

algorithms to identify items a given user likes over time, based on ratings
that this user and a large number of other users have provided in the past.
This problem has been studied extensively when users' preferences do not change
over time (static case); an assumption that is often violated in practical
settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for online non-stationary
recommendation systems which allows for temporal uncertainties in the users'
preferences. For this model, we propose a user-based CF algorithm, and provide
a theoretical analysis of its achievable reward. Compared to related
non-stationary multi-armed bandit literature, the main fundamental difficulty
in our model lies in the fact that variations in the preferences of a certain
user may affect the recommendations for other users severely. We also test our
algorithm over real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in real-world
applications. One of the main surprising observations in our experiments is the
fact our algorithm outperforms other static algorithms even when preferences do
not change over time. This hints toward the general conclusion that in
practice, dynamic algorithms, such as the one we propose, might be beneficial
even in stationary environments.

formation and evolution history. Recent interior models of Jupiter that fit
Juno's measured gravitational field suggest an inhomogeneous interior and
potentially the existence of a diluted core. These models, however, strongly
depend on the model assumptions and the equations of state used. A
complementary modelling approach is to use empirical structure models. These
can later be used to reveal new insights on the planetary interior and be
compared to standard models. Here we present empirical structure models of
Jupiter where the density profile is constructed by piecewise-polytropic
equations. With these models we investigate the relation between the normalized
moment of inertia (MoI) and the gravitational moments $J_2$ and $J_4$. Given
that only the first few gravitational moments of Jupiter are measured with high
precision, we show that an accurate and independent measurement of the MoI
value could be used to further constrain Jupiter's interior. An independent
measurement of the MoI with an accuracy better than $\sim 0.1\%$ could
constrain Jupiter's core region and density discontinuities in its envelope. We
find that models with a density discontinuity at $\sim$ 1 Mbar, as would
produce a presumed hydrogen-helium separation, correspond to a fuzzy core in
Jupiter. We next test the appropriateness of using polytropes, by comparing
them with empirical models based on polynomials. We conclude that both
representations result in similar density profiles and ranges of values for
quantities like core mass and MoI.

measuring network quality. The standard centers on the notion of quality
attenuation. Quality attenuation is a measure of the distribution of latency
and packet loss between two points connected by a network path. A vital feature
of the quality attenuation idea is that we can express detailed application
requirements and network performance measurements in the same mathematical
framework. Performance requirements and measurements are both modeled as
latency distributions. To the best of our knowledge, existing models of the
802.11 WiFi protocol do not permit the calculation of complete latency
distributions without assuming steady-state operation. We present a novel model
of the WiFi protocol. Instead of computing throughput numbers from a
steady-state analysis of a Markov chain, we explicitly model latency and packet
loss. Explicitly modeling latency and loss allows for both transient and
steady-state analysis of latency distributions, and we can derive throughput
numbers from the latency results. Our model is, therefore, more general than
the standard Markov chain methods. We reproduce several known results with this
method. Using transient analysis, we derive bounds on WiFi throughput under the
requirement that latency and packet loss must be bounded.

model the statistics of the differences between adjacent or neighboring video
frames that have been slightly spatially displaced relative to one another. We
find that when these space-time differences are further subjected to locally
pooled divisive normalization, statistical regularities (or lack thereof) arise
that depend on the local motion trajectory. We find that bandpass and
divisively normalized frame-differences that are displaced along the motion
direction exhibit stronger statistical regularities than for other

finding the space-time displacement paths that best preserve statistical

behaviors in the flow. The governing equations are restricted to linear regime
so that the velocity and streaming potential fields can be solved analytically.
Based on the interaction of viscoelastic shear waves, we explain the mechanism
of resonance, and derive a critical Deborah number Dec = 1/4 which dictates the
occurrence of resonance. Using the Maxwell fluid model, we show that the
resonance enhances electrokinetic effects and results in a dramatic increase of
electrokinetic energy conversion efficiency. However, by applying the Oldroyd-B
fluid model it reveals that the amplification of efficiency is suppressed even
for a very small Newtonian solvent contribution. This may be one of the reasons
that experimental verification regarding the high efficiency predicted by
Bandopadhyay & Chakraborty (Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 101, 2012, 043905) is
unavailable in the literature. Furthermore, the damping effect of solvent
viscosity is more significant for higher-order resonances. Introducing the
factor of multiple relaxation times, we show that the occurrence of resonances
for the streaming potential field and the flow rate are still dominated by Dec.
For the efficiency in the multi-mode case, the occurrence of resonance is
dominated by the Deborah number De and the mode number N, and the resonance
disappears for small De or large N. In addition, a new type of scaling relation
between the streaming potential field and EDL thickness can be identified at
large De.

One of the most successful approaches predicts neighbors of each unlabeled

high precision neighbor pseudo labels and high recall group pseudo labels. The
group pseudo labels are generated by transitively merging neighbors of
different samples into a group to achieve higher recall. However, the merging
operation may cause subgroups in the group due to imperfect neighbor

broken Weyl systems. This is, however, possible only in the particle-hole
symmetry broken regime obtained for finite chemical potential $\mu$. Although
weakly, breaking time-reversal symmetry suppresses the Kondo resonance,
especially in the single-node Weyl semimetals. More interesting Kondo screening
regimes are obtained for inversion symmetry broken multi-Weyl fermions. In
these systems the Kondo regimes of double- and triple-Weyl node models are much
richer than in the single-Weyl node model. While in the single-Weyl node model
the Kondo temperature increases monotonically with $|\mu|$ regardless the value

arise from spin-transfer torques that lead to Doppler shifted spin waves. For
sufficiently large electrical currents, spin-wave excitations have negative
energy with respect to the uniform magnetic ground state, while remaining
dynamically stable due to dissipative spin-transfer torques. Hence, the uniform
magnetic ground state is energetically unstable, but is not able to dynamically
reach the new ground state. We estimate this to happen for current densities $
j\gtrsim (1-D/D_c)10^{13} \mathrm{A/m^2} $ in typical thin film experiments,
with $ D $ the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction constant, and $ D_c $ the

  Interactions",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SI q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivation: Exploring drug-protein interactions (DPIs) work as a pivotal step
in drug discovery. The fast expansion of available biological data enables
computational methods effectively assist in experimental methods. Among them,
deep learning methods extract features only from basic characteristics, such as
protein sequences, molecule structures. Others achieve significant improvement
by learning from not only sequences/molecules but the protein-protein and
drug-drug associations (PPAs and DDAs). The PPAs and DDAs are generally
obtained by using computational methods. However, existing computational
methods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that
hamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel
supervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby
improve the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI. Results: In
this research, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely BridgeDPI.
BridgeDPI introduces a class of nodes named hyper-nodes, which bridge different
proteins/drugs to work as PPAs and DDAs. The hyper-nodes can be supervised
learned for the specific task of DPI since the whole process is an end-to-end
learning. Consequently, such a model would improve prediction performance of
DPI. In three real-world datasets, we further demonstrate that BridgeDPI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies verify the
effectiveness of the hyper-nodes. Last, in an independent verification,
BridgeDPI explores the candidate bindings among COVID-19's proteins and various
antiviral drugs. And the predictive results accord with the statement of the
World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration, showing the
validity and reliability of BridgeDPI.

identify the most suitable items that satisfy personal preferences. As
user-item interactions can be naturally modelled as graph-structured data,
variants of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become a well-established
building block in the latest recommenders. Due to the wide utilization of
sensitive user profile data, existing recommendation paradigms are likely to
expose users to the threat of privacy breach, and GCN-based recommenders are no
exception. Apart from the leakage of raw user data, the fragility of current
recommenders under inference attacks offers malicious attackers a backdoor to
estimate users' private attributes via their behavioral footprints and the
recommendation results. However, little attention has been paid to developing
recommender systems that can defend such attribute inference attacks, and
existing works achieve attack resistance by either sacrificing considerable
recommendation accuracy or only covering specific attack models or protected
information. In our paper, we propose GERAI, a novel differentially private
graph convolutional network to address such limitations. Specifically, in
GERAI, we bind the information perturbation mechanism in differential privacy
with the recommendation capability of graph convolutional networks.
Furthermore, based on local differential privacy and functional mechanism, we
innovatively devise a dual-stage encryption paradigm to simultaneously enforce
privacy guarantee on users' sensitive features and the model optimization
process. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GERAI in terms of its
resistance to attribute inference attacks and recommendation effectiveness.

home-town areas and visit the areas they have never been to before. It is
challenging to recommend Point-of-Interests (POIs) for out-of-town users since
the out-of-town check-in behavior is determined by not only the user's
home-town preference but also the user's travel intention. Besides, the user's
travel intentions are complex and dynamic, which leads to big difficulties in
understanding such intentions precisely. In this paper, we propose a
TRAvel-INtention-aware Out-of-town Recommendation framework, named TRAINOR. The
proposed TRAINOR framework distinguishes itself from existing out-of-town
recommenders in three aspects. First, graph neural networks are explored to
represent users' home-town check-in preference and geographical constraints in
out-of-town check-in behaviors. Second, a user-specific travel intention is
formulated as an aggregation combining home-town preference and generic travel
intention together, where the generic travel intention is regarded as a mixture
of inherent intentions that can be learned by Neural Topic Model (NTM). Third,
a non-linear mapping function, as well as a matrix factorization method, are
employed to transfer users' home-town preference and estimate out-of-town POI's
representation, respectively. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets
validate the effectiveness of the TRAINOR framework. Moreover, the learned
travel intention can deliver meaningful explanations for understanding a user's
travel purposes.

has been a roadblock in achieving predictability in the spread and containment

effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any
effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can
be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence
of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data
collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical
variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population
demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model -- the Blue Sky
model -- and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a
solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the
data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease
spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a
model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The
methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission
of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The
predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology
can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during
a pandemic.

we compute the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and surface energies

self-consistent DFT+DMFT method. Our results reveal a complex interplay between
electronic correlations and surface effects in NiO, with the electronic
structure of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ NiO surfaces being significantly different
from that in bulk NiO. We obtain a sizeable reduction of the band gap at the
surface of NiO, which is most significant for the $(110)$ NiO surface. This
suggests a higher catalytic activity of the $(110)$ NiO surface than that of
the $(001)$ NiO one. Our results reveal a charge-transfer character of the
$(001)$ and $(110)$ surfaces of NiO. Most notably, for the $(110)$ NiO surface
we observe a remarkable electronic state characterized by an alternating
charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard character of the band gap in the surface and
subsurface NiO layers, respectively. This novel form of electronic order
stabilized by strong correlations is not driven by lattice reconstructions but
of purely electronic origin. We notice the importance of
orbital-differentiation of the Ni $e_g$ states to characterize the Mott-Hubbard
insulating state of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ NiO surfaces. The unoccupied Ni
$e_g$ surface states are seen to split from the lower edge of the conduction
band to form strongly localized states in the fundamental gap of bulk NiO. Our
results for the surface energies of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ NiO surfaces show
that the $(001)$ facet of NiO has significantly lower energy. This implies that
the relative stability of different surfaces, at least from a purely energetic
point of view, does not depend on the presence or absence of magnetic order in
NiO.

description of the changes induced by meditation on human brain. Longitudinal
studies have reported morphological changes in cortical thickness and volume in
selected brain regions due to meditation practice, which is interpreted as
evidence for effectiveness of it beyond the subjective self reporting. Evidence
based on real time monitoring of meditating brain by functional imaging
modalities such as MEG or EEG remains a challenge. In this article we consider
MEG data collected during meditation sessions of experienced Buddhist monks
practicing focused attention (Samatha) and open monitoring (Vipassana)
meditation, contrasted by resting state with eyes closed. The MEG data is first
mapped to time series of brain activity averaged over brain regions
corresponding to a standard Destrieux brain atlas, and further by bootstrapping
and spectral analysis to data matrices representing a random sample of power
spectral densities over bandwidths corresponding to $\alpha$, $\beta$,
$\gamma$, and $\theta$ bands in the spectral range. We demonstrate using linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) that the samples corresponding to different
meditative or resting states contain enough fingerprints of the brain state to
allow a separation between different states, and we identify the brain regions
that appear to contribute to the separation. Our findings suggest that
cingulate cortex, insular cortex and some of the internal structures, most
notably accumbens, caudate and putamen nuclei, thalamus and amygdalae stand out
as separating regions, which seems to correlate well with earlier findings

interactions between pairs of vertices, and a large corpus has emerged on their
mining and modeling. However, many phenomena are comprised of polyadic
interactions between more than two vertices. Such complex hypergraphs range
from emails among groups of individuals, scholarly collaboration, or joint
interactions of proteins in living cells.
  A key generative principle within social and other complex networks is
transitivity, where friends of friends are more likely friends. The previously
proposed Iterated Local Transitivity (ILT) model incorporated transitivity as
an evolutionary mechanism. The ILT model provably satisfies many observed
properties of social networks, such as densification, low average distances,
and high clustering coefficients.
  We propose a new, generative model for complex hypergraphs based on
transitivity, called the Iterated Local Transitivity Hypergraph (or ILTH)
model. In ILTH, we iteratively apply the principle of transitivity to form new
hypergraphs. The resulting model generates hypergraphs simulating properties
observed in real-world complex hypergraphs, such as densification and low
average distances. We consider properties unique to hypergraphs not captured by
their 2-section. We show that certain motifs, which are specified
subhypergraphs of small order, have faster growth rates in ILTH hypergraphs
than in random hypergraphs with the same order and expected average degree. We
show that the graphs admitting a homomorphism into the 2-section of the initial
hypergraph appear as induced subgraphs in the 2-section of ILTH hypergraphs. We
consider new and existing hypergraph clustering coefficients, and show that
these coefficients have larger values in ILTH hypergraphs than in comparable
random hypergraphs.

capabilities play a key role for safely performing the robot's task.
Probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) have been proposed for representing
adaptable movement skills, which are modelled as Gaussian distributions over
trajectories. These are analytically tractable and can be learned from a small
number of demonstrations. However, both the original ProMP formulation and the
subsequent approaches only provide solutions to specific movement adaptation
problems, e.g., obstacle avoidance, and a generic, unifying, probabilistic
approach to adaptation is missing. In this paper we develop a generic
probabilistic framework for adapting ProMPs. We unify previous adaptation
techniques, for example, various types of obstacle avoidance, via-points,
mutual avoidance, in one single framework and combine them to solve complex
robotic problems. Additionally, we derive novel adaptation techniques such as
temporally unbound via-points and mutual avoidance. We formulate adaptation as
a constrained optimisation problem where we minimise the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the adapted distribution and the distribution of the
original primitive while we constrain the probability mass associated with
undesired trajectories to be low. We demonstrate our approach on several
adaptation problems on simulated planar robot arms and 7-DOF Franka-Emika

communication based on quantum mechanical principles. To improve the secure key
rate of a QKD system, most studies on reconciliation primarily focused on
improving the efficiency. With the increasing performance of QKD systems, the
research priority has shifted to the improvement of both throughput and
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a high performance solution of Cascade
reconciliation, including a high-throughput-oriented framework and an
integrated-optimization-oriented scheme. Benefiting from the fully utilizing
computation and storage resources, effectively dealing with communication
delays, the integrated-optimization-oriented parameters setting, etc., an
excellent overall performance was achieved. Experimental results showed that,
the throughput of up to 570Mbps with an efficiency of 1.038 was achieved,
which, to our knowledge, was more than four times faster than any throughput
previously demonstrated. Furthermore, throughputs on real data sets were
capable of reaching up to 86Mbps even on embedded platforms. Additionally, our
solution offers good adaptability to the fluctuating communication delay and
quantum bit error rate (QBER). Based on our study, low performance (i.e. low
power-consumption and cost-effective) CPU platforms will be sufficient for
reconciliation in the existing and near-term QKD systems.

compared by the collapsing bubble cavity during the sequential stages of the

entrains the surrounding gas-phase. During the successive stages of air
entrainment, spatiotemporal characteristics of the vortex ring are obtained. At
low Bond numbers (< 1), after comparing the phase contours of evacuating inner

then information into empirical knowledge. To be valid, the process that goes
from data to knowledge should be supported by detailed, rigorous guidelines,
which help ferret out issues with the data or model, and lead to qualified
results that strike a reasonable balance between generality and practical
relevance. Such guidelines are being developed by statisticians to support the
latest techniques for Bayesian data analysis. In this article, we frame these
guidelines in a way that is apt to empirical research in software engineering.
  To demonstrate the guidelines in practice, we apply them to reanalyze a
GitHub dataset about code quality in different programming languages. The
dataset's original analysis (Ray et al., 2014) and a critical reanalysis
(Berger at al., 2019) have attracted considerable attention -- in no small part
because they target a topic (the impact of different programming languages) on
which strong opinions abound. The goals of our reanalysis are largely
orthogonal to this previous work, as we are concerned with demonstrating, on
data in an interesting domain, how to build a principled Bayesian data analysis
and to showcase some of its benefits. In the process, we will also shed light
on some critical aspects of the analyzed data and of the relationship between
programming languages and code quality.
  The high-level conclusions of our exercise will be that Bayesian statistical
techniques can be applied to analyze software engineering data in a way that is
principled, flexible, and leads to convincing results that inform the state of
the art while highlighting the boundaries of its validity. The guidelines can
support building solid statistical analyses and connecting their results, and
hence help buttress continued progress in empirical software engineering
research.

degrees of freedom. The valley degree of freedom originates from the bulk
bandstructure of silicon, which has six degenerate electronic minima. The
degeneracy can be lifted in silicon quantum wells due to strain and electronic
confinement, but the ""valley splitting"" of the two lowest lying valleys is
known to be sensitive to atomic-scale disorder. Large valley splittings are
desirable to have a well-defined spin qubit. In addition, an understanding of
the inter-valley tunnel coupling that couples different valleys in adjacent
quantum dots is extremely important, as the resulting gaps in the energy level
diagram may affect the fidelity of charge and spin transfer protocols in
silicon quantum dot arrays. Here we use microwave spectroscopy to probe spatial
variations in the valley splitting, and the intra- and inter-valley tunnel
couplings ($t_{ij}$ and $t'_{ij}$) that couple dots $i$ and $j$ in a triple
quantum dot (TQD). We uncover large spatial variations in the ratio of
inter-valley to intra-valley tunnel couplings $t_{12}'/t_{12}=0.90$ and
$t_{23}'/t_{23}=0.56$. By tuning the interdot tunnel barrier we also show that
$t'_{ij}$ scales linearly with $t_{ij}$, as expected from theory. The results
indicate strong interactions between different valley states on neighboring

performance compared with that of the commonly used self-consistent field
approach. Results are presented for the G2 set of 148 molecules, liquid water
configurations with up to 576 molecules and some insulating crystals. A general
preconditioner is presented that is applicable to systems with fractional
orbital occupation as is, for example, needed in the k-point sampling for
periodic systems. This exponential transformation direct minimization approach
is found to outperform the standard implementation of the self-consistent field
approach in that all the calculations converge with the same set of parameter
values and it requires less computational effort on average. The formulation of
the exponential transformation and the gradients of the energy presented here
are quite general and can be applied to energy functionals that are not unitary
invariant such as self-interaction corrected functionals.

conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of
stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable
attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to
deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain
relationships. The rare studies addressing this issue have focused on
deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of such
strategies. Herein, we introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable
patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses.
Using shortest-path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient
selection method to obtain required resistance-strain relationship. Using this
algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant
resistance-strain responses up to 50% elongation using a single micro-textured
material. Finally, we demonstrate counter-intuitive sinusoidal responses by
integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft

inequalities, such as random sampling theory or Azuma's inequality. The latter
can be straightforwardly employed in a wider class of QKD protocols, including
those that do not rely on mutually unbiased encoding bases, such as the

disentangle the sources of discrepancy observed in computed potentials of mean

However, we also unveil that for some models, small changes in the solution
density can have significant effects on modifying the equilibrium balance
between the two configurations. We conclude that the thermodynamic stability of
contact and solvent-separated ion pairs is very sensitive to the dielectric
properties of the underlying simulation model. In general, classical models are
very robust on providing a similar estimation of the contact ion pair
stability, while this is much more variable in density functional theory-based
models. The barrier to transition from solvent-separated to contact ion pair is
fundamentally dependent on the balance between electrostatic potential energy
and entropy. This reflects the importance of water intra- and inter-molecular
polarizability in obtaining an accurate description of the screened ion-ion
interactions.

from the equilibrium black holes with killing horizon, where the temperatures
are uniform. Therefore, the black hole with non-killing horizon can be overall
in non-equilibrium steady state while the Hawking temperature of the black
funnel can be viewed as the local temperature and the corresponding Hawking
radiation can be regarded as being in the local equilibrium with the horizon of
the black funnel. By AdS/CFT, we discuss some possible implications of our
results of local Hawking temperature for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of

positive results when compared to in-vivo measurements. In this context, the
numerical implementation of boundary conditions able to keep memory of the

when dealing with large circulatory systems. In this work, viscoelasticity is
taken into account in entire networks via the Standard Linear Solid Model. The
implementation of the viscoelastic contribution at boundaries (inlet, outlet

mathematical model. A non-linear system is established based on the definition
of the Riemann Problem at junctions, characterized by rarefaction waves
separated by contact discontinuities, among which the mass and the total energy
are conserved. Basic junction tests are analyzed, such as a trivial 2-vessels
junction, for both a generic artery and vein, and a simple 3-vessels junction,
considering an aortic bifurcation scenario. The chosen asymptotic-preserving
IMEX Runge-Kutta Finite Volume scheme is demonstrated to be second-order
accurate in the whole domain and well-balanced, even when including junctions.
Two different benchmark models of the arterial network are implemented,
differing in number of vessels and in viscoelastic parameters. Comparison of
the results obtained in the two networks underlines the high sensitivity of the
model to the chosen viscoelastic parameters. The conservation of the

assessed in the whole network, including junctions and boundary conditions.

noncommutative gauge theories in general backgrounds of string theory, and give
novel explicit constructions using techniques based on symplectic embeddings of
almost Poisson structures. In the absence of fluxes the gauge symmetries close
a Poisson gauge algebra and their action is governed by a $P_\infty$-algebra
which we construct explicitly from the symplectic embedding. In curved
backgrounds they close a field dependent gauge algebra governed by an
$L_\infty$-algebra which is not a $P_\infty$-algebra. Our technique produces
new all orders constructions which are significantly simpler compared to
previous approaches, and we illustrate its applicability in several examples of
interest in noncommutative field theory and gravity. We further show that our
symplectic embeddings naturally define a $P_\infty$-structure on the exterior
algebra of differential forms on a generic almost Poisson manifold, which
generalizes earlier constructions of differential graded Poisson algebras, and
suggests a new approach to defining noncommutative gauge theories beyond the
gauge sector and the semi-classical limit based on $A_\infty$-algebras.

a relatively recent research direction, with a host of promising results. As
the field progresses, direct in-depth comparisons of distinct artificial spin
systems are crucial to advancing the field. While studies have investigated the
effects of different lattice geometries, little comparison exists between
systems comprising continuously connected nanostructures, where spin-waves
propagate via dipole-exchange interaction, and systems with nanobars
disconnected at vertices where spin-wave propagation occurs via stray
dipolar-field. Gaining understanding of how these very different coupling
methods affect both spin-wave dynamics and magnetic reversal is key for the
field to progress and provides crucial system-design information including for
future systems containing combinations of connected and disconnected elements.
Here, we study the magnonic response of two kagome spin ices via Brillouin
light scattering, a continuously connected system and a disconnected system
with vertex gaps. We observe distinct high-frequency dynamics and magnetization
reversal regimes between the systems, with key distinctions in spin-wave
localization and mode quantization, microstate-trajectory during reversal and
internal field-profiles. These observations are pertinent for the fundamental
understanding of artificial spin systems and broader design and engineering of
reconfigurable functional magnonic crystals.

to build data dissemination systems using permissioned, private ledgers where

easy-to-use MRI reconstruction framework using the scientific programming
language Julia.
  Methods: Julia is a modern, general purpose programming language with strong
features in the area of signal / image processing and numerical computing. It
has a high-level syntax but still generates efficient machine code that is
usually as fast as comparable C/C++ applications. In addition to the language
features itself, Julia has a sophisticated package management system that makes
proper modularization of functionality across different packages feasible. Our
developed MRI reconstruction framework MRIReco.jl can therefore reuse existing
functionality from other Julia packages and concentrate on the MRI-related
parts. This includes common imaging operators and support for MRI raw data
formats.
  Results: MRIReco.jl is a simple to use framework with a high degree of
accessibility. While providing a simple-to-use interface, many of its
components can easily be extended and customized. The performance of MRIReco.jl
is compared to the Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) and we show
that the Julia framework achieves comparable reconstruction speed as the
popular C/C++ library.
  Conclusion: Modern programming languages can bridge the gap between high
performance and accessible implementations. MRIReco.jl leverages this fact and
contributes a promising environment for future algorithmic development in MRI
reconstruction.

over the years. Rooted into statistical physics, the ERGMs framework has been
successfully employed for reconstructing networks, detecting statistically
significant patterns in graphs, counting networked configurations with given
properties. From a technical point of view, the ERGMs workflow is defined by
two subsequent optimization steps: the first one concerns the maximization of
Shannon entropy and leads to identify the functional form of the ensemble
probability distribution that is maximally non-committal with respect to the
missing information; the second one concerns the maximization of the likelihood
function induced by this probability distribution and leads to its numerical
determination. This second step translates into the resolution of a system of
$O(N)$ non-linear, coupled equations (with $N$ being the total number of nodes
of the network under analysis), a problem that is affected by three main
issues, i.e. accuracy, speed and scalability. The present paper aims at
addressing these problems by comparing the performance of three algorithms
(i.e. Newton's method, a quasi-Newton method and a recently-proposed
fixed-point recipe) in solving several ERGMs, defined by binary and weighted
constraints in both a directed and an undirected fashion. While Newton's method
performs best for relatively little networks, the fixed-point recipe is to be
preferred when large configurations are considered, as it ensures convergence
to the solution within seconds for networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes
(e.g. the Internet, Bitcoin). We attach to the paper a Python code implementing
the three aforementioned algorithms on all the ERGMs considered in the present
work.

radio-undetected quasars, but that the loudest, most luminous and largest radio

radio-detection fraction increases with blueshift whereas the radio-loud
fraction decreases. In the radio-quiet population, we observe a range of HeII
equivalent widths as well as a Baldwin effect with bolometric luminosity,
whilst the radio-loud population has mostly strong HeII, consistent with a
stronger soft X-ray flux. The presence of strong HeII is a necessary but not
sufficient condition to detect radio-loud emission suggesting some degree of

state-of-the-art models for this task assume that all documents are of the same
type (e.g. news articles) or fall under the same theme. However, it is also
desirable to perform CDCR across different domains (type or theme). A
particular use case we focus on in this paper is the resolution of entities
mentioned across scientific work and newspaper articles that discuss them.
Identifying the same entities and corresponding concepts in both scientific
articles and news can help scientists understand how their work is represented
in mainstream media. We propose a new task and English language dataset for
cross-document cross-domain co-reference resolution (CD$^2$CR). The task aims
to identify links between entities across heterogeneous document types. We show
that in this cross-domain, cross-document setting, existing CDCR models do not
perform well and we provide a baseline model that outperforms current

of features with central pits and radial troughs which are thought to be
associated with the solid state greenhouse effect under a CO$_{2}$ ice sheet.
Sublimation at the base of this ice leads to gas buildup, fracturing of the ice
and the flow of gas and entrained regolith out of vents and onto the surface.
There are two possible pathways for the gas: through the gap between the ice
slab and the underlying regolith, as proposed by Kieffer et al (2007), or
through the pores of a permeable regolith layer, which would imply that
regolith properties can control the spacing between adjacent spiders, as
suggested by Hao et al. We test this hypothesis quantitatively in order to
place constraints on the regolith properties. Based on previously estimated
flow rates and thermophysical arguments, we suggest that there is insufficient
depth of porous regolith to support the full gas flow through the regolith. By
contrast, free gas flow through a regolith--ice gap is capable of supplying the
likely flow rates for gap sizes on the order of a centimetre. This size of gap
can be opened in the centre of a spider feature by gas pressure bending the
overlying ice slab upwards, or by levitating it entirely as suggested in the
original Kieffer et al (2007) model. Our calculations therefore support at
least some of the gas flowing through a gap opened between the regolith and
ice. Regolith properties most likely still play a role in the evolution of
spider morphology, by regolith cohesion controlling the erosion of the central
pit and troughs, for example.

reveal that the two proposed slicing approaches outperform today's Wi-Fi access

lower latency for time-critical slices. Simultaneously, the proposed approach
is up to 32 times more energy efficient, when considering slices tailored for

spacetime dimensions greater than four. We prove that under unitary defect
renormalization group (RG) flows, the defect $a$-anomaly must decrease, thus
establishing the defect $a$-theorem. For conformal defects preserving minimal
supersymmetry, the full defect symmetry contains a distinguished $U(1)_R$

decades. The challenge is of improving bandwidth with limited spectrum and
power consumption, which however has gradually become a bottleneck with
evolution going on. The intrinsic problem is that communication is modeled as a
message transportation from sender to receiver and pursues for an exact message
replication in Shannon's information theory, which certainly leads to large
bandwidth and power requirements with data explosion. However, the goal for
communication among intelligent agents, entities with intelligence including
humans, is to understand the meaning or semantics underlying data, not an
accurate recovery of the transmitted messages. The separate first transmission
and then understanding is a waste on bandwidth. In this article, we deploy
semantics to solve the spectrum and power bottleneck and propose a first
understanding and then transmission framework with high semantic fidelity. We
first give a brief introduction of semantics covering the definition and
properties to show the insights and scope of this paper. Then the proposed
communication towards semantic fidelity framework is introduced, which takes
the above mentioned properties into account to further improve efficiency.
Specially, a semantic transformation is introduced to transform the input into
semantic symbols. Different from the conventional transformations in signal
processing area, for example discrete cosine transform, the transformation is
with data loss, which is also the reason that the proposed framework can
achieve large bandwidth saving with high semantic fidelity. Besides, we also
discuss semantic noise and performance measurement. To evaluate the
effectiveness, a case study of audio transmission is carried out. Finally, we
discuss the typical applications and open challenges.

lithography and, with few exceptions, on academic style lift-off processes.
Although these fabrication techniques offer process flexibility, they suffer
from low yield and poor uniformity. An important question is whether the

high yield, throughput, and uniformity of transistors are suitable for quantum

demonstrate quantum dots hosted at a 28Si/28SiO2 interface, fabricated in a 300

Wiesel [37] in order to prove the stability of Martingale Optimal Transport

set of martingale couplings between these two marginals. In reason of the lack
of relative compactness of the set of couplings with given marginals for the
adapted Wasserstein topology, the existence of such a projection is not clear
at all. Under a barycentre dispersion assumption on the original coupling which
is in particular satisfied by the Hoeffding-Fr\'echet or comonotone coupling,
Wiesel gives a clear algorithmic construction of a martingale rearrangement

the lack of relative compactness. Here, we give a direct general construction
of a martingale rearrangement coupling under the barycentre dispersion

that both bulk phase and isolated $VS_4$ NWs are semiconductors with band gaps
of 2.24 and 2.64 eV, respectively, and that they prefer the antiferromagnetic

that isolated $VS_4$ NWs show half-metallic antiferromagnetism upon electron

local spin polarisation. As a result, spin polarisation currents in isolated
$VS_4$ NWs can be manipulated with locally applied gate voltage. Therefore,
these 1D AFM materials have a high potential for advancing both fundamental
research and spintronic applications because they are more resistant to

  The key step in counterfactual planning is to use an AGI machine learning
system to construct a counterfactual world model, designed to be different from
the real world the system is in. A counterfactual planning agent determines the
action that best maximizes expected utility in this counterfactual planning
world, and then performs the same action in the real world.
  We use counterfactual planning to construct an AGI agent emergency stop
button, and a safety interlock that will automatically stop the agent before it
undergoes an intelligence explosion. We also construct an agent with an input
terminal that can be used by humans to iteratively improve the agent's reward
function, where the incentive for the agent to manipulate this improvement
process is suppressed. As an example of counterfactual planning in a non-agent
AGI system, we construct a counterfactual oracle.
  As a design approach, counterfactual planning is built around the use of a
graphical notation for defining mathematical counterfactuals. This two-diagram
notation also provides a compact and readable language for reasoning about the
complex types of self-referencing and indirect representation which are
typically present inside machine learning agents.

'urban vitality' -- is one of the qualities world-class cities aspire to the
most, yet it is one of the hardest to achieve. Back in the 1970s, Jane Jacobs
theorized urban vitality and found that there are four conditions required for
the promotion of life in cities: diversity of land use, small block sizes, the
mix of economic activities, and concentration of people. To build proxies for
those four conditions and ultimately test Jane Jacobs's theory at scale,
researchers have had to collect both private and public data from a variety of
sources, and that took decades. Here we propose the use of one single source of
data, which happens to be publicly available: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In
particular, since the first two conditions (diversity of land use and small
block sizes) are visible to the naked eye from satellite imagery, we tested
whether we could automatically extract them with a state-of-the-art
deep-learning framework and whether, in the end, the extracted features could
predict vitality. In six Italian cities for which we had call data records, we
found that our framework is able to explain on average 55% of the variance in
urban vitality extracted from those records.

considering phantom energy equation of state (EoS), and (iii) for a specific

of $f(Q)$). Besides, we discuss two wormhole geometries for a general case of
$f(Q)$ with two specific shape functions. Then, we discuss the viability of
shape functions and the stability analysis of the wormhole solutions for each
case. We have found that the null energy condition (NEC) violates each wormhole
model which concluded that our outcomes are realistic and stable. Finally, we
discuss the embedding diagrams and volume integral quantifier to have a

further suggestion came from the interpretation of the Hubbert curve in terms

was obvious as logistic function and LV equation were proposed within the
demography science field. Mathematical population dynamics has a history of
about two centuries. The first principle and model of population dynamics can
be regarded the exponential law of Malthus. In the XIX century, the Malthusian
demographic model was first refined to include mortality rate by Gompertz. In
the early XIX century the model was further refined by Verhulst by introducing
the standard logistic function. The previous models only concern the population
of a single species. In the early XX century, the American demographer Lotka
and the Italian mathematician Volterra proposed a pair of state equations which
describe the population dynamics of two competing species, the predator and the
prey. This paper is concerned with the single and two-species fundamental
equations: the logistic and LV equation. The paper starts with the generalized
logistic equation whose free response is derived together with equilibrium
points and stability properties. The parameter estimation of the logistic
function is applied to the raw data of the US crude oil production. The paper
proceeds with the Lotka Volterra equation of the competition between two
species, with the goal of applying it to resource exploitation. At the end, a
limiting version of the LV equation is studied since it describes a competition
model between the production rate of exploited resources and the relevant
capital stock employed in the exploitation.

absorption of the soft X-rays by the cool, partially ionized bulk of the wind
we derive the temperature distribution of the shock-heated plasma and the wind
mass-loss rate of each star. We find a similar temperature distribution for
each star's hot wind plasma, consistent with a power-law differential emission
measure, $\frac{d\log EM}{d\log T}$, with a slope a little steeper than -2, up
to temperatures of only about $10^7$ K. The wind mass-loss rates, which are
derived from the broadband X-ray absorption signatures in the spectra, are
consistent with those found from other diagnostics. The most notable conclusion
of this study is that wind absorption is a very important effect, especially at
longer wavelengths. More than 90 per cent of the X-rays between 18 and 25
Angstrom units produced by shocks in the wind of $\zeta$ Puppis are absorbed,
for example. It appears that the empirical trend of X-ray hardness with

  Wireless VR Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of enhancing the quality of virtual reality (VR)
services is studied for an indoor terahertz (THz)/visible light communication
(VLC) wireless network. In the studied model, small base stations (SBSs)
transmit high-quality VR images to VR users over THz bands and light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) provide accurate indoor positioning services for them using VLC.
Here, VR users move in real time and their movement patterns change over time
according to their applications, where both THz and VLC links can be blocked by
the bodies of VR users. To control the energy consumption of the studied
THz/VLC wireless VR network, VLC access points (VAPs) must be selectively
turned on so as to ensure accurate and extensive positioning for VR users.
Based on the user positions, each SBS must generate corresponding VR images and
establish THz links without body blockage to transmit the VR content. The
problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the
reliability of the VR network by selecting the appropriate VAPs to be turned on
and controlling the user association with SBSs. To solve this problem, a policy
gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that adopts a
meta-learning approach is proposed. The proposed meta policy gradient (MPG)
algorithm enables the trained policy to quickly adapt to new user movement
patterns. In order to solve the problem of maximizing the average number of
successfully served users for VR scenarios with a large number of users, a dual
method based MPG algorithm (D-MPG) with a low complexity is proposed.
Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the trust region policy
optimization algorithm (TRPO), the proposed MPG and D-MPG algorithms yield up
to 26.8% and 21.9% improvement in the reliability as well as 81.2% and 87.5%

widespread. While vaccine damage as a scientific fact is statistically highly
uncommon, emerging social and technological forces have converted probable
vaccine damage into an alternative fact. Methods: Using the Eurobarometer 91.2
survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March
2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief
configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through
exploratory cluster analysis. Results: The public beliefs in vaccine risks are
frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider vaccines
are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe vaccines can
overload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease
against which they protect, and almost one-half believe vaccines can cause
serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: the skeptical,
the confident, and the trade-off clusters. The skeptical type (approx. 11
percent of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the belief that vaccines are
rather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not
well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59 percent) is defined by
beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the
trade-off type (approx. 29 percent) combines beliefs that vaccines are
effective, well-tested and useful, with beliefs of probable vaccine damage.
Conclusions: Probable vaccine damage presently exists as an alternative fact in
the public imagination, perceptively available for wide segments of the public,
including those who trust medical science.

ethylene in burner-stabilized premixed flames at different equivalence ratios.
Particle size distribution (PSD) and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and
Incandescence (LII) along with numerical (Conditional Quadrature Method of
Moments - CQMOM, based on D'Anna physico-chemical soot model) investigations
were conducted to study particle formation and growth in pure ethylene and
ethylene/OME3 flames. The soot volume fraction and PSD indicate a reduction in
the total number and the size of the soot particles at all equivalence ratios,
while the number of small nanoparticles remains almost unchanged. The CQMOM
model is able to predict similar trends for the soot volume fraction and, using
the entropy maximization concept, the general shape of the PSD for both pure
ethylene and OME3-blended flames, compared to the experimental measurements.
Further, carbon particulate matter was thermophoretically sampled in the
highest equivalence ratio conditions and spectroscopically analyzed. The soot
structure was investigated using UV-Visible and Raman spectroscopy, finding a
slightly higher aromaticity for the pure ethylene soot. FTIR analysis showed
that carbon particulate matter produced from an OME3-doped flame contained
