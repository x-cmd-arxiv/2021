The discovery
of the cation HC3S+ was carried through the observation of four harmonically
related lines in the Q band using the Yebes 40m radiotelescope, and is
supported by accurate ab initio calculations and laboratory measurements of its
rotational spectrum. We derive a column density N(HC3S+) = (2.0 +/- 0.5)e11
cm-2, which translates to an abundance ratio C3S/HC3S+ of 65 +/- 20. This ratio
is comparable to the CS/HCS+ ratio (35 +/- 8) and is a factor of about ten
larger than the C3O/HC3O+ ratio previously found in the same source. However,
the abundance ratio HC3O+/HC3S+ is 1.0 +/- 0.5, while C3O/C3S is just 0.11. We
also searched for protonated C2S in TMC-1, based on ab initio calculations of
its spectroscopic parameters, and derive a 3sigma upper limit of N(HC2S+) <
9e11 cm-2 and a C2S/HC2S+ > 60. The observational results are compared with a
state-of-the-art gas-phase chemical model and conclude that HC3S+ is mostly
formed through several pathways: proton transfer to C3S, reaction of S+ with
c-C3H2, and reaction between neutral atomic sulfur and the ion C3H3+.

additional isotropic three-site ($J_3$) spin interactions remain relatively
less explored, although such types of competing exchange terms can naturally
emerge from different sources, including the strong-coupling expansion of the
multiorbital Hubbard model. Below we present a short survey of the recently
published research in this field, the emphasis being on the characteristics of
the variety of quantum phases supported by a few generic uniform- and
alternating-spin $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg chains. For the reason that the positive
($J_3>0$) three-site couplings tend towards the formation of local quantum
dimers, the $J_1-J_3$ spin models typically experience some spontaneous
dimerization upon increasing $J_3$. Actually, it occurred that the established
dimer phases in spin-$S$ $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg chains ($S>{1}/{2}$) serve as
complete analogues of the famous gapped Majumdar-Ghosh dimer phase in the
spin-${1}/{2}$ Heisenberg chain with next-nearest-neighbor couplings. The same
dimerizations have been observed in the alternating-spin ($S,\sigma$) $J_1-J_3$
chains ($S>\sigma$), provided that the cell spin $S+\sigma=\rm{integer}$,
whereas for half-integer cell spin, the local dimer formation produces gapless
spin-liquid ground states. The alternating-spin $J_1-J_3$ chains also provide
some typical examples of spin models supporting the so-called non-Lieb-Mattis
magnetic phases.

surface chemistry and its treatment in gas-grain chemical models are however

controlling scattering patterns. The conventional underpinning principle, such
as for the Kerker effect, is the interference of electric and magnetic dipole
and quadrupole modes. Here a route to realize transverse Kerker scattering
through employing only the interference between the electric dipole and
magnetic quadrupole is demonstrated. The proposed approach is numerically
validated in an ultra-thin Silicon square nanoplate metasurface, and is further
verified by multipole decomposition. The metasurface is shown to be invisible
fornear-infrared wavelengths and with an enhanced electric field in the region
of the nanoparticle. Additionally, we develop further the proposed approach
with practical implementation for invisibility applications by exploring the
effects of the aspect ratio of the square plate nanoresonator, the
inter-particle separation, and the presence of a substrate. Further it is
demonstrated that invisibility can be observed at oblique incidence up to
60{\deg} for a transverse magnetic plane wave. The results are relevant for
Huygens metasurface design for perfect reflectors, invisibility and devices for
harmonic generation manipulation.

re-assessed by means of a multiple regression analysis. Evaluating linear
combinations of the logarithm of carbon dioxide concentration and the
geomagnetic aa-index as a proxy for solar activity, we reproduce the sea
surface temperature (HadSST) since the middle of the 19th century with an
adjusted $R^2$ value of around 87 per cent for a climate sensitivity (of TCR
type) in the range of 0.6 K until 1.6 K per doubling of CO$_2$. The solution of
the regression is quite sensitive: when including data from the last decade,
the simultaneous occurrence of a strong El Ni\~no on one side and low aa-values
on the other side lead to a preponderance of solutions with relatively high
climate sensitivities around 1.6 K. If those later data are excluded, the
regression leads to a significantly higher weight of the aa-index and a
correspondingly lower climate sensitivity going down to 0.6 K. The plausibility
of such low values is discussed in view of recent experimental and
satellite-borne measurements. We argue that a further decade of data collection
will be needed to allow for a reliable distinction between low and high
sensitivity values. Based on recent ideas about a quasi-deterministic planetary
synchronization of the solar dynamo, we make a first attempt to predict the
aa-index and the resulting temperature anomaly for various typical CO$_2$
scenarios. Even for the highest climate sensitivities, and an unabated linear
CO$_2$ increase, we predict only a mild additional temperature rise of around 1
K until the end of the century, while for the lower values an imminent
temperature drop in the near future, followed by a rather flat temperature
curve, is prognosticated.

many proteins is concentrated, the uniformly mixed state becomes unstable, and
membrane-less phases form spontaneously. This LLPS droplet formation is induced
when the TXTL reaction is enclosed in water-in-oil emulsion droplets, in which
water evaporates from the surface. As the emulsion droplets shrink, smaller
LLPS droplets appear inside the emulsion droplets and coalesce into large
phase-separated domains that partition the localization of synthesized reporter

cosmological fluids has been considered by S.D. Odintsov et al. in [30] from

generative of appreciable results in the Hilbert-Einstein model, hence we
intend to investigate all the cases in a homogeneous $F(T)$-gravity ($T$ is the
torsion) through phase space analysis in precise detail. In short, three viable
models of interaction between dark matter and dark energy, including
usual-type, power-law type, and oscillating type, are investigated
comprehensively. It is indicated that the power-law interaction in the related
dynamical systems should be of increasing nature with time to get more critical
points. Due to the failure of the oscillating model of ref. [30] in
$F(T)$-gravity, four modified models are suggested and examined in both $F(T)$
and Hilbert-Einstein models. As to be seen, the modified models not only are
generative of critical points equivalent to that of ref. [30], but also give
rise to further critical points covering crucial stages of the evolution of the
universe. In the context of these four models, such as the old one, at early
times the interactions are negligible and they commence to grow as the cosmic
time approaches the late-time in which the unification of early inflation and
late acceleration is obtained. Using an indirect method, it is shown that the
oscillating models have substantial roles in transitions between eras.

sub-images. After each sub-image is embedded, costs will be adjusted following
clustering modification directions profile. And then the next sub-image will be

target CNN classifier does not discriminate the stego image as a cover image,
based on adjusted costs, we change costs with adversarial manners according to
signs of gradients back-propagated from the CNN classifier. And then a

relations, converge to solutions to the S-matrix axioms. We characterize the
region in the amplitude-space in which our algorithms converge, and discover a
fractal structure connected to the so-called CDD ambiguities which we call ""CDD
fractal"". To our surprise, the question of convergence naturally connects to
the recent study of the coupling maximization in the two-dimensional S-matrix
bootstrap. The methods exposed here pave the way for applications to higher
dimensions, and expose some of the potential challenges that will have to be

extensively for more than two decades, the accumulated knowledge remains
fragmentary. The goal of this review is to synthesize published studies on the
membrane trafficking of the five major junction transmembrane proteins:
claudins, occludin, and junction adhesion molecules (JAMs) in tight junctions;
cadherins and nectins in adherens junctions; to identify underlying common
mechanisms; to highlight their functional consequences on barrier function; and
to identify knowledge gaps. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis appears to be the
main, but not exclusive, mode of internalization. Caveolin-mediated endocytosis
and macropinocytosis are employed less frequently. PDZ-domain binding is the
predominant mode of interaction between junction protein cytoplasmic tails and
scaffold proteins. It is shared by claudins, the largest family of junction
integral proteins, by junction adhesion molecules A, B, and C, and by the three
nectins. All eight proteins are destined to either recycling via Rab4/Rab11
GTPases or to degradation. The sorting mechanisms that underlie the specificity
of their endocytic pathways and determine their fates are not fully known. New
data is presented to introduce an emerging role of junction-associated scaffold
proteins in claudin membrane trafficking.

store large amounts of source data for long durations using a large number $N$
of unreliable storage nodes, each with $c$ bits of storage capacity. Storage
nodes fail randomly over time and are replaced with nodes of equal capacity
initialized to zeroes, and thus bits are erased at some rate $e$. To maintain
recoverability of the source data, a repairer continually reads data over a
network from nodes at an average rate $r$, and generates and writes data to
nodes based on the read data.
  The distributed storage source capacity is the maximum amount of source that
can be reliably stored for long periods of time. Previous research shows that
asymptotically the distributed storage source capacity is at most
$\left(1-\frac{e}{2 \cdot r}\right) \cdot N \cdot c$ as $N$ and $r$ grow.
  In this work we introduce and analyze algorithms such that asymptotically the
distributed storage source data capacity is at least the above equation. Thus,
the above equation expresses a fundamental trade-off between network traffic
and storage overhead to reliably store source data.

this, existing techniques like maximum likelihood estimation are
computationally inefficient due to the intractability of the normalizing

independent on the normalizing constant. However, such estimator is consistent
only for distributions with the full space support. One of the approaches to
make it consistent is to add noise to the input data which is called Denoising
Score Matching. In this work we derive analytical expression for the Denoising
Score matching using the Kernel Exponential Family as a model distribution. The
usage of the kernel exponential family is motivated by the richness of this
class of densities. To tackle the computational complexity we use Random
Fourier Features based approximation of the kernel function. The analytical
expression allows to drop additional regularization terms based on the
higher-order derivatives as they are already implicitly included. Moreover, the
obtained expression explicitly depends on the noise variance, so the validation
loss can be straightforwardly used to tune the noise level. Along with
benchmark experiments, the model was tested on various synthetic distributions
to study the behaviour of the model in different cases. The empirical study
shows comparable quality to the competing approaches, while the proposed method

this class, players control the inputs of smooth but possibly non-linear
functions whose outputs are being applied as inputs to a convex-concave game.

convex-concave then vanilla GDA converges not merely to local Nash, but
typically to the von-Neumann solution. If the game lacks strict convexity
properties, GDA may fail to converge to any equilibrium, however, by applying
standard regularization techniques we can prove convergence to a von-Neumann

experiment, which probes the absolute neutrino-mass scale via the $\beta$-decay
kinematics of molecular tritium. The source is highly pure, cryogenic T$_2$
gas. The $\beta$ electrons are guided along magnetic field lines toward a
high-resolution, integrating spectrometer for energy analysis. A silicon
detector counts $\beta$ electrons above the energy threshold of the
spectrometer, so that a scan of the thresholds produces a precise measurement
of the high-energy spectral tail. After detailed theoretical studies,
simulations, and commissioning measurements, extending from the molecular
final-state distribution to inelastic scattering in the source to subtleties of
the electromagnetic fields, our independent, blind analyses allow us to set an
upper limit of 1.1 eV on the neutrino-mass scale at a 90\% confidence level.
This first result, based on a few weeks of running at a reduced source
intensity and dominated by statistical uncertainty, improves on prior limits by
nearly a factor of two. This result establishes an analysis framework for
future KATRIN measurements, and provides important input to both particle
theory and cosmology.

Specifically, random Fourier Features (RFF) based deep-learning has emerged as
an attractive solution for several machine-learning problems; yet there is a
lacuna of rigorous results to justify the viability of RFF based DL-algorithms
in general. To address this gap, we attempt to analytically quantify the
viability of RFF based DL. Precisely, in this paper, analytical proofs are
presented demonstrating that RFF based DL architectures have lower
approximation-error and probability of misclassification as compared to
classical DL architectures. In addition, a new distribution-dependent RFF is
proposed to facilitate DL architectures with low training-complexity. Through
computer simulations, the practical application of the presented analytical
results and the proposed distribution-dependent RFF, are depicted for various
machine-learning problems encountered in next-generation communication systems
such as: a) line of sight (LOS)/non-line of sight (NLOS) classification, and b)
message-passing based detection of low-density parity check codes (LDPC) codes
over nonlinear visible light communication (VLC) channels. Especially in the
low training-data regime, the presented simulations show that significant
performance gains are achieved when utilizing RFF maps of observations. Lastly,
in all the presented simulations, it is observed that the proposed
distribution-dependent RFFs significantly outperform RFFs, which make them
useful for potential machine-learning/DL based applications in the context of
next-generation communication systems.

detected what appears to be a radio synchrotron background at frequencies below
about 3 GHz. Neither extragalactic radio sources nor diffuse Galactic emission
can currently account for this finding. We use the locally measured Cosmic ray
electron population, demodulated for effects of the Solar wind, and other
observational constraints combined with a turbulent magnetic field model to
predict the radio synchrotron emission for the Local Bubble. We find that the
spectral index of the modelled radio emission is roughly consistent with the
radio background. Our model can approximately reproduce the observed antenna
temperatures for a mean magnetic field strength B between 3-5 nT. We argue that
this would not violate observational constraints from pulsar measurements.
However, the curvature in the predicted spectrum would mean that other, so far
unknown sources would have to contribute below 100 MHz. Also, the magnetic
energy density would then dominate over thermal and cosmic ray electron energy
density, likely causing an inverse magnetic cascade with large variations of
the radio emission in different sky directions as well as high polarisation. We
argue that this disagrees with several observations and thus that the magnetic
field is probably much lower, quite possibly limited by equipartition with the
energy density in relativistic or thermal particles (B = 0.2-0.6 nT). In the
latter case, we predict a contribution of the Local Bubble to the unexplained
radio background at most at the per cent level.

  the Royal Astronomical Society",,"10.1093/mnras/stab1000",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gravitational lensing magnification modifies the observed spatial
distribution of galaxies and can severely bias cosmological probes of
large-scale structure if not accurately modelled. Standard approaches to
modelling this magnification bias may not be applicable in practice as many
galaxy samples have complex, often implicit, selection functions. We propose
and test a procedure to quantify the magnification bias induced in clustering
and galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) signals in galaxy samples subject to a
selection function beyond a simple flux limit. The method employs realistic
mock data to calibrate an effective luminosity function slope,
$\alpha_{\rm{obs}}$, from observed galaxy counts, which can then be used with
the standard formalism. We demonstrate this method for two galaxy samples
derived from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) in the redshift
ranges $0.2 < z \leq 0.5$ and $0.5 < z \leq 0.75$, complemented by mock data
built from the MICE2 simulation. We obtain $\alpha_{\rm{obs}} = 1.93 \pm 0.05$
and $\alpha_{\rm{obs}} = 2.62 \pm 0.28$ for the two BOSS samples. For BOSS-like
lenses, we forecast a contribution of the magnification bias to the GGL signal
between the multipole moments, $\ell$, of 100 and 4600 with a cumulative
signal-to-noise ratio between 0.1 and 1.1 for sources from the Kilo-Degree
Survey (KiDS), between 0.4 and 2.0 for sources from the Hyper Suprime-Cam
survey (HSC), and between 0.3 and 2.8 for ESA Euclid-like source samples. These
contributions are significant enough to require explicit modelling in future
analyses of these and similar surveys. Our code is publicly available within
the \textsc{MagBEt} module (\url{https://github.com/mwiet/MAGBET}).

possible route to significantly improve our knowledge and ability to confine

hyperbolicity in a class of materials with hexagonal P6/mmm and P6$_{3}$/mmc
layered crystal structures and its physical origin is thoroughly investigated.
By utilizing density functional theory and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE), we find that the layered crystal structure and symmetry imposed
constraints in Li$_{3}$N gives rise to an exceedingly strong anisotropy in
optical responses along in- and out-of-plane directions of the crystals making
it a natural hyperbolic in a broad spectral range from the visible spectrum to
the ultraviolet. More excitingly, the hyperbolicity relation to anisotropic
interband absorption in addition to the impressive dependency of the conduction
band to the lattice constant along the out-of-plane direction provide the
hyperbolicity tunability in these hexagonal structures under strain, doping,
and alloying. Our findings not only suggest a large family of real hexagonal
compounds as a unique class of materials for realization of the highly tunable
broad band hyperbolicity but also offers an approach to search for new

introduce a theoretically motivated policy similarity metric (PSM) for
measuring behavioral similarity between states. PSM assigns high similarity to

states are similar. We also present a contrastive representation learning

life to exist and their remnants -- neutron stars and black holes -- are
interesting astrophysical objects in their own right. However, despite
millennia of observations and almost a century of astrophysical study, the
explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae is not yet well understood.
Hyper-Kamiokande is a next-generation neutrino detector that will be able to
observe the neutrino flux from the next galactic core-collapse supernova in
unprecedented detail. We focus on the first 500 ms of the neutrino burst,
corresponding to the accretion phase, and use a newly-developed, high-precision
supernova event generator to simulate Hyper-Kamiokande's response to five
different supernova models. We show that Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to
distinguish between these models with high accuracy for a supernova at a
distance of up to 100 kpc. Once the next galactic supernova happens, this
ability will be a powerful tool for guiding simulations towards a precise
reproduction of the explosion mechanism observed in nature.

pretrained GAN models such as StyleGAN and BigGAN to be used for real image
editing applications. Meanwhile, GAN inversion also provides insights on the
interpretation of GAN's latent space and how the realistic images can be
generated. In this paper, we provide an overview of GAN inversion with a focus

observations of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m transition and the dust continuum in HZ4,
a typical star-forming galaxy when the Universe was only $\sim1$ Gyr old
($z\approx5.5$). Our high $\approx0.3$'' spatial resolution allow us to study
the relationships between [CII] line emission, star formation rate (SFR), and
far-infrared (FIR) emission on spatial scales of $\sim2$ kpc. In the central
$\sim$4 kpc of HZ4, the [CII]/FIR ratio is $\sim3\times10^{-3}$ on global
scales as well as on spatially-resolved scales of $\sim$2 kpc, comparable to
the ratio observed in local moderate starburst galaxies such as M82 or M83. For
the first time in an individual normal galaxy at this redshift, we find
evidence for outflowing gas from the central star-forming region in the
direction of the minor-axis of the galaxy. The projected velocity of the
outflow is $\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$, and the neutral gas mass outflow rate is
$\sim3-6$ times higher than the SFR in the central region. Finally, we detect a
diffuse component of [CII] emission, or ""[CII]-halo"", that extends beyond the
star-forming disk and has a size of $\sim12$ kpc in diameter. Most likely the
outflow, which has a velocity approximately half the escape velocity of the
system, is in part responsible for fueling the [CII] extended emission.
Together with the kinematic analysis of HZ4 (presented in a forthcoming paper),
the analysis supports that HZ4 is a typical star-forming disk at $z\sim5$ with
interstellar medium (ISM) conditions similar to present-day galaxies forming
stars at a similar level, driving a galactic outflow that may already play a
role in its evolution.

dark matter halo properties are most tightly connected to observable galaxy
properties. We show that different halo properties beyond mass imprint distinct
scale-dependent signatures in both the galaxy two-point correlation function
and the distribution of distances to galaxies' $k$th nearest neighbours, with
features strong enough to be accessible even with low-resolution (e.g., grism)

two-point correlation functions for galaxies binned by half-mass radius at
$z=0$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, showing that classic galaxy size

recent proposals show significant tensions with observational data. We show
that the agreement with observed clustering can be improved with a simple

exoplanetary atmospheres is difficult due to the inherent telluric
contamination from absorption in Earth's atmosphere. A variety of methods have
previously been used to remove telluric features in the optical regime and
calculate the planetary transmission spectrum. In this paper we present and
compare two such methods, specifically focusing on Na detections using
high-resolution optical transmission spectra: (1) calculating the telluric
absorption empirically based on the airmass, and (2) using a model of the
Earth's transmission spectrum. We test these methods on the transmission
spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b using archival data obtained with the
HARPS spectrograph during three transits. Using models for Centre-to-Limb
Variation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, spurious signals which are
imprinted within the transmission spectrum are reduced. We find that correcting
tellurics with an atmospheric model of the Earth is more robust and produces
consistent results when applied to data from different nights with changing
atmospheric conditions. We confirm the detection of sodium in the atmosphere of
HD 189733 b, with doublet line contrasts of -0.64 $\pm$ 0.07 % (D2) and -0.53
$\pm$ 0.07 % (D1). The average line contrast corresponds to an effective
photosphere in the Na line located around 1.13 R$_p$. We also confirm an
overall blueshift of the line centroids corresponding to net atmospheric
eastward winds with a speed of 1.8 $\pm$ 1.2 km/s. Our study highlights the
importance of accurate telluric removal for consistent and reliable
characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres using high-resolution transmission

an outflow arising from the Galactic center (GC) has recently been discovered
at different wavelength. We show that the X-ray, radio, and infrared emissions
are deeply interconnected, affecting one another and forming coherent features
on scales of hundreds of parsecs, therefore indicating a common physical link
associated with the GC outflow. We debate the location of the northern chimney
and suggest that it might be located on the front side of the GC because of a
significant tilt of the chimneys toward us. We report the presence of strong
shocks at the interface between the chimneys and the interstellar medium, which
are traced by radio and warm dust emission. We observe entrained molecular gas
outflowing within the chimneys, revealing the multiphase nature of the outflow.
In particular, the molecular outflow produces a long, strong, and structured
shock along the northwestern wall of the chimney. Because of the different
dynamical times of the various components of the outflow, the chimneys appear
to be shaped by directed large-scale winds launched at different epochs. The
data support the idea that the chimneys are embedded in an (often dominant)
vertical magnetic field, which likely diverges with increasing latitude. We
observe that the thermal pressure associated with the hot plasma appears to be
smaller than the ram pressure of the molecular outflow and the magnetic
pressure. This leaves open the possibility that either the main driver of the
outflow is more powerful than the observed hot plasma, or the chimneys
represent a ""relic"" of past and more powerful activity. These multiwavelength
observations corroborate the idea that the chimneys represent the channel
connecting the quasi-continuous, but intermittent, activity at the GC with the
base of the Fermi bubbles.

solution will provide important insights into their interior physics. Many
potential solutions have been suggested, which make diverse predictions about
the details of inflation. In particular, although any valid model must allow
for maintaining large planetary radii, only some allow for radii to increase
with time. This reinflation process would potentially occur when the incident
flux on the planet is increased. In this work, we examine the observed
population of hot Jupiters to see if they grow as their parent stars brighten
along the main sequence. We consider the relation between radius and other
observables, including mass, incident flux, age, and fractional age (age over
main sequence lifetime), and show that main sequence brightening is often
sufficient to produce detectable reinflation. We further argue that these
provide strong evidence for the relatively rapid reinflation of giant planets,
and discuss the implications for proposed heating mechanisms. In our population
analysis we also find evidence for a ""delayed-cooling effect"", wherein planets
cool and contract far more slowly than expected. While not capable of
explaining the observed radii alone, it may represent an important component of
the effect. Finally, we identify a weak negative relationship between stellar
metallicity and planet radius which is presumably the result of enhanced
planetary bulk metallicity around metal-rich stars and has important
implications for planet formation theory.

which we study in this paper; we match the FC $u_i t \ell \ell$ 4-Fermi terms

eliminated with a sufficiently high invariant mass selection on the OSSF

as an additional selection in the di-lepton final state case also proves very
useful. We find, for example, that the expected 95\% CL bounds on the scale of

interaction between E0102's original supernova blast wave and an inhomogeneous
surrounding environment, as opposed to intrinsic explosion asymmetry. The
observed non-homologous expansion suggests that the use of a free expansion

overestimated explosion age. We discuss our findings as they compare to
previous age and center of expansion estimates of E0102 and their relevance to

the CHANG-ES radio polarization data to create Rotation Measure (RM) maps for

current that universally outflows from the center both above and below the

astrophysical jets but never before in galaxy halos. This is an indication that
galaxy halo magnetic fields are probably not generated by pure ideal

such promising physical mechanism is the Cosmic Battery operating in the

in the large-detuning limit. Utilizing an adaptation of the Suzuki-Trotter
quantum-to-classical mapping, we develop an exact field-theoretical analysis

a simple scattering picture. With this representation, we are able to analyze
critical behavior, finite-size scaling and the effective temperature near the
respective phase transition. Our formalism further allows a detailed study of
the ordered phase where we find a ""heating"" region within which the effective
temperature becomes negative, thereby exhibiting a truly non-equilibrium
behavior. At the phase transition, we find two distinct critical behaviors with
overdamped and underdamped critical dynamics at generic and weakly-dissipative
critical points, respectively. We further show that the underdamped critical
behavior is robust against short-range perturbations and is not an artifact of
the mean-field nature of the model. To treat such perturbations, we extend our
diagrammatic representation to include the coupling to spin waves due to the
short-range interactions. The field-theoretical approach and the diagrammatics

population of coupled oscillators of diverse natural frequencies self-organize
to operate in unison. The phenomenon occurs in physical and biological systems
over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, e.g., in electrochemical and
electronic oscillators, Josephson junctions, laser arrays, animal flocking,
pedestrians on footbridges, audience clapping, etc. Besides the obvious
necessity of the synchronous firings of cardiac cells to keep the heart
beating, synchrony is desired in many man-made systems such as parallel
computing, electrical power-grids. On the contrary, synchrony could also be
hazardous, e.g., in neurons, leading to impaired brain function in Parkinson's
disease and epilepsy. Due to this wide range of applications, collective
synchrony in networks of oscillators has attracted the attention of physicists,
applied mathematicians and researchers from many other fields. An essential
aspect of synchronizing systems is that long-range order naturally appear in
these systems, which questions the fact whether long-range interactions may be
particular suitable to synchronization. In this context, it is interesting to
remind that long-range interacting system required several adaptations from
statistical mechanics \`a la Gibbs Boltzmann, in order to deal with the
peculiarities of these systems: negative specific heat, breaking of ergodicity
or lack of extensivity. As for synchrony, it is still lacking a theoretical
framework to use the tools from statistical mechanics. The present issue
presents a collection of exciting recent theoretical developments in the field
of synchronization and long-range interactions, in order to highlight the
mutual progresses of these twin areas.

be powered by traditional energy sources, such as radioactive 56Ni. These
transients may instead be powered by a central engine, such as a millisecond
pulsar or magnetar, whose relativistic wind inflates a nebula of high energy
particles and radiation behind the expanding ejecta. We present 3D Monte Carlo
radiative transfer calculations which follow the production and thermalization
of high energy radiation from the nebula into optical radiation and,
conversely, determine the gamma-ray emission that escapes the ejecta without
thermalizing. We track the evolution of photons and matter in a coupled
two-zone (""wind/nebula"" and ""ejecta"") model, accounting for the range of
radiative processes. We identify a novel mechanism by which gamma-gamma pair
creation in the upstream pulsar wind regulates the mean energy of particles
entering the nebula over the first several years after the explosion, rendering
our results on this timescale insensitive to the (uncertain) intrinsic wind
pair multiplicity. To explain the observed late-time steepening of SLSNe
optical light curves as being the result of gamma-ray leakage, the nebular
magnetization must be very low, epsB <~ 1e-6-1e-4. For higher epsB, synchrotron
emission quickly comes to dominate the thermalized nebula radiation, and being
readily absorbed because of its lower photon energies, results in the SN
optical light curve tracking the spin-down power even to late times >~ 1 yr,
inconsistent with observations. For magnetars to remain viable contenders for
powering SLSNe, we conclude that either magnetic dissipation in the wind/nebula
is extremely efficient, or that the spin-down luminosity decays significantly
faster than the canonical dipole rate ~1/t^2 in a way that coincidentally
mimicks gamma-ray escape.

reduction of the emissivity due to improvements to the one-pion exchange

Namely, of Hamiltonians whose single-particle eigenstates have random

describes the average entanglement entropy in Hamiltonians without

augmenting space-efficient Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) with additional data
structures to permit ultra-fast exact-match operations. However, FM-Index is
notorious for its poor spatial locality and random memory access pattern. Prior
works create GPU-, FPGA-, ASIC- and even process-in-memory (PIM)-based
accelerators to boost FM-Index search throughput. Though they achieve the
state-of-the-art FM-Index search throughput, the same as all prior conventional
accelerators, FM-Index PIMs process only one DNA symbol after each DRAM row
activation, thereby suffering from poor memory bandwidth utilization.
  In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator, EXMA, to enhance FM-Index
search throughput. We first create a novel EXMA table with a
multi-task-learning (MTL)-based index to process multiple DNA symbols with each
DRAM row activation. We then build an accelerator to search over an EXMA table.
We propose 2-stage scheduling to increase the cache hit rate of our
accelerator. We introduce dynamic page policy to improve the row buffer hit
rate of DRAM main memory. We also present CHAIN compression to reduce the data
structure size of EXMA tables. Compared to state-of-the-art FM-Index PIMs, EXMA
improves search throughput by $4.9\times$, and enhances search throughput per

risk of large outages. Thus, there is an imperative need to enhance grid
emergency control to maintain system reliability and security. Towards this
end, great progress has been made in developing deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) based grid control solutions in recent years. However, existing DRL-based
solutions have two main limitations: 1) they cannot handle well with a wide
range of grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies; 2)
they generally lack the ability to fast adapt to new grid operation conditions,
system parameters, and contingencies, limiting their applicability for
real-world applications. In this paper, we mitigate these limitations by
developing a novel deep meta reinforcement learning (DMRL) algorithm. The DMRL
combines the meta strategy optimization together with DRL, and trains policies
modulated by a latent space that can quickly adapt to new scenarios. We test
the developed DMRL algorithm on the IEEE 300-bus system. We demonstrate fast
adaptation of the meta-trained DRL polices with latent variables to new

in integrating the gradient flow. We also compare the performance of the tuned

recently established connection between low-storage Lie group integrators and
classical 2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods, we study two fourth-order low-storage
methods that provide a computationally efficient alternative to the commonly
used third-order method while retaining the convenient iterative property of
the latter. Finally, we demonstrate that almost no coding effort is needed to
implement the low-storage Lie group methods into existing gradient flow codes.

NGC 4643, in contrast, has a nuclear disc with an unusual broken-exponential

component (R_e approx. 35 pc, n = 1.6; 0.5% of the light). IFU stellar

a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn feasible dynamic motions for a

has several benefits: it enables us to readily transform a broad range of

A*, we consider a standard self-similar radiatively inefficient accretion flow
where the emission is predominantly from thermal leptons with a small fraction
in a power-law tail. In both models, we fix the positron-to-electron ratio
throughout the emission region. We generate polarized images and spectra from
our models using the general-relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer
from GRTRANS. We find that a substantial positron fraction reduces the circular
polarization fraction at infrared and higher frequencies. However, in
sub-millimeter images higher positron fractions increase polarization fractions
due to strong effects of Faraday conversion. We find a M87* jet model that best
matches the available broadband total intensity and 230 GHz polarization data
is a sub-equipartition, with positron fraction of $\simeq$ 10%. We show that
jet models with significant positron fractions do not satisfy the polarimetric
constraints at 230 GHz from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Sgr A* models
show similar trends in their polarization fractions with increasing pair
fraction. Both models suggest that resolved, polarized EHT images are useful to
constrain the presence of pairs at 230 GHz emitting regions of M87* and Sgr A*.

are a preferred supervised learning model due to their high data-efficiency.
Particularly in model-based control, Gaussian processes allow the derivation of
performance guarantees using probabilistic model error bounds. To make these
approaches applicable in practice, two open challenges must be solved i)
Existing error bounds rely on prior knowledge, which might not be available for
many real-world tasks. (ii) The relationship between training data and the
posterior variance, which mainly drives the error bound, is not well understood
and prevents the asymptotic analysis. This article addresses these issues by
presenting a novel uniform error bound using Lipschitz continuity and an
analysis of the posterior variance function for a large class of kernels.
Additionally, we show how these results can be used to guarantee safe control
of an unknown dynamical system and provide numerical illustration examples.

lossless compression scheme which is easy to implement and achieves a good
compression on input data which contains repeating consecutive symbols. In its
pure form RLE is not applicable on natural text or other input data with short
sequences of identical symbols. We present a combination of preprocessing steps
that turn arbitrary input data in a byte-wise encoding into a bit-string which
is highly suitable for RLE compression. The main idea is to first read all most
significant bits of the input byte-string, followed by the second most
significant bit, and so on. We combine this approach by a dynamic byte
remapping as well as a Burrows-Wheeler-Scott transform on a byte level.
Finally, we apply a Huffman Encoding on the output of the bit-wise RLE encoding
to allow for more dynamic lengths of code words encoding runs of the RLE. With
our technique we can achieve a lossless average compression which is better
than the standard RLE compression by a factor of 8 on average.

be better explain with the wide-angle wind model as well, but new observations

tracers are useful for broad evolutionary classifications, but are not
consistent with each other to provide enough granularity to disentangle
different evolutionary stage of sources that belong to the same Class. Outflow
properties used as protostellar age tracers (mass, momentum, energy, opening

potential for c-physics was also clear. At first data taking, the versatility
of the experiment as a general-purpose detector in the forward region also
became evident, with measurements achievable such as electroweak physics, jets
and new particle searches in open states. These were facilitated by the
excellent capability of the detector to identify muons and to reconstruct decay
vertices close to the primary pp interaction region. By the end of the LHC Run
2 in 2018, before the accelerator paused for its second long shut down, LHCb
had measured the CKM quark mixing matrix elements and CP violation parameters
to world-leading precision in the heavy-quark systems. The experiment had also
measured many rare decays of b and c quark mesons and baryons to below their
Standard Model expectations, some down to branching ratios of order 10-9. In
addition, world knowledge of b and c spectroscopy had improved significantly
through discoveries of many new resonances already anticipated in the quark
model, and also adding new exotic four and five quark states.

density along the line of sight. Correcting for this delay accurately is
crucial for the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves using Pulsar Timing
Arrays. In this work, we present in-band and inter-band DM estimates of four
pulsars observed with uGMRT over the timescale of a year using two different
template alignment methods. The DMs obtained using both these methods show only
subtle differences for PSR 1713+0747 and J1909$-$3744. A considerable offset is
seen in the DM of PSR J1939+2134 and J2145$-$0750 between the two methods. This
could be due to the presence of scattering in the former and profile evolution
in the latter. We find that both methods are useful but could have a systematic

followed, the precision on the DMs obtained is about $10^{-3}$ pc cm$^{-3}$

insightful findings on the genetic etiology of infertility that may lead to
better management of the condition. This review provides an update on genes
predisposing to syndromic and nonsyndromic infertility.
  Main body: The review identified 65 genes linked with infertility and
infertility-related disorders. These genes regulate fertility. However,
mutational loss of the functions of the genes predisposes to infertility.
Twenty-three (23) genes representing 35% were linked with syndromic
infertility, while 42 genes (65%) cause nonsyndromic infertility. Of the 42
nonsyndromic genes, 26 predispose to spermatogenic failure and sperm
morphological abnormalities, 11 cause ovarian failures, and 5 cause sex
reversal and puberty delay. Overall, 31 genes (48%) predispose to male
infertility, 15 genes (23%) cause female infertility, and 19 genes (29%)
predispose to both. The common feature of male infertility was spermatogenic
failure and sperm morphology abnormalities, while ovarian failure has been the
most frequently reported among infertile females. The mechanisms leading to
these pathologies are gene-specific, which, if targeted in the affected, may
lead to improved treatment.
  Conclusions: Mutational loss of the functions of some genes involved in the
development and maintenance of fertility may predispose to syndromic or
nonsyndromic infertility via gene-specific mechanisms. A treatment procedure
that targets the affected gene(s) in individuals expressing infertility may
lead to improved treatment.

role for gene regulation, DNA replication, and genomic integrity. Through the
development of chromosome conformation capture experiments (such as 3C, 4C,
Hi-C) it is now possible to obtain the contact frequencies of the DNA at the
whole-genome level. In this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing the
3D organization of the genome from such whole-genome contact frequencies. A
standard approach is to transform the contact frequencies into noisy distance
measurements and then apply semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations to
obtain the 3D configuration. However, neglected in such reconstructions is the
fact that most eukaryotes including humans are diploid and therefore contain
two copies of each genomic locus. We prove that the 3D organization of the DNA
is not identifiable from distance measurements derived from contact frequencies
in diploid organisms. In fact, there are infinitely many solutions even in the
noise-free setting. We then discuss various additional biologically relevant
and experimentally measurable constraints (including distances between
neighboring genomic loci and higher-order interactions) and prove
identifiability under these conditions. Furthermore, we provide SDP
formulations for computing the 3D embedding of the DNA with these additional
constraints and show that we can recover the true 3D embedding with high
accuracy from both noiseless and noisy measurements. Finally, we apply our
algorithm to real pairwise and higher-order contact frequency data and show
that we can recover known genome organization patterns.

using the observations for Sr and Ba. Employing these parameters for rotating
massive stars in our stochastic model, we are able to correctly reproduce the
chemical evolution of Sr and Ba, but also Y, Zr and La. The data supports a
decrease of both the mean rotational velocities and their dispersion with
increasing metallicity. Our results show that a metallicity-dependent rotation
is a necessary assumption to explain the s-process in massive stars. Our novel

such as discharge from the hospital or admission to the ICU. When a model's
predicted number of events within any time interval is similar to the observed
number, it is called well-calibrated. A survival model's calibration can be
measured using, for instance, distributional calibration (D-CALIBRATION)
[Haider et al., 2020] which computes the squared difference between the
observed and predicted number of events within different time intervals.
Classically, calibration is addressed in post-training analysis. We develop
explicit calibration (X-CAL), which turns D-CALIBRATION into a differentiable
objective that can be used in survival modeling alongside maximum likelihood
estimation and other objectives. X-CAL allows practitioners to directly
optimize calibration and strike a desired balance between predictive power and
calibration. In our experiments, we fit a variety of shallow and deep models on
simulated data, a survival dataset based on MNIST, on length-of-stay prediction
using MIMIC-III data, and on brain cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We
show that the models we study can be miscalibrated. We give experimental
evidence on these datasets that X-CAL improves D-CALIBRATION without a large
decrease in concordance or likelihood.

nodeactivities. Existing works mainly focus on unimodal distributions,where it
is usually assumed that the observed activities aregenerated from

modeling the edge detectionproblem as estimating a mixture ofmultipleGaussian

this problem, we propose a novel model called GaussianMixture Graphical Lasso

moreinterpretable networks, MGL imposes a special regularization,called Mutual

critical requirement in many practical systems, such as batteries and electric
motors. Significant work has been done in the past developing different types
of algorithms for system identification using reduced equivalent circuit
models. However, little work was done in analyzing the theoretical performance
bounds of these approaches. Proper understanding of theoretical bounds will
help in designing a system that is economical in cost and robust in
performance. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a linear recursive
least squares approach to equivalent circuit model identification and show that
the least squares approach is both unbiased and efficient when the
signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However, we show that, when the
signal-to-noise ratio is low - resembling the case in many practical
applications - the least squares estimator becomes significantly biased.
Consequently, we develop a parameter estimation approach based on total least
squares method and show it to be asymptotically unbiased and efficient at
practically low signal-to-noise ratio regions. Further, we develop a recursive
implementation of the total least square algorithm and find it to be slow to
converge; for this, we employ a Kalman filter to improve the convergence speed
of the total least squares method. The resulting total Kalman filter is shown
to be both unbiased and efficient in equivalent circuit model parameter
identification. The performance of this filter is analyzed using real-world
current profile under fluctuating signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, the
applicability of the algorithms and analysis in this paper in identifying
higher order electrical equivalent circuit models is explained.

one hand, detached EBs hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like

measurements. On the other hand, the oscillations and surface activity of stars
that belong to EBs offer unique information about the evolution of binary
systems. This paper builds upon previous works dedicated to red giant stars
(RG) in EBs -- 20 known systems so far -- discovered by the NASA Kepler
mission. Here we report the discovery of 16 RGs in EBs also from the Kepler

systems where the RG display a clear surface activity and complete oscillation
suppression. Based on dedicated high-resolution spectroscopic observations
(Apache Point Observatory, Observatoire de Haute Provence), we focus on three
main aspects. From the extended sample of 14 SB2-EBs, we first confirm that the
simple application of the asteroseismic scaling relations to RGs overestimates
masses and radii of RGs, by about 15% and 5%. This bias can be reduced by
employing either new asteroseismic reference values for RGs, or model-based
corrections of the asteroseismic parameters. Secondly, we confirm that close
binarity leads to a high level of photometric modulation (up to 10%), and a
suppression of solar-like oscillations. In particular, we show that it reduces
the lifetime of radial modes by a factor of up to 10. Thirdly, we use our 16
new systems to complement previous observational studies that aimed at
constraining tidal dissipation in interacting binaries. In particular, we
identify systems with circular orbits despite relatively young ages, which
suggests exploring complementary tidal dissipation mechanisms in the future.

posed by mixtures of environmental exposures. Two popular classes of models for
mixtures analyses are response-surface methods and exposure-index methods.
Response-surface methods estimate high-dimensional surfaces and are thus highly
flexible but difficult to interpret. In contrast, exposure-index methods
decompose coefficients from a linear model into an overall mixture effect and
individual index weights; these models yield easily interpretable effect
estimates and efficient inferences when model assumptions hold, but, like most
parsimonious models, incur bias when these assumptions do not hold. In this
paper we propose a Bayesian multiple index model framework that combines the
strengths of each, allowing for non-linear and non-additive relationships
between exposure indices and a health outcome, while reducing the
dimensionality of the exposure vector and estimating index weights with
variable selection. This framework contains response-surface and exposure-index
models as special cases, thereby unifying the two analysis strategies. This
unification increases the range of models possible for analyzing environmental
mixtures and health, allowing one to select an appropriate analysis from a

direct numerical simulation of the non-linear unit cell motion, we explicitly
show that our model allows sub-Planckian thermal diffusivity. We find that the
propagator of the acoustic phonons becomes incoherent throughout most of the

self-shadows estimated during the first stage, later prevent its baking into

physics. Here, we propose an exotic mechanics for generating orbital
frustration in hexagonal lattices. We study two-component (pseudospin-$1/2$)
Bose gases in $p$-orbital bands of two-dimensional hexagonal lattices, and find
that the system exhibits previously untouched orbital frustration as a result
of the interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom, in contrast to normal
Ising-type orbital ordering of spinless $p$-orbital band bosons in
two-dimensional hexagonal lattices. Based on the classification by symmetry
analysis, we find the interplay of orbital frustration and strong interaction
leads to exotic Mott and superfluid phases with spin-orbital intertwined
orders, in spite of the complete absence of spin-orbital interaction in the
Hamiltonian. Our study implies many-body correlations in a multi-orbital
setting could induce rich spin-orbital intertwined physics in complex lattice
structures.

  and time-inhomogeneous environment",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article, we consider a Branching Random Walk on the real line. The
genealogical structure is assumed to be given through a supercritical branching
process in the i.i.d. environment and satisfies the Kesten-Stigum condition.
The displacements coming from the same parent are assumed to have jointly
regularly varying tails. Conditioned on the survival of the underlying
genealogical tree, we prove that the appropriately normalized (normalization
depends on the quenched size of the $n$-th generation) maximum among positions
at the $n$-th generation converges weakly to a scale-mixture of Frech\'{e}t
random variable. Furthermore, we derive the weak limit of the point processes
composed of appropriately scaled positions at the $n$-th generation and show
that the limit point process is a member of the randomly scaled scale-decorated
Poisson point processes. Hence, an analog of the predictions by Brunet and
Derrida (2011) holds. We have obtained an explicit description of the limit
point process. This description captures the influence of the environment in
the joint asymptotic behavior of the extreme positions. We show that the law of
the clusters in the limit depends on the time-reversed environment. The
asymptotic distribution of the normalized rightmost position is derived as a
consequence. This approach (based on weak convergence of extremal processes)
can not be adapted when the genealogical structure is given through a
supercritical Branching Process in a time-Inhomogeneous Environment (BPIE) (due
to lack of structural regularity in the genealogical structure). We provide a
simple example where the point processes do not converge weakly. The tightness
of the point processes holds in this example though the point processes do not
(weakly) converge (due to having different subsequential weak limits). This
phenomenon is not yet known in the literature.

confirmation that the quantum world violates the Bell inequalities, being the

experiment relies on entanglement swapping, and our main claim is that this
geometry introduces an additional loophole in the argument from violation of
the Bell inequalities to action at a distance: the apparent action at a
distance may be an artifact of 'collider bias'. In the absence of
retrocausality, the sensitivity of such experiments to this 'Collider Loophole'
(CL) depends on the temporal relation between the entanglement swapping
measurement C and the two measurements A and B between which we seek to infer a
causal connection. CL looms large if the C is in the future of A and B, but not
if C is in the past. The Delft experiment itself is the intermediate case, in
which the separation is spacelike. We argue that this leaves it vulnerable to
CL, unable to establish conclusively that it avoids it. An Appendix discusses
the implications of permitting retrocausality for the issue of causal influence
across entanglement swapping measurements.

$c_i$ and the radii $r_i$. The joint distribution for the array of channel taps
and their realizations are unknown to both the transmitter and the receiver. A
lower bound (achievability result) is presented on the channel capacity which
results in an upper bound on the capacity loss compared to when all radii are
zeros. The lower bound on the channel capacity saturates at a positive value as
the maximum average input power $P$ increases beyond what is referred to as the

proportional to the sum of the squares of the radii $r_i$. A partial converse

equilibrium water uptake, the ions exhibit a similar level of hydration as they
would in their saturated aqueous solution. The framework of Manning's limiting
law for counterion condensation is used to examine ionic interactions in the
simulated polysulfones. The dielectric constant that the ions experience can be
well approximated by a volume-weighted average of the dielectric constants of
the polymer backbone and water. Our results show that a reasonable estimate of
the average inter-ion distance, b, is obtained by using the distance where the
sulfonate-sulfonate coordination number reaches 1. The spacing of the sulfonate
ions along the polysulfone backbone plays a role in determining their spatial
distribution inside the hydrated polymer. As a result, the value of b is
slightly larger for polymers where the sulfonate ions are more evenly spaced
along the backbone, which is consistent with experimental evidence. The
simulations reveal that the sulfonate ions and sodium counterions form
fibrillar aggregates at water contents below the equilibrium water uptake. Such
extensive ionic aggregates are expected to facilitate ion transport in
sulfonated polysulfone membranes, without the need for long-range chain motion
as in the case of traditional rubbery ionic polymers. Our estimates for the
dielectric constant and b are used in conjunction with Manning's theory to
estimate the fraction of counterions condensed to the fixed ions. The

dispersion measure of the pulsar. However, this assumes that the thermal
electron density and magnetic field of the interstellar medium are
uncorrelated. Using numerical simulations and observations, we test the
validity of this assumption. Based on magnetohydrodynamical simulations of
driven turbulence, we show that the correlation between the thermal electron
density and the small-scale magnetic field increases with increasing Mach
number of the turbulence. We find that the assumption of uncorrelated thermal
electron density and magnetic fields is valid only for subsonic and transsonic
flows, but for supersonic turbulence, the field strength can be severely
overestimated by using $1.232 \, \text{RM}/\text{DM}$. We then correlate
existing pulsar observations from the Australia Telescope National Facility
with regions of enhanced thermal electron density and magnetic fields probed by
${^{12} \mathrm {CO}}$ data of molecular clouds, magnetic fields from the
Zeeman splitting of the 21 cm line, neutral hydrogen column density, and
H$\alpha$ observations. Using these observational data, we show that the
thermal electron density and magnetic fields are largely uncorrelated over kpc

determine the pathway and mechanism for toroid formation. We first imaged
short-length (L=217-1023 nm) DNA molecules in 0-5.0 $\mu$M protamine using an
atomic force microscope (AFM). At low protamine concentrations (0.2-0.6
$\mu$M), molecules dramatically condensed, folding into a flower structure.
Dynamic folding measurements of the DNA using a tethered particle motion (TPM)
assay revealed a corresponding, initial folding event, which was >3 loops at
L=398 nm. The initial folding event was made up of smaller (<1 loop) events
that had similar dynamics as protamine-induced bending. This suggests that
flowers form in an initial step as protamine binds and bends the DNA. It was
not until higher protamine concentrations (>2 $\mu$M) that DNA in the AFM assay
formed small (<10 loop), vertically packed toroids. Taken together, these
results lead us to propose a nucleation-growth model of toroid formation that
includes a flower intermediate. This pathway is important in both in vivo DNA

circle distance. In this setting, the Mat{\'e}rn family of covariance functions

to model smooth data. Finding a suitable analogue for modelling data on the

family has a parameter that indexes the mean square differentiability of the

dimension. Our simulation study mimics the fixed domain asymptotic setting,
which is the most natural regime for sampling on a closed and bounded set. As
expected, our results support the analogous results (under the same asymptotic

led to significant budget deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues.
Additionally, public transit agencies are facing challenges of reduced vehicle
capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional costs of cleaning
and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to
these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted
essential service plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or
frequencies. This paper studies the resiliency during a pandemic of On-Demand
Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit systems that
combine a network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to
serve the first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It
presents a case study for the city of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple
scenarios of depressed demand and social distancing representing various stages

  The case study relies on an optimization pipeline that provides an end-to-end
ODMTS solution by bringing together methods for demand estimation, network
design, fleet sizing, and real-time dispatching. These methods are adapted to
work in a multimodal setting and to satisfy practical constraints. In
particular, a limit is imposed on the number of passenger transfers, and a new

from this constraint. Real data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit

evaluated with a high-fidelity simulation. The case study demonstrates how

representative of the ""true"" probability that event, or outcome, will occur.
Unfortunately, for modern deep neural networks this is not the case, they are
often observed to be poorly calibrated. Additionally, these deep learning
approaches make use of large numbers of model parameters, motivating the use of
Bayesian, or ensemble approximation, approaches to handle issues with parameter
estimation. This paper explores the application of calibration schemes to deep
ensembles from both a theoretical perspective and empirically on a standard
image classification task, CIFAR-100. The underlying theoretical requirements
for calibration, and associated calibration criteria, are first described. It
is shown that well calibrated ensemble members will not necessarily yield a
well calibrated ensemble prediction, and if the ensemble prediction is well
calibrated its performance cannot exceed that of the average performance of the
calibrated ensemble members. On CIFAR-100 the impact of calibration for
ensemble prediction, and associated calibration is evaluated. Additionally the
situation where multiple different topologies are combined together is
discussed.

  flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an exact analytical solution to the problem of shear dispersion
given a general initial condition. The solution is expressed as an infinite
series expansion involving Mathieu functions and their eigenvalues. The
eigenvalue system depends on the imaginary parameter $q=2ik$Pe, with $k$ the
wavenumber that determines the tracer scale in the initial condition and Pe the
P\'{e}clet number. Solutions are valid for all Pe, $t>0$, and $k>0$ except at
specific values of $q=q_{\ell}^{EP}$ called Exceptional Points (EPs), the first
occurring at $q_{0}^{EP}\approx1.468i$. For values of $q \lessapprox 1.468i$,
all the eigenvalues are real, different and eigenfunctions decay with time,
thus shear dispersion can be represented as a diffusive process. For values of
$q \gtrapprox 1.468i$, pairs of eigenvalues coalesce at EPs becoming complex
conjugates, the eigenfunctions propagate and decay with time, and so shear
dispersion is no longer a purely diffusive process.
  The limit $q\rightarrow0$ is approached by the small P\'{e}clet number limit
for all finite $k>0$, or equally by the large P\'{e}clet number limit as long
as $2k \ll 1/$Pe. The latter implies $k\rightarrow0$, strong separation of
scales between the tracer and flow. The limit $q\rightarrow\infty$ results from
large P\'{e}clet number for any $k>0$, or from large $k$ and non-vanishing Pe.
  We derive an exact closure that is continuous in wavenumber space. At small
$q$, the closure approaches a diffusion operator with an effective diffusivity
proportional to $U_0^2/\kappa$, for flow speed $U_0$ and diffusivity $\kappa$.
At large $q$, the closure approaches the sum of an advection operator plus a
half-derivative operator (differential operator of fractional order), the
latter with coefficient proportional to $\sqrt{\kappa U_0}$.

${\mathcal C}_x^C$ should be Legendrian with respect to the induced contact

COVID-19. Machine learning methods can be employed to train models from labeled
CT images and predict whether a case is positive or negative. However, there
exists no publicly-available and large-scale CT data to train accurate models.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage attentive transfer learning framework
for improving COVID-19 diagnosis. Our proposed framework consists of three
stages to train accurate diagnosis models through learning knowledge from
multiple source tasks and data of different domains. Importantly, we propose a
novel self-supervised learning method to learn multi-scale representations for
lung CT images. Our method captures semantic information from the whole lung
and highlights the functionality of each lung region for better representation
learning. The method is then integrated to the last stage of the proposed
transfer learning framework to reuse the complex patterns learned from the same
CT images. We use a base model integrating self-attention (ATTNs) and
convolutional operations. Experimental results show that networks with ATTNs
induce greater performance improvement through transfer learning than networks
without ATTNs. This indicates attention exhibits higher transferability than
convolution. Our results also show that the proposed self-supervised learning
method outperforms several baseline methods.

dataset is usually required. A simple yet effective way to improve recognition
performance is to use a dataset as large as possible by combining multiple
datasets in the training. However, it is problematic and troublesome to naively
combine different datasets due to two major issues. First, the same person can
possibly appear in different datasets, leading to an identity overlapping issue
between different datasets. Naively treating the same person as different
classes in different datasets during training will affect back-propagation and
generate non-representative embeddings. On the other hand, manually cleaning
labels may take formidable human efforts, especially when there are millions of
images and thousands of identities. Second, different datasets are collected in
different situations and thus will lead to different domain distributions.
Naively combining datasets will make it difficult to learn domain invariant
embeddings across different datasets. In this paper, we propose DAIL:
Dataset-Aware and Invariant Learning to resolve the above-mentioned issues. To
solve the first issue of identity overlapping, we propose a dataset-aware loss
for multi-dataset training by reducing the penalty when the same person appears

with a dataset-aware term. To solve the second issue, domain adaptation with
gradient reversal layers is employed for dataset invariant learning. The

unusually long rise time; $18.9\pm2.7$d in $V$ band and a bright $V$ band peak
absolute magnitude of $-18.7\pm0.06$ mag. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen

in their expansion velocities, which when compared to large samples of SNe II

mass, a large amount of synthesized $^{56}$Ni, 0.3-0.4 M$_\odot$, and an
explosion energy of $2.5-3.0\times10^{51}$ ergs. The density structure and
expansion velocities of SN 2013ai are similar to that of the prototypical SN
IIb, SN 1993J. However, SN 2013ai shows no strong helium features in the
optical, likely due to the presence of a dense core that prevents the majority
of $\gamma$-rays from escaping to excite helium. Our analysis suggests that SN
2013ai could be a link between SNe II and stripped envelope SNe.

To reduce the inconsistency amongst validation study results and provide a more

competing prediction systems based upon (1) an unbiased statistic, Standardised
Accuracy, (2) testing the result likelihood relative to the baseline technique
of random 'predictions', that is guessing, and (3) calculation of effect sizes.
Results: Previously published empirical evaluations of prediction systems are
re-examined and the original conclusions shown to be unsafe. Additionally, even
the strongest results are shown to have no more than a medium effect size

to an infinite number of degeneracies in the DLCQ approach. More generally, we
show that many single-trace states in the theory are threshold bound states

explained using the Kac-Moody algebra of the SU$(N)$ current. We also present
strong numerical evidence that additional threshold states appear in the

rechargeable batteries. Coulomb counting is one of the traditional approaches
to state of charge estimation and it is considered reliable as long as the
battery capacity and initial state of charge are known. However, the Coulomb
counting method is susceptible to errors from several sources and the extent of
these errors are not studied in the literature. In this paper, we formally
derive and quantify the state of charge estimation error during Coulomb
counting due to the following four types of error sources: (i) current
measurement error; (ii) current integration approximation error; (iii) battery
capacity uncertainty; and (iv) the timing oscillator error/drift. It is shown
that the resulting state of charge error can either be of the time-cumulative
or of state-of-charge-proportional type. Time-cumulative errors increase with
time and has the potential to completely invalidate the state of charge
estimation in the long run. State-of-charge-proportional errors increase with
the accumulated state of charge and reach its worst value within one
charge/discharge cycle. Simulation analyses are presented to demonstrate the
extent of these errors under several realistic scenarios and the paper
discusses approaches to reduce the time-cumulative and state of
charge-proportional errors.

two distinct factorizations of $x$ have the same length. The notion of

definition of a unique factorization domain. However, being a length-factorial
monoid is in general weaker than being a factorial monoid (i.e., a unique
factorization monoid). Here we further investigate length-factoriality. First,
we offer two characterizations of a length-factorial monoid $M$, and we use

the phase caused by the extended object and reconstruct the point spread

disc-like flattening. 2) In the south-eastern quadrant, a large Doppler

possible association with an evaporating planetary companion is questioned. 3)
A crude evaluation of the respective contributions of rotation, expansion and
turbulence to the morpho-kinematics is presented. Significant line broadening
occurs below $\sim$12 au from the star and causes the presence of high Doppler
velocity components near the line of sight pointing to the centre of the star.

of self-absorption. The presence of a cold SiO layer extending up to some 60 au

  To meet this challenge, we propose a novel solution for maintaining low
request latency and high transactions per second (TPS): replicate
nontransactional data by followers and confirm by the leader to achieve
nonconfliction SMR, rather than all by the leader. Our solution, named Leader

is designed to ensure the reliability and consistency of LCR when meeting

environments, the TPS of LCR is 1.4X-1.9X higher than Raft, the transactional
data response time is reduced by 40%-60%, and the network traffic is reduced by

training deep neural networks, which has been pointed out to be divergent even
in the simple convex setting via a few simple counterexamples. Many attempts,
such as decreasing an adaptive learning rate, adopting a big batch size,
incorporating a temporal decorrelation technique, seeking an analogous

converge. In contrast with existing approaches, we introduce an alternative
easy-to-check sufficient condition, which merely depends on the parameters of
the base learning rate and combinations of historical second-order moments, to
guarantee the global convergence of generic Adam for solving large-scale
non-convex stochastic optimization. This observation, coupled with this
sufficient condition, gives much deeper interpretations on the divergence of
Adam. On the other hand, in practice, mini-Adam and distributed-Adam are widely
used without any theoretical guarantee. We further give an analysis on how the
batch size or the number of nodes in the distributed system affects the
convergence of Adam, which theoretically shows that mini-batch and distributed
Adam can be linearly accelerated by using a larger mini-batch size or a larger
number of nodes.At last, we apply the generic Adam and mini-batch Adam with the
sufficient condition for solving the counterexample and training several neural

changes with time for different shear rates, which is more useful than a
typical end-to-end distance analysis. We identified whether the polymer chains
undergo a tumbling rotation (slight elongation not accompanying contraction) or
flipping rotation (elongation accompanying contraction). The simulation results
indicate that the polymer chains exhibit a significant tendency to elongate at
higher shear rates and occasionally experience flipping, while lower shear
rates tend to exhibit very frequent tumbling. Furthermore, no rotations were
observed under extensional flows. These results help clarifying uncertainty of
previously proposed polymer deformation mechanisms of the convective constraint

power density spectra of luminosity variation show the peak frequencies which
correspond to the periods of $5 \times 10^5$, $1.4 \times 10^5$, and $5 \times

to the interaction between the outer oscillating standing shock and the inner

steady and symmetric to the equator. The steady standing shock is formed more

be the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever observed in a
binary compact object system. To explore the possible equation of state (EOS),
which can support such massive neutron star, we apply the relativistic
mean-field model with a density-dependent isovector coupling constant to
describe the neutron-star matter. The acceptable EOS should satisfy some
constraints: the EOS model can provide a satisfactory description of the
nuclei; the maximum mass $M_\textrm{TOV}$ is above 2.6 $M_{\odot}$; the tidal
deformability of a canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star $\Lambda_{1.4}$
should lie in the constrained range from GW170817. In this paper, we find that
the nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence play a crucial role in
determining the EOS of neutron-star matter. The constraints from the mass of
2.6 $M_{\odot}$ and the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}=616_{-158}^{+273}$
(based on the assumption that GW190814 is a neutron star-black hole binary) can

  Classification","Accept by DASFAA'21",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph classification is a critical research problem in many applications from
different domains. In order to learn a graph classification model, the most
widely used supervision component is an output layer together with
classification loss (e.g.,cross-entropy loss together with softmax or margin
loss). In fact, the discriminative information among instances are more
fine-grained, which can benefit graph classification tasks. In this paper, we
propose the novel Label Contrastive Coding based Graph Neural Network (LCGNN)
to utilize label information more effectively and comprehensively. LCGNN still
uses the classification loss to ensure the discriminability of classes.
Meanwhile, LCGNN leverages the proposed Label Contrastive Loss derived from
self-supervised learning to encourage instance-level intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To power the contrastive learning, LCGNN
introduces a dynamic label memory bank and a momentum updated encoder. Our
extensive evaluations with eight benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that
LCGNN can outperform state-of-the-art graph classification models. Experimental
results also verify that LCGNN can achieve competitive performance with less
training data because LCGNN exploits label information comprehensively.

  global sensitivity analysis",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Global sensitivity analysis is the main quantitative technique for
identifying the most influential input variables in a numerical simulation
model. In particular when the inputs are independent, Sobol' sensitivity
indices attribute a portion of the output of interest variance to each input
and all possible interactions in the model, thanks to a functional ANOVA
decomposition. On the other hand, moment-independent sensitivity indices focus
on the impact of input variables on the whole output distribution instead of
the variance only, thus providing complementary insight on the inputs / output
relationship. Unfortunately they do not enjoy the nice decomposition property
of Sobol' indices and are consequently harder to analyze. In this paper, we
introduce two moment-independent indices based on kernel-embeddings of
probability distributions and show that the RKHS framework used for their
definition makes it possible to exhibit a kernel-based ANOVA decomposition.
This is the first time such a desirable property is proved for sensitivity
indices apart from Sobol' ones. When the inputs are dependent, we also use
these new sensitivity indices as building blocks to design kernel-embedding
Shapley effects which generalize the traditional variance-based ones used in
sensitivity analysis. Several estimation procedures are discussed and
illustrated on test cases with various output types such as categorical
variables and probability distributions. All these examples show their
potential for enhancing traditional sensitivity analysis with a kernel point of
view.

scale particle motion, namely, the smoothing of intra-pore velocity contrasts,
the increase of the tortuosity of particle paths, and the setting of a maximum
time for particle transitions. Based on these mechanisms, we derive a theory
that predicts anomalous and normal hydrodynamic dispersion based on the
characteristic pore length, Eulerian velocity distribution and P\'eclet number.

humans in realistic settings, we will need to ensure that the agents are
\emph{robust}. Since the real world is very diverse, and human behavior often
changes in response to agent deployment, the agent will likely encounter novel
situations that have never been seen during training. This results in an
evaluation challenge: if we cannot rely on the average training or validation
reward as a metric, then how can we effectively evaluate robustness? We take
inspiration from the practice of \emph{unit testing} in software engineering.
Specifically, we suggest that when designing AI agents that collaborate with
humans, designers should search for potential edge cases in \emph{possible
partner behavior} and \emph{possible states encountered}, and write tests which
check that the behavior of the agent in these edge cases is reasonable. We
apply this methodology to build a suite of unit tests for the Overcooked-AI
environment, and use this test suite to evaluate three proposals for improving
robustness. We find that the test suite provides significant insight into the
effects of these proposals that were generally not revealed by looking solely
at the average validation reward.

or fully autonomous, require human driver supervision and are currently
constrained to visual information in their line-of-sight. A cooperative
perception system among vehicles increases their situational awareness by
extending their perception range. Existing solutions focus on improving
perspective transformation and fast information collection. However, such
solutions fail to filter out large amounts of less relevant data and thus
impose significant network and computation load. Moreover, presenting all this
less relevant data can overwhelm the driver and thus actually hinder them. To
address such issues, we present Augmented Informative Cooperative Perception
(AICP), the first fast-filtering system which optimizes the informativeness of
shared data at vehicles to improve the fused presentation.
  To this end, an informativeness maximization problem is presented for
vehicles to select a subset of data to display to their drivers. Specifically,
we propose (i) a dedicated system design with custom data structure and
lightweight routing protocol for convenient data encapsulation, fast
interpretation and transmission, and (ii) a comprehensive problem formulation
and efficient fitness-based sorting algorithm to select the most valuable data
to display at the application layer.
  We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of AICP with a bandwidth-hungry,
latency-constrained real-life augmented reality application. The prototype adds
only 12.6 milliseconds of latency to a current informativeness-unaware system.
Next, we test the networking performance of AICP at scale and show that ACIP
effectively filters out less relevant packets and decreases the channel busy
time.

services. Yet, opportunistic traders extract monetary value from the mesh of
decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts through so-called blockchain
extractable value (BEV). The recent emergence of centralized BEV relayer
portrays BEV as a positive additional revenue source. Because BEV was
quantitatively shown to deteriorate the blockchain's consensus security, BEV
relayers endanger the ledger security by incentivizing rational miners to fork
the chain. For example, a rational miner with a 10% hashrate will fork Ethereum
if a BEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block reward.
  However, related work is currently missing quantitative insights on past BEV
extraction to assess the practical risks of BEV objectively. In this work, we
allow to quantify the BEV danger by deriving the USD extracted from sandwich
attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage. We estimate that
over 32 months, BEV yielded 540.54M USD in profit, divided among 11,289
addresses when capturing 49,691 cryptocurrencies and 60,830 on-chain markets.
The highest BEV instance we find amounts to 4.1M USD, 616.6x the Ethereum block
reward.
  Moreover, while the practitioner's community has discussed the existence of
generalized trading bots, we are, to our knowledge, the first to provide a
concrete algorithm. Our algorithm can replace unconfirmed transactions without
the need to understand the victim transactions' underlying logic, which we
estimate to have yielded a profit of 57,037.32 ETH (35.37M USD) over 32 months
of past blockchain data.
  Finally, we formalize and analyze emerging BEV relay systems, where miners
accept BEV transactions from a centralized relay server instead of the
peer-to-peer (P2P) network. We find that such relay systems aggravate the
consensus layer attacks and therefore further endanger blockchain security.

that the poles of such superprojectors correspond to (partially) massless

a highly desirable trait of an automatic system, as it improves the robustness
and usefulness in downstream tasks. In this paper we investigate confidence
estimation for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). Previous work has
addressed confidence measures for lattice-based ASR, while current machine
learning research mostly focuses on confidence measures for unstructured deep
learning. However, as the ASR systems are increasingly being built upon deep
end-to-end methods, there is little work that tries to develop confidence
measures in this context. We fill this gap by providing an extensive benchmark
of popular confidence methods on four well-known speech datasets. There are two
challenges we overcome in adapting existing methods: working on structured data
(sequences) and obtaining confidences at a coarser level than the predictions
(words instead of tokens). Our results suggest that a strong baseline can be
obtained by scaling the logits by a learnt temperature, followed by estimating
the confidence as the negative entropy of the predictive distribution and,
finally, sum pooling to aggregate at word level.

topological defects (DTDs) can be quantitatively characterized in terms of
Burgers circuits (and the resulting Burgers vectors) which are constructed on

the manifestation of incompatibility of deformation in glasses as a result of
violation of Cauchy-Born rules (nonaffinity); (ii) the resulting average
Burgers vector displays peaks in correspondence of major plastic events,
including a spectacular non-local peak at the yielding transition, which
results from self-organization into shear bands due to the attractive
interaction between anti-parallel DTDs; (iii) application of Schmid's law to
the DTDs leads to prediction of shear bands at 45 degrees for uniaxial
deformations, as widely observed in experiments and simulations.

semi-classical photon deletion theory that the post-detection laser shot noise
contributions on both receivers must be completely uncorrelated in this case of

measurement), and obtain a cross-correlation system noise temperature up to 20

cross-correlation standard deviations 30 times lower than in auto-correlation.
Careful calibration of the source power shows that the auto-correlation

near to the quantum limit as expected, which suggests a cross-correlation
system noise temperature below the quantum limit. If validated further, this
experimentally clear finding will not only be relevant for astronomical

sharp gains in recovering the true dynamic network over existing dynamic

cryptocurrencies, including smart contracts -- which let users execute
arbitrary code in a distributed and decentralized fashion. Regardless of their
intended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the
correct execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are
totally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not
necessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency (Guerraoui et al.,
PODC'19), contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current
implementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they
synchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work,
we study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract,
one of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a
smart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as
a measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods
supported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in
strictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the
synchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can
thus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a
dedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed
synchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as
other token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain
cryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific
synchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the
way towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.

performances. In this paper, we argue that learning strategies for deep
ensembles need to tackle the trade-off between ensemble diversity and
individual accuracies. Motivated by arguments from information theory and
leveraging recent advances in neural estimation of conditional mutual
information, we introduce a novel training criterion called DICE: it increases
diversity by reducing spurious correlations among features. The main idea is
that features extracted from pairs of members should only share information
useful for target class prediction without being conditionally redundant.
Therefore, besides the classification loss with information bottleneck, we
adversarially prevent features from being conditionally predictable from each
other. We manage to reduce simultaneous errors while protecting class
information. We obtain state-of-the-art accuracy results on CIFAR-10/100: for
example, an ensemble of 5 networks trained with DICE matches an ensemble of 7
networks trained independently. We further analyze the consequences on
calibration, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution detection and online

proposed for plane elasticity. It is based on the improvement of the strain
representation within the element, without altering the degree of the
displacement interpolating functions on the element boundary. The idea is to
fully exploit polygonal elements with a high number of sides, a peculiar VEM
feature, characterized by many displacement degrees of freedom on the element
boundary, even if a low interpolation order is assumed over each side. The
proposed approach is framed within a generalization of the classic VEM
formulation, obtained by introducing an energy norm in the projection operator
definition. Although such generalization may mainly appear to have a formal
value, it allows to effectively point out the mechanical meaning of the
quantities involved in the projection operator definition and to drive the
selection of the enhanced representations. Various enhancements are proposed
and tested through several numerical examples. Numerical results successfully
show the capability of the enhanced VEM formulation to (i) considerably
increase accuracy (with respect to standard VEM) while keeping the optimal
convergence rate, (ii) bypass the need of stabilization terms in many practical
cases, (iii) obtain natural serendipity elements in many practical cases, and
(vi) effectively treat also nearly incompressible materials.

like an efficient local computation algorithm that misclassifies at most an
$O(\epsilon)$ fraction of vertices in every expander. We refer to such a data
structure as a \textit{spectral clustering oracle}. Our main result is a
spectral clustering oracle with query time $O^*(n^{1/2+O(\epsilon)})$ and
preprocessing time $2^{O(\frac{1}{\epsilon} k^4 \log^2(k))}
n^{1/2+O(\epsilon)}$ that provides misclassification error $O(\epsilon \log k)$
per cluster for any $\epsilon \ll 1/\log k$. More generally, query time can be
reduced at the expense of increasing the preprocessing time appropriately (as
long as the product is about $n^{1+O(\epsilon)}$) -- this in particular gives a
nearly linear time spectral clustering primitive. The main technical
contribution is a sublinear time oracle that provides dot product access to the
spectral embedding of $G$ by estimating distributions of short random walks
from vertices in $G$. The distributions themselves provide a poor approximation
to the spectral embedding, but we show that an appropriate linear
transformation can be used to achieve high precision dot product access. We
then show that dot product access to the spectral embedding is sufficient to
design a clustering oracle. At a high level our approach amounts to hyperplane
partitioning in the spectral embedding of $G$, but crucially operates on a
nested sequence of carefully defined subspaces in the spectral embedding to
achieve per cluster recovery guarantees.

approach works only for quantum well widths smaller than the exciton radius.
After separation of variables, finite difference solution of the resulting
interaction equation gives a much better agreement with the full spectral

has a critical effect on the magnitudes of exciton absorption peaks,
suppressing previously allowed transitions and enhancing forbidden ones.

rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of the different interactions. In this
pilot study, we investigate the physical effects beyond the mean-field
approximation, known as electron correlation, in the ground state energies of
atomic systems using the classical-quantum hybrid variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. To this end, we consider three isoelectronic
species, namely Be, Li-, and B+. This unique choice spans three classes, a
neutral atom, an anion, and a cation. We have employed the unitary
coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz to perform a rigorous analysis of two very
important factors that could affect the precision of the simulations of
electron correlation effects within a basis, namely mapping and backend
simulator. We carry out our all-electron calculations with four such basis
sets. The results obtained are compared with those calculated by using the full
configuration interaction, traditional coupled-cluster and the UCC methods, on
a classical computer, to assess the precision of our results. A salient feature
of the study involves a detailed analysis to find the number of shots (the
number of times a VQE algorithm is repeated to build statistics) required for
calculations with IBM Qiskit's QASM simulator backend, which mimics an ideal

learning technology for predictive modeling of complex systems, described by
parametrized time-dependent PDEs. For these problems, typical finite element
approaches involve the spatiotemporal discretization of the PDE and the
solution of the corresponding linear system of equations at each time step.
Instead, the proposed method utilizes a convolutional autoencoder in
conjunction with a feed forward neural network to establish a low-cost and
accurate mapping from the problem's parametric space to its solution space. For
this purpose, time history response data are collected by solving the
high-fidelity model via FEM for a reduced set of parameter values. Then, by
applying the convolutional autoencoder to this data set, a low-dimensional
representation of the high-dimensional solution matrices is provided by the
encoder, while the reconstruction map is obtained by the decoder. Using the
latent representation given by the encoder, a feed-forward neural network is
efficiently trained to map points from the problem's parametric space to the
compressed version of the respective solution matrices. This way, the encoded
response of the system at new parameter values is given by the neural network,
while the entire response is delivered by the decoder. This approach
effectively bypasses the need to serially formulate and solve the system's
governing equations at each time increment, thus resulting in a significant
cost reduction and rendering the method ideal for problems requiring repeated
model evaluations or 'real-time' computations. The elaborated methodology is
demonstrated on the stochastic analysis of time-dependent PDEs solved with the
Monte Carlo method, however, it can be straightforwardly applied to other
similar-type problems, such as sensitivity analysis, design optimization, etc.

we present a direct measurement scheme based on phase-shifting operations which
do not need ancillary pointers. In this method, estimates of at most six
expectation values of projective observables suffice to determine any specific
element of an unknown quantum density matrix. A concrete quantum circuit to
implement this direct measurement protocol for multiqubit states is provided,
which is composed of just single-qubit gates and two multiqubit
controlled-phase gates. This scheme is also extended for the direct measurement
of the density matrix of continuous-variable quantum states. Our method can be
used in quantum information applications where only partial information about
the quantum state needs to be extracted, for example, problems such as
entanglement witnessing, fidelity estimation of quantum systems, and quantum

adaptive immune system, destroying B lymphocytes and reducing the diversity of

previously acquired immunization from vaccination or direct exposition to other
pathogens could be erased in a phenomenon named ""immune amnesia"", whose effects
can become particularly worrisome given the actual rise of anti-vaccination
movements. Here we present the first attempt to incorporate immune amnesia into
standard models of epidemic spreading. In particular, we analyze diverse
variants of a model that describes the spreading of two concurrent pathogens
causing measles and another generic disease: the SIR-IA model. Analytical and
computational studies confirm that immune amnesia can indeed have important
consequences for epidemic spreading, significantly altering the vaccination
coverage required to reach herd-immunity for concurring infectious diseases.
More specifically, we uncover the existence of novel propagating and endemic
phases which are induced by immune amnesia, that appear both in fully-connected
and more structured networks, such as random networks and power-law
degree-distributed ones. In particular, the transitions from a quiescent state
into these novel phases can become rather abrupt in some cases that we
specifically analyze. Furthermore, we discuss the meaning and consequences of
our results and their relation with, e.g., immunization strategies, together
with the possibility that explosive types of transitions may emerge, making
immune-amnesia effects particularly dramatic. This work opens the door to
further developments and analyses of immune amnesia effects, contributing, more
generally, to the theory of interacting epidemics on complex networks.

we develop and investigate a phenotype-structured model of solid tumour growth
in which cells are structured by a stemness level, which varies continuously
between stem-like and terminally differentiated behaviours. Cell evolution is
driven by proliferation and apoptosis, as well as advection and diffusion with
respect to the stemness structure variable. We use the model to investigate how
the environment, in particular oxygen levels, affects the tumour's population
dynamics and composition, and its response to radiotherapy. We use a
combination of numerical and analytical techniques to quantify how under
physiological oxygen levels the cells evolve to a differentiated phenotype and
under low oxygen level (i.e., hypoxia) they de-differentiate. Under normoxia,
the proportion of cancer stem cells is typically negligible and the tumour may
ultimately become extinct whereas under hypoxia cancer stem cells comprise a
dominant proportion of the tumour volume, enhancing radio-resistance and
favouring the tumour's long-term survival. We then investigate how such
phenotypic heterogeneity impacts the tumour's response to treatment with
radiotherapy under normoxia and hypoxia. Of particular interest is establishing
how the presence of radio-resistant cancer stem cells can facilitate a tumour's
regrowth following radiotherapy. We also use the model to show how
radiation-induced changes in tumour oxygen levels can give rise to complex
re-growth dynamics. For example, transient periods of hypoxia induced by damage
to tumour blood vessels may rescue the cancer cell population from extinction
and drive secondary regrowth. Further model extensions to account for spatial
variation are also discussed briefly.

right-handed (RH) neutrinos solves simultaneously the $\mu$- and
$\nu$-problems. We explore extensions of the $\mu \nu$SSM adding a $U(1)'$
gauge group, which provides the RH neutrinos with a non-vanishing charge. In
these models, dubbed U$\mu\nu$SSM, the anomaly cancellation conditions impose
the presence of exotic quarks in the spectrum that are vector-like under the
standard model (SM) gauge group: either three pairs $SU(2)$ quark singlets, or
a pair of quark singlets together with a pair of quark doublets. Several extra
singlets under the SM group can also be present, with the $U(1)'$ charges
making distinctions among them, and therefore allowing different types of
couplings. Some of these singlets dynamically generate Majorana masses for the
RH neutrinos, and others can be candidates for dark matter. The useful
characteristics of models with $U(1)'$s are also present in U$\mu\nu$SSM
models: baryon-number-violating operators as well as explicit Majorana masses
and $\mu$ terms are forbidden, and the domain wall problem is avoided. The
phenomenology of U$\mu\nu$SSM models is very rich. We analyze the experimental
constraints on their parameter space, specially on the mass and mixing of the
new $Z'$ boson. In addition to the exotic quarks, which can hadronize inside
the detector or decay producing SM particles, the U$\mu\nu$SSM models can also
have new signals such as decays of the $Z'$ to sparticle pairs like right
sneutrinos, charginos or neutralinos. Besides, $Z'$ and Higgs mediated
annihilations and interactions with the visible sector of WIMP dark matter
particles, can also be present.

system is considered. A stochastic process with linear dynamics and Gaussian
noise is measured by multiple agent nodes, each equipped with multiple sensors.
The agent nodes form a multi-hop network among themselves. Each agent node
computes an estimate of the process by using its sensor observation and
messages obtained from neighboring nodes, via Kalman-consensus filtering. An
external attacker, capable of arbitrarily manipulating the sensor observations
of some or all agent nodes, injects errors into those sensor observations. The
goal of the attacker is to steer the estimates at the agent nodes as close as
possible to a pre-specified value, while respecting a constraint on the attack
detection probability. To this end, a constrained optimization problem is
formulated to find the optimal parameter values of a certain class of linear
attacks. The parameters of linear attack are learnt on-line via a combination
of stochastic approximation based update of a Lagrange multiplier, and an
optimization technique involving either the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions
or online stochastic gradient descent. The problem turns out to be convex for
some special cases. Desired convergence of the proposed algorithms are proved
by exploiting the convexity and properties of stochastic approximation
algorithms. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the attack.

using a model which accounts for scattering of radio waves by electron density
fluctuations in a turbulent plasma. This allows us to show the type II radio
sources were located $\sim$0.5 R$_\odot$ above the jet and propagated at a
speed of $\sim$1000 kms$^{-1}$, which was significantly faster than the jet
speed of $\sim$200 kms$^{-1}$. This suggests that the type II burst was
generated by a piston shock driven by the jet in the low corona.

is one of the most fundamental and crucial formulae in cosmology. This relation
couples the luminosity and angular diameter distances, two of the most often
used measures of structure in the Universe. We here propose a new
model-independent method to test this relation, using strong gravitational
lensing (SGL) and the high-redshift quasar Hubble diagram reconstructed with a
Bezier parametric fit. We carry out this test without pre-assuming a zero
spatial curvature, adopting instead the value Omega_K=0.001 +/- 0.002 optimized
by Planck in order to improve the reliability of our result. We parametrize the
CDDR using eta(z)=1 + eta_0 z, 1 + eta_1 z + eta_2 z^2 and 1 + eta_3 z/(1+z),
and consider both the SIS and non-SIS lens models for the strong lensing. Our
best fit results are: eta_0=-0.021^{+0.068}_{-0.048},
eta_1=-0.404^{+0.123}_{-0.090}, eta_2=0.106^{+0.028}_{-0.034}, and
eta_3=-0.507^{+0.193}_{-0.133} for the SIS model, and
eta_0=-0.109^{+0.044}_{-0.031} for the non-SIS model. The measured eta(z),
based on the Planck parameter Omega_K, is essentially consistent with the value
(=1) expected if the CDDR were fully respected. For the sake of comparison, we
also carry out the test for other values of Omega_K, but find that deviations
of spatial flatness beyond the Planck optimization are in even greater tension
with the CDDR. Future measurements of SGL may improve the statistics and alter
this result but, as of now, we conclude that the CDDR favours a flat Universe.

all-at-once setting. The advantages of the all-at-once formulation are known to
include the avoidance of a parameter-to-state map as well as numerical
improvements, especially when considering nonlinear problems. In the Bayesian
approach, prior knowledge is taken into account with the help of a prior
distribution. In addition, the error in the observation equation is formulated
by means of a distribution. This method naturally results in a whole posterior
distribution for the unknown target, not just point estimates. This allows for
further statistical analysis including the computation of credible intervals.
We combine the Bayesian setting with the all-at-once formulation, resulting in
a novel approach for investigating inverse problems. With this combination we
are able to chose a prior not only for the parameter, but also for the state
variable, which directly influences the parameter. Furthermore, errors not only
in the observation equation, but additionally, in the model can be taken into
account. %The aim of this approach is not only to accomplish reasonable
reconstructions of the unknown parameter but also to maximize the information
gained from measurements through combining it with prior knowledge, obtained
either from certain expertise or former investigation in the model. We analyze
this approach with the help of two linear standard examples, namely the inverse
source problem for the Poisson equation and the backwards heat equation, i.e. a
stationary and a time dependent problem. Appropriate function spaces and
derivation of adjoint operators are investigated. To assess the degree of
ill-posedness, we analyze the singular values of the corresponding all-at-once

identified correctly only with a probability $p$. Agents decide at each time
step to choose either cooperation or defection based on different information.
In the local scenario, they compare their potential gains from both strategies.
In the global scenario, they compare the gains of the cooperative and defective

information in the field, including the sample of all currently known optically
selected z>5.5 quasars and cross-matched secure Legacy DR8 counterparts of
eROSITA-detected X-ray point-like sources with this spectroscopic sample. We
report the X-ray detection of an eROSITA source securely matched to the
well-known quasar SDSS J083643.85+005453.3 (z=5.81). The soft X-ray flux of the
source derived from eROSITA is consistent with previous Chandra observations.
In addition, we report the detection of the quasar with LOFAR at 145 MHz and
ASKAP at 888 MHz. The reported flux densities confirm a spectral flattening at
lower frequencies in the emission of the radio core, indicating that the quasar
could be a (sub-) gigahertz peaked spectrum source. The inferred spectral shape
and the parsec-scale radio morphology of SDSS J083643.85+005453.3 suggest that
it is in an early stage of its evolution into a large-scale radio source or
confined in a dense environment. We find no indications for a strong jet
contribution to the X-ray emission of the quasar, which is therefore likely to
be linked to accretion processes. The detection of this source allows us to
place the first constraints on the XLF at z>5.5 based on a secure spectroscopic
redshift. Compared to extrapolations from lower-redshift observations, this
favours a relatively flat slope for the XLF at $z\sim 6$ beyond $L_*$. The
population of X-ray luminous AGNs at high redshift may be larger than
previously thought. From our XLF constraints, we make the conservative
prediction that eROSITA will detect $\sim 90$ X-ray luminous AGNs at redshifts
5.7<z<6.4 in the full-sky survey (De+RU).

the baryonic matter known to be present in the universe. Additional baryons are
found to be in diffuse (gaseous) form, in or between galaxies, but a
significant fraction has not yet been seen. The latter (missing baryons) are
thought to be hiding in low-density warm-hot ionized medium (WHIM), based on
results from theoretical studies and recent observations, and be distributed in
the vicinity of galaxies (i.e., circum-galactic medium) and between galaxies
(i.e., intergalactic medium). Such gas would radiate mainly in the soft X-ray
band and the emission would be very weak, due to its very low density. HUBS is
optimized to detect the X-ray emission from the hot baryons in the
circum-galactic medium, and thus fill a void in observational astronomy. The
goal is not only to detect the missing baryons, but to characterize their
physical and chemical properties, as well as to measure their spatial
distribution. The results would establish the boundary conditions for
understanding galaxy evolution. Though highly challenging, detecting missing
baryons in the intergalactic medium could be attempted, perhaps in the
outskirts of galaxy clusters, and could shed significant light on the
large-scale structures of the universe. The current design of HUBS will be

loss of confidence may propagate mostly within high income households, or

two. We find that crises are more severe for segregated networks (where
confidence feedback is essentially mediated between agents of the same social

reason, larger income inequalities tend to reduce, in our model, the
probability of global crises. Finally, we are able to reproduce a perhaps

less than that of the highest incomes in crisis times.

subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into account the
time-delay for recovery or death processes. The dynamic equations for the
entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type reaction approach. More
specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine measures are modelled by some
kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be
trapped into inactive states. The dynamics for the recovered people is obtained
by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalised infected people.
To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis- Menten
enzyme-substrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is
associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to the infected
people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In other words,
everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyser in the hospital
recovery process. Of course, in our case the reverse MM reactions has no sense
in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal to zero. Finally,
the O.D.E.s for people tested positive to COVID-19 is simply modelled by the
following kinetic scheme S+I=>2I with I=>R or I=>D, with S, I, R, and D
denoting the compartments Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased
people, respectively. The resulting kinetic-type equation} provide the O.D.E.s,
for elementary reaction steps, describing the number of the infected people,
the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised, subject to
the lockdown and the quarantine measure, and the total number of deaths. The
model foresees also the second wave of Infection by Coronavirus. The tests
carried out on real data for Belgium, France and Germany confirmed the
correctness of our model.

potential where it is free to diffuse. We calculate the particle's probability
distribution function (PDF) at coordinate $x$ and time $t$, $P(x,t)$, by
solving the corresponding Smoluchowski equation. The solution is expressed by a
multipole expansion, with each term decaying $t^{1/2}$ faster than the previous
one. At asymptotically large times, the PDF outside the well converges to the
Gaussian PDF of a free Brownian particle. The average energy, which is
proportional to the probability of finding the particle inside the well,
diminishes as $E\sim 1/t^{1/2}$. Interestingly, we find that the free energy of
the particle, $F$, approaches the free energy of a freely diffusing particle,
$F_0$, as $\delta F=F-F_0\sim 1/t$, i.e., at a rate faster than $E$. We provide
analytical and computational evidences that this scaling behavior of $\delta F$
is a general feature of Brownian dynamics in non-confining potential fields.
Furthermore, we argue that $\delta F$ represents a diminishing entropic
component which is localized in the region of the potential, and which diffuses

interleaved linearized Reed-Solomon codes. Compared to the construction by

increased packet size. The proposed decoder is a list decoder that can also be
interpreted as a probabilistic unique decoder. Although our best upper bound on
the list size is exponential, we present a heuristic argument and simulation

transport and L-H transition dynamics of tokamaks. Our recent calculation finds
that a sufficiently strong localized toroidal rotation can directly bring out
the formation of edge pressure pedestal with reversed magnetic shear that is
reminiscent of an H-mode plasma, purely through the effects of toroidal
rotation on the tokamak MHD equilibrium itself. In particular, the enhanced
edge toroidal rotation enables a substantial peaking of the parallel current
profile near edge in higher $\beta$ regimes, which leads to the flattening or
reversal of the local $q$ (safety factor) profile. Here the formation of
pressure pedestal along with the reversed magnetic shear region is shown to be
the natural outcome of the MHD tokamak equilibrium in a self-consistent
response to the presence of a localized toroidal rotation typically observed in
H-mode or QH-mode.

high rates between the transmitting users in a wireless network. However, the
quality of the wireless channels between the users substantially limits the
achievable computation rate in such systems. In this paper, we introduce the
idea of using intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to enhance the computing
capability of the compute-and-forward systems. For this purpose, we consider a
multiple access channel(MAC) where a number of users aim to send data to a base
station (BS) in a wireless network, where the BS is interested in decoding a
linear combination of the data from different users in the corresponding finite
field. Considering the compute-and-forward framework, we show that through
carefully designing the IRS parameters, such a scenario's computation rate can
be significantly improved. More specifically, we formulate an optimization
problem which aims to maximize the computation rate of the system through
optimizing the IRS phase shift parameters. We then propose an alternating
optimization (AO) approach to solve the formulated problem with low complexity.
Finally, via various numerical results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
IRS technology for enhancing the performance of the compute-and-forward
systems, which indicates its great potential for future wireless networks with
massive computation requirements, such as 6G.

proposed. A space-time tensor formalism is used to express the equations of
motion covariantly and to describe the geometry of the rotated cubed-sphere
grid. The spatial discretization is done with the direct flux reconstruction
method, which is an alternative formulation to the discontinuous Galerkin
approach. The equations of motion are solved in differential form and the
resulting discretization is free from quadrature rules. It is well known that
the time step of traditional explicit methods is limited by the phase velocity
of the fastest waves. Exponential integration is employed to enable
integrations with significantly larger time step sizes and improve the
efficiency of the overall time integration. New multistep-type exponential
propagation iterative methods of orders 4, 5 and 6 are constructed and applied
to integrate the shallow-water equations in time. These new schemes enable time
integration with high-order accuracy but without significant increases in
computational time compared to low-order methods. The exponential matrix
functions-vector products used in the exponential schemes are approximated
using the complex-step approximation of the Jacobian in the Krylov-based KIOPS
(Krylov with incomplete orthogonalization procedure solver) algorithm.
Performance of the new numerical methods is evaluated using a set of standard
benchmark tests.

Stackelberg game theory. We first prove the existence of the Stackelberg
equilibrium, and then we propose two distributed algorithms, namely iterative
proximal offloading algorithm (IPOA) and iterative Stackelberg game pricing
algorithm (ISPA). The IPOA solves the follower non-cooperative game among IoT
MDs and ISPA uses backward induction to deal with the price competition among
OSPs. Experimental results show that IPOA can markedly reduce the disutility of
IoT MDs compared with other traditional task offloading schemes and the price
of anarchy is always less than 150\%. Besides, results also demonstrate that
ISPA is reliable in boosting the revenue of OSPs.

  Systems","30 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless
  Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes an off-grid channel estimation scheme for orthogonal
time-frequency space (OTFS) systems adopting the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)
framework. To avoid channel spreading caused by the fractional delay and
Doppler shifts and to fully exploit the channel sparsity in the delay-Doppler
(DD) domain, we estimate the original DD domain channel response rather than
the effective DD domain channel response as commonly adopted in the literature.
OTFS channel estimation is first formulated as a one-dimensional (1D) off-grid
sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem based on a virtual sampling grid defined
in the DD space, where the on-grid and off-grid components of the delay and
Doppler shifts are separated for estimation. In particular, the on-grid
components of the delay and Doppler shifts are jointly determined by the entry
indices with significant values in the recovered sparse vector. Then, the
corresponding off-grid components are modeled as hyper-parameters in the
proposed SBL framework, which can be estimated via the expectation-maximization
method. To strike a balance between channel estimation performance and
computational complexity, we further propose a two-dimensional (2D) off-grid
SSR problem via decoupling the delay and Doppler shift estimations. In our
developed 1D and 2D off-grid SBL-based channel estimation algorithms, the
hyper-parameters are updated alternatively for computing the conditional
posterior distribution of channels, which can be exploited to reconstruct the
effective DD domain channel. Compared with the 1D method, the proposed 2D
method enjoys a much lower computational complexity while only suffers slight
performance degradation. Simulation results verify the superior performance of
the proposed channel estimation schemes over state-of-the-art schemes.

shrinking spline-based functional effects towards a predefined vector space of
parametric functions. Instead of shrinking each spline coefficient towards
zero, we use an adapted horseshoe prior to control the deviation from the
predefined vector space. For this purpose, the modified horseshoe prior is set
up with one scale parameter per spline and not one per coefficient. The
presented prior allows for a large number of basis functions to capture all
kinds of functional effects while the estimated functional effect is prevented
from a highly oscillating overfit. We achieve this by integrating a smoothing
penalty similar to the random walk prior commonly applied in Bayesian P-spline
priors. In a simulation study, we demonstrate the properties of the new prior
specification and compare it to other approaches from the literature.
Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of the proposed method by estimating
the energy consumption in Germany over the course of a day. For inference, we
rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations combining Gibbs sampling for the
spline coefficients with slice sampling for all scale parameters in the model.

approximation is more likely to be accurate and may also lead to slightly
higher computational efficiency. The transition parameters and scale parameters
in a VAR(1) process are hard to be estimated accurately and increasing the

dynamic analysis methods that can detect polymorphic and metamorphic malware
efficiently. In the present study, we propose a methodological framework for
detecting malicious code by analyzing run trace outputs by Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM). We developed models of run traces of malicious and benign
Portable Executable (PE) files. We created our dataset from run trace outputs
obtained from dynamic analysis of PE files. The obtained dataset was in the
instruction format as a sequence and was called Instruction as a Sequence Model
(ISM). By splitting the first dataset into basic blocks, we obtained the second
one called Basic Block as a Sequence Model (BSM). The experiments showed that
the ISM achieved an accuracy of 87.51% and a false positive rate of 18.34%,
while BSM achieved an accuracy of 99.26% and a false positive rate of 2.62%.

learning tasks. However, most such networks have poor performance gain per
parameter increase. In this paper, we investigate whether the gain observed in
deeper models is purely due to the addition of more optimization parameters or
whether the physical size of the network as well plays a role. Further, we
present a novel rescaling strategy for CNNs based on learnable repetition of
its parameters. Based on this strategy, we rescale CNNs without changing their
parameter count, and show that learnable sharing of weights itself can provide
significant boost in the performance of any given model without changing its
parameter count. We show that small base networks when rescaled, can provide
performance comparable to deeper networks with as low as 6% of optimization
parameters of the deeper one.
  The relevance of weight sharing is further highlighted through the example of
group-equivariant CNNs. We show that the significant improvements obtained with
group-equivariant CNNs over the regular CNNs on classification problems are
only partly due to the added equivariance property, and part of it comes from
the learnable repetition of network weights. For rot-MNIST dataset, we show
that up to 40% of the relative gain reported by state-of-the-art methods for
rotation equivariance could actually be due to just the learnt repetition of

accessed by the MPS approach are comparable to those studied in
state-of-the-art experiments. Results for 1D, quasi-1D, and 2D random systems,
as well as 1D quasi-periodic systems are presented. On time scales explored (up
to $t \approx 300$ in units set by the hopping amplitude), a slow, subdiffusive
transport in a rather broad disorder range on the ergodic side of the MBL
transition is found. For 1D random spin chains, which serve as a ""standard
model"" of the MBL transition, the MPS study demonstrates a substantial drift of
the critical point $W_c(L)$ with the system size $L$: while for $L \approx 20$
we find $W_c \approx 4$, as also given by exact diagonalization, the MPS
results for $L = 50$--100 provide evidence that the critical disorder
saturates, in the large-$L$ limit, at $W_c \approx 5.5$. For quasi-periodic
systems, these finite-size effects are much weaker, which suggests that they
can be largely attributed to rare events. For quasi-1D ($d\times L$, with $d
\ll L$) and 2D ($L\times L$) random systems, the MPS data demonstrate an
unbounded growth of $W_c$ in the limit of large $d$ and $L$, in agreement with
analytical predictions based on the rare-event avalanche theory.

order to derive efficient designs we use results from stochastic analysis to
identify the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) in a corresponding
continuous time model. It is demonstrated that in general simultaneous
estimation using the data from both groups yields more precise results than
estimation of the parameters separately in the two groups. Using the BLUE from
simultaneous estimation, we then construct an efficient linear estimator for
finite sample size by minimizing the mean squared error between the optimal
solution in the continuous time model and its discrete approximation with
respect to the weights (of the linear estimator). Finally, the optimal design
points are determined by minimizing the maximal width of a simultaneous
confidence band for the difference of the two regression functions. The
advantages of the new approach are illustrated by means of a simulation study,
where it is shown that the use of the optimal designs yields substantially
narrower confidence bands than the application of uniform designs.

major barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity
operations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an
effective system for model development that streamlines data curation,
training, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images
of a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This
paper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically
for on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges.
The core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a

process. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset,
to generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses

observed in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based
framework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common
functionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all
projects while giving complete independence to project-specific code.
Time-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation
and model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to
any scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and
models from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas

rateless codes), for private distributed matrix-matrix multiplication. A master
server owns two private matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ and hires worker
nodes to help computing their multiplication. The matrices should remain
information-theoretically private from the workers. Codes with fixed rate
require the master to assign tasks to the workers and then wait for a
predetermined number of workers to finish their assigned tasks. The size of the
tasks, hence the rate of the scheme, depends on the number of workers that the
master waits for. We design a rateless private matrix-matrix multiplication
scheme, called RPM3. In contrast to fixed-rate schemes, our scheme fixes the
size of the tasks and allows the master to send multiple tasks to the workers.
The master keeps sending tasks and receiving results until it can decode the
multiplication; rendering the scheme flexible and adaptive to heterogeneous
environments. Despite resulting in a smaller rate than known straggler-tolerant
schemes, RPM3 provides a smaller mean waiting time of the master by leveraging
the heterogeneity of the workers. The waiting time is studied under two
different models for the workers' service time. We provide upper bounds for the
mean waiting time under both models. In addition, we provide lower bounds on
the mean waiting time under the worker-dependent fixed service time model.

is represented by a neural network, trained using wave packets that are
parameterized by their band width and wave numbers. The accuracy is tested for
both the second-order wave equation and the Schrodinger equation, including the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We examine the accuracy from both
interpolations and extrapolations. For initial conditions lying in the training
set, the learned map has good interpolation accuracy, due to the approximation
property of deep neural networks. The learned map also exhibits some good
extrapolation accuracy. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
problems in irregular domains. Overall, the proposed method provides an
interesting alternative for finite-time simulation of wave propagation.

radiative-transfer code ${\rm \small TARDIS}$ to recreate five spectra of the
prototypical SN 1999em at different times within the plateau phase of the light
curve. The microlensing-induced deformations of the spectra and light curves
are calculated by placing the SN into magnification maps generated with the
code ${\rm \small GERLUMPH}$. We study the impact of microlensing on the color
curves and find that there is no strong influence on them during the
investigated time interval of the plateau phase. The color curves are only
weakly affected by microlensing due to the almost achromatic behavior of the
intensity profiles. However, the lack of non-linear structure in the color
curves makes time-delay measurements difficult given the possible presence of
differential dust extinction. Therefore, we further investigate SN phase
inference through spectral absorption lines under the influence of microlensing
and Gaussian noise. As the spectral features shift to longer wavelengths with
progressing time after explosion, the measured wavelength of a specific
absorption line provides information on the epoch of the SN. The comparison
between retrieved epochs of two observed lensing images then gives the time
delay of the images. We find that the phase retrieval method using spectral
features yields accurate delays with uncertainties $\small {\lesssim}$2 days,
making it a promising approach.

stick-slip type of behavior. We establish that there is a clear correlation
between the slider dynamics and the response of the force network that
spontaneously develop in the granular system. This correlation is established
by application of the persistence homology that allows for formulation of
objective measures for quantification of time-dependent force networks. We find
that correlation between the slider dynamics and the force network properties
is particularly strong in the dynamical regime characterized by well-defined
stick-slip type of dynamics.

so that the connectivity and the weights are chosen randomly. Optimization is
hardly considered as the parameter space is typically too large. Here we
investigate this problem for a class of reservoir computers for which we obtain
a decomposition of the reservoir dynamics into modes, which can be computed
independently of one another. Each mode depends on an eigenvalue of the network
adjacency matrix. We then take a parametric approach in which the eigenvalues
are parameters that can be appropriately designed and optimized. In addition,
we introduce the application of a time shift to each individual mode. We show
that manipulations of the individual modes, either in terms of the eigenvalues
or the time shifts, can lead to dramatic reductions in the training error.

mathematically model the structure of large-scale complex flexible engineering
systems. It does so by fusing concepts from network science and model-based
systems engineering (MBSE). For the former, it utilizes multiple graph-based
data structures to support a matrix-based quantitative analysis. For the
latter, HFGT inherits the heterogeneity of conceptual and ontological
constructs found in model-based systems engineering including system form,
system function, and system concept. These diverse conceptual constructs
indicate multi-dimensional rather than two-dimensional relationships. This
paper provides the first tensor-based treatment of hetero-functional graph
theory. In particular, it addresses the ``system concept"" and the
hetero-functional adjacency matrix from the perspective of tensors and
introduces the hetero-functional incidence tensor as a new data structure. The
tensor-based formulation described in this work makes a stronger tie between
HFGT and its ontological foundations in MBSE. Finally, the tensor-based
formulation facilitates several analytical results that provide an
understanding of the relationships between HFGT and multi-layer networks.

modularity and speed as keys to successful scale-up. On that basis four types
of scale-up are identified: Smart, dumb, forced, and fumbled. Smart scale-up
combines modularity and speed. Dumb scale-up is bespoke and slow, and very
common. The paper presents examples of each type of scale-up, explaining why
they were successful or not. Whether you are a small startup or Elon Musk
trying to grow Tesla and SpaceX or Jeff Bezos scaling up Amazon - or you are
the US, UK, Chinese, or other government trying to increase power production,
expand your infrastructure, or make your health, education, and social services
work better - modularity and speed are the answer to effective delivery, or so
the paper argues. How well you deal with modularity and speed decides whether
your efforts succeed or fail. Most ventures, existing or planned, are neither
fully smart nor fully dumb, but have elements of both. Successful organizations
work to tip the balance towards smart by (a) introducing elements of smart
scale-up into existing ventures and (b) starting new, fully smart-scaled
ventures, to make themselves less dumb and ever smarter.

interest. Compared with the well-studied machine reading comprehension (MRC),
SQA is a more challenging task: a scenario may contain not only a textual
passage to read but also structured data like tables, i.e., tabular scenario
based question answering (TSQA). AI applications of TSQA such as answering
multiple-choice questions in high-school exams require synthesizing data in
multiple cells and combining tables with texts and domain knowledge to infer
answers. To support the study of this task, we construct GeoTSQA. This dataset
contains 1k real questions contextualized by tabular scenarios in the geography
domain. To solve the task, we extend state-of-the-art MRC methods with TTGen, a
novel table-to-text generator. It generates sentences from variously
synthesized tabular data and feeds the downstream MRC method with the most
useful sentences. Its sentence ranking model fuses the information in the
scenario, question, and domain knowledge. Our approach outperforms a variety of
strong baseline methods on GeoTSQA.

  Text","10 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Method: We develop CNN-based methods for automatic ICD coding based on
clinical text from intensive care unit (ICU) stays. We come up with the Shallow
and Wide Attention convolutional Mechanism (SWAM), which allows our model to
learn local and low-level features for each label. The key idea behind our
model design is to look for the presence of informative snippets in the
clinical text that correlated with each code, and we infer that there exists a
correspondence between ""informative snippet"" and convolution filter. Results:
We evaluate our approach on MIMIC-III, an open-access dataset of ICU medical
records. Our approach substantially outperforms previous results on top-50
medical code prediction on MIMIC-III dataset. We attribute this improvement to
SWAM, by which the wide architecture gives the model ability to more
extensively learn the unique features of different codes, and we prove it by
ablation experiment. Besides, we perform manual analysis of the performance
imbalance between different codes, and preliminary conclude the characteristics
that determine the difficulty of learning specific codes. Conclusions: We
present SWAM, an explainable CNN approach for multi-label document
classification, which employs a wide convolution layer to learn local and
low-level features for each label, yields strong improvements over previous
metrics on the ICD-9 code prediction task, while providing satisfactory
explanations for its internal mechanics.

are made in the cloud and edge respectively. We aim to guarantee the user
fairness in terms of video coding rate under statistical delay constraint and
edge caching capacity constraint. A hybrid human-artificial intelligence
approach is developed to improve the user hit rate for video caching.
Specifically, individual user interest is first characterized by merging
factorization machine (FM) model and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, where
both low-order and high-order features can be well learned simultaneously.
Thereafter, a social aware similarity model is constructed to transferred
individual user interest to group interest, based on which, videos can be
selected to cache. Furthermore, a double bisection exploration scheme is
proposed to optimize wireless resource allocation and video coding rate. The
effectiveness of the proposed video caching scheme and video delivery scheme is
finally validated by extensive experiments with a real-world data set.
