fields. However, not much is known about the resulting GW amplitudes and their
dependence on the details of the generation mechanism. Here we treat magnetic
field generation through the chiral magnetic effect (CME) as a generic
mechanism and explore its dependence on the speed of generation (the product of
magnetic diffusivity and characteristic wavenumber) and the speed
characterizing the maximum magnetic field strength expected from the CME. When
the latter exceeds the former (regime I), the regime applicable to the early
universe, we obtain an inverse cascade with moderate GW energy that scales with
the third power of the magnetic energy. When the generation speed exceeds the
CME limit (regime II), the GW energy continues to increase without a
corresponding increase of magnetic energy. In the early kinematic phase, the GW
energy spectrum (per linear wavenumber interval) has opposite slopes in both
regimes and is characterized by an inertial range spectrum in regime I and a
white noise spectrum in regime II. The occurrence of these two slopes is shown
to be a generic consequence of a nearly monochromatic exponential growth of the
magnetic field. The resulting GW energy is found to be proportional to the
fifth power of the limiting CME speed and the first power of the generation
speed.

address two major challenges: first, conversation context-aware search and
second, abstractive search-answers generation. To address the first challenge,
the conversation context is modeled with a query rewriting method that unfolds
the context of the conversation up to a specific moment to search for the
correct answers. These answers are then passed to a Transformer-based re-ranker
to further improve retrieval performance. The second challenge, is tackled with
recent Abstractive Transformer architectures to generate a digest of the top

K requires reliable projections of uncertainty as well as best estimates of
Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST). However, uncertainty bands on GMST
projections are often calculated heuristically and have several potential
shortcomings. In particular, the uncertainty bands shown in IPCC plume
projections of GMST are based on the distribution of GMST anomalies from
climate model runs and so are strongly determined by model characteristics with
little influence from observations of the real-world. Physically motivated
time-series approaches are proposed based on fitting energy balance models
(EBMs) to climate model outputs and observations in order to constrain future
projections. It is shown that EBMs fitted to one forcing scenario will not
produce reliable projections when different forcing scenarios are applied. The
errors in the EBM projections can be interpreted as arising due to a
discrepancy in the effective forcing felt by the model. A simple time-series
approach to correcting the projections is proposed based on learning the
evolution of the forcing discrepancy so that it can be projected into the
future. These approaches give reliable projections of GMST when tested in a
perfect model setting, and when applied to observations lead to well
constrained projections with lower mean warming and narrower projection bands
than previous estimates. Despite the reduced uncertainty, the lower warming
leads to a greatly reduced probability of exceeding the 2.0 K warming target.

One of the models has a spherical geometry, another one is the combination of
two wind flows whereas the third model is a Keplerian disk. The models can
reproduce the typical shape of the quasar Lyman-{\alpha} emission and different
ghostly configurations. We show that the DLA Hi column density can be recovered
precisely independently of the BLR model used. The size of the absorbing cloud

possible to disentangle the two using an independent estimate of the radius

region of the minimum. The k-nearest neighbors method is used to calculate the
optimal parameter values. The algorithm is used to estimate the physical
parameters of the contracting dense star-forming core of L1287. Maps in the
HCO+(1-0), H13CO+(1-0), HCN(1-0), and H13CN(1-0) lines, calculated within a 1D

for the physical parameters of the core, including the radial profiles of
density ($\propto r^{-1.7}$), turbulent velocity ($\propto r^{-0.4}$), and
contraction velocity ($\propto r^{-0.1}$). Confidence intervals are calculated

models and in general requires strong assumptions on the data generating
process (DGP). In a causally inspired perspective on OOD generalization, the
test data arise from a specific class of interventions on exogenous random
variables of the DGP, called anchors. Anchor regression models, introduced by
Rothenhaeusler et al. (2021), protect against distributional shifts in the test
data by employing causal regularization. However, so far anchor regression has
only been used with a squared-error loss which is inapplicable to common
responses such as censored continuous or ordinal data. Here, we propose a
distributional version of anchor regression which generalizes the method to
potentially censored responses with at least an ordered sample space. To this
end, we combine a flexible class of parametric transformation models for
distributional regression with an appropriate causal regularizer under a more
general notion of residuals. In an exemplary application and several simulation
scenarios we demonstrate the extent to which OOD generalization is possible.

optimised to simulate the merger of well-resolved stars that can be

stars. The gravity solver conserves angular momentum to machine precision,
thanks to a correction algorithm. This code uses HPX parallelization, allowing
the overlap of work and communication and leading to excellent scaling
properties, allowing for the computation of large problems in reasonable
wall-clock times. In this paper, we investigate the code performance and
precision by running benchmarking tests. These include simple problems, such as
the Sod shock tube, as well as sophisticated, full, white-dwarf binary
simulations. Results are compared to analytic solutions, when known, and to
other grid based codes such as FLASH. We also compute the interaction between
two white dwarfs from the early mass transfer through to the merger and compare
with past simulations of similar systems. We measure OCTO-TIGERs scaling

aspects of the data and include text captions that emphasize aspects of the
data. Through a crowdsourced study, we explore how readers gather takeaways
when considering charts and captions together. We first ask participants to
mark visually prominent regions in a set of line charts. We then generate text
captions based on the prominent features and ask participants to report their
takeaways after observing chart-caption pairs. We find that when both the chart
and caption describe a high-prominence feature, readers treat the doubly
emphasized high-prominence feature as the takeaway; when the caption describes
a low-prominence chart feature, readers rely on the chart and report a
higher-prominence feature as the takeaway. We also find that external
information that provides context, helps further convey the caption's message
to the reader. We use these findings to provide guidelines for authoring
effective chart-caption pairs.

is a trend towards the use of deep learning probabilistic forecasting methods.
However, the point at which the more complex deep learning methods should be
preferred over more simple approaches is not yet clear. Therefore, the current
article presents a simple comparison between a long short-term memory neural

also enables optimal energy efficiency in composable DCs. The paper also
studies logical disaggregation of traditional DC servers over an optical

disaggregation of server resources within each rack enables marginal fall in
the total DC power consumption (TDPC) due to improved resource demands

also conduct a study of the adoption of micro-service architecture in both

disproportionate utilization of DC resources persists. A combination of
disaggregation and micro-services achieved up to 23% reduction in the TDPC of

using an invertible contact model in the forward pass and a closed form
solution in the backward pass to improve the numerical resolution of contacts.
The performance of the proposed framework is validated (1) by comparing
implicit versus explicit DDP for the swing-up of a double pendulum, and (2) by
planning motions for two tasks using a single leg model making multi-body

thickness-dependent band gap with an oscillatory feature is revealed, which we

topological quantum phase transition beyond a film thickness of one monolayer,
with alternating QAH and axion insulating states for even and odd layers,
respectively. At an even-odd layer step, a localized gapped electronic state is
observed, in agreement with an axion insulator edge state that results from a

a Run-time adversarial weight Attack Detection and Accuracy Recovery scheme to
protect DNN weights against PBFA. We organize weights that are interspersed in
a layer into groups and employ a checksum-based algorithm on weights to derive
a 2-bit signature for each group. At run time, the 2-bit signature is computed
and compared with the securely stored golden signature to detect the bit-flip
attacks in a group. After successful detection, we zero out all the weights in
a group to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by malicious bit-flips. The
proposed scheme is embedded in the inference computation stage. For the
ResNet-18 ImageNet model, our method can detect 9.6 bit-flips out of 10 on

amplitude magnification is degenerate with a shift in the source intrinsic mass
and redshift. However, even in the geometric-optics limit, type II
strongly-lensed images cannot be fully matched by type I (or unlensed) waveform
templates, especially with large binary mass ratios and orbital inclination
angles. We propose to use this mismatch to distinguish individual type II
images. Using planned noise spectra of Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope and
LIGO Voyager, we show that a significant fraction of type II images can be
distinguished from unlensed sources, given sufficient SNR ($\sim 30$).
Incorporating models on GW source population and lens population, we predict
that the yearly detection rate of lensed GW sources with detectable type II
images is 172.2, 118.2 and 27.4 for CE, ET and LIGO Voyager, respectively.
Among these detectable events, 33.1%, 7.3% and 0.22% will be distinguishable

that such distinguishable events are likely to appear in the third-generation

binaries within the isolated binary formation channel. As a neutron star
inspirals within the envelope of a primary massive star, it accretes and spins
up. Because neutron stars are in the strong-gravity regime, they have a
substantial relativistic mass deficit, i.e., their gravitational mass is less
than their baryonic mass. This effect causes some fraction of the accreted
baryonic mass to convert into neutron star binding energy. The relativistic
mass deficit also depends on the nuclear equation of state, since more compact
neutron stars will have larger binding energies. We model the mass growth and
spin-up of neutron stars inspiraling within common-envelope environments and
quantify how different initial binary conditions and hadronic equations of
state affect the post-common-envelope neutron star's mass and spin. From these
models, we find that neutron star mass growth is suppressed by $\approx
15-30\%$. We also find that for a given amount of accreted baryonic mass, more
compact neutron stars will spin-up faster while gaining less gravitational
mass, and vice versa. This work demonstrates that a neutron star's strong
gravity and nuclear microphysics plays a role in neutron-star-common-envelope
evolution, in addition to the macroscopic astrophysics of the envelope. Strong
gravity and the nuclear equation of state may thus affect both the population
properties of neutron star binaries and the cosmic double neutron star merger
rate.

works, obtains images of a reference star for PSF subtraction, within minutes
of observing the target star. We aim to significantly gain in contrast over the
conventional angular differencing imaging (ADI) method, to search for a fifth

the HR 8799 system. We obtained a total of 4.5 hours of simultaneous integral
field spectroscopy (R~30, Y-H band with IFS) and dual-band imaging (K1 and
K2-band with IRDIS) of the HR 8799 system and a reference star. The reference
star was observed for ~1/3 of the total time, and should have dR~1 mag and
separated on sky by ~1-2 deg. The star hops were made every 6-10 minutes, with
only 1 minute gaps in on-sky integration per hop. We did not detect the
hypothetical fifth planet at the most plausible separations, 7.5 and 9.7 au,
down to mass limits of 3.6 MJup high signal-to-noise ratios. As noted in
previous works, the planet spectra are matched very closely by some red field
dwarfs. We also demonstrated that with star-hopping RDI, the contrast
improvement at 0.1'' separation can be up to 2 magnitudes. Since ADI, meridian
transit and the concomitant sky rotation are not needed, the time of
observation can be chosen from within a 2-3 times larger window. In general,
star-hopping can be used for stars fainter than R=4 magnitudes, since for these
a reference star of suitable brightness and separation is usually available.

For cloud densities $\gtrsim 0.5\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ a magnetised wind triggers
H$_2$ formation before cloud dispersal. Up to 3 per cent of the initial cloud

stronger for winds with perpendicular $B$-fields and intermediate density

galaxy of its luminosity. GALFA Dw3 and Dw4 contain HII regions with young star
clusters and an overall irregular morphology; they show evidence of ongoing
star formation through both ultraviolet and H$\alpha$ observations and are
therefore classified as dwarf irregulars (dIrrs). The star formation histories
of these two dwarfs show distinct differences: Dw3 shows signs of a recently
ceased episode of active star formation across the entire dwarf, while Dw4

regions. Compact HI sources offer a promising method for identifying isolated

composition of its outflowing material, but they have been hampered by the lack
of complete atomic data. Here, we demonstrate how inclusion of new atomic data
in synthetic spectra calculations can provide insights and constraints on the
production of the heaviest elements. We employ theoretical atomic data
(obtained using GRASP$^0$) for neutral, singly- and doubly-ionised platinum and
gold, to generate photospheric and simple nebular phase model spectra for
kilonova-like ejecta properties. We make predictions for the locations of
strong transitions, which could feasibly appear in the spectra of kilonovae
that are rich in these species. We identify low-lying electric quadrupole and
magnetic dipole transitions that may give rise to forbidden lines when the
ejecta becomes optically thin. The strongest lines lie beyond $8000\,\r{A}$,
motivating high quality near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of kilonova
candidates. We compare our model spectra to the observed spectra of AT2017gfo,
and conclude that no platinum or gold signatures are prominent in the ejecta.
From our nebular phase modelling, we place tentative upper limits on the
platinum and gold mass of $\lesssim$ a few $10^{-3}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$, and
$\lesssim 10^{-2}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This work demonstrates how
new atomic data of heavy elements can be included in radiative transfer

to reconstruct dynamics in a model-independent way. However, recent new
measurements of supernovae Ia and quasars have populated the Hubble diagram up
to high redshifts ($z \sim 7.5$) and the application of the traditional
cosmographic approach has become less straightforward due to the large
redshifts implied. Here we investigate this issue through an expansion of the
luminosity distance-redshift relation in terms of ""orthogonal"" logarithmic
polynomials. In particular we point out the advantages of a new procedure of
""orthogonalization"" and we show that such an expansion provides a very good fit
in the whole $z=0\div 7.5$ range to both real and mock data obtained assuming
various cosmological models. Moreover, despite of the fact that the
cosmographic series is tested well beyond its convergence radius, the
parameters obtained expanding the luminosity distance - redshift relation for
the $\Lambda$CDM model are broadly consistent with the results from a fit of
mock data obtained with the same cosmological model. This provides a method to
test the reliability of a cosmographic function to study cosmological models at
high redshifts and it demonstrates that the logarithmic polynomial series can
be used to test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model with the current
Hubble diagram of quasars and supernovae Ia. We confirm a strong tension (at
$>4\sigma$) between the concordance cosmological model and the Hubble diagram
at $z>1.5$. Such a tension is dominated by the contribution of quasars at $z>2$
and starts to be present also in the few supernovae Ia observed at $z>1$.

second-order boundaries of our system. Such chiral hinge modes coexist in a
wide range of parameters regimes with Fermi arc surface states connecting a
pair of Weyl points in a two-band model. We find numerically that these modes
still preserve their locality along the hinge and their chiral nature in the
presence of local defects and other parameter changes. We trace the robustness
of such chiral hinge modes to special band structure unique in a Floquet system
allowing all the eigenstates to be localized in quasi-one-dimensional regions
parallel to each other when open hinge boundaries are introduced. The
implementation of a model featuring both the second-order Floquet skin effect

underlying gravitational potential, and thus to the total (luminous and dark)
matter distribution. They are particularly useful for understanding the mass
and spatial distribution of dark matter (DM) in a galaxy. Globular clusters
(GCs) are an ideal tracer population in dynamical models, since they are bright
and can be found far out into the halo of galaxies. We aim to test how well
Jeans-Anisotropic-MGE (JAM) models using GCs (positions and line-of-sight
velocities) as tracers can constrain the mass and radial distribution of DM
halos. For this, we use the E-MOSAICS suite of 25 zoom-in simulations of L*
galaxies. We find that the DM halo properties are reasonably well recovered by
the JAM models. There is, however, a strong correlation between how well we
recover the mass and the radial distribution of the DM and the number of GCs in
the galaxy: the constraints get exponentially worse with fewer GCs, and at
least 150 GCs are needed in order to guarantee that the JAM model will perform
well. We find that while the data quality (uncertainty on the radial
velocities) can be important, the number of GCs is the dominant factor in terms
of the accuracy and precision of the measurements. This work shows promising
results for these models to be used in extragalactic systems with a sample of
more than 150 GCs.

suffer from instability, even when universal approximation properties guarantee

demonstrating basic well-conditioned problems in scientific computing where one
can prove the existence of NNs with great approximation qualities, however,
there does not exist any algorithm, even randomised, that can train (or
compute) such a NN. For any positive integers $K > 2$ and $L$, there are cases
where simultaneously: (a) no randomised training algorithm can compute a NN
correct to $K$ digits with probability greater than $1/2$, (b) there exists a

imply a classification theory describing conditions under which (stable) NNs

resolved emission-line ratios indicate that our systems reside off the star

diagram at low redshift. The dominant cause of the difference between line
ratios of low redshift galaxies and our sample is due to lower gas-phase
metallicities, which are 2-5$\times$ less compared to galaxies with AGN in the
nearby Universe. Using gas velocity dispersion as a proxy to stellar velocity
dispersion and dynamical mass measurement through inclined disk modeling we
find that the quasar host galaxies are under-massive relative to their central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, with all systems residing off the local
scaling ($M_{\bullet}-\sigma~$,$M_{\bullet}-M_{*}~$) relationship. These quasar
host galaxies require substantial growth, up to an order of magnitude in
stellar mass, to grow into present-day massive elliptical galaxies. Combining
these results with part I of our sample paper (Vayner et al. 2021) we find
evidence for winds capable of causing feedback before the AGN host galaxies

Gourgouliatos, Hollerbach and Igoshev recently suggested that peculiar emission
properties of central compact objects can be explained by tangled magnetic
field configurations formed in a stochastic dynamo during the proto-neutron
star stage. In this case the magnetic field consists of multiple small-scale
components with negligible contribution of global dipolar field. We study
numerically three-dimensional magneto-thermal evolution of tangled crustal
magnetic fields in neutron stars. We find that all configurations produce
complicated surface thermal patterns which consist of multiple small hot
regions located at significant separations from each other. The configurations
with initial magnetic energy of $2.5-10\times 10^{47}$ erg have temperatures of
hot regions that reach $\approx 0.2$ keV, to be compared with the bulk
temperature of $\approx 0.1$ keV in our simulations with no cooling. A factor
of two in temperature is also seen in observations of central compact objects.
The hot spots produce periodic modulations in light curve with typical
amplitudes of $\leq 9-11$ %. Therefore, the tangled magnetic field
configuration can explain thermal emission properties of some central compact
objects.

readout individual qubits and to enable fast classical data processing [1-3].
Integrating both subsystems at deep cryogenic temperatures [4], where
solid-state quantum processors operate best, may solve some major scaling
challenges, such as system size and input/output (I/O) data management [5].
Spin qubits in silicon quantum dots (QDs) could be monolithically integrated
with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics using
very-large-scale integration (VLSI) and thus leveraging over wide manufacturing
experience in the semiconductor industry [6]. However, experimental
demonstrations of integration using industrial CMOS at mK temperatures are
still in their infancy. Here we present a cryogenic integrated circuit (IC)
fabricated using industrial CMOS technology that hosts three key ingredients of
a silicon-based quantum processor: QD arrays (arranged here in a
non-interacting 3x3 configuration), digital electronics to minimize control
lines using row-column addressing and analog LC resonators for multiplexed
readout, all operating at 50 mK. With the microwave resonators (6-8 GHz range),
we show dispersive readout of the charge state of the QDs and perform combined
time- and frequency-domain multiplexing, enabling scalable readout while
reducing the overall chip footprint. This modular architecture probes the
limits towards the realization of a large-scale silicon quantum computer
integrating quantum and classical electronics using industrial CMOS technology.

in 116 GRBs with known redshifts observed by {\it Swift}~XRT. A time-resolved
spectral analysis is carried out and the significance of the blackbody is
assessed with respect to an absorbed power-law model. We report nine new
detections and confirm the previously reported blackbody in GRB~171205A.
Together with our previous results, there are a total of 19 GRBs with
significant blackbody emission in a sample of 199 GRBs observed by {\it Swift}
over 13 years. The detections include one short GRB and two low-luminosity
GRBs. We estimate fireball parameters from the blackbody components and note
that the blackbody luminosity is correlated with the temperature and inferred
Lorentz factor. There is a large spread in the properties of the blackbody
components and the light curves, which points to different origins for the
emission. In about a third of the GRBs, the blackbody is clearly associated
with late prompt emission from the jet. The rest of the sample includes cases
that are fully consistent with the expectations from a cocoon, as well cases
that may be explained by high-latitude emission or more energetic cocoons.
These results indicate that thermal emission is associated with all parts of
the jet.

with respect to an over-complete dictionary is one of the most flexible
settings in the field of compressed sensing with numerous applications. As in
the standard compressed sensing setting, it is possible that the signal can be
reconstructed efficiently from few, linear measurements, for example by the
so-called $\ell_1$-synthesis method.
  However, it has been less well-understood which measurement matrices provably
work for this setting. Whereas in the standard setting, it has been shown that
even certain heavy-tailed measurement matrices can be used in the same sample
complexity regime as Gaussian matrices, comparable results are only available
for the restrictive class of sub-Gaussian measurement vectors as far as the
recovery of dictionary-sparse signals via $\ell_1$-synthesis is concerned.
  In this work, we fill this gap and establish optimal guarantees for the
recovery of vectors that are (approximately) sparse with respect to a
dictionary via the $\ell_1$-synthesis method from linear, potentially noisy
measurements for a large class of random measurement matrices. In particular,
we show that random measurements that fulfill only a small-ball assumption and
a weak moment assumption, such as random vectors with i.i.d. Student-$t$
entries with a logarithmic number of degrees of freedom, lead to comparable
guarantees as (sub-)Gaussian measurements.
  As a technical tool, we show a bound on the expectation of the sum of squared
order statistics under very general assumptions, which might be of independent
interest.
  As a corollary of our results, we also obtain a slight improvement on the
weakest assumption on a measurement matrix with i.i.d. rows sufficient for
uniform recovery in standard compressed sensing, improving on results by
Lecu\'e and Mendelson and Dirksen, Lecu\'e and Rauhut.

distribution exists iff measurement operators ""on-state"" permute (permutability
is the commutativity of more than two operators). By ""on-state"" we mean
properties of operators that hold only on a subset of states in the Hilbert

property of partial on-state permutation implies full on-state permutation. We
disprove this conjecture with a counterexample where pairwise ""on-state""
commutativity does not imply on-state permutability, unlike in the case of
commutativity for all states in the Hilbert space.

  Structure","Accepted in AAAI 2021 main conference",,,,"cs.CE econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network games provide a natural machinery to compactly represent strategic
interactions among agents whose payoffs exhibit sparsity in their dependence on
the actions of others. Besides encoding interaction sparsity, however, real
networks often exhibit a multi-scale structure, in which agents can be grouped
into communities, those communities further grouped, and so on, and where
interactions among such groups may also exhibit sparsity. We present a general
model of multi-scale network games that encodes such multi-level structure. We
then develop several algorithmic approaches that leverage this multi-scale
structure, and derive sufficient conditions for convergence of these to a Nash
equilibrium. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches
enable orders of magnitude improvements in scalability when computing Nash
equilibria in such games. For example, we can solve previously intractable
instances involving up to 1 million agents in under 15 minutes.

  in Telework",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The COVID-19 outbreak has admittedly caused a major disruption worldwide. The
interruptions to production, transportation, and mobility have clearly had a
significant impact on the well-functioning of the global supply and demand
chain. But what happened to the companies developing digital services, such as
software. Were they interrupted as much or at all? And how has the enforced
Working-From-Home mode impacted their ability to continue to deliver software?
We hear that some managers are concerned that their engineers are not working
effectively from home, or even lack the motivation to work in general, that
teams lose touch and that managers do not notice when things go wrong. In this
article, we share our findings from monitoring the situation in an
international software company with engineers located in Sweden, USA, and the
UK. We analyzed different aspects of productivity, such as developer
satisfaction and well-being, activity, communication and collaboration,
efficiency and flow based on the archives of commit data, calendar invites, and
Slack communication, as well as the internal reports of WFH experiences and 18
interviews. We find that company engineers continue committing code and carry
out their daily duties without significant disruptions, while their routines
have gradually adjusted to the new norm with new emerging practices and various
changes to the old ones. In a way, our message is that there is no news, which
is good news. Yet, the experiences gained with the WFH of such scale have
already made significant changes in the software industry's future, work from
anywhere being an example of major importance.

  network for cognitive ability prediction",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Multi-modal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be
used to make predictions about individual behavioral and cognitive traits based
on brain connectivity networks. Methods: To take advantage of complementary
information from multi-modal fMRI, we propose an interpretable multi-modal
graph convolutional network (MGCN) model, incorporating the fMRI time series
and the functional connectivity (FC) between each pair of brain regions.
Specifically, our model learns a graph embedding from individual brain networks
derived from multi-modal data. A manifold-based regularization term is then
enforced to consider the relationships of subjects both within and between
modalities. Furthermore, we propose the gradient-weighted regression activation
mapping (Grad-RAM) and the edge mask learning to interpret the model, which is
used to identify significant cognition-related biomarkers. Results: We validate
our MGCN model on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort to predict
individual wide range achievement test (WRAT) score. Our model obtains superior
predictive performance over GCN with a single modality and other competing
approaches. The identified biomarkers are cross-validated from different
approaches. Conclusion and Significance: This paper develops a new
interpretable graph deep learning framework for cognitive ability prediction,
with the potential to overcome the limitations of several current data-fusion
models. The results demonstrate the power of MGCN in analyzing multi-modal fMRI
and discovering significant biomarkers for human brain studies.

to a mixing ratio of $10^{-5}$ at the same pressure, at the expense of H2S and

how the inclusion of sulfur can manifest in an atmosphere indirectly, by its

associate groups with the regions around the modes of the probability density
function underlying the data. This correspondence between clusters and dense
regions in the sample space is here exploited to discuss an extension of this
approach to the analysis of social networks. Such extension seems particularly
appealing: conceptually, the notion of high-density cluster fits well the one
of community in a network, regarded to as a collection of individuals with
dense local ties in its neighbourhood. The lack of a probabilistic notion of
density in networks is turned into a major strength of the proposed method,
where node-wise measures that quantify the role and position of actors may be
used to derive different community configurations. The approach allows for the
identification of a hierarchical structure of clusters, which may catch
different degrees of resolution of the clustering structure. This feature well
fits the nature of social networks, disentangling a different involvement of
individuals in social aggregations.

interpretation of ultrasound images, computational simulations can facilitate
the training of such skills in virtual reality. With ray-tracing based
simulations, realistic ultrasound images can be generated. However, due to
computational constraints for interactivity, image quality typically needs to
be compromised.
  Methods. We propose herein to bypass any rendering and simulation process at
interactive time, by conducting such simulations during a non-time-critical
offline stage and then learning image translation from cross-sectional model
slices to such simulated frames. We use a generative adversarial framework with
a dedicated generator architecture and input feeding scheme, which both
substantially improve image quality without increase in network parameters.
Integral attenuation maps derived from cross-sectional model slices,
texture-friendly strided convolutions, providing stochastic noise and input
maps to intermediate layers in order to preserve locality are all shown herein
to greatly facilitate such translation task.
  Results. Given several quality metrics, the proposed method with only tissue
maps as input is shown to provide comparable or superior results to a
state-of-the-art that uses additional images of low-quality ultrasound
renderings. An extensive ablation study shows the need and benefits from the
individual contributions utilized in this work, based on qualitative examples
and quantitative ultrasound similarity metrics. To that end, a local histogram
statistics based error metric is proposed and demonstrated for visualization of
local dissimilarities between ultrasound images.

it challenging to predict the rate of cognitive and functional decline for

trial designs and focus prevention strategies on the most at-risk patients.
METHOD: We built a prognostic model using baseline cognitive scores and
MRI-based features to determine which subjects with mild cognitive impairment
remained stable and which functionally declined (measured by a two-point
increase in CDR-SB) over 2 and 3-year follow-up periods, periods typical of the
length of clinical trials. RESULTS: Combining both sets of features yields 77%
accuracy (81% sensitivity and 75% specificity) to predict cognitive decline at
2 years (74% accuracy at 3 years with 75% sensitivity and 73% specificity).
Using this tool to select trial participants yields a 3.8-fold decrease in the
required sample size for a 2-year study (2.8-fold decrease for a 3-year study)
for a hypothesized 25% treatment effect to reduce cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: This cohort enrichment tool could accelerate treatment development
by increasing power in clinical trials.

ordinary differential equation models for tear film thinning were designed that
model evaporation, osmosis, and various types of flow. Eight tear film breakup
instances of five healthy subjects that were identified in fluorescence images
in previous work were fit with these five models. The fitting procedure used a
nonlinear least squares optimization that minimized the difference of the
computed theoretical fluorescent intensity from the models and the experimental
fluorescent intensity from the images. The optimization was conducted over the
evaporation rate and up to three flow rate parameters. The smallest norm of the
difference was determined to correspond to the model that best explained the
tear film dynamics. Results: All of the breakup instances were best fit by
models with time-dependent flow. Our optimal parameter values and thinning rate
and fluid flow profiles compare well with previous partial differential
equation model results in most instances. Conclusion: Our fitting procedure
suggests that the combination of the Marangoni effect and evaporation cause
most of the breakup instances. Comparison with results from previous work
suggests that the simplified models can capture the essential tear film
dynamics in most cases, thereby validating this procedure as one that could be

estimates rely crucially on the features of the spacetime with three
interacting impulsive gravitational waves, particularly that each wave is
highly localized and that the waves are transversal to each other. In the
second paper of the series, we will prove the wave estimates and complete the

mechanical systems can produce probability distributions that exhibit quantum
correlations which are difficult to capture using classical models. We show
theoretically that such quantum correlations provide a powerful resource for
generative modeling. In particular, we provide an unconditional proof of
separation in expressive power between a class of widely-used generative
models, known as Bayesian networks, and its minimal quantum extension. We show
that this expressivity advantage is associated with quantum nonlocality and
quantum contextuality. Furthermore, we numerically test this separation on

encountered less-ordered one as a controlled parameter is continuously varied,
is a recurring theme found in disparate physical systems, from condensed matter
to black holes. While diverse in its many incarnations and generally
unsuspected, the cause of reentrance at the microscopic level is often not
investigated thoroughly. Here, through detailed characterization and
theoretical modeling, we uncover the microscopic mechanism behind reentrance in
the strongly frustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnet Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. Taking
advantage of the recent advance in rare earth stannate single crystal
synthesis, we use heat capacity measurements to expose that Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$
exhibits multiple instances of reentrance in its magnetic field $B$ vs.
temperature $T$ phase diagram for magnetic fields along three cubic high
symmetry directions. Through classical Monte Carlo simulations, mean field
theory and classical linear spin-wave expansions, we argue that the origins of
the multiple occurrences of reentrance observed in Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ are linked
to soft modes. Depending on the field direction, these arise either from a
direct $T=0$ competition between the field-evolved ground states, or from a
field-induced enhancement of the competition with a distinct zero-field
antiferromagnetic phase. In both scenarios, the phase competition enhances
thermal fluctuations which entropically stabilize a specific ordered phase.
This results in an increased transition temperature for certain field values
and thus the reentrant behavior. Our work represents a detailed examination
into the mechanisms responsible for reentrance in a frustrated magnet and may
serve as a template for the interpretation of reentrant phenomena in other
physical systems.

nonparametric part which is a weight function to be estimated through

an appropriate choice between the parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric

model performance, is important for building better machine learning models.
Although previous studies have succeeded in estimating harmful instances under
supervised settings, they cannot be trivially extended to generative
adversarial networks (GANs). This is because previous approaches require that
(1) the absence of a training instance directly affects the loss value and that
(2) the change in the loss directly measures the harmfulness of the instance
for the performance of a model. In GAN training, however, neither of the
requirements is satisfied. This is because, (1) the generator's loss is not
directly affected by the training instances as they are not part of the
generator's training steps, and (2) the values of GAN's losses normally do not
capture the generative performance of a model. To this end, (1) we propose an
influence estimation method that uses the Jacobian of the gradient of the
generator's loss with respect to the discriminator's parameters (and vice
versa) to trace how the absence of an instance in the discriminator's training
affects the generator's parameters, and (2) we propose a novel evaluation
scheme, in which we assess harmfulness of each training instance on the basis
of how GAN evaluation metric (e.g., inception score) is expect to change due to
the removal of the instance. We experimentally verified that our influence
estimation method correctly inferred the changes in GAN evaluation metrics.
Further, we demonstrated that the removal of the identified harmful instances
effectively improved the model's generative performance with respect to various
GAN evaluation metrics.

the organic linkers and metal salts, however, their post-synthetic modification

post-synthetic MOF-to-MOF transformation of a non-luminescent MOF (Zn-based
OX-1) into a highly luminescent framework (Ag-based OX-2) by a simple immersion
of the former in a silver salt solution. The conversion mechanism exploits the
uncoordinated oxygen atoms of terephthalate linkers found in OX-1, instead of
the unsaturated metal sites commonly employed, making the reaction much faster.
The materials derived from the OX-1 to OX-2 transformation are highly
luminescent and exhibit a selective response to acetone, turning them into a
promising candidate for manufacturing fluorometric sensors for the diagnosis

component-separated maps combining ACT and $\it{Planck}$ data (ACT DR4). The
corresponding optical depths, $\bar{\tau}$, which depend on the baryon content
of the halos, are estimated using results from cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations assuming an AGN feedback radiative cooling model. We estimate the
mean mass of the halos in multiple luminosity bins, and compare the tSZ-based
$\bar{\tau}$ estimates to theoretical predictions of the baryon content for a
Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We do the same for $\bar{\tau}$ estimates
extracted from fits to pairwise baryon momentum measurements of the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) for the same data set obtained in a companion
paper. We find that the $\bar{\tau}$ estimates from the tSZ measurements in
this work and the kSZ measurements in the companion paper agree within
$1\sigma$ for two out of the three disjoint luminosity bins studied, while they
differ by 2-3$\sigma$ in the highest luminosity bin. The optical depth
estimates account for one third to all of the theoretically predicted baryon
content in the halos across luminosity bins. Potential systematic uncertainties
are discussed. The tSZ and kSZ measurements provide a step towards empirical
Compton-$\bar{y}$-$\bar{\tau}$ relationships to provide new tests of cluster

accuracy and model interpretability. However, the myopic and random search
components of current rule ensemble methods can compromise this goal: they
often need more rules than necessary to reach a certain accuracy level or can
even outright fail to accurately model a distribution that can actually be
described well with a few rules. Here, we present a novel approach aiming to
fit rule ensembles of maximal predictive power for a given ensemble size (and
thus model comprehensibility). In particular, we present an efficient
branch-and-bound algorithm that optimally solves the per-rule objective
function of the popular second-order gradient boosting framework. Our main
insight is that the boosting objective can be tightly bounded in linear time of
the number of covered data points. Along with an additional novel pruning
technique related to rule redundancy, this leads to a computationally feasible
approach for boosting optimal rules that, as we demonstrate on a wide range of

active subject of research in the past several decades in hydrology,
geosciences and petroleum engineering. The scale dependence of flow in porous
media is attributed to small- and large-scale heterogeneities, such as pore
size distribution, pore connectivity, long-range correlations, fractures and
faults orientations, and spatial and temporal variations. The main objective of
this study was to investigate how permeability (k) and formation factor (F)
vary with sample dimension at small scales by means of a combination of
pore-network modeling and percolation theory. For this purpose, the
permeability and formation factor were simulated in twelve three-dimensional
pore networks with different levels of pore-scale heterogeneities. Simulations
were carried out at five different network sizes, i.e., 1130, 2250, 3380, 4510
and 6770 microns. Four theoretical models were also developed based on
percolation theory to estimate the scale dependence of permeability and
formation factor from the pore-throat radius distribution. In addition, two
other theoretical scale-dependent permeability models were proposed to estimate
permeability at different scales from the pore-throat radius distribution and
formation factor. Comparing theoretical estimations with numerical simulations
showed that the proposed models estimate the scale dependence of permeability
and formation factor reasonably. The calculated relative error (RE) ranged
between -3.7 and 3.8% for the permeability and between 0.21 and 4.04% for the
formation factor in the studied pore-networks.

  Meta-Learning","Accepted to ISIT 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Meta-learning aims at optimizing the hyperparameters of a model class or
training algorithm from the observation of data from a number of related tasks.
Following the setting of Baxter [1], the tasks are assumed to belong to the
same task environment, which is defined by a distribution over the space of
tasks and by per-task data distributions. The statistical properties of the
task environment thus dictate the similarity of the tasks. The goal of the
meta-learner is to ensure that the hyperparameters obtain a small loss when
applied for training of a new task sampled from the task environment. The
difference between the resulting average loss, known as meta-population loss,
and the corresponding empirical loss measured on the available data from
related tasks, known as meta-generalization gap, is a measure of the
generalization capability of the meta-learner. In this paper, we present novel
information-theoretic bounds on the average absolute value of the
meta-generalization gap. Unlike prior work [2], our bounds explicitly capture
the impact of task relatedness, the number of tasks, and the number of data
samples per task on the meta-generalization gap. Task similarity is gauged via
the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences. We illustrate
the proposed bounds on the example of ridge regression with meta-learned bias.

(BSs) have been densely deployed in radio access networks (RANs) to increase
the network coverage and capacity. However, as the high density of BSs is
designed to accommodate peak traffic, it would consume an unnecessarily large
amount of energy if BSs are on during off-peak time. To save the energy
consumption of cellular networks, an effective way is to deactivate some idle
base stations that do not serve any traffic demand. In this paper, we develop a
traffic-aware dynamic BS sleep control framework, named DeepBSC, which presents
a novel data-driven learning approach to determine the BS active/sleep modes
while meeting lower energy consumption and satisfactory Quality of Service
(QoS) requirements. Specifically, the traffic demands are predicted by the
proposed GS-STN model, which leverages the geographical and semantic
spatial-temporal correlations of mobile traffic. With accurate mobile traffic
forecasting, the BS sleep control problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process
that is solved by Actor-Critic reinforcement learning methods. To reduce the
variance of cost estimation in the dynamic environment, we propose a benchmark
transformation method that provides robust performance indicator for policy
update. To expedite the training process, we adopt a Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) approach, together with an explorer network, which can
strengthen the exploration further. Extensive experiments with a real-world
dataset corroborate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the
existing methods.

the HST images. The CO emission lines are clearly detected and the
CO(5-4)/CO(2-1) flux ratio (R_52) is ~1, similar to that of the Milky Way.
Assuming a metallicity dependent CO-toH_2 conversion factor and a
CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) flux ratio of 2 (the Milky Way value), the molecular gas mass
and the gas mass fraction (f_gas = molecular gas mass / (molecular gas mass +
stellar mass)) are estimated to be ~1.5x10^11 M_Sun and ~0.55, respectively. We
find that R_52 peak coincides with the position of the UV clump and its value
is approximately two times higher than the galactic average. This result
implies high gas density and/or high temperature in the UV clump, which
qualitatively agrees with a numerical simulation of a clumpy galaxy. The
CO(2-1) distribution is well represented by a rotating disk model and its
half-light radius is ~2.3 kpc. Compared to the stellar distribution, the
molecular gas is more concentrated in the central region of the galaxy. We also
find that f_gas decreases from ~0.6 at the galactic center to ~0.2 at

as documented in the IERS Conventions refers to the time epoch when the signal
passes one of two stations of an interferometer baseline (selected arbitrarily
from the pair of stations and called the 'reference station', or 'station 1').
This model consists of the previous correlation procedure used before the year
2002. However, since 2002 a new correlation procedure that produces the VLBI
group delays referring to the time epoch of signal passage at the geocenter has
been used. A corresponding correction to the conventional VLBI model delay has
to be introduced. However, this correction has not been thoroughly presented in
peer reviewed journals, and different approaches are used at the correlators to
calculate the final group delays officially published in the IVS database. This
may cause an inconsistency up to 6 ps for ground-based VLBI experiments between
the group delay obtained by the correlator and the geometrical model delay from
the IERS Conventions used in data analysis software. Moreover, a miscalculation
of the signal arrival moment to the 'reference station' could result a larger
modelling error (up to 50 ps). The paper presents the justification of the
correction due to transition between two epochs elaborated from the Lorentz
transformation, and the approach to model the uncertainty of the calculation of
the signal arrival moment. The both changes are particularly essential for
upcoming broadband technology geodetic VLBI observations.

universal structures subject to white noise at vertices. We focus on the
network coherence $H_{\rm SO}$ characterized in terms of the
$\mathcal{H}_2$-norm of the vertex systems, which measures the mean deviation
of vertex states from their average value. We first study numerically the
coherence of some representative real-world networks. We find that their
coherence $H_{\rm SO}$ scales sublinearly with the vertex number $N$. We then
study analytically $H_{\rm SO}$ for a class of iteratively growing networks --
pseudofractal scale-free webs (PSFWs), and obtain an exact solution to $H_{\rm
SO}$, which also increases sublinearly in $N$, with an exponent much smaller
than 1. To explain the reasons for this sublinear behavior, we finally study
$H_{\rm SO}$ for Sierpin\'ski gaskets, for which $H_{\rm SO}$ grows
superlinearly in $N$, with a power exponent much larger than 1. Sierpin\'ski
gaskets have the same number of vertices and edges as the PSFWs, but do not
display the scale-free and small-world properties. We thus conclude that the
scale-free and small-world, and loopy topologies are jointly responsible for
the observed sublinear scaling of $H_{\rm SO}$.

variational autoencoder (BHiVAE), to get better-disentangled representation. It
is well known that information theory has an excellent explanatory meaning for

perspective of information theory. BHiVAE mainly comes from the information
bottleneck theory and information maximization principle. Our main idea is that
(1) Neurons block not only one neuron node is used to represent attribute,
which can contain enough information; (2) Create a hierarchical structure with
different attributes on different layers, so that we can segment the
information within each layer to ensure that the final representation is
disentangled. Furthermore, we present supervised and unsupervised BHiVAE,
respectively, where the difference is mainly reflected in the separation of
information between different blocks. In supervised BHiVAE, we utilize the
label information as the standard to separate blocks. In unsupervised BHiVAE,
without extra information, we use the Total Correlation (TC) measure to achieve
independence, and we design a new prior distribution of the latent space to
guide the representation learning. It also exhibits excellent disentanglement
results in experiments and superior classification accuracy in representation
learning.

for fixing the singular covariance matrix has been developed, so that the

the cellular basis of disease. To break this bottleneck and achieve a
biologically meaningful timescale, we propose a multiscale parareal algorithm
in which a continuum-based solver supervises a mesoscopic simulation in the
time-domain. Using an iterative prediction-correction strategy, the
parallel-in-time mesoscopic simulation supervised by its continuum-based
counterpart can converge fast. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
first verified in a time-dependent flow with a sinusoidal flowrate through a
Y-shaped bifurcation channel. Physical quantities of interest including
velocity, wall shear stress and flowrate are computed to compare against those
of reference solutions, showing a less than 1% relative error on flowrate in
the Newtonian flow and a less than 3\% relative error in the non-Newtonian
blood flow. The proposed method is then applied to a large-scale mesoscopic
simulation of microvessel blood flow in a zebrafish hindbrain for temporal
acceleration. The time-dependent blood flow from heartbeats in this realistic
vascular network of zebrafish hindbrain is simulated using dissipative particle
dynamics as the mesoscopic model, which is supervised by a one-dimensional
blood flow model (continuum-based model) in multiple temporal sub-domains. The
computational analysis shows that the resulting microvessel blood flow
converges to the reference solution after only two iterations. The proposed
method is suitable for long-time mesoscopic simulations with complex fluids and

popular and promising biometrics due to its high distinguishes ability,
security and non-invasive procedure. The main idea of traditional schemes is to
directly extract features from finger vein images or patterns and then compare
features to find the best match. However, the features extracted from images
contain much redundant data, while the features extracted from patterns are
greatly influenced by image segmentation methods. To tack these problems, this
paper proposes a new finger vein recognition by generating code. The proposed
method does not require an image segmentation algorithm, is simple to calculate
and has a small amount of data. Firstly, the finger vein images were divided
into blocks to calculate the mean value. Then the centrosymmetric coding is
performed by using the generated eigenmatrix. The obtained codewords are
concatenated as the feature codewords of the image. The similarity between vein
codes is measured by the ratio of minimum Hamming distance to codeword length.
Extensive experiments on two public finger vein databases verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that our method
outperforms the state-of-theart methods and has competitive potential in
performing the matching task.

educate the students such that they learn how to learn, and that they are

This paper analyzes the current state of practice in software engineering

industrial practice to understand if frameworks, methods and practices for
software and system development taught at HEIs reflect industrial practice. For
this, we conducted an online survey and collected information about 67 software

beneficial to put more emphasis on building learning sequences with other

robustly detect signals with unknown noise statistics in multiple-input

impulsive and not analyzable. Existing detection methods have mainly focused on
specific noise models, which are not robust enough with unknown noise
statistics. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel ML detection framework to
effectively recover the desired signal. Our framework is a fully probabilistic
one that can efficiently approximate the unknown noise distribution through a
normalizing flow. Importantly, this framework is driven by an unsupervised
learning approach, where only the noise samples are required. To reduce the

the usefulness of STTG. The STTG system consists of a closed circuit comprising
thermoelectric and magnetic materials which exhibit the Seebeck and anomalous
Hall effects, respectively. When a temperature gradient is applied to the
hybrid system, the Seebeck effect in the thermoelectric material layer
generates a longitudinal charge current in the closed circuit and the charge
current subsequently drives the anomalous Hall effect in the magnetic material
layer. The anomalous Hall voltage driven by the Seebeck effect has a similar
symmetry to the transverse thermoelectric conversion based on the anomalous
Nernst effect. We find that the thermoelectric properties of STTG can be much
better than those of the anomalous Nernst effect by increasing the Seebeck
coefficient and anomalous Hall angle of the thermoelectric and magnetic

formulate the electronic cooling performance in the STTG system, confirming the

prior tracking methods have merely focused on robust tracking in the

illumination adaptive and anti dark capability, namely ADTrack. ADTrack firstly
exploits image illuminance information to enable adaptability of the model to

extraction across imaging disciplines, allowing rapid conversion of the data
streams to spatial or spatiotemporal arrays of features of interest. However,
applications of deep learning in experimental domains are often limited by the
out-of-distribution drift between the experiments, where the network trained
for one set of imaging conditions becomes sub-optimal for different ones. This
limitation is particularly stringent in the quest to have an automated
experiment setting, where retraining or transfer learning becomes impractical
due to the need for human intervention and associated latencies. Here we
explore the reproducibility of deep learning for feature extraction in
atom-resolved electron microscopy and introduce workflows based on ensemble
learning and iterative training to greatly improve feature detection. This
approach both allows incorporating uncertainty quantification into the deep
learning analysis and also enables rapid automated experimental workflows where
retraining of the network to compensate for out-of-distribution drift due to
subtle change in imaging conditions is substituted for a human operator or
programmatic selection of networks from the ensemble. This methodology can be

However, its validity for biological matter, which often consists of very dense

of optimal allocation reflects a trade-off between the benefits conferred by
the opportunities in the current generation and the potential to elevate the
socioeconomic status of recipients, shaping the composition of future
generations in ways that can benefit further from the opportunities. We show
how optimal allocations in our model arise as solutions to continuous
optimization problems over multiple generations, and we find in general that
these optimal solutions can favor recipients of low socioeconomic status over
slightly higher-performing individuals of high socioeconomic status -- a form
of socioeconomic affirmative action that the society in our model discovers in
the pursuit of purely payoff-maximizing goals. We characterize how the
structure of the model can lead to either temporary or persistent affirmative
action, and we consider extensions of the model with more complex processes
modulating the movement between different levels of socioeconomic status.

attacks to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and is also important for rolling
out real-world RL agent under unpredictable sensing noise. With a fixed agent
policy, we demonstrate that an optimal adversary to perturb state observations
can be found, which is guaranteed to obtain the worst case agent reward. For
DRL settings, this leads to a novel empirical adversarial attack to RL agents
via a learned adversary that is much stronger than previous ones. To enhance
the robustness of an agent, we propose a framework of alternating training with
learned adversaries (ATLA), which trains an adversary online together with the
agent using policy gradient following the optimal adversarial attack framework.
Additionally, inspired by the analysis of state-adversarial Markov decision
process (SA-MDP), we show that past states and actions (history) can be useful
for learning a robust agent, and we empirically find a LSTM based policy can be
more robust under adversaries. Empirical evaluations on a few continuous

strong adversaries. Our code is available at

In-vitro and particle image velocimetry (PIV) have been used in this study to
assess the aerosol performance of a model carrier formulation delivered by DPI

with modification to their tangential inlets and addition of a grid, have been
explored. Similar aerosol performances were observed for all four device
models, with FPF larger than 50%, indicating desirable lung deposition. A high
swirling and recirculating jet-flow emerging from the mouthpiece of the DPI

both hardware and software mechanisms to reduce the compute and memory burden.
A widely adopted approach is to use mixed precision data types. However, it is
hard to leverage mixed precision without hardware support because of the
overhead of data casting. Hardware vendors offer tensorized instructions for
mixed-precision tensor operations, like Intel VNNI, Tensor Core, and ARM-DOT.
These instructions involve a computing idiom that reduces multiple low
precision elements into one high precision element. The lack of compilation
techniques for this makes it hard to utilize these instructions: Using
vendor-provided libraries for computationally-intensive kernels is inflexible
and prevents further optimizations, and manually writing hardware intrinsics is
error-prone and difficult for programmers. Some prior works address this
problem by creating compilers for each instruction. This requires excessive
effort when it comes to many tensorized instructions. In this work, we develop
a compiler framework to unify the compilation for these instructions -- a
unified semantics abstraction eases the integration of new instructions, and
reuses the analysis and transformations. Tensorized instructions from different
platforms can be compiled via UNIT with moderate effort for favorable
performance. Given a tensorized instruction and a tensor operation, UNIT
automatically detects the applicability, transforms the loop organization of
the operation,and rewrites the loop body to leverage the tensorized
instruction. According to our evaluation, UNIT can target various mainstream
hardware platforms. The generated end-to-end inference model achieves 1.3x
speedup over Intel oneDNN on an x86 CPU, 1.75x speedup over Nvidia cuDNN on an

of the knowledge base, due to absence of any prior information. Utility
maximization of Q-learning has been used to minimize ambiguities in the rough
approximations. The new set approximation method, thus developed here, is named
as Q-rough set. It is used for fire region segmentation from video frames. The
threat index of fire flame over the input video stream has been defined in sync
with the relative growth in the fire segments on the recent frames. All
theories and indices defined here have been experimentally validated with
different types of fire videos, through demonstrations and comparisons, as

to design micron-scale machines with minimal required control. However,
self-organization goes hand in hand with predetermined dynamics that are hardly
susceptible to environmental perturbations. Therefore utilizing this feature of
active systems requires harnessing and directing the macroscopic dynamics to
achieve specific functions; which in turn necessitates understanding the
underlying mechanisms of active forces. Here we devise an optical control
protocol to engineer the dynamics of active networks composed of microtubules
and light-activatable motor proteins. The protocol enables carving activated
networks of different shapes, and isolating them from the embedding solution.
Studying a large set of shapes, we observe that the active networks contract in
a shape-preserving manner that persists over the course of contraction. We
formulate a coarse-grained theory and demonstrate that self-similarity of
contraction is associated with viscous-like active stresses. These findings
help us program the dynamics of the network through manipulating the light
intensity in space and time, and maneuver the network into bending in specific
directions, as well as temporally alternating directions. Our work improves
understanding the active dynamics in contractile networks, and paves a new path

illumination is not uniformly distributed over whole image which brings model
mismatch and possibly results in color shift of the deep models using ASM.

sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, by offering multi-ten-GHz bandwidth. To
overcome the short transmission distance and huge propagation loss,
ultra-massive (UM) MIMO systems that employ sub-millimeter wavelength antennas
array are proposed to enable an enticingly high array gain. In the UM-MIMO
systems, hybrid beamforming stands out for its great potential in promisingly
high data rate and reduced power consumption. In this paper, challenges and
features of the THz hybrid beamforming design are investigated, in light of the
distinctive THz peculiarities. Specifically, we demonstrate that the spatial
degree-of-freedom (SDoF) is less than 5, which is caused by the extreme
sparsity of the THz channel. The blockage problem caused by the huge reflection
and scattering losses, as high as 15 dB or over, is studied. Moreover, we
analyze the challenges led by the array containing 1024 or more antennas,
including the requirement for intelligent subarray architecture, strict energy
efficiency, and propagation characterization based on spherical-wave
propagation mechanisms. Owning up to hundreds of GHz bandwidth, beam squint
effect could cause over 5~dB array gain loss, when the fractional bandwidth
exceeds 10%. Inspired by these facts, three novel THz-specific hybrid
beamforming architectures are presented, including widely-spaced
multi-subarray, dynamic array-of-subarrays, and true-time-delay-based
architectures. We also demonstrate the potential data rate, power consumption,
and array gain capabilities for THz communications. As a roadmap of THz hybrid
beamforming design, multiple open problems and potential research directions
are elaborated.

technique, has been receiving considerable attention in deep learning. The key
to its success is to transfer knowledge from a large teacher network to a small

consider only one type of knowledge learned from either instance features or
instance relations via a specific distillation strategy in teacher-student
learning. There are few works that explore the idea of transferring different
types of knowledge with different distillation strategies in a unified
framework. Moreover, the frequently used offline distillation suffers from a
limited learning capacity due to the fixed teacher-student architecture. In
this paper we propose a collaborative teacher-student learning via multiple
knowledge transfer (CTSL-MKT) that prompts both self-learning and collaborative
learning. It allows multiple students learn knowledge from both individual
instances and instance relations in a collaborative way. While learning from
themselves with self-distillation, they can also guide each other via online
distillation. The experiments and ablation studies on four image datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CTSL-MKT significantly outperforms the

speaker-tracing, which alleviates the difference in the number of speakers
between a buffer and a current chunk. We also examine buffer update strategies
to select important frames for tracing multiple speakers. Experiments on
CALLHOME and DIHARD II datasets show that the proposed method achieves
comparable performance to the offline EEND method with 1-second latency. The

observational data. This is challenging as outcomes of alternative decisions
are not observed and have to be estimated. Previous methods estimate outcomes
based on unconfoundedness but neglect any constraints that unconfoundedness
imposes on the outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization
framework for estimating average treatment effects that exploits
unconfoundedness. To this end, we formalize unconfoundedness as an
orthogonality constraint, which ensures that the outcomes are orthogonal to the
treatment assignment. This orthogonality constraint is then included in the
loss function via a regularization. Based on our regularization framework, we
develop deep orthogonal networks for unconfounded treatments (DONUT), which
learn outcomes that are orthogonal to the treatment assignment. Using a variety
of benchmark datasets for estimating average treatment effects, we demonstrate
that DONUT outperforms the state-of-the-art substantially.

the tropical martian atmosphere during the dusty season, as observed by the
Mars Climate Sounder. The inversions are linked to the occurrence of
large-scale regional dust storms, with their strengths largely correlated to
the strengths of the dust storms. Inversions strengthen between 2 am and 4 am,
with the bases of the inversions getting cooler, and the tops of the inversions
getting warmer. The inversions are strongest around Tharsis and Terra Sabaea,
which are higher-elevation regions, suggesting they are forming due to a
combination of topographically-excited tides and cloud radiative cooling.
However, inversions are also observed over the flat plains, and are likely
associated with stronger tides resulting from the increased dust abundance.
These results highlight an important interplay between the dust distribution,
water ice clouds and thermal tides.

most sensitive axion search experiments operate at millikelvin temperatures and
hence rely on instrumentation that carries signals from a system at cryogenic

factors affecting the parameter scanning speed of these detectors is the noise
added by the components in the signal detection chain. Since the first
amplifier in the chain limits the minimum noise, low-noise amplification is of
paramount importance. This paper reports on the operation of a flux-driven
Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) operating at around 2.3 GHz with added
noise approaching the quantum limit. The JPA was employed as a first stage
amplifier in an experimental setting similar to the ones used in haloscope
axion detectors. By operating the JPA at a gain of 19 dB and cascading it with
two cryogenic amplifiers operating at 4 K, noise temperatures as low as 120 mK

source code bases. It is supported by a number of existing tools that rely on
several features, and most notably file extensions, to determine file types. We
consider the problem of accurately detecting the type of files commonly found
in software code bases, based solely on textual file content. Doing so is
helpful to classify source code that lack file extensions (e.g., code snippets
posted on the Web or executable scripts), to avoid misclassifying source code
that has been recorded with wrong or uncommon file extensions, and also shed
some light on the intrinsic recognizability of source code files. We propose a
simple model that (a) use a language-agnostic word tokenizer for textual files,
(b) group tokens in 1-/2-grams, (c) build feature vectors based on N-gram
frequencies, and (d) use a simple fully connected neural network as classifier.
As training set we use textual files extracted from GitHub repositories with at
least 1000 stars, using existing file extensions as ground truth. Despite its
simplicity the proposed model reaches 85% in our experiments for a relatively
high number of recognized classes (more than 130 file types).

opacity at each layer of the model. This mean opacity is very often
interpolated in pre-computed tables due to the overwhelming time to compute it
from monochromatic cross sections. The main drawback to using tables is that
the opacities can be inconsistent with the actual local chemical composition,
for instance in the regions of the star where nucleosynthesis occurs. We
developed a strategy that allows very fast calculations of Rosseland opacities
from monochromatic cross sections. This method has been implemented in the
Toulouse-Geneva evolution code, which we used to compute evolutionary tracks
with models whose Rosseland opacities are fully consistent with the chemical
mix everywhere in the star. Our self-consistent models show very small
structural differences compared to models where the Rosseland opacity is
computed with a fixed metal mixture. The main-sequence evolutionary tracks are
almost the same for models of mass ranging from 2 to 8 solar masses. At a given
surface gravity the relative difference in age is lower than 2% and generally
below 1% between the two kinds of calculations, the self-consistent model being
younger most of the time. Unless such a precision in age is sought out, the use
of tabulated Rosseland opacities with a metal content defined globally is still
acceptable, at least in main-sequence stars where the chemical mix changes only
through nucleosynthesis.

\CII~$\lambda$6580 absorption feature, which disappeared in near-maximum-light
spectra but reemerged at phases from $t \sim +8.7$ d to $t \sim +11.7$ d after

prominent carbon feature, low velocity seen in carbon and oxygen, and large

frequency is studied in a region of space around the central object using a
perturbative approach. In this study, the central object is either a neutron

orbiting the neutron star or a white dwarf. Moreover, the companion object that
causes the tidal field can be a neutron star, white dwarf, a black hole, or a
main-sequence star. The tidal effect significantly affects the spacetime around
the host star, which affects the gyro precession frequency. The gyro's
precession frequency increases with the mass of the companion object and
decreases as the separation between the host star and the companion star
increases. The tidal effect also varies with the stiffness of the equation of

deterministic, however, switching of perpendicularly magnetized materials by
SOT requires a mechanism for in-plane symmetry breaking. Existing methods to do
so involve the application of an in-plane bias magnetic field, or incorporation
of in-plane structural asymmetry in the device, both of which can be difficult
to implement in practical applications. Here, we reported bias-field-free SOT
switching in a single perpendicular CoTb layer with an engineered vertical
composition gradient. The vertical structural inversion asymmetry induces
strong intrinsic SOTs and a gradient-driven Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(g-DMI), which breaks the in-plane symmetry during the switching process.
Micromagnetic simulations are in agreement with experimental results, and
elucidate the role of g-DMI in the deterministic switching. This

orientation. Finally, the complete output features are constructed by
concatenating the intrinsic and ghost features together. Extensive experiments
on several benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that both the non-compact
and lightweight SISR models embedded with the proposed method can achieve a
comparable performance to that of their baselines with a large reduction of
parameters, FLOPs and GPU inference latency. For instance, we reduce the
parameters by 46%, FLOPs by 46% and GPU inference latency by 42% of $\times2$

computation of the connected moment expansion has been reported to find the
ground and excited state energies. In particular, the Peeters-Devreese-Soldatov
(PDS) formulation is found variational and bearing the potential for further
combining with the existing variational quantum infrastructure. Here we find
that the PDS formulation can be considered as a new energy functional of which
the PDS energy gradient can be employed in a conventional variational quantum
solver. In comparison with the usual variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and
the original static PDS approach, this new variational quantum solver offers an
effective approach to navigate the dynamics to be free from getting trapped in
the local minima that refer to different states, and achieve high accuracy at
finding the ground state and its energy through the rotation of the trial wave
function of modest quality, thus improves the accuracy and efficiency of the
quantum simulation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed variational
quantum solver for toy models, H$_2$ molecule, and strongly correlated planar
H$_4$ system in some challenging situations. In all the case studies, the
proposed variational quantum approach outperforms the usual VQE and static PDS
calculations even at the lowest order. We also discuss the limitations of the
proposed approach and its preliminary execution for model Hamiltonian on the
NISQ device.

similarity by encouraging interaction between the feature channels within
same-category image pairs to capture the common discriminative features.
Considering that complementary information is also crucial for recognition, we
erase the prominent areas enhanced by the channel interaction to force the
network to focus on other discriminative regions. The proposed model has
achieved competitive results on three fine-grained visual classification

correlation with $L$, the slope parameter of symmetry energy. However, current
uncertainty of $J$ hinders the precise constraint on $L$. We investigate the
correlations between electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_D$ (or times
symmetry energy at saturation density $J$) in Sn isotopes and the slope
parameter of symmetry energy $L$ using the quasiparticle random-phase
approximation based on Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov. A strong and
model-independent linear correlation between $\alpha_D$ and $L$ is found in
neutron-rich Sn isotopes where pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) gives a
considerable contribution to $\alpha_D$, attributed to the pairing correlations
playing important roles through PDR. This newly discovered linear correlation
would help one to constrain $L$ and neutron-skin thickness $\Delta
R_\textnormal{np}$ stiffly if $\alpha_D$ is measured with high resolution in

dramatically between them. For some, like the 2.2~ms pulsar PSR J2241--5236, we
measure an implied jitter of just $\sim$ 4~ns/hr, while others like the 3.9~ms
PSR J0636--3044 are limited to $\sim$ 100 ns/hr. While it is well known that
jitter plays a central role to limiting the precision measurements of arrival
times for high signal-to-noise ratio observations, its role in the measurement
of dispersion measure (DM) has not been reported, particularly in broad-band
observations. Using the exceptional sensitivity of MeerKAT, we explored this on
the bright millisecond pulsar PSR J0437--4715 by exploring the DM of literally
every pulse. We found that the derived single pulse DMs vary by typically
0.0085 cm$^{-3}$ pc from the mean, and that the best DM estimate is limited by
the differential pulse jitter across the band. We postulate that all
millisecond pulsars will have their own limit on DM precision which can only be
overcome with longer integrations. Using high-time resolution filterbank data

synchronisation and loss of synchrony among the three key oscillators
controlling sleep-wake cycles: the circadian, homeostatic, and light
oscillators. Synchronisation of these rhythms promotes sleep and brain
clearance and is critical for human health. Conversely, their desynchrony is
linked to impaired performance and disease. We find that the default state of
the model corresponds to the endogenous homeostatic period that is far from ~24
h of the circadian and light-dark cycles. Combined action of light and
circadian oscillator on the homeostatic rhythm is required to achieve the
typical sleep-wake pattern of healthy people. Change of homeostatic clearance
is found to induce two types of desynchronisation: (i) fast clearance rates
desynchronise the homeostatic oscillator from the circadian, while the
circadian rhythm remains entrained to light, and (ii) slow clearance maintains
synchronisation between the homeostatic and circadian oscillators, but the
period is different from that of the light-dark cycle. Between these regimes,
all three rhythms are synchronised under the studied conditions. The system is
highly sensitive to external inputs to the neuronal populations of the
sleep-wake switch, which can lead to complete loss of sleep. The model shows
that loss of synchronisation can be caused by changes in the homeostatic
clearance rate or external input to the neuronal populations of the sleep-wake
switch. This has implications for understanding individual variability in
sleep-wake patterns and in mechanisms of sleep and circadian disorders.

deviations in changeable environments. Therefore, minimizing the adverse
effects of color deviation on the prediction is one of the main goals of vision
task. Current solutions focus on using generative models to augment training
data to enhance the invariance of input variation. However, such methods often
introduce new noise, which limits the gain from generated data. To this end,
this paper proposes a strategy eliminate deviation with deviation, which is
named Random Color Dropout (RCD). Our hypothesis is that if there are color
deviation between the query image and the gallery image, the retrieval results
of some examples will be better after ignoring the color information.
Specifically, this strategy balances the weights between color features and
color-independent features in the neural network by dropouting partial color
information in the training data, so as to overcome the effect of color
devitaion. The proposed RCD can be combined with various existing ReID models
without changing the learning strategy, and can be applied to other computer
vision fields, such as object detection. Experiments on several ReID baselines
and three common large-scale datasets such as Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17
have verified the effectiveness of this method. Experiments on Cross-domain
tests have shown that this strategy is significant eliminating the domain gap.
Furthermore, in order to understand the working mechanism of RCD, we analyzed
the effectiveness of this strategy from the perspective of classification,
which reveals that it may be better to utilize many instead of all of color
information in visual tasks with strong domain variations.

for clear detection of the disorder-induced phase transition between

the emergence of symmetry-forbidden even-order harmonics: these harmonics are
enabled by Anderson-type localization and arise for sufficiently strong

heterogeneous tabular data. But what approach should be used for graphs with
tabular node features? Previous GNN models have mostly focused on networks with
homogeneous sparse features and, as we show, are suboptimal in the
heterogeneous setting. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that
trains GBDT and GNN jointly to get the best of both worlds: the GBDT model
deals with heterogeneous features, while GNN accounts for the graph structure.
Our model benefits from end-to-end optimization by allowing new trees to fit
the gradient updates of GNN. With an extensive experimental comparison to the
leading GBDT and GNN models, we demonstrate a significant increase in
performance on a variety of graphs with tabular features. The code is

Ellipticals dominate at the high end of the mass range, and therefore there
must be a mechanism responsible for the quenching of star-forming galaxies.
This could either be due to the secular processes linked to the mass and star
formation of galaxies or to external processes linked to the surrounding
environment. In this paper, we analytically model the processes that govern
galaxy evolution and quantify their contribution. We have specifically studied
the effects of mass quenching, gas stripping, and mergers on galaxy quenching.
To achieve this, we first assumed a set of differential equations that describe
the processes that shape galaxy evolution. We then modelled the parameters of
these equations by maximising likelihood. These equations describe the
evolution of galaxies individually, but the parameters of the equations are
constrained by matching the extrapolated intermediate-redshift galaxies with
the low-redshift galaxy population. In this study, we modelled the processes
that change star formation and stellar mass in massive galaxies from the GAMA
survey between z~0.4 and the present. We identified and quantified the
contributions from mass quenching, gas stripping, and mergers to galaxy
quenching. The quenching timescale is on average 1.2 Gyr and a closer look
reveals support for the slow-then-rapid quenching scenario. The major merging
rate of galaxies is about once per 10~Gyr, while the rate of ram pressure
stripping is significantly higher. In galaxies with decreasing star formation,
we show that star formation is lost to fast quenching mechanisms such as ram
pressure stripping and is countered by mergers, at a rate of about 41%
Gyr$^{-1}$ and to mass quenching 49% Gyr$^{-1}$. (abridged)

to additional mathematical complexities that arise in its derivation and
implementation. Furthermore, in both models Prandtl neglects the kinematic
viscosity on the basis that it is much smaller in magnitude than the turbulent
viscosity. Recent work has shown that including the kinematic viscosity in the
original model has both mathematical and physical advantages. In the present
work, a novel derivation of the extended model is provided, and it is
demonstrated that similar advantages are again obtained when the kinematic
viscosity is included. Additionally, through the use of scaling techniques,
similarity mean velocity profiles of the extended model are derived, resulting
in a single nonlinear ordinary differential equation that is solved numerically
with a Hermite spectral method. The computed profiles for the normalised

level of risk, it remains challenging in these strategies to determine how to
properly control for this confounding. We therefore consider a causal inference
approach in this paper to account for customers' price sensitivity and to
deduce optimal, multi-period profit maximizing premium renewal offers. More
specifically, we extend the discrete treatment framework of Guelman and
Guill\'en (2014) by Extreme Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, and by multiple
imputation to better account for the uncertainty in the counterfactual
responses. We additionally introduce the continuous treatment framework with
XGBoost to the insurance literature to allow identification of the exact
optimal renewal offers and account for any competition in the market by
including competitor offers. The application of the two treatment frameworks to
a Dutch automobile insurance portfolio suggests that a policy's competitiveness
in the market is crucial for a customer's price sensitivity and that XGBoost is
more appropriate to describe this than the traditional logistic regression.
Moreover, an efficient frontier of both frameworks indicates that substantially
more profit can be gained on the portfolio than realized, also already with
less churn and in particular if we allow for continuous rate changes. A
multi-period renewal optimization confirms these findings and demonstrates that
the competitiveness enables temporal feedback of previous rate changes on

design paradigm in Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). A D\&O EA divides a variable
into partial variables and then optimize them respectively. A complicated
problem is thus divided into simple subtasks. For example, a variable of
portfolio problem can be divided into two partial variables, i.e. the selection
of assets and the allocation of capital. Thereby, we optimize these two partial
variables respectively. There is no formal discussion about how are the partial
variables iteratively optimized and why can it work for both single- and
multi-objective problems in D\&O. In this paper, this gap is filled. According
to the discussion, an elitist selection method for partial variables in
multiobjective problems is developed. Then this method is incorporated into the
Decomposition-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (D\&O-MOEA/D). With
the help of a mathematical programming optimizer, it is achieved on the
constrained multiobjective portfolio problems. In the empirical study,
D\&O-MOEA/D is implemented for 20 instances and recent Chinese stock markets.
The results show the superiority and versatility of D\&O-MOEA/D on large-scale
instances while the performance of it on small-scale problems is also not bad.
The former targets convergence towards the Pareto front and the latter helps
promote diversity among the non-dominated solutions during the search process.

quenching amplitude of the light variation. We have used high-resolution
spectra obtained with HARPS-N@TNG for HD 344787 and the more famous Polaris
DCEP, to infer their detailed chemical abundances. Results from the analysis of
new time-series photometry of HD 344787 obtained by the TESS satellite are also
reported. The double mode nature of HD344787 pulsation is confirmed by analysis
of the TESS light curve, although with rather tiny amplitudes of a few tens of
millimag. This is an indication that HD344787 is on the verge of quenching the
pulsation. Analysis of the HARPS-N@TNG spectra reveals an almost solar
abundance and no depletion of carbon and oxygen. Hence, the star appears to
have not gone through the first dredge-up. Similar results are obtained for
Polaris. Polaris and HD344787 are confirmed to be both most likely at their
first crossing of the instability strip (IS). The two stars are likely at the
opposite borders of the IS for first overtone DCEPs with metal abundance
Z=0.008. A comparison with other DCEPs which are also thought to be at their

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram might be due to differences in the properties of
the DCEP progenitors during the main sequence phase.

here we establish that a four orbital based minimal basis set is sufficient to
build the Slater-Koster tight-binding model (SK-TB), which is capable of
reproducing the bulk and surface electronic structure in the vicinity of the

comparing the model study and DFT band structure, the dominant electron

  Blind Audio Source Separation Using the Multichannel Wiener Filter","submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language
  Processing",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a computationally efficient approach to blind source
separation (BSS) of audio signals, applicable even when there are more sources
than microphones (i.e., the underdetermined case). When there are as many
sources as microphones (i.e., the determined case), BSS can be performed
computationally efficiently by independent component analysis (ICA).
Unfortunately, however, ICA is basically inapplicable to the underdetermined
case. Another BSS approach using the multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) is
applicable even to this case, and encompasses full-rank spatial covariance
analysis (FCA) and multichannel non-negative matrix factorization (MNMF).
However, these methods require massive numbers of matrix inversions to design
the MWF, and are thus computationally inefficient. To overcome this drawback,
we exploit the well-known property of diagonal matrices that matrix inversion
amounts to mere inversion of the diagonal elements and can thus be performed
computationally efficiently. This makes it possible to drastically reduce the
computational cost of the above matrix inversions based on a joint
diagonalization (JD) idea, leading to computationally efficient BSS.
Specifically, we restrict the N spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of all N
sources to a class of (exactly) jointly diagonalizable matrices. Based on this
approach, we present FastFCA, a computationally efficient extension of FCA. We
also present a unified framework for underdetermined and determined audio BSS,
which highlights a theoretical connection between FastFCA and other methods.
Moreover, we reveal that FastFCA can be regarded as a regularized version of
approximate joint diagonalization (AJD).

schemes are efficient but suffer from severe stability constraints, while
nonlinear systems of equations have to be solved in implicit schemes though
they are unconditionally stable. A better compromise between stability and
efficiency is the semi-implicit scheme, such as the Gauss-Seidel projection
method (GSPM) and the second-order backward differentiation formula scheme
(BDF2). At each marching step, GSPM solves several linear systems of equations
with constant coefficients and updates the stray field several times, while
BDF2 updates the stray field only once but solves a larger linear system of
equations with variable coefficients and a nonsymmetric structure. In this
work, we propose a new method, dubbed as GSPM-BDF2, by combing the advantages
of both GSPM and BDF2. Like GSPM, this method is first-order accurate in time
and second-order accurate in space, and is unconditionally stable with respect
to the damping parameter. However, GSPM-BDF2 updates the stray field only once
per time step, leading to an efficiency improvement of about $60\%$ than the
state-of-the-art GSPM for micromagnetic simulations. For Standard Problem \#4

frequently varying operating conditions. Traditional approaches generally
misidentify the normal dynamic deviations as faults and thus lead to high false
alarms. Besides, they generally consider single relatively steady operating
condition and suffer from the catastrophic forgetting issue when learning
successive operating conditions. In this paper, recursive cointegration
analysis (RCA) is first proposed to distinguish the real faults from normal
systems changes, where the model is updated once a new normal sample arrives
and can adapt to slow change of cointegration relationship. Based on the
long-term equilibrium information extracted by RCA, the remaining short-term
dynamic information is monitored by recursive principal component analysis
(RPCA). Thus a comprehensive monitoring framework is built. When the system
enters a new operating condition, the RCA-RPCA model is rebuilt to deal with
the new condition. Meanwhile, elastic weight consolidation (EWC) is employed to
settle the `catastrophic forgetting' issue inherent in RPCA, where significant
information of influential parameters is enhanced to avoid the abrupt
performance degradation for similar modes. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is illustrated by a practical industrial system.

investigate three potential explanations for the SO$_2$ and H$_2$O depletion:
(1) varying the below-cloud water vapor (H$_2$O), (2) varying the below-cloud
sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$), and (3) the incorporation of chemical reactions inside
the sulfuric acid cloud droplets. We find that increasing the below-cloud
H$_2$O to explain the SO$_2$ depletion results in a cloud top that is 20 km too
high, above-cloud O$_2$ three orders of magnitude greater than observational
upper limits and no SO above 80 km. The SO$_2$ depletion can be explained by
decreasing the below-cloud SO$_2$ to $20\,{\rm ppm}$. The depletion of SO$_2$
in the clouds can also be explained by the SO$_2$ dissolving into the clouds,
if the droplets contain hydroxide salts. These salts buffer the cloud pH. The
amount of salts sufficient to explain the SO$_2$ depletion entail a droplet pH
of $\sim 1$ at 50 km. Since sulfuric acid is constantly condensing out into the
cloud droplets, there must be a continuous and pervasive flux of salts of
$\approx 10^{-13} \, {\rm mol \, cm^{-2} \, s^{-1}}$ driving the cloud droplet
chemistry. An atmospheric probe can test both of these explanations by
measuring the pH of the cloud droplets and the concentrations of gas-phase
SO$_2$ below the clouds.

each of these provides a possible mechanism for a deviation of the value of the

The field-dependent potential that is characteristic of the rolling tachyon
also leads to variations of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, implying that
the model can be constrained both by standard cosmological probes and by
astrophysical measurements of $\alpha$. Our analysis, using the latest
available low-redshfit data and local constraints from atomic clock and weak

$\log_{10}{(1+w_0)_V}<-7.85$ and $\log_{10}{(1+w_0)_C}<-0.85$, respectively for

this challenge, we propose a fast short text stream clustering method (called

compute similarity between a text and a selected number of clusters while
assigning a text to a cluster. In this way, we not only reduce the running time

  Topology Optimization formulation",,,,,"math.OC cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The robust topology optimization formulation that introduces the eroded and
dilated versions of the design has gained increasing popularity in recent
years, mainly because of its ability to produce designs satisfying a minimum
length scale. Despite its success in various topology optimization fields, the
robust formulation presents some drawbacks. This paper addresses one in
particular, which concerns the imposition of the minimum length scale. In the
density framework, the minimum size of the solid and void phases must be
imposed implicitly through the parameters that define the density filter and
the smoothed Heaviside projection. Finding these parameters can be time
consuming and cumbersome, hindering a general code implementation of the robust
formulation. Motivated by this issue, in this article we provide analytical
expressions that explicitly relate the minimum length scale and the parameters
that define it. The expressions are validated on a density-based framework. To
facilitate the reproduction of results, MATLAB codes are provided.
  As a side finding, this paper shows that to obtain simultaneous control over
the minimum size of the solid and void phases, it is necessary to involve the 3
fields (eroded, intermediate and dilated) in the topology optimization problem.
Therefore, for the compliance minimization problem subject to a volume
restriction, the intermediate and dilated designs can be excluded from the
objective function, but the volume restriction has to be applied to the dilated
design in order to involve all 3 designs in the formulation.

phases and synthetic dimension, and propose to efficiently characterize
photonic topological phases via holographic quench dynamics. A pseudo spin
model is constructed with ring resonators in a synthetic lattice formed by
frequencies of light, and the quench dynamics is induced by initializing a
trivial state which evolves under a topological Hamiltonian. Our key prediction
is that the complete topological information of the Hamiltonian is extracted
from quench dynamics solely in the time domain, manifesting holographic
features of the dynamics. In particular, two fundamental time scales emerge in
the quench dynamics, with one mimicking the Bloch momenta of the topological
band and the other characterizing the residue time evolution of the state after
quench. For this a dynamical bulk-surface correspondence is obtained in time
dimension and characterizes the topology of the spin model. This work also
shows that the photonic synthetic frequency dimension provides an efficient and
powerful way to explore the topological non-equilibrium dynamics.

the notion of 4-coloring of graphs and signed graphs is captured, through

Motivated by reformulations of the $k$-coloring problem in this language, and

fit better to a two-parameter Weibull distribution than Gaussian or lognormal
distributions. Based upon the spatial variation of the two Weibull parameters,
scale and shape, more information may be gleaned from these data. How well the
GPR array is illuminating various parts of the ground, in depth and
cross-track, may be determined from the spatial variation of the Weibull scale
parameter, which may in turn be used to estimate an effective attenuation
coefficient in the soil. The transition in depth from clutter-limited to
noise-limited conditions (which is one possible definition of GPR penetration
depth) can be estimated from the spatial variation of the Weibull shape
parameter. Finally, the underlying clutter distributions also provide an
opportunity to standardize image intensities to determine when a statistically
significant deviation from background (clutter) has occurred, which is
convenient for buried threat detection algorithm development which needs to be
robust across multiple different arrays.

the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) collaboration. In the presence of
eccentricity, the model is similarly NR-faithful, $\lesssim 1\%$, all over the
28 public SXS NR datasets, with initial eccentricity up to $\simeq 0.2$ , mass
ratio up to $q=3$ and dimensionless spin magnitudes as large as $+0.7$. Higher

very costly because they must be recorded in a studio. This requirement
currently restricts the amount of training data for speech enhancement to less
than 1/1000 of that of speech recognition which does not need clean signals.
Increasing the amount of training data is important for improving the
performance, and hence the requirement of clean signals should be relaxed. In
this paper, we propose a training strategy that does not require clean signals.
The proposed method only utilizes noisy signals for training, which enables us
to use a variety of speech signals in the wild. Our experimental results showed
that the proposed method can achieve the performance similar to that of a DNN

located along the rope. This process was accompanied by a group of slowly
positively drifting bursts in the 0.8--2 GHz range. The frequency drift of
these bursts was 45 -- 100 MHz s$^{-1}$. One of the bursts had an S-like form.
During the brightening of the rope we observed an unique bright EUV structure
transverse to the rope axis. The structure was observed in a broad range of
temperatures and it moved along the rope with the velocity of about 240 km
s$^{-1}$. When the structure dissipated, we saw a plasma further following
twisted threads in the rope. The observed slowly positively drifting bursts
were interpreted considering particle beams and we show that one with the

al, Symmetry 10 518 (2018)], we adopt the operator-valued Wigner formulation of
quantum mechanics (wherein the density matrix depends on the points of the
Wigner phase space associated to the system) and derive a non-linear equation
of motion. Moreover, we introduce a model for a non-Hermitian quantum
single-molecule junction (nHQSMJ). In this model the leads are mapped to a
tunneling two-level system, which is in turn coupled to a harmonic mode (i.e.,
the molecule). A decay operator acting on the two-level system describes
phenomenologically probability losses. Finally, the temperature of the molecule
is controlled by means of a Nos\'e-Hoover chain thermostat. A numerical study
of the quantum dynamics of this toy model at different temperatures is
reported. We find that the combined action of probability losses and thermal
fluctuations assists quantum transport through the molecular junction. The
possibility that the formalism here presented can be extended to treat both
more quantum states (about 10) and many more classical modes or atomic
particles (about 10^3 - 10^5) is highlighted.

$1$s must be separated by at least $d$ $0$s. We derive upper and lower bounds
on the feedback capacity of this channel, for all $d\geq 1$, given by:
$\max\limits_{\delta \in [0,\frac{1}{d+1}]}R(\delta) \leq
C^{\text{fb}}_{(d\infty)}(\epsilon) \leq \max\limits_{\delta \in

\frac{h_b(\delta)}{d\delta + \frac{1}{1-\epsilon}}$, with $\epsilon\in [0,1]$

(see Sabag et al. (2016)), and, in addition, we demonstrate that for the case
when $d=2$, the feedback capacity is equal to the capacity with non-causal
knowledge of erasures, for $\epsilon \in [0,1-\frac{1}{2\log(3/2)}]$. For
$d>1$, our bounds differ from the non-causal capacities (which serve as upper
bounds on the feedback capacity) derived in Peled et al. (2019) in only the
domains of maximization. The approach in this paper follows Sabag et al.
(2017), by deriving single-letter bounds on the feedback capacity, based on

that the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$ that is used to derive the local

a tight approximation for the STP of the C-JT scheme. Next, we maximize the STP
in NC-JT and the approximation of STP in C-JT by optimizing the placement

Finally, numerical results show the optimized placement strategy achieves
significant gains in STP over several comparative baselines both in NC-JT and

mass ratio is consistent with that of the standard Raghavan distribution and
may show a decrease in high-q systems as the binary separation increases. The

matter candidate particle, the dark photon, on the final phases of the
evolution of a $15\,M_\odot$ star and resulting modifications of the
pre-supernova neutrino signal. For a substantial portion of the dark photon
parameter space the extra cooling speeds up Si burning, which results in a
reduced number of neutrinos emitted during the last day before core collapse.
This reduction can be described by a systematic acceleration of the relevant
timescales and the results can be estimated semi-analytically in good agreement
with the numerical simulations. Outside the semi-analytic regime we find more
complicated effects. In a narrow parameter range, low-mass dark photons lead to
an increase of the number of emitted neutrinos because of additional shell
burning episodes that delay core collapse. Furthermore, relatively strong
couplings produce a thermonuclear runaway during O burning, which could result
in a complete disruption of the star but requires more detailed simulations to
determine the outcome. Our results show that pre-supernova neutrino signals are
a potential probe of the dark photon parameter space.

designed for integrands that fall off rapidly at large distances, such as those
approximating bound electronic states. When applied to states in the electronic
continuum, however, Becke scheme exhibits slow convergence and it is highly
redundant. Here, we present a modified version of Becke scheme that is
applicable to functions of the electronic continuum, such as those involved in
molecular photoionization and electron-molecule scattering, and which ensures
convergence and efficiency comparable to those realized in the calculation of
bound states. In this modified scheme, the atomic weights already present in
Becke's partition are smoothly switched off within a range of few bond lengths
from their respective nuclei, and complemented by an asymptotically unitary
weight. The atomic integrals are evaluated on small spherical grids, centered
on each atom, with size commensurate to the support of the corresponding atomic
weight. The residual integral of the interstitial and long-range region is
evaluated with a central master grid. The accuracy of the method is
demonstrated by evaluating integrals involving integrands containing Gaussian
Type Orbitals and Yukawa potentials, on the atomic sites, as well as spherical
Bessel functions centered on the master grid. These functions are
representative of those encountered in realistic electron-scattering and

potentials of the $\Delta$(1232) baryon are studied and information regarding
their effective strength is obtained from a comparison to experimental pion
production data in heavy-ion collisions below 800 MeV/nucleon impact energy.
The best description is achieved for an isoscalar potential moderately more
attractive than the nucleon optical potential and a rather small isoscalar
relative effective mass m$^*_\Delta \approx$ 0.45. For the isovector component
only a constraint between the potential's strength at saturation and the
isovector effective mass difference can be extracted, which depends on
quantities such as the slope of the symmetry energy and the neutron-proton
effective mass difference. These results are incompatible with the usual
assumption, in transport models, that the $\Delta$(1232) and nucleon potentials
are equal. The density dependence of symmetry energy can be studied using the
high transverse momentum tail of pion multiplicity ratio spectra. Results are
however correlated with the value of neutron-proton effective mass difference.
This region of spectra is shown to be affected by uncertain model ingredients
such as the pion potential or in-medium correction to inelastic scattering
cross-sections at levels smaller than 10$\%$. Extraction of precise constraints
for the density dependence of symmetry energy above saturation will require
experimental data for pion production in heavy-ion collisions below 800

the computational graph of a neural network has to fit into the in-computation

this study, we introduce a class of network models that have a small memory

Cohen","Overfitting for Fun and Profit: Instance-Adaptive Data Compression","Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neural data compression has been shown to outperform classical methods in
terms of $RD$ performance, with results still improving rapidly. At a high
level, neural compression is based on an autoencoder that tries to reconstruct
the input instance from a (quantized) latent representation, coupled with a
prior that is used to losslessly compress these latents. Due to limitations on
model capacity and imperfect optimization and generalization, such models will
suboptimally compress test data in general. However, one of the great strengths
of learned compression is that if the test-time data distribution is known and
relatively low-entropy (e.g. a camera watching a static scene, a dash cam in an
autonomous car, etc.), the model can easily be finetuned or adapted to this
distribution, leading to improved $RD$ performance. In this paper we take this
concept to the extreme, adapting the full model to a single video, and sending
model updates (quantized and compressed using a parameter-space prior) along
with the latent representation. Unlike previous work, we finetune not only the
encoder/latents but the entire model, and - during finetuning - take into
account both the effect of model quantization and the additional costs incurred
by sending the model updates. We evaluate an image compression model on
I-frames (sampled at 2 fps) from videos of the Xiph dataset, and demonstrate
that full-model adaptation improves $RD$ performance by ~1 dB, with respect to
encoder-only finetuning.

homogeneous modal images of visible, grayscale and sketch, and further
strengthens the defense ability of the model. These methods fuse different
modalities of homogeneous images to enrich the input sample variety, the
variaty of samples will reduce the over-fitting of the ReID model to color
variations and make the adversarial space of the dataset that the attack method
can find difficult to align, thus the accuracy of model is improved, and the
attack effect is greatly reduced. The more modal homogeneous images are fused,
the stronger the defense capabilities is . The proposed method performs well on
multiple datasets, and successfully defends the attack of MS-SSIM proposed by

base and subgrade layers. To improve the sensitivity and better reflect the
influence of unbound layers a new set of improved models i.e., resilient
modulus (MR) and modulus of subgrade reaction (k-value) are adopted in this
study. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed to predict the
modified k-value based on finite element (FE) analysis. The training and
validation datasets in the ANN model consist of 27000 simulation cases with
different combinations of pavement layer thickness, layer modulus and slab-base
interface bond ratio. To examine the sensitivity of modified MR and k-values on
pavement response, eight pavement sections data are collected from the
Long-Term Pavement performance (LTPP) database and modeled by using the FE
software ISLAB2000. The computational results indicate that the modified MR
values have higher sensitivity to water content in base layer on critical
stress and deflection response of rigid pavements compared to the results using
the Pavement ME design model. It is also observed that the k-values using ANN
model has the capability of predicting critical pavement response at any
partially bonded conditions whereas the Pavement ME design model can only
calculate at two extreme bonding conditions (i.e., fully bonding and no
bonding).

used in the past thirty years to elegantly obtain exact integration formulas,
in both mathematics and physics. These integration formulas are proved within
the mathematical formalism of equivariant cohomology, a variant of standard
cohomology theory that incorporates the presence of a symmetry group acting on
the space at hand. A suitable infinite-dimensional generalization of this
formalism is applicable to a certain class of Quantum Field Theories (QFT)
endowed with supersymmetry. In this thesis we review the formalism of
equivariant localization and some of its applications in Quantum Mechanics (QM)
and QFT. We start from the mathematical description of equivariant cohomology
and related localization theorems of finite-dimensional integrals in the case
of an Abelian group action, and then we discuss their formal application to
infinite-dimensional path integrals in QFT. We summarize some examples from the
literature of computations of partition functions and expectation values of
supersymmetric operators in various dimensions. For 1-dimensional QFT, that is
QM, we review the application of the localization principle to the derivation
of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem applied to the Dirac operator on a twisted
spinor bundle. In 3 and 4 dimensions, we examine the computation of expectation
values of certain Wilson loops in supersymmetric gauge theories and their
relation to 0-dimensional theories described by ""matrix models"". Finally, we
review the formalism of non-Abelian localization applied to 2-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory and its application in the mapping between the standard

there is an approximately one-year observation gap of TWSAs between GRACE and

in the TWSA observations may introduce significant biases and uncertainties in
the hydrological model predictions and consequently mislead decision making. To
tackle this challenge, a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) driven by

Enhanced by integrating recent advances in deep learning, including the
attention mechanisms and the residual and dense connections, BCNN can
automatically and efficiently extract important features for TWSA predictions
from multi-source input data. The predicted TWSAs are compared to the
hydrological model outputs and three recent TWSA prediction products. The
comparison suggests the superior performance of BCNN in providing improved
predictions of TWSAs during the gap in particular in the relatively arid
regions. The BCNN's ability to identify the extreme dry and wet events during
the gap period is further discussed and comprehensively demonstrated by
comparing with the precipitation anomalies, drought index, ground/surface water

to maintain the TWSA data continuity and quantify the impacts of climate

estimate the carbon footprint of research activities in France. It operates at
the scale of research labs, i.e. laboratoires, which are the social structures
around which research is organized in France and the smallest decision making
entities in the French research system. The application allows French research
labs to compute their own carbon footprint along a standardized, open protocol.
The data collected in a rapidly growing network of labs will be used as part of
the Labos 1point5 project to estimate France's research carbon footprint. At
the time of submitting this manuscript, 89 research labs had engaged with GES

  Multiscale Recurrence Quantification Measure","19 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose lacunarity as a novel recurrence quantification measure and
illustrate its efficacy to detect dynamical regime transitions which are
exhibited by many complex real-world systems. We carry out a recurrence plot
based analysis for different paradigmatic systems and nonlinear empirical data
in order to demonstrate the ability of our method to detect dynamical
transitions ranging across different temporal scales. It succeeds to
distinguish states of varying dynamical complexity in the presence of noise and
non-stationarity, even when the time series is of short length. In contrast to
traditional recurrence quantifiers, no specification of minimal line lengths is
required and rather geometric features beyond linear structures in the
recurrence plot can be accounted for. This makes lacunarity more broadly
applicable as a recurrence quantification measure. Lacunarity is usually
interpreted as a measure of heterogeneity or translational invariance of an
arbitrary spatial pattern. In application to recurrence plots, it quantifies
the degree of heterogenity in the temporal recurrence patterns at all relevant
time scales. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed method when applied
to empirical data, namely time series of acoustic pressure fluctuations from a
turbulent combustor. Recurrence lacunarity captures both the rich variability
in dynamical complexity of acoustic pressure fluctuations and shifting time
scales encoded in the recurrence plots. Furthermore, it contributes to a better
distinction between stable operation and near blowout states of combustors.

requires accurate transient modeling, lower computation cost, and fewer

learning approach using black-box knowledge distillation for both accurate and
efficient transmission dynamics prediction in a practical manner. First, we
leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical
simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the
simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge.
Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query
efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model
accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved

Methods: CFD simulations are performed using the Ansys Fluent 2020R1 software

single wire earth return (SWER) networks. There is a steadily growing energy
demand from remote consumers, and the capacity of existing lines may become
inadequate soon. Furthermore, high impedance arcing faults (HIF) from SWER
lines can cause catastrophic bushfires such as the 2009 Black Saturday event.
As a solution, reliable remote electricity networks can be established through
breaking the existing systems down into microgrids, and existing SWER lines can
be utilised to interconnect those microgrids. The development of such reliable
networks with better energy demand management will rely on having an integrated
network-wide condition monitoring system. As the first contribution of this
thesis, a distributed online monitoring platform is developed that incorporates
power quality monitoring, real-time HIF identification and transient
classification in SWER network. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques
are developed to classify faults and transients. The proposed approach
demonstrates higher HIF detection accuracy (98.67%) and reduced detection
latency (115.2 ms). Secondly, a remote consumer load identification methodology
is developed to detect the load type from its transients. An edge
computing-based architecture is proposed to facilitate the high-frequency
analysis for load identification. The proposed approach is evaluated in
real-time, and it achieves an average accuracy of 98% in identifying different
loads. Finally, a deep neural network-based energy disaggregation framework is
developed to separate the load specific energy usage from an aggregated signal.
The proposed framework is evaluated using a real-world data set. It improves
the signal aggregate error by 44% and mean aggregate error by 19% in comparison
with the state-of-the-art techniques.
