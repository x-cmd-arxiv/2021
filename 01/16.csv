large-scale datasets. To manage such voluminous data, classical machine
learning and deep learning techniques have been employed to accelerate physics
discovery. Recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) have indicated the
potential of applying these techniques in HEP. However, there are only limited
results in QML applications currently available. In particular, the challenge
of processing sparse data, common in HEP datasets, has not been extensively
studied in QML models. This research provides a hybrid quantum-classical graph
convolutional network (QGCNN) for learning HEP data. The proposed framework
demonstrates an advantage over classical multilayer perceptron and
convolutional neural networks in the aspect of number of parameters. Moreover,
in terms of testing accuracy, the QGCNN shows comparable performance to a
quantum convolutional neural network on the same HEP dataset while requiring
less than $50\%$ of the parameters. Based on numerical simulation results,
studying the application of graph convolutional operations and other QML models
may prove promising in advancing HEP research and other scientific fields.

Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality using two spatially separated
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). To prepare the Bell-correlated state,
spin-changing collisions are used to first prepare a two-mode squeezed BEC.
This is then split into two BECs by controlling the spatial wavefunction, e.g.,
by modifying the trapping potential. Finally, spin-changing collisions are also
exploited locally, to compensate local squeezing terms. The correlators
appearing in the inequality are evaluated using three different approaches. In
the first approach, correlators are estimated using normalized expectation
values of number operators, in a similar way to evaluating continuous-variable
Bell inequalities. An improvement to this approach is developed using the
sign-binning of total spin measurements, which allows for the construction of
two-outcome measurements and violations of the CHSH inequality without
auxiliary assumptions. Finally, we show a third approach where maximal
violations of the CH inequality can be obtained by assigning zero values to
local vacua outcomes under a no-enhancement assumption. The effect of loss and
imperfect detection efficiency is investigated and the observed violations are
found to be robust to noise.

Centrality measures to identify important vertices belong to the most popular
analysis methods in graph mining. A measure that is gaining attention is forest
closeness centrality; it is closely related to electrical measures using
current flow but can also handle disconnected graphs. Recently, [Jin et al.,
ICDM'19] proposed an algorithm to approximate this measure probabilistically.
Their algorithm processes small inputs quickly, but does not scale well beyond
hundreds of thousands of vertices.
  In this paper, we first propose a different approximation algorithm; it is up
to two orders of magnitude faster and more accurate in practice. Our method
exploits the strong connection between uniform spanning trees and forest
distances by adapting and extending recent approximation algorithms for related
single-vertex problems. This results in a nearly-linear time algorithm with an
absolute probabilistic error guarantee. In addition, we are the first to
consider the problem of finding an optimal group of vertices w.r.t. forest
closeness. We prove that this latter problem is NP-hard; to approximate it, we
adapt a greedy algorithm by [Li et al., WWW'19], which is based on (partial)
matrix inversion. Moreover, our experiments show that on disconnected graphs,
group forest closeness outperforms existing centrality measures in the context
of semi-supervised vertex classification.

the sequential decision-making literature. In the face of a complex environment

trade-off between the information an agent must acquire to learn and the
sub-optimality of the resulting policy. While an agent designer has a
preference for how this trade-off is resolved, existing approaches further
require that the designer translate these preferences into a fixed learning
target for the agent. In this work, leveraging rate-distortion theory, we
automate this process such that the designer need only express their
preferences via a single hyperparameter and the agent is endowed with the
ability to compute its own learning targets that best achieve the desired
trade-off. We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret for an
agent that decides what to learn in this manner along with computational
experiments that illustrate the expressiveness of designer preferences and even

describes the large onsite repulsion U limit of the spin degrees of freedom of
the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with one electron per site in a

appealing targets for attackers. As a result, they started to become victims of

vulnerabilities before deploying them on the blockchain. However, most of these
tools solely focus on detecting vulnerabilities and not attacks, let alone
quantifying or tracing the number of stolen assets. In this paper, we present
Horus, a framework that empowers the automated detection and investigation of

Our investigation shows that the number of attacks did not necessarily decrease

Finally, we also demonstrate the practicality of our framework via an in-depth

been partly attributed to network effects too. We study the existence of
network effects in six cryptoassets from their inception to obtain a high-level

show that contrary to the usual implications of network effects, they do not
serve to concentrate the cryptoasset market, nor do they accord any one

alternatives for multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed multinomial logit (MMNL)
models. A sampling of alternatives reduces the computational challenge of
evaluating the denominator of the logit choice probability for large choice
sets by only using a smaller subset of sampled alternatives including the
chosen alternative. To correct for the resulting overestimation of the choice
probability, a correction factor has to be applied. McFadden (1978) proposes a
correction factor to the utility of each alternative which is based on the
probability of sampling the smaller subset of alternatives and that alternative
being chosen. McFadden's correction factor ensures consistency of parameter
estimates under a wide range of sampling protocols. A special sampling protocol
discussed by McFadden is uniform conditioning, which assigns the same sampling
probability and therefore the same correction factor to each alternative in the
sampled choice set. Since a constant is added to each alternative the
correction factor cancels out, but consistent estimates are still obtained.
Bayesian estimation is focused on describing the full posterior distributions
of the parameters of interest instead of the consistency of their point
estimates. We theoretically show that uniform conditioning is sufficient to
minimise the loss of information from a sampling of alternatives on the
parameters of interest over the full posterior distribution in Bayesian MNL
models. Minimum loss of information is, however, not guaranteed for other
sampling protocols. This result extends to Bayesian MMNL models estimated using
the principle of data augmentation. The application of uniform conditioning, a
more restrictive sampling protocol, is thus sufficient in a Bayesian estimation
context to achieve finite sample properties of MNL and MMNL parameter
estimates.

  Results show that adequacy greatly depends on the length of the reduced

imposes a positive bias on seasonal storage resulting in an overestimation of

how to design the guiding forces. For this reason, the challenge lies in
developing controllers to provide the optimal guiding forces for the tasks that

transfers the knowledge from the pretext task network to the downstream task

  survey",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Malware is being increasingly threatening and malware detectors based on
traditional signature-based analysis are no longer suitable for current malware
detection. Recently, the models based on machine learning (ML) are developed
for predicting unknown malware variants and saving human strength. However,
most of the existing ML models are black-box, which made their pre-diction
results undependable, and therefore need further interpretation in order to be
effectively deployed in the wild. This paper aims to examine and categorize the
existing researches on ML-based malware detector interpretability. We first
give a detailed comparison over the previous work on common ML model
inter-pretability in groups after introducing the principles, attributes,
evaluation indi-cators and taxonomy of common ML interpretability. Then we
investigate the interpretation methods towards malware detection, by addressing
the importance of interpreting malware detectors, challenges faced by this
field, solutions for migitating these challenges, and a new taxonomy for
classifying all the state-of-the-art malware detection interpretability work in
recent years. The highlight of our survey is providing a new taxonomy towards
malware detection interpreta-tion methods based on the common taxonomy
summarized by previous re-searches in the common field. In addition, we are the
first to evaluate the state-of-the-art approaches by interpretation method
attributes to generate the final score so as to give insight to quantifying the
interpretability. By concluding the results of the recent researches, we hope
our work can provide suggestions for researchers who are interested in the
interpretability on ML-based malware de-tection models.

the spectral density and also by converting the real-space spectrum of number
density or volume fraction fluctuations for windows of diameter $D$ to the

occur. This real-space hyperuniformity disorder length spectroscopy is
performed on various point patterns which are determined by the centroids of
the bubbles in the foam, by the points patterns around which the Voronoi cells

either unweighted or weighted by the area of the cells they occupy. The
unweighted bubble centroids have $h(D)$ that collapses for the different ages

$h_e=0.084 \sqrt{\left< a\right>}$ for the bubble centroids is the smallest

similar analysis is performed on the edges of the cells where the spectra of
$h(D)$ for the foam edges show $h(D) \sim D^{1-\epsilon}$ where $\epsilon=0.3$

marketing and advertising. Through ""word of mouth"" effects, information or
product adoption could spread from some influential individuals to millions of
users in social networks. Given a social network $G$ and a constant $k$, the
influence maximization problem seeks for $k$ nodes in $G$ that can influence
the largest number of nodes. This problem has found important applications, and
a large amount of works have been devoted to identifying the few most
influential users. But most of existing works only focus on the diffusion of a
single idea or product in social networks. However, in reality, one company may
produce multiple kinds of products and one user may also have multiple
adoptions.
  Given multiple kinds of different products with different activation costs
and profits, it is crucial for the company to distribute the limited budget
among multiple products in order to achieve profit maximization. Profit
Maximization with Multiple Adoptions (PM$^{2}$A) problem aims to seek for a
seed set within the budget to maximize the overall profit. In this paper, a
Randomized Modified Greedy (RMG) algorithm based on the Reverse Influence
Sampling (RIS) technique is presented for the PM$^{2}$A problem, which could
achieve a $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$-approximate solution with high probability.
Compared with the algorithm proposed in [16] that achieves a
$\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^{2})$-approximate solution, our algorithm provides a better
performance ratio which is also the best performance ratio of the PM$^{2}$A
problem. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world social networks are
conducted, and the results demonstrate that our RMG algorithm outperforms the
algorithm proposed in [16] and other heuristics in terms of profit
maximization, and could better allocate the budget.

query enumeration on sparse databases, that come with performance and accuracy
guarantees. We introduce a new model for approximate query enumeration on
classes of relational databases of bounded degree. We first prove that on
databases of bounded degree any local first-order definable query can be
enumerated approximately with constant delay after a constant time
preprocessing phase. We extend this, showing that on databases of bounded
tree-width and bounded degree, every query that is expressible in first-order
logic can be enumerated approximately with constant delay after a sublinear
(more precisely, polylogarithmic) time preprocessing phase.
  Durand and Grandjean (ACM Transactions on Computational Logic 2007) proved
that exact enumeration of first-order queries on databases of bounded degree
can be done with constant delay after a linear time preprocessing phase. Hence
we achieve a significant speed-up in the preprocessing phase. Since sublinear
running time does not allow reading the whole input database even once,
sacrificing some accuracy is inevitable for our speed-up. Nevertheless, our
enumeration algorithms come with guarantees: With high probability, (1) only
tuples are enumerated that are answers to the query or `close' to being answers
to the query, and (2) if the proportion of tuples that are answers to the query
is sufficiently large, then all answers will be enumerated. Here the notion of
`closeness' is a tuple edit distance in the input database. For local
first-order queries, only actual answers are enumerated, strengthening (1).
Moreover, both the `closeness' and the proportion required in (2) are
controllable.
  We combine methods from property testing of bounded degree graphs with logic
and query enumeration, which we believe can inspire further research.

combining multiple Gaussian kernels structurally enhanced in terms of scales

nuclei is of great interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics. In the
`southwest' region of $^{78}$Ni, the development of deformation might trigger a
major shift in our understanding of explosive nucleosynthesis. To this end, new
spectroscopic information on key close-lying nuclei is very valuable.
  Purpose: We intend to measure the isomeric and $\beta$ decay of $^{75}$Co,
with one-proton and two-neutron holes relative to $^{78}$Ni, to access new
nuclear structure information in $^{75}$Co and its $\beta$-decay daughters
$^{75}$Ni and $^{74}$Ni.
  Methods: The nucleus $^{75}$Co is produced in relativistic in-flight fission
reactions of $^{238}$U at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory in the RIKEN Nishina
Center. Its isomeric and $\beta$ decay are studied exploiting the BigRIPS and
EURICA setups.
  Results: We obtain partial $\beta$-decay spectra for $^{75}$Ni and $^{74}$Ni,
and report a new isomeric transition in $^{75}$Co. The energy
[$E_{\gamma}=1914(2)$ keV] and half-life [$t_{1/2}=13(6)$ $\mu$s] of the
delayed $\gamma$ ray lend support for the existence of a $J^{\pi}=(1/2^-)$
isomeric state at 1914(2) keV. A comparison with PFSDG-U shell-model
calculations provides a good account for the observed states in $^{75}$Ni, but
the first calculated $1/2^-$ level in $^{75}$Co, a prolate $K=1/2$ state, is
predicted about 1 MeV below the observed $(1/2^-)$ level.
  Conclusions: The spherical-like structure of the lowest-lying excited states
in $^{75}$Ni is proved. In the case of $^{75}$Co, the results suggest that the
dominance of the spherical configurations over the deformed ones might be
stronger than expected below $^{78}$Ni. Further experimental efforts to discern
the nature of the $J^{\pi}=(1/2^-)$ isomer are necessary.

generative models to solve optimization problems. Our Generator-Enhanced
Optimization (GEO) strategy is flexible to adopt any generative model, from
quantum to quantum-inspired or classical, such as Generative Adversarial
Networks, Variational Autoencoders, or Quantum Circuit Born Machines, to name a
few. Here, we focus on a quantum-inspired version of GEO relying on
tensor-network Born machines and referred to hereafter as TN-GEO. We present
two prominent strategies for using TN-GEO. The first uses data points
previously evaluated by any quantum or classical optimizer, and we show how
TN-GEO improves the performance of the classical solver as a standalone
strategy in hard-to-solve instances. The second strategy uses TN-GEO as a
standalone solver, i.e., when no previous observations are available. Here, we
show its superior performance when the goal is to find the best minimum given a
fixed budget for the number of function calls. This might be ideal in
situations where the cost function evaluation can be very expensive. To
illustrate our results, we run these benchmarks in the context of the portfolio
optimization problem by constructing instances from the S\&P 500 and several
other financial stock indexes. We also comprehensively compare state-of-the-art
algorithms in a generalized version of the portfolio optimization problem. The
results show that TN-GEO is among the best compared to these state-of-the-art
algorithms; a remarkable outcome given the solvers used in the comparison have
been fine-tuned for decades in this real-world industrial application. We see
this as an important step toward a practical advantage with quantum-inspired
models and, subsequently, with quantum generative models.

solutions of 10d type II supergravities, candidates for classical de Sitter
string backgrounds: surprisingly, all known examples are unstable with $\eta_V
< -1$. We aim at proving the existence of such a systematic tachyon, and
getting formally a bound on the value of $\eta_V$. To that end, we develop
three methods, giving us various sufficient conditions for having a tachyon
upon assumptions, in analogy with de Sitter no-go theorems. Our analysis
eventually indicates the existence of variety of different tachyons, and
related bounds on $\eta_V$. We use this knowledge to find 10 new de Sitter
solutions of type IIB supergravity, that have tachyons of a different kind,
higher $\eta_V$ values and new 6d geometries. One solution even appears to be
stable, with however non-compact extra dimensions.

some stars are actually represented in misleading colors. We use pre-computed
PHOENIX and TLUSTY stellar model spectra and convolve them with the three
standard color matching functions for human color perception between 360$\,$nm

receptors in the eye that respond to red, green, and blue light. For a grid of
main sequence stars with effective temperatures between 2300$\,$K and
55,000$\,$K of different metallicities we present the red-blue-green and
hexadecimal color codes that can be used for digitized color representations of

the same effective temperature. We illustrate the main sequence in the color

these two topological phases in a tri-layer heterostructure consisting of a
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) TI thin film sandwiched between two
antiferromagnetic MnTe layers. We find that an orthogonal exchange field from
the MnTe layers, stabilized by a small anisotropy barrier, opens an energy gap
of the order of 10 meV at the Dirac point of the TI film. A topological
analysis demonstrates that, depending on the relative orientation of the
exchange field at the two interfaces, the total Chern number of the system is
either ${\cal C} = 1$ or ${\cal C} = 0$, characteristic of the CI and the AI
phase, respectively. Non-topological surface states inside the energy-gap
region, caused by the interface potential, complicate this identification.
Remarkably though, the calculation of the anomalous Hall conductivity shows
that such non-topological surface states do not affect the topology-induced
transport properties. Given the size of the exchange gap, we estimate that
gapless chiral edge states, leading to the quantum anomalous Hall effect,
should emerge on the sidewalls of these heterostructures in the CI phase for
widths $\ge 200$ nm. We also discuss the possibility of inducing transitions
between the CI and the AI phases by means of the spin-orbit torque caused by
the spin Hall effect in an adjacent conducting layer.

red stars is significant at negative longitudes. We also confirm that the bluer

spectroscopy ($\Delta$[Fe/H] $\sim$ 0.45 dex). Therefore, our results support a
scenario whereby the MW bulge is composed of a spheroid of metal-poor stars and

a bow shock trailed by a bullet-like core. In some cases, such as in the

and pronounced shoulders. We point out that these features, while difficult to
explain without dark matter (DM), naturally arise as the head of the
slowed-down gas is gravitationally pulled forward toward its unhindered DM
counterpart. X-ray imaging thus provides a unique, robust probe of the offset,
collisionless DM, even without gravitational lensing or other auxiliary data.
Numerical simulations and a toy model suggest that the effect is common in

molecular gas reservoir of $1.3\times10^{11} M_\odot$. We characterize its CGM
with two background QSOs at impact parameters of 93 kpc and 176 kpc. We detect
strong HI and metal-line absorption near the redshift of the SMG towards both
QSOs, each consisting of three main subsystems spanning over 1500 km/s. The
absorbers show remarkable kinematic and metallicity coherence across a
separation of 86 kpc. In particular, the cool gas in the CGM of the SMG
exhibits high HI column densities ($\log N_{\rm HI}/{\rm cm}^{-2} = 20.2,
18.6$), low metallicities ([M/H] $\approx$ -2.0), and similar radial velocities
($\approx$ -300 km/s). While the HI column densities match previous results on
the CGM around QSOs at z > 2, the metallicities are lower by more than an order
of magnitude, making it an outlier in the line width$-$metallicity relation of
damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers. The large physical extent, the velocity coherence,
the high surface density, and the low metallicity are all consistent with the
cool, inflowing, and near-pristine gas streams predicted to penetrate hot

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions with extended range and oscillatory
dependence on the distance between the spins. These interactions are realized
in multiple competing channels shaped by the multitude of Weyl nodes in the
electron spectrum. Microscopic spins need to be spatially modulated with a
channel-dependent wavevector in order to take advantage of the interactions.
The DM vector is parallel to the displacement between the two interacting
spins, and requires the presence of Weyl electron Fermi surfaces. We also
derive the Weyl-induced chiral three-spin interaction in the presence of an
external magnetic field. This interaction has an extended range as well, and
acts upon the spatially modulated spins in various channels. Its tendency is to
produce a skyrmion lattice or a chiral spin liquid which exhibits topological
Hall effect. Ultimately, the theory developed here addresses magnetic dynamics

ubiquitous localised magnetic deflections in the inner heliosphere; these
structures, often called switchbacks, are particularly striking in solar wind
streams originating from coronal holes. We report the direct evidence for
magnetic reconnection occuring at the boundaries of three switchbacks crossed
by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of 45 to 48 solar radii of the Sun
during its first encounter. We analyse the magnetic field and plasma parameters
from the FIELDS and SWEAP instruments. The three structures analysed all show
typical signatures of magnetic reconnection. The ion velocity and magnetic
field are first correlated and then anti-correlated at the inbound and outbound
edges of the bifurcated current sheets with a central ion flow jet. Most of the
reconnection events have a strong guide field and moderate magnetic shear but
one current sheet shows indications of quasi anti-parallel reconnection in
conjunction with a magnetic field magnitude decrease by $90\%$. Given the
wealth of intense current sheets observed by PSP, reconnection at switchbacks
boundaries appears to be rare. However, as the switchback boundaries accomodate
currents one can conjecture that the geometry of these boundaries offers
favourable conditions for magnetic reconnection to occur. Such a mechanism
would thus contribute in reconfiguring the magnetic field of the switchbacks,
affecting the dynamics of the solar wind and eventually contributing to the
blending of the structures with the regular wind as they propagate away from
the Sun.

strategy to augment the fiber network capacity. It relies on modern fiber
designs that support the propagation of multiple spatial modes. One of these
fibers, the ring-core fiber (RCF), is able to propagate modes that carry
orbital angular momentum (OAM), and has been shown to enhance not only
classical, but also quantum communication systems. Typically, the RCF spatial
modes are used as orthogonal transmission channels for data streams that are
coupled into the fiber using different Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams. Here, we
study the optimal conditions to multiplex information into ring-core fibers in
this scheme. We determine which are the most relevant LG beams to be
considered, and how their coupling efficiency can be maximized by properly
adjusting the beam width with respect to the fiber parameters. Our results show
that the coupling efficiency depends upon the OAM value, and that this can
limit the achievable transmission rates. In this regard, we show that LG beams
are not the optimal choice to couple information into RCF. Rather, another
class of OAM-carrying beam, the perfect vortex beam, allows for nearly perfect
coupling efficiencies for all spatial modes supported by these fibers.

ranges of the debris disk have been studied extensively, less information is
known about the outer, fainter parts of the disk. Here we present an analysis
of archival FORS V-band imaging data from 2003-2004, which have previously not
been explored scientifically because the halo substructure of the bright
stellar point spread function is complex. Through a high-contrast scheme based
on angular differential imaging, with a forward-modelling approach to mitigate
self-subtraction, we produced the deepest imaging yet for the outer range of
the beta Pic disk, and extracted its morphological characteristics. A
brightness asymmetry between the two arms of the edge-on disk, which was
previously noted in the inner disk, is even more pronounced at larger angular
separations, reaching a factor ~10 around 1000 AU. Approaching 2000 AU, the
brighter arm is visible at a surface brightness of 27-28 mag/arcsec^2. Much
like for the brightness asymmetry, a tilt angle asymmetry exists between the
two arms that becomes increasingly extreme at large separations. The outer tilt
angle of 7.2 deg can only be explained if the outer disk is farther from an
edge-on inclination than the inner disk, or if its dust has a stronger
scattering anisotropy, or (most likely) both. The strong asymmetries imply the
presence of a highly eccentric kinematic disk component, which may have been
caused by a disruptive event thought to have taken place at a closer-in
location in the disk.

J-factors scale as the moments of the relative velocity distribution, and that

that if the dark matter density in the Milky Way can be robustly determined,
one can accurately predict the dark matter annihilation signal, without the

lives. They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social
networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation
problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is
now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can
better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as
a Markov decision process (MDP) and be solved by reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative
filtering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential,
dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user
engagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has
been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of
scalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has
emerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning
(DRL), which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with
large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement
learning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented. Our aim is to present
an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete

RLRSs can be generally classified into RL- and DRL-based methods. Then, we

boundary conditions at the membrane that are linear combinations of integral
operators, with time dependent kernels, which act on the functions and their
spatial derivatives define on both membrane surfaces. We show how boundary
conditions at the membrane change the temporal evolution of the first and
second moments of particle position distribution (the Green's function) which
is a solution to normal diffusion equation. As these moments define the kind of

a particle random walk model in which the subdiffusion effect is caused by
anomalously long stays of the particle in the membrane.

target features of the data distribution relies on a a second order remainder
being asymptotically negligible. In previous work we proposed a nonparametric
MLE termed Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) which parametrizes the relevant
functional of the data distribution in terms of a multivariate real valued
cadlag function that is assumed to have finite variation norm. We showed that
the HAL-MLE converges in Kullback-Leibler dissimilarity at a rate n-1/3 up till
logn factors. Therefore, by using HAL as initial density estimator in the TMLE,
the resulting HAL-TMLE is an asymptotically efficient estimator only assuming
that the relevant nuisance functions of the data density are cadlag and have
finite variation norm. However, in finite samples, the second order remainder
can dominate the sampling distribution so that inference based on asymptotic
normality would be anti-conservative.
  In this article we propose a new higher order TMLE, generalizing the regular
first order TMLE. We prove that it satisfies an exact linear expansion, in
terms of efficient influence functions of sequentially defined higher order
fluctuations of the target parameter, with a remainder that is a k+1th order
remainder. As a consequence, this k-th order TMLE allows statistical inference
only relying on the k+1th order remainder being negligible. We also provide a
rationale for the higher order TMLE that it will be superior to the first order
TMLE by (iteratively) locally minimizing the exact finite sample remainder of
the first order TMLE. The second order TMLE is demonstrated for nonparametric
estimation of the integrated squared density and for the treatment specific
mean outcome. We also provide an initial simulation study for the second order

variationally stable FE (AVS-FE) method of Calo, Romkes and Valseth, in which

to employ a fully conforming FE discretization for any elastic solid using

yields both continuous stresses and displacements.
  To ensure stability of the method, we employ the philosophy of the
discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan and
use optimal test spaces. Thus, the resulting FE discretization is stable even
as the Poisson ratio approaches 0.5, and the system of linear algebraic
equations is symmetric and positive definite. Our method also comes with a
built-in a posteriori error estimator as well as well as indicators which are
used to drive mesh adaptive refinements. We present several numerical

energy of 1.8 eV related to GaAs quantum well and GaP substrate. We observe
type-I emission from QDs with recombination times between 2 ns and 10 ns,
increasing towards lower energies. The distribution suggests the coexistence of

considerable tunability of the dots depending on Sb incorporation, we suggest
their utilization as quantum photonic sources embedded in complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platforms, since GaP is almost lattice-matched

the mean trajectories converge to either a point or a single trajectory;
alignment, where the mean trajectories juxtapose in parallel; twist, where the
mean trajectories twist and intertwine, forming a plait structure. Moreover, we

transit between them. And its Brownian behavior could be modified during such

virtual state that must be held in memory, such as variable/value pairs and a
call stack. In this work, we examine the influence of short-term working memory
(WM) on a person's ability to remember program state during tracing. We first
confirm that previous findings in cognitive psychology transfer to the
programming domain: people can keep about 7 variable/value pairs in WM, and
people will accidentally swap associations between variables due to WM load. We
use a restricted focus viewing interface to further analyze the strategies
people use to trace through programs, and the relationship of tracing strategy
to WM. Given a straight-line program, we find half of our participants traced a
program from the top-down line-by-line (linearly), and the other half start at
the bottom and trace upward based on data dependencies (on-demand).
Participants with an on-demand strategy made more WM errors while tracing
straight-line code than with a linear strategy, but the two strategies
contained an equal number of WM errors when tracing code with functions. We
conclude with the implications of these findings for the design of programming
tools: first, programs should be analyzed to identify and refactor
human-memory-intensive sections of code. Second, programming environments
should interactively visualize variable metadata to reduce WM load in
accordance with a person's tracing strategy. Third, tools for program
comprehension should enable externalizing program state while tracing.

and surface science because it is the path to finding ground state atomic
structures and reaction pathways. These properties are used in the estimation
of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecular and crystal structures.
This process is slow at the quantum level of theory because it involves an
iterative calculation of forces using quantum chemical codes such as density
functional theory (DFT), which are computationally expensive, and which limit
the speed of the optimization algorithms. It would be highly advantageous to
accelerate this process because then one could either do the same amount of
work in less time, or more work in the same time. In this work, we provide a
neural network (NN) ensemble based active learning method to accelerate the
local geometry optimization for multiple configurations simultaneously. We
illustrate the acceleration on several case studies including bare metal
surfaces, surfaces with adsorbates, and nudged elastic band (NEB) for two
reactions. In all cases the accelerated method requires fewer DFT calculations
than the standard method. In addition, we provide an ASE-optimizer Python
package to make the usage of the NN ensemble active learning for geometry
optimization easier.

country wide deployment, there will be almost 1.3 billion smart meters in place

provides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of
demand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing

better consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks
associated with fine grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy
of users. With this technology, customers' personal data such as sleeping

the hands of the utility companies and can be subject to misuse. This research
paper addresses privacy violation of consumers' energy usage data collected
from smart meters and provides a novel solution for the privacy protection

successful application of occupancy detection attacks using a deep neural

prevent leakage of consumers personal information. Our privacy-aware approach
protects consumers' privacy without compromising the correctness of billing and
preserves operational efficiency without use of authoritative intermediaries.

robustness of models against adversarial perturbations. However, the full
effect of this approach on models is not well understood. For example, while
adversarial training can reduce the adversarial risk (prediction error against
an adversary), it sometimes increase standard risk (generalization error when
there is no adversary). Even more, such behavior is impacted by various
elements of the learning problem, including the size and quality of training
data, specific forms of adversarial perturbations in the input, model
overparameterization, and adversary's power, among others. In this paper, we
focus on \emph{distribution perturbing} adversary framework wherein the
adversary can change the test distribution within a neighborhood of the
training data distribution. The neighborhood is defined via Wasserstein
distance between distributions and the radius of the neighborhood is a measure
of adversary's manipulative power. We study the tradeoff between standard risk
and adversarial risk and derive the Pareto-optimal tradeoff, achievable over
specific classes of models, in the infinite data limit with features dimension
kept fixed. We consider three learning settings: 1) Regression with the class
of linear models; 2) Binary classification under the Gaussian mixtures data
model, with the class of linear classifiers; 3) Regression with the class of
random features model (which can be equivalently represented as two-layer
neural network with random first-layer weights). We show that a tradeoff
between standard and adversarial risk is manifested in all three settings. We
further characterize the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curves and discuss how a
variety of factors, such as features correlation, adversary's power or the
width of two-layer neural network would affect this tradeoff.

While a quantitative, predictive theory of Radiative Alignment Torques (RAT)

to be fully constrained. In a recent paper, \citet{medan2019} showed that the
polarization efficiency (and therefore grain alignment efficiency) at different
locations in the wall of the Local Bubble (LB) could be modeled as proportional
to the integrated light intensity from the surrounding stars and OB

intensities by studying the extinction and polarization in the two reflection

approach that focuses on crowd dynamics and is robust to the particularities of
different crowdfunding platforms. We rely on a multi-method analysis to
investigate the correlates, predictive importance, and quasi-causal effects of
features that describe crowd dynamics in determining the success of crowdfunded
projects. By applying a multi-method analysis to a study of fundraising in
three different online markets, we uncover general crowd dynamics that
ultimately decide which projects will succeed. In all analyses and across the
three different platforms, we consistently find that funders' behavioural
signals (1) are significantly correlated with fundraising success; (2)
approximate fundraising outcomes better than the characteristics of projects
and their creators such as credit grade, company valuation, and subject domain;
and (3) have significant quasi-causal effects on fundraising outcomes while
controlling for potentially confounding project variables. By showing that
universal features deduced from crowd behaviour are predictive of fundraising
success on different crowdfunding platforms, our work provides design-relevant
insights about novel types of collective decision-making online. This research
inspires thus potential ways to leverage cues from the crowd and catalyses

for software analytics tasks. State-of-the-art techniques leverage modern deep
learning techniques such as LSTMs, yielding competitive performance, albeit at
the price of longer training times.
  Recently, Galke and Scherp [18] showed that at least for image recognition, a
decades-old feedforward neural network can match the performance of modern deep
learning techniques. This motivated us to try the same in the SE literature.
Specifically, in this paper, we apply feedforward networks with some
preprocessing to two analytics tasks: issue close time prediction, and
vulnerability detection. We test the hypothesis laid by Galke and Scherp [18],
that feedforward networks suffice for many analytics tasks (which we call, the
""Old but Gold"" hypothesis) for these two tasks. For three out of five datasets
from these tasks, we achieve new high-water mark results (that out-perform the
prior state-of-the-art results) and for a fourth data set, Old but Gold
performed as well as the recent state of the art. Furthermore, the old but gold
results were obtained orders of magnitude faster than prior work. For example,
for issue close time, old but gold found good predictors in 90 seconds (as
opposed to the newer methods, which took 6 hours to run).
  Our results supports the ""Old but Gold"" hypothesis and leads to the following
recommendation: try simpler alternatives before more complex methods. At the
very least, this will produce a baseline result against which researchers can
compare some other, supposedly more sophisticated, approach. And in the best
case, they will obtain useful results that are as good as anything else, in a
small fraction of the effort.

constructing a `astronomical' Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the Schwarzschild

another general relativistic effect, the geodetic precession. Besides, by using
the unitary representation of the local Lorentz transformation, we show that

Myers-Perry-AdS black hole mark bifurcation points to black resonators and
hairy Myers-Perry-AdS black holes, respectively. These solutions are subject to
the other (gravitational or scalar) instability, and result in hairy black
resonators which contain both gravitational and scalar hair. The hairy black
resonators have smooth zero-horizon limits that we call graviboson stars. In
the hairy black resonator and graviboson solutions, multiple scalar components
with different frequencies are excited, and hence these are multioscillating
solutions. The phase structure of the solutions are examined in the
microcanonical ensemble, i.e. at fixed energy and angular momenta. It is found
that the entropy of the hairy black resonator is never the largest among them.
We also find that hairy black holes with higher scalar wavenumbers are
entropically dominant and occupy more of phase space than those of lower

well-developed keywords and complete structures. Such queries fail to express
their true information needs and raise ambiguity as fragmental language often
yield various interpretations and aspects. This gives search engines a hard
time processing and understanding the query, and eventually leads to
unsatisfactory retrieval results. An alternative approach to direct answer
while facing an ambiguous query is to proactively ask clarifying questions to
the user. Recent years have seen many works and shared tasks from both NLP and
IR community about identifying the need for asking clarifying question and
methodology to generate them. An often neglected fact by these works is that
although sometimes the need for clarifying questions is correctly recognized,
the clarifying questions these system generate are still off-topic and
dissatisfaction provoking to users and may just cause users to leave the
conversation.
  In this work, we propose a risk-aware conversational search agent model to
balance the risk of answering user's query and asking clarifying questions. The
agent is fully aware that asking clarifying questions can potentially collect
more information from user, but it will compare all the choices it has and
evaluate the risks. Only after then, it will make decision between answering or
asking. To demonstrate that our system is able to retrieve better answers, we
conduct experiments on the MSDialog dataset which contains real-world customer
service conversations from Microsoft products community. We also purpose a
reinforcement learning strategy which allows us to train our model on the
original dataset directly and saves us from any further data annotation
efforts. Our experiment results show that our risk-aware conversational search
agent is able to significantly outperform strong non-risk-aware baselines.

consistency regularization based methods which achieve strong performance.
However, they heavily rely on domain-specific data augmentations, which are not
easy to generate for all data modalities. Pseudo-labeling (PL) is a general SSL
approach that does not have this constraint but performs relatively poorly in
its original formulation. We argue that PL underperforms due to the erroneous
high confidence predictions from poorly calibrated models; these predictions
generate many incorrect pseudo-labels, leading to noisy training. We propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-label selection (UPS) framework which improves pseudo
labeling accuracy by drastically reducing the amount of noise encountered in
the training process. Furthermore, UPS generalizes the pseudo-labeling process,
allowing for the creation of negative pseudo-labels; these negative
pseudo-labels can be used for multi-label classification as well as negative
learning to improve the single-label classification. We achieve strong
performance when compared to recent SSL methods on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100

applied a simple CS framework, using a weighted iterative thresholding
algorithm for CS reconstruction, to representative high-resolution STM images

reconstruction diagrams for a range of scanning patterns, sampling densities,

satisfactorily reconstructed down to 30\% sampling - already a strong
improvement. We furthermore outline limitations of this method, such as
sampling pattern artifacts, which become particularly pronounced for images
with intrinsic long-range disorder, and propose ways to mitigate some of them.
Finally we investigate compressibility of STM images as a measure of intrinsic

In this paper, we discover that the lost information is related to a large

discriminative cost-volume feature would completely vanish due to invalid
sampling, leading to the low efficiency of optical flow learning. We call this
phenomenon the Vanishing Cost Volume Problem. Inspired by the fact that local
motion tends to be highly consistent within a short temporal window, we propose
a novel iterative Motion Feature Recovery (MFR) method to address the vanishing
cost volume via modeling motion consistency across multiple frames. In each MFR
iteration, invalid entries from original motion features are first determined
based on the current flow. Then, an efficient network is designed to adaptively
learn the motion correlation to recover invalid features for lost-information
restoration. The final optical flow is then decoded from the recovered motion
features. Experimental results on Sintel and KITTI show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performances. In fact, MFR currently ranks second on

redshift range of $0.8 < z < 2.5$ and a minimum $\Delta z/z$ of ~0.003. One of
the primary science goals of HIRAX is to constrain the dark energy equation of
state by measuring the BAO scale as a function of redshift over a
cosmologically significant range. Achieving this goal places stringent
requirements on the mechanical and optical design of the HIRAX instrument which
are described in this paper. This includes the simulations used to optimize the
instrument, including the dish focal ratio, receiver support mechanism, and
instrument cabling. As a result of these simulations, the dish focal ratio has
been reduced to 0.23 to reduce inter-dish crosstalk, the feed support mechanism
has been redesigned as a wide (35 cm diam.) central column, and the feed design
has been modified to allow the cabling for the receiver to pass directly along
the symmetry axis of the feed and dish in order to eliminate beam asymmetries
and reduce sidelobe amplitudes. The beams from these full-instrument
simulations are also used in an astrophysical m-mode analysis pipeline which is
used to evaluate cosmological constraints and determine potential systematic

This generates the conservation equations of the two principal motion modes
naturally: the global center-of-mass flow and the relative velocity between
fluids. Well-posed equations can be obtained by modelling the storage of
kinetic energy in fluctuations structures induced by the interaction between
fluids, like wakes and vortexes. In this way, the equations can be regularized
without losing in the process the instabilities responsible for flow-patterns

networks, the deployment of different types of access points (APs) is underway.
In order to limit human intervention and reduce costs, the APs are expected to
be equipped with self-organizing capabilities. Moreover, due to the spectrum
crunch, frequency reuse among the deployed APs is inevitable, aggravating the
problem of inter-cell interference (ICI). Therefore, ICI mitigation in
self-organizing networks (SONs) is commonly identified as a key radio resource
management mechanism to enhance performance in future communication networks.
With the aim of reducing ICI in a SON, this paper proposes a novel solution for
the uncoordinated channel and power allocation problems. Based on the
multi-player multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework, the proposed technique does
not require any communication or coordination between the APs. The case of
varying channel rewards across APs is considered. In contrast to previous work
on channel allocation using the MAB framework, APs are permitted to choose
multiple channels for transmission. Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) is used to allow multiple APs to access each channel simultaneously.
This results in an MAB model with varying channel rewards, multiple plays and
non-zero reward on collision. The proposed algorithm has an expected regret in
the order of O(log^2 T ), which is validated by simulation results. Extensive
numerical results also reveal that the proposed technique significantly
outperforms the well-known upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, by achieving
more than a twofold increase in the energy efficiency.

observe the cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization over the
full sky at large angular scales. The challenges of LiteBIRD are the wide
field-of-view (FoV) and broadband capabilities of millimeter-wave polarization
measurements, which are derived from the system requirements. The possible
paths of stray light increase with a wider FoV and the far sidelobe knowledge
of $-56$ dB is a challenging optical requirement. A crossed-Dragone
configuration was chosen for the low frequency telescope (LFT : 34--161 GHz),
one of LiteBIRD's onboard telescopes. It has a wide field-of-view ($18^\circ
\times 9^\circ$) with an aperture of 400 mm in diameter, corresponding to an
angular resolution of about 30 arcminutes around 100 GHz. The focal ratio f/3.0
and the crossing angle of the optical axes of 90$^\circ$ are chosen after an
extensive study of the stray light. The primary and secondary reflectors have
rectangular shapes with serrations to reduce the diffraction pattern from the
edges of the mirrors. The reflectors and structure are made of aluminum to
proportionally contract from warm down to the operating temperature at $5\,$K.
A 1/4 scaled model of the LFT has been developed to validate the wide
field-of-view design and to demonstrate the reduced far sidelobes. A
polarization modulation unit (PMU), realized with a half-wave plate (HWP) is
placed in front of the aperture stop, the entrance pupil of this system. A
large focal plane with approximately 1000 AlMn TES detectors and frequency
multiplexing SQUID amplifiers is cooled to 100 mK. The lens and sinuous
antennas have broadband capability. Performance specifications of the LFT and
an outline of the proposed verification plan are presented.

4U~1630$-$47 using relativistic reflection spectroscopy. We use archival data
from the RXTE, Swift, and NuSTAR observatories, taken during different
outbursts of the source between $1998$ and $2015$. Our modeling includes two
relatively new advances in modern reflection codes: high-density disks, and
returning thermal disk radiation. Accretion disks around stellar-mass black
holes are expected to have densities well above the standard value assumed in
traditional reflection models (i.e., $n_{\rm e}\sim10^{15}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$). New
high-density reflection models have important implications in the determination
of disk truncation (i.e., the disk inner radius). This is because one must
retain self-consistency in the irradiating flux and corresponding disk
ionization state, which is a function of disk density and system geometry. We
find the disk density is $n_{\rm e}\ge10^{20}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ across all
spectral states. This density, combined with our constraints on the ionization
state of the material, implies an irradiating flux impinging on the disk that
is consistent with the expected theoretical estimates. Returning thermal disk
radiation -- the fraction of disk photons which bend back to the disk producing
additional reflection components -- is expected predominantly in the soft
state. We show that returning radiation models indeed provide a better fit to
the soft state data, reinforcing previous results which show that in the soft
state the irradiating continuum may be blackbody emission from the disk itself.

SN 2019yvq, from its discovery $\sim$1 day after explosion to $\sim$100 days
after its peak brightness. This SN exhibits several unusual features, most
notably an extremely bright UV excess seen within $\sim$5 days of its
explosion. As seen in Swift UV data, this early excess outshines its ""peak""
brightness, making this object more extreme than other SNe with early UV/blue
excesses (e.g. iPTF14atg and SN 2017cbv). In addition, it was underluminous
($M_B=-18.4$), relatively quickly declining ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35$), and
shows red colors past its early blue bump. Unusual (although not unprecedented)
spectral features include extremely broad-lined and high-velocity Si
absorption. Despite obvious differences in peak spectra, we classify SN 2019yvq
as a transitional member of the 02es-like subclass due to its similarities in
several respects (e.g. color, peak luminosity, peak Ti, nebular [Ca II]). We
model this dataset with a variety of published models, including SN ejecta -
companion shock interaction and sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD double detonation
models. Radio constraints from the VLA place an upper limit of $(4.5 - 20)
\times 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr on the mass-loss rate from a symbiotic
progenitor, which does not exclude a red giant or main sequence companion.
Ultimately we find that no one model can accurately replicate all aspects of
the dataset, and further we find that the ubiquity of early excesses in
02es-like SNe Ia requires a progenitor system that is capable of producing
isotropic UV flux, ruling out some models for this class of objects.

learn Hawkes process in high-frequency data, with optimized parametric and
non-parametric learners. But one challenge is to take into account the correct
causality of order book events considering latency: the only way one order book
event can influence another is if the time difference between them (by the
central order book timestamps) is greater than the minimum amount of time for
an event to be (i) published in the order book, (ii) reach the trader
responsible for the second event, (iii) influence the decision (processing time
at the trader) and (iv) the 2nd event reach the order book and be processed.
For this we can use exponential kernels shifted to the right by the latency
amount. We derive the expression for the log-likelihood to be minimized for the
1-D and the multidimensional cases, and test this method with simulated data
and real data. On real data we find that, although not all decays are the same,
the latency itself will determine most of the decays. We also show how the
decays are related to the latency. Code is available on GitHub at

stars of the same mass. Theoretical arguments and numerical calculations that
trace this effect to the difference in the behaviour of the equilibrium and
adiabatic sound speeds in the mixed phase of quarks and nucleons are provided.
We propose that the sensitivity of core g-mode oscillations to non-nucleonic
matter in neutron stars could be due to the presence of a mixed quark-nucleon
phase. Based on our analysis, we conclude that for binary mergers where one or
both components may be a hybrid star, the fraction of tidal energy pumped into
resonant g-modes in hybrid stars can exceed that of a normal neutron star by a
factor of 2-3, although resonance occurs during the last stages of inspiral. A
self-bound star, on the other hand, has a much weaker tidal overlap with the
g-mode. The cumulative tidal phase error in hybrid stars, $\Delta\phi\cong$ 0.5
rad, is comparable to that from tides in ordinary neutron stars, presenting a
challenge in distinguishing between the two cases. However, should the
principal g-mode be excited to sufficient amplitude for detection in a
post-merger remnant with quark matter in its interior, its frequency would be a
possible indication for the existence of non-nucleonic matter in neutron stars.

Preprocessing is done twice, before segmentation using k-means and after.
Preprocessing stage 1 using resize and reshape. Whereas after k-means is the
contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization. Preprocessing results are
segmented using k-means clustering. The K-means concept classifies images using
segments between the object and the background (using k = 8). The final step is
the morphological process with open and close operations to obtain fish
contours using black and white images based on grayscale images from color

device. Earlier research has attempted remote verification of a devices' state
using hardware, software, or hybrid approaches. Majority of them have used
Attestation Key as a hardware root of trust, which does not detect hardware
modification or counterfeit issues. In addition, they do not have a secure
communication channel between verifier and prover, which makes them susceptible
to modern security attacks. This paper presents SEDAT, a novel methodology for
remote attestation of the device via a security enhanced communication channel.
SEDAT performs hardware, firmware, and software attestation. SEDAT enhances the
communication protocol security between verifier and prover by using the Single
Packet Authorization (SPA) technique, which provides replay and Denial of
Service (DoS) protection. SEDAT provides a way for verifier to get on-demand
device integrity and authenticity status via a secure channel. It also enables
the verifier to detect counterfeit hardware, change in firmware, and software
code on the device. SEDAT validates the manufacturers` root CA certificate,
platform certificate, endorsement certificate (EK), and attributes certificates
to perform platform hardware attestation. SEDAT is the first known tool that
represents firmware, and Integrity Measurement Authority (IMA) event logs in
the Canonical Event Logs (CEL) format (recommended by Trusted Computing Group).
SEDAT is the first implementation, to the best of our knowledge, that showcases
end to end hardware, firmware, and software remote attestation using Trusted
Platform Module (TPM2.0) which is resilient to DoS and replay attacks. SEDAT is
the first remote verifier that is capable of retrieving a TPM2.0 quote from
prover and validate it after regeneration, using a software TPM2.0 quote check.

characteristics of wormlike micellar solutions past a single and vertically
aligned two microcylinders placed in a microchannel in the creeping flow regime
on the two-species Vasquez-Cook-McKinley (VCM) constitutive model, which takes
into account both the breakage and reformation dynamics of micelles. For the
case of single microcylinder, as the blockage ratio (ratio of the cylinder
diameter to that of the channel height) is gradually varied, we find the
existence of a flow bifurcation in the system, and also flow transits from
steady to unsteady state. For the case of two microcylinders, we observe the
presence of three distinct flow states in the system, namely, diverging (D),
asymmetric-diverging (AD) and converging (C) states as the intercylinder
spacing in between the two cylinders is varied. Similar types of flow states
are also observed in the recent experiments dealing with wormlike micellar
solutions. However, we show that either this transition from one flow state to
another in the case of a single microcylinder or the occurrence of any flow
state in the case of two microcylinders, is strongly dependent upon the values
of the Weissenberg number and the nonlinear VCM model parameter \xi, which
basically indicates how easy or hard to break a micelle. Based on the results
and discussion presented herein for the single and two microcylinders, we
ultimately provide the explanation for the formation of preferential paths or
lanes during the flow of viscoelastic fluids through a porous media, which was
seen in many prior experiments in the creeping flow regime.

Linguists have often considered the process of loanword integration to be more
dependent on language-internal constraints, but sociolinguistic constraints
such as speaker background remain only qualitatively understood. We investigate
the role of social context and speaker background in Spanish speakers' use of
integrated loanwords on social media. We find first that newspaper authors use
the integrated forms of loanwords and native words more often than social media
authors, showing that integration is associated with formal domains. In social
media, we find that speaker background and expectations of formality explain
loanword and native word integration, such that authors who use more Spanish

This study shows that loanword integration reflects not only language-internal

inviscid impinging outgoing jet with contact discontinuity, which issues from
two given semi-infinitely long axially symmetric nozzles and extends to

jet initiate smoothly from the mouths of the two nozzles and shrink to some
asymptotic conical surface. There exists a smooth surface separating the two
incompressible fluids and the contact discontinuity occurs on the surface.
Furthermore, we showed that there is no stagnation point in the flow field and
its closure, except one point on the symmetric axis. Some asymptotic behavior

normal metallic leads kept at different temperatures and chemical potentials.
Transport in this set-up is usually studied using two frameworks -- the
nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach or the scattering approach. In
the NEGF approach the current and other steady state properties of a system are
expressed in terms of Green's functions that involve the wire properties and
self-energy corrections arising from the leads. In the scattering approach,
transport is studied in terms of the scattering amplitudes of plane waves
incident on the wire from the reservoirs. Here we show explicitly that these
two approaches produce identical results for the conductance of the Kitaev
chain. Further we show that the NEGF expression for conductance can be written
in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence of the various terms in
the NEGF expression to the amplitudes for normal transmission, Andreev
transmission and Andreev reflection in the scattering approach. Thereby, we
obtain closed form expressions for these. We obtain the wavefunctions of zero
energy Majorana bound states(MBS) of the wire connected to leads and prove that
they are present in the same parameter regime in which they occur for an
isolated wire. These bound states give rise to perfect Andreev reflection
responsible for zero bias quantized conductance peak. We discuss the dependence
of the width of this peak on different parameters of the Hamiltonian and relate

Furthermore, we verify using several simulations that our method determines

materials which attenuate low energy photons, sometimes combined with an
absorption edge, thus also discriminating towards photons of higher energies.
These filters are fairly inefficient, in particular for photons of higher
energies, and other methods for achieving a narrower bandwidth have been
proposed. Such methods include various types of monochromators, based on for
instance mosaic crystals or refractive multi-prism x-ray lenses (MPL's).
Prism-array lenses (PAL's) are similar to MPL's, but are shorter, have larger
apertures, and higher transmission. A PAL consists of a number of small prisms
arranged in columns perpendicular to the optical axis. The column height
decreases along the optical axis so that the projection of lens material is
approximately linear with a Fresnel phase-plate pattern superimposed on it. The
focusing effect is one dimensional, and the lens is chromatic. Hence, unwanted
energies can be blocked by placing a slit in the image plane of a desired
energy. We present the first experimental and theoretical results on an energy
filter based on a silicon PAL. The study includes an evaluation of the spectral
shaping properties of the filter as well as a quantification of the achievable
increase in dose efficiency compared to standard methods. Previously, PAL's
have been investigated with synchrotron radiation, but in this study a medical

logarithmically subtracted, resulting in suppression of the signal from the
tissue background and a relative enhancement of the signal from the agent.
Although promising, DES is still not widely used in clinical practice. One
reason may be the need for two distinctly separated x-ray spectra that are
still close to the absorption edge, realized through dual exposures which may
introduce motion unsharpness. In this study, electronic spectrum-splitting with
a silicon-strip detector is theoretically and experimentally investigated for a
mammography model with iodinated contrast agent. Comparisons are made to
absorption imaging and a near-ideal detector using a signal-to-noise ratio that

heavy absorption filtration was needed to narrow the spectra at the expense of
a large reduction in x-ray flux. Therefore, potential improvements using a

  Modeling","Accepted to ICASSP 2021",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A common approach to the automatic detection of mispronunciation in language
learning is to recognize the phonemes produced by a student and compare it to
the expected pronunciation of a native speaker. This approach makes two
simplifying assumptions: a) phonemes can be recognized from speech with high
accuracy, b) there is a single correct way for a sentence to be pronounced.
These assumptions do not always hold, which can result in a significant amount
of false mispronunciation alarms. We propose a novel approach to overcome this
problem based on two principles: a) taking into account uncertainty in the
automatic phoneme recognition step, b) accounting for the fact that there may
be multiple valid pronunciations. We evaluate the model on non-native (L2)
English speech of German, Italian and Polish speakers, where it is shown to
increase the precision of detecting mispronunciations by up to 18% (relative)
compared to the common approach.

applies to existing works on SAN-based models and can explain the relationship
among the ability to capture the structural or linguistic information, depth of
model, and length of sentence, and can also be extended to other models such as
recurrent neural network based models. We also propose a revisited multigraph
called Multi-order-Graph (MoG) based on our explanation to model the graph
structures in the SAN-based model as subgraphs in MoG and convert the encoding
of SAN-based model to the generation of MoG. Based on our explanation, we
further introduce a Graph-Transformer by enhancing the ability to capture
multiple subgraphs of different orders and focusing on subgraphs of high
orders. Experimental results on multiple neural machine translation tasks show
that the Graph-Transformer can yield effective performance improvement.

nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). However, the spectra matrix produced

identifiability of each source as well. To address this problem, here we
propose to enhance the identifiability of the source model by a minimum-volume

the posterior distribution of the separated sources, which ensures the

  Optimization for CNN","13 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  As the convolutional neural network (CNN) gets deeper and wider in recent
years, the requirements for the amount of data and hardware resources have
gradually increased. Meanwhile, CNN also reveals salient redundancy in several
tasks. The existing magnitude-based pruning methods are efficient, but the
performance of the compressed network is unpredictable. While the accuracy loss
after pruning based on the structure sensitivity is relatively slight, the
process is time-consuming and the algorithm complexity is notable. In this
article, we propose a novel automatic channel pruning method (ACP).
Specifically, we firstly perform layer-wise channel clustering via the
similarity of the feature maps to perform preliminary pruning on the network.
Then a population initialization method is introduced to transform the pruned
structure into a candidate population. Finally, we conduct searching and
optimizing iteratively based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find
the optimal compressed structure. The compact network is then retrained to
mitigate the accuracy loss from pruning. Our method is evaluated against
several state-of-the-art CNNs on three different classification datasets
CIFAR-10/100 and ILSVRC-2012. On the ILSVRC-2012, when removing 64.36%
parameters and 63.34% floating-point operations (FLOPs) of ResNet-50, the Top-1
and Top-5 accuracy drop are less than 0.9%. Moreover, we demonstrate that
without harming overall performance it is possible to compress SSD by more than
50% on the target detection dataset PASCAL VOC. It further verifies that the
proposed method can also be applied to other CNNs and application scenarios.

mutually unbiased bases sets formed by the eigenbases of Heisenberg-Weyl

analysis of purity, rank, orthogonality, mutual unbiasedness conditions and the
distance between two qutrit states inside the sphere indicates that it is a
natural extension of the qubit Bloch sphere. However, unlike the qubit Bloch
sphere, the four-dimensional sphere is not a solid sphere. We also analyze the
two and three-dimensional sections which gives a non-convex but closed
structure for physical qutrit states inside the sphere. Significantly, we have
applied our representation to find mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), to
characterize the unital maps in three dimensions and also to characterize the
ensemble generated using Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures metrics. Lastly, we also

their geometrical properties. It is analogous to color back-projection which
measures similarity between images, simply by looking at their color
distributions. In the overall process, first, shape histogram of a sample
surface (e.g. planar) is computed, which captures the profile of surface
normals around a point in form of a probability distribution. Later, the
histogram is back-projected onto a test surface and a likelihood score is
obtained. The score depicts that how likely a point in the test surface behaves
similar to the sample surface, geometrically. Shape back-projection finds its
application in binary surface classification, high curvature edge detection in
unorganized point cloud, automated point cloud labeling for 3D-CNNs

robust functional principal component analysis approach based on the functional
pairwise spatial sign (PASS) operator, termed PASS FPCA, is introduced where we
propose estimation procedures for both eigenfunctions and eigenvalues with and
without measurement error. Compared to existing robust FPCA methods, the
proposed one requires weaker distributional assumptions to conserve the
eigenspace of the covariance function. In particular, a class of distributions
called the weakly functional coordinate symmetric (weakly FCS) is introduced
that allows for severe asymmetry and is strictly larger than the functional
elliptical distribution class, the latter of which has been well used in the
robust statistics literature. The robustness of the PASS FPCA is demonstrated
via simulation studies and analyses of accelerometry data from a large-scale
epidemiological study of physical activity on older women that partly motivates
this work.

inference forgetting} (BIF) framework to realize the right to be forgotten in
Bayesian inference. In the BIF framework, we develop forgetting algorithms for
variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo. We show that our algorithms
can provably remove the influence of single datums on the learned models.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithms have guaranteed
generalizability. Experiments of Gaussian mixture models on the synthetic
dataset and Bayesian neural networks on the real-world data verify the

and with its popularity comes the concerns of privacy of riders and drivers.
ORide is a privacy-preserving RHS proposed at the USENIX Security Symposium
2017 and uses Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE). In their protocol, a rider
and all drivers in a zone send their encrypted coordinates to the RHS Service
Provider (SP) who computes the squared Euclidean distances between them and
forwards them to the rider. The rider decrypts these and selects the optimal
driver with least Euclidean distance. In this work, we demonstrate a
location-harvesting attack where an honest-but-curious rider, making only a
single ride request, can determine the exact coordinates of about half the
number of responding drivers even when only the distance between the rider and
drivers are given. The significance of our attack lies in inferring locations
of other drivers in the zone, which are not (supposed to be) revealed to the
rider as per the protocol. We validate our attack by running experiments on
zones of varying sizes in arbitrarily selected big cities. Our attack is based
on enumerating lattice points on a circle of sufficiently small radius and
eliminating solutions based on conditions imposed by the application scenario.
Finally, we propose a modification to ORide aimed at thwarting our attack and
show that this modification provides sufficient driver anonymity while
preserving ride matching accuracy.

described through two-state systems which act as a two-peak random potential.
An impurity sits either at the top or at the bottom of the ladder on each rung
equally, producing a telegraph signal. The impurities-matter coupling gives
rise to a classical Ising symmetry for static and mobile impurities associated
to the inversion symmetry of the two legs of the ladder. From the decoupled
rungs limit, we also identify a local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory for mobile
impurities. The properties of the system are studied from an effective quantum
spin model including the possibility of four-body coupling in the limit of a
strong interaction between bosons and impurities. Through analytical approaches
and numerical exact diagonalization, we study the superfluid currents both in
the weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled rungs limits for the bosons. In the
weakly-coupled rungs situation, we find a smooth power-law localization whereas
the strongly-coupled rungs limit produces a steep localization or insulating
phase for various configurations of the two-peak random potential. In the
strongly disordered situation, through entanglement and bipartite fluctuation

answering, information retrieval, and dialogue. However, these models designed
for short texts cannot well address the long-form text matching problem,
because there are many contexts in long-form texts can not be directly aligned
with each other, and it is difficult for existing models to capture the key
matching signals from such noisy data. Besides, these models are
computationally expensive for simply use all textual data indiscriminately. To
tackle the effectiveness and efficiency problem, we propose a novel
hierarchical noise filtering model, namely Match-Ignition. The main idea is to
plug the well-known PageRank algorithm into the Transformer, to identify and
filter both sentence and word level noisy information in the matching process.
Noisy sentences are usually easy to detect because previous work has shown that
their similarity can be explicitly evaluated by the word overlapping, so we
directly use PageRank to filter such information based on a sentence similarity
graph. Unlike sentences, words rely on their contexts to express concrete
meanings, so we propose to jointly learn the filtering and matching process, to
well capture the critical word-level matching signals. Specifically, a word
graph is first built based on the attention scores in each self-attention block
of Transformer, and key words are then selected by applying PageRank on this
graph. In this way, noisy words will be filtered out layer by layer in the
matching process. Experimental results show that Match-Ignition outperforms
both SOTA short text matching models and recent long-form text matching models.
We also conduct detailed analysis to show that Match-Ignition efficiently
captures important sentences and words, to facilitate the long-form text
matching process.

forward-modelled EUV emission and three-dimensional tracing of magnetic field
to analyse oscillatory behaviour of individual magnetic loops. We further

using wavelet power spectra to capture changes in the oscillation periods.
Various types of oscillations commonly observed in the corona are present in
the simulation. We detect standing oscillations in both transverse and

We also show that self-consistent simulations reproduce existence of two
distinct regimes of transverse coronal oscillations: rapidly decaying
oscillations triggered by impulsive events and sustained small-scale
oscillations showing no observable damping. No harmonic drivers are detected at
the footpoints of oscillating loops. We show that coronal loop oscillations are

the convergence of many multigrid methods known in the literature. This paper
aims to generalize the previous results giving more general sufficient

matrix-valued trigonometric polynomials which can be non-diagonalizable and
singular at all points and we express the new conditions in terms of the
eigenvectors associated with the ill-conditioned subspace. Moreover, we extend
the analysis to the V-cycle method proving a linear convergence rate under
stronger conditions, which resemble those given in the scalar case. In order to

circular membrane with a hole at its center are analyzed within the framework
of finite deformation elasticity. Initially, we derive a simple form for the
differential governing equation to the problem. This enables us to introduce a
closed-form solution in the limit of infinite stretch. Subsequently, we propose
approximate solutions for intermediate and large deformations. These
approximations approach the exact solutions in the limits of small and infinite
stretches. The transition stretch at which the membrane behavior switches from
the intermediate to the large deformation approximation is determined too.
Comparison of our solution and approximations to corresponding numerical
results reveal a neat agreement for any stretch and ratio between the hole to
the membrane radii. In the limit of large stretches and a small hole, the ratio
of the hoop stress at the hole boundary to the nominal stress is 4, which is
twice the corresponding ratio in the small deformation limit. Comparison of the
strain energy stored in the membrane to the one in a membrane without a hole
reveals that only at finite stretches the difference between these energies
becomes meaningful. This implies that it is likely that a flaw in a membrane
will tear out only at a finite level of stretches.

symmetry breaking is a non-perturbative phenomenon and thanks to massive $QCD$

from satisfactory. The first part of this article is devoted to review the

of quantities directly related to the $U_A(1)$ axial anomaly. In the second

aliasing and redundant oversampling by design. Conversely, in medical image
resampling, images are considered as continuous functions, are warped by a
spatial transformation, and are then sampled on a regular grid. In most cases,
the spatial warping changes the frequency characteristics of the continuous
function and no special care is taken to ensure that the resampling grid
respects the conditions of the sampling theorem. This paper shows that this
oversight introduces artefacts, including aliasing, that can lead to important
bias in clinical applications. One notable exception to this common practice is
when multi-resolution pyramids are constructed, with low-pass ""anti-aliasing""
filters being applied prior to downsampling. In this work, we illustrate why
similar caution is needed when resampling images under general spatial
transformations and propose a novel method that is more respectful of the
sampling theorem, minimising aliasing and loss of information. We introduce the
notion of scale factor point spread function (sfPSF) and employ Gaussian
kernels to achieve a computationally tractable resampling scheme that can cope
with arbitrary non-linear spatial transformations and grid sizes. Experiments
demonstrate significant (p<1e-4) technical and clinical implications of the
proposed method.

clinical care to mitigate the risk. While hyperkalemia is often a complication
of acute kidney injury (AKI), it also occurs in the absence of AKI. We
developed predictive models to identify intensive care unit (ICU) patients at
risk of developing hyperkalemia by using the Medical Information Mart for
Intensive Care (MIMIC) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD).
Our methodology focused on building multiple models, optimizing for
interpretability through model selection, and simulating various clinical
scenarios.
  In order to determine if our models perform accurately on patients with and
without AKI, we evaluated the following clinical cases: (i) predicting
hyperkalemia after AKI within 14 days of ICU admission, (ii) predicting
hyperkalemia within 14 days of ICU admission regardless of AKI status, and
compared different lead times for (i) and (ii). Both clinical scenarios were
modeled using logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and XGBoost.
  Using observations from the first day in the ICU, our models were able to
predict hyperkalemia with an AUC of (i) 0.79, 0.81, 0.81 and (ii) 0.81, 0.85,
0.85 for LR, RF, and XGBoost respectively. We found that 4 out of the top 5

models that included all patients with or without AKI, but not in the models

important for hyperkalemia, the specific stage of AKI may not be as important.
Our findings require further investigation and confirmation.

also obscure the inherent characteristics of different types of high-order

innovatively integrate self-supervised learning into the training of the

Specifically, we consider lattice distributions $P_\Lambda$ in which the

function, $f$, evaluated at that point. To generate samples from $P_\Lambda$,
it suffices to draw samples from a pull-back measure $P_{\mathbb{Z}^d}$ defined

dissipation by turbulent friction and shock waves (i.e., hydraulic jumps) for

specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most
territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in
response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the

the problem of assigning buses to bus stops to minimise the average waiting
time of passengers, W. An analytical theory for two specific cases of
interactions is formulated: normal situation where all buses board passengers
from every bus stop, versus novel express buses where disjoint subsets of
non-interacting buses serve disjoint subsets of bus stops. Our formulation
allows exact calculation of W for general loops in the two cases examined.
Compared with regular buses, we present scenarios where express buses show
improvement in W. Useful insights are obtained from our theory: 1) there is a
minimum number of buses needed, 2) splitting a crowded bus stop into two less
crowded ones always increases W for regular buses, 3) changing the destination
of passengers and location of bus stops do not influence W. In the second part,
we introduce a reinforcement-learning platform that overcomes limitations of
our analytical method to search for better allocations of buses to bus stops
that minimise W. Compared with the previous cases, any possible interaction
between buses is allowed, unlocking novel emergent strategies. We apply this
tool to a simple toy model and three empirically-motivated bus loops, based on
data collected from the Nanyang Technological University shuttle bus system. In
the simplified model, we observe an unexpected strategy emerging that could not
be analysed with our mathematical formulation and displays chaotic behaviour.
The possible configurations in the three empirically-motivated scenarios are
approximately 10^11, 10^11 and 10^20, so a brute-force approach is impossible.
Our algorithm reduces W by 12% to 32% compared with regular buses and 12% to
29% compared with express buses. This tool has practical applications because
it works independently of the specific characteristics of a bus loop.

objects on the conveyor belts are moving, robots have limited time to pick them
up. This brings the requirement for fast and reliable motion planners that
could provide provable real-time planning guarantees, which the existing
algorithms do not provide. Besides the planning efficiency, the success of
manipulation tasks relies heavily on the accuracy of the perception system
which is often noisy, especially if the target objects are perceived from a
distance. For fast moving conveyor belts, the robot cannot wait for a perfect
estimate before it starts executing its motion. In order to be able to reach
the object in time, it must start moving early on (relying on the initial noisy
estimates) and adjust its motion on-the-fly in response to the pose updates
from perception. We propose a planning framework that meets these requirements

two limitations of existing work on Supreme Court citations. First, dyadic

Second, citations are treated as if they arise independently. We present a
methodology for studying citations between Supreme Court opinions at the dyadic
level, as a network, that overcomes these limitations. This methodology -- the
citation exponential random graph model, for which we provide user-friendly
software -- enables researchers to account for the effects of case
characteristics and complex forms of network dependence in citation formation.
We then analyze a network that includes all Supreme Court cases decided between

reciprocity, transitivity, and popularity. The dependence effects are as
substantively and statistically significant as the effects of exogenous

denoising of data, as when you have calibration data and you want to fit a

to de-trend a time series or normalize a spectrum. In these contexts,
investigators often choose a polynomial basis, or a Fourier basis, or wavelets,
or something equally general. They also choose an order, or number of basis
functions to fit, and (often) some kind of regularization. We discuss how this
basis-function fitting is done, with ordinary least squares and extensions
thereof. We emphasize that it is often valuable to choose far more parameters
than data points, despite folk rules to the contrary: Suitably regularized
models with enormous numbers of parameters generalize well and make good
predictions for held-out data; over-fitting is not (mainly) a problem of having
too many parameters. It is even possible to take the limit of infinite
parameters, at which, if the basis and regularization are chosen correctly, the
least-squares fit becomes the mean of a Gaussian process. We recommend
cross-validation as a good empirical method for model selection (for example,
setting the number of parameters and the form of the regularization), and
jackknife resampling as a good empirical method for estimating the
uncertainties of the predictions made by the model. We also give advice for
building stable computational implementations.

The action is zero for a perfect fluid solution and this fixes $\Lambda$ to the

$\Lambda = 4\pi G <\rho+3p>$. This explains both why the observed value of
$\Lambda$ is related to the matter density today and also why other
contributions to $\Lambda$, such as DE or MG, do not produce cosmic expansion.
Cosmic acceleration results from the repulsive boundary force that occurs when
the expansion reaches the causal horizon. This universe is similar to the

departures from homogeneity/isotropy, such as CMB anomalies and variations in

across dataset sizes, series lengths, data dimensions, temporal window sizes,
and machines. The new solution, named TC-DTW, introduces Triangle Inequality
and Point Clustering into the algorithm design on lower bound calculations for
multivariate DTW. In experiments on DTW-based nearest neighbor finding, the new
solution avoids as much as 98% (60% average) DTW distance calculations and
yields as much as 25X (7.5X average) speedups.

  Limitation and An Effective Fix","22 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work considers the out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction problem where
(1)~the training data are from multiple domains and (2)~the test domain is
unseen in the training. DNNs fail in OOD prediction because they are prone to
pick up spurious correlations. Recently, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) is
proposed to address this issue. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in the
colored MNIST experiment. Nevertheless, we find that the performance of IRM can
be dramatically degraded under \emph{strong $\Lambda$ spuriousness} -- when the
spurious correlation between the spurious features and the class label is
strong due to the strong causal influence of their common cause, the domain
label, on both of them (see Fig. 1). In this work, we try to answer the
questions: why does IRM fail in the aforementioned setting? Why does IRM work
for the original colored MNIST dataset? How can we fix this problem of IRM?
Then, we propose a simple and effective approach to fix the problem of IRM. We
combine IRM with conditional distribution matching to avoid a specific type of
spurious correlation under strong $\Lambda$ spuriousness. Empirically, we
design a series of semi synthetic datasets -- the colored MNIST plus, which
exposes the problems of IRM and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method.

  Snapshots","To appear in ASPLOS 2021",,"10.1145/3445814.3446714",,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Serverless computing has seen rapid adoption due to its high scalability and
flexible, pay-as-you-go billing model. In serverless, developers structure
their services as a collection of functions, sporadically invoked by various
events like clicks. High inter-arrival time variability of function invocations
motivates the providers to start new function instances upon each invocation,
leading to significant cold-start delays that degrade user experience. To
reduce cold-start latency, the industry has turned to snapshotting, whereby an
image of a fully-booted function is stored on disk, enabling a faster
invocation compared to booting a function from scratch.
  This work introduces vHive, an open-source framework for serverless
experimentation with the goal of enabling researchers to study and innovate
across the entire serverless stack. Using vHive, we characterize a
state-of-the-art snapshot-based serverless infrastructure, based on
industry-leading Containerd orchestration framework and Firecracker hypervisor
technologies. We find that the execution time of a function started from a
snapshot is 95% higher, on average, than when the same function is
memory-resident. We show that the high latency is attributable to frequent page
faults as the function's state is brought from disk into guest memory one page
at a time. Our analysis further reveals that functions access the same stable
working set of pages across different invocations of the same function. By
leveraging this insight, we build REAP, a light-weight software mechanism for
serverless hosts that records functions' stable working set of guest memory
pages and proactively prefetches it from disk into memory. Compared to baseline
snapshotting, REAP slashes the cold-start delays by 3.7x, on average.

recovery of communities based on variances in credit card transactions. Such
variances could capture the collective effects of household impacts, disrupted
accesses, and business closures, and thus provide an integrative measure for
examining disaster impacts and community recovery in disasters. Existing
studies depend mainly on survey and sociodemographic data for disaster impacts
and recovery effort evaluations, although such data has limitations, including
large data collection efforts and delayed timeliness results. In addition,
there are very few studies have concentrated on spatial patterns and
disparities of disaster impacts and short-term recovery of communities,
although such investigation can enhance situational awareness during disasters
and support the identification of disparate spatial patterns of disaster
impacts and recovery in the impacted regions. This study examines credit card
transaction data Harris County (Texas, USA) during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 to
explore spatial patterns of disaster impacts and recovery during from the
perspective of community residents and businesses at ZIP code and county
scales, respectively, and to further investigate their spatial disparities
across ZIP codes. The results indicate that individuals in ZIP codes with
populations of higher income experienced more severe disaster impact and
recovered more quickly than those located in lower-income ZIP codes for most
business sectors. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of spatial
patterns and disparities in disaster impacts and recovery for better community
resilience assessment, but also could benefit emergency managers, city
planners, and public officials in harnessing population activity data, using
credit card transactions as a proxy for activity, to improve situational
awareness and resource allocation.

  Source Veracity Detection","Preprint Version",,,,"cs.SI cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stopping the malicious spread and production of false and misleading news has
become a top priority for researchers. Due to this prevalence, many automated
methods for detecting low quality information have been introduced. The
majority of these methods have used article-level features, such as their
writing style, to detect veracity. While writing style models have been shown
to work well in lab-settings, there are concerns of generalizability and
robustness. In this paper, we begin to address these concerns by proposing a
novel and robust news veracity detection model that uses the content sharing
behavior of news sources formulated as a network. We represent these content
sharing networks (CSN) using a deep walk based method for embedding graphs that
accounts for similarity in both the network space and the article text space.
We show that state of the art writing style and CSN features make diverse
mistakes when predicting, meaning that they both play different roles in the
classification task. Moreover, we show that the addition of CSN features
increases the accuracy of writing style models, boosting accuracy as much as
14\% when using Random Forests. Similarly, we show that the combination of
hand-crafted article-level features and CSN features is robust to concept
drift, performing consistently well over a 10-month time frame.

spectrum efficiency than with the conventional four-color (4CR) and two-color
(2CR) reuse approaches. In this scope, we develop an over-the-air test-bed for
end-to-end precoding validations. We use an actual multi-beam satellite to
transmit and receive precoded signals using the DVB-S2X standard based gateway
and user terminals. The developed system is capable of end-to-end real-time
communications over the satellite link including channel measurements and
precompensation. It is shown, that by successfully canceling inter-user
interference in the actual satellite FFR link precoding brings gains in terms
of enhanced SINR and increased system goodput.
