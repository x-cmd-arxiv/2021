idiosyncratic option-based currency volatilities and shows how such network
risk is priced in the cross-section of currency returns. A portfolio that buys
net-receivers and sells net-transmitters of short-term linkages between
currency volatilities generates a significant Sharpe ratio. The network
strategy formed on causal connections is uncorrelated with popular benchmarks

quantum dots, uncommon for molecular beam epitaxy grown nanostructures, with

configurations of external magnetic field. The diamagnetic coefficients are
found to be in the range of 1.5-4 {\mu}eV/{\T^2}, and 8-15 {\mu}eV/{\T^2},
respectively out of plane and in plane of the dots. The determined values of
diamagnetic shifts are related to the anisotropy of dot sizes. Trion g-factors
are measured to be relatively small, in the range of 0.3-0.7 and 0.5-1.3, in
both configurations respectively. Analysis of single carrier g-factors, based
on the formalism of spin-correlated orbital currents, leads to the similar
values for hole and electron of {\sim} 0.25 for Voigt and {\g_e} {\approx} -5;
{\g_h} {\approx} +6 for Faraday configuration of magnetic field. Values of
g-factors close to zero measured in Voigt configuration make the investigated
dots promising for electrical tuning of g-factor sign, required for schemes of

measures. However, OT is limited to nonnegative measures having the same mass,
and suffers serious drawbacks about its computation and statistics. This leads
to several proposals of regularized variants of OT in the recent literature. In
this work, we consider an \textit{entropy partial transport} (EPT) problem for
nonnegative measures on a tree having different masses. The EPT is shown to be
equivalent to a standard complete OT problem on a one-node extended tree. We
derive its dual formulation, then leverage this to propose a novel
regularization for EPT which admits fast computation and negative definiteness.
To our knowledge, the proposed regularized EPT is the first approach that
yields a \textit{closed-form} solution among available variants of unbalanced
OT. For practical applications without priori knowledge about the tree
structure for measures, we propose tree-sliced variants of the regularized EPT,
computed by averaging the regularized EPT between these measures using random
tree metrics, built adaptively from support data points. Exploiting the
negative definiteness of our regularized EPT, we introduce a positive definite
kernel, and evaluate it against other baselines on benchmark tasks such as
document classification with word embedding and topological data analysis. In
addition, we empirically demonstrate that our regularization also provides
effective approximations.

that size fractionated sampling times of few hours must be achieved such that
anthropogenic and natural emissions can be correctly identified. While cascade
impactors allow for time- and size-resolved collection of airborne PM, total
reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) allows for element-sensitive investigation
of low sample amounts thanks to its detection sensitivity. However, during
quantification by means of TXRF it is crucial to be aware of the limits of TXRF
in order to identify situations where collection times or pollution levels were
exceedingly long or high. It will be shown by means of grazing incidence X-ray
fluorescence (GIXRF), where different reflection conditions are probed, that a
self consistent quantification of elemental mass depositions can be performed
in order to validate or identify issues in quantification by means of TXRF.
Furthermore, monitors of validity for a reliable quantification of the
elemental composition of PM by means of TXRF will be introduced. The
methodological approach presented can be transferred to tabletop
instrumentation in order to guarantee a reliable quantification on an element
sensitive basis of the PM collected. This aspect is highly relevant for

active galactic nucleus are switched off. To study the fraction of radio
galaxies in a remnant phase, we take advantage of a $8.31$\,deg$^2$ sub-region
of the GAMA~23~field which comprises of surveys covering the frequency range
0.1--9\,GHz. We present a sample of 104 radio galaxies compiled from
observations conducted by the Murchison Wide-field Array (216\,MHz), the
Australia Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (887\,MHz), and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (5.5\,GHz). We adopt an `absent radio core' criterion
to identify 10 radio galaxies showing no evidence for an active nucleus. We
classify these as new candidate remnant radio galaxies. Seven of these objects
still display compact emitting regions within the lobes at 5.5\,GHz; at this
frequency the emission is short-lived, implying a recent jet switch-off. On the
other hand, only three show evidence of aged lobe plasma by the presence of an
ultra-steep spectrum ($\alpha<-1.2$) and a diffuse, low surface-brightness
radio morphology. The predominant fraction of young remnants is consistent with
a rapid fading during the remnant phase. Within our sample of radio galaxies,
our observations constrain the remnant fraction to $4\%\lesssim
f_{\mathrm{rem}} \lesssim 10\%$; the lower limit comes from the limiting case
in which all remnant candidates with hotspots are simply active radio galaxies
with faint, undetected radio cores. Finally, we model the synchrotron spectrum
arising from a hotspot to show they can persist for 5--10\,Myr at 5.5\,GHz
after the jets switch off -- radio emission arising from such hotspots can
therefore be expected in an appreciable fraction of genuine remnants.

unique features that the conventional picture of radial excitation in the quark

in mind the existence of a natural length scale given by the Planck length,

pure energy part has the appropriate property for dealing with the dark sector

solution can be obtained by combining the two. The proposed approach is based
on the combination of a generative framework and a one-class classification
method. First, we learn generative features using the one-class data with a
generative framework. We augment the learned features with the corresponding
reconstruction errors to obtain augmented features. Then, we qualitatively
identify a suitable feature distribution that reduces the redundancy in the
chosen classifier space. Finally, we force the augmented features to take the

undecidable problem. Algorithms for termination analysis are divided into two
groups: (1) algorithms with strong behavioral guarantees that work in limited

polyhedral loops [Podelski and Rybalchenko, 2004]), and (2) algorithms that are
widely applicable, but have weak behavioral guarantees (e.g., Terminator [Cook

practical termination analyzers with useful behavioral guarantees?
  This paper presents a termination analysis that is both compositional (the
result of analyzing a composite program is a function of the analysis results
of its components) and monotone (""more information into the analysis yields
more information out""). The paper has two key contributions. The first is an
extension of Tarjan's method for solving path problems in graphs to solve
infinite path problems. This provides a foundation upon which to build
compositional termination analyses. The second is a collection of monotone
conditional termination analyses based on this framework. We demonstrate that
our tool ComPACT (Compositional and Predictable Analysis for Conditional

that valley states can serve as an asset that enables two-axis control of a
singlet-triplet qubit formed in a double quantum dot without the application of
a magnetic field gradient. We measure the valley spectrum in each dot using
magnetic field spectroscopy of Zeeman split triplet states. The interdot
transition between ground states requires an electron to flip between valleys,
which in turn provides a g-factor difference $\Delta g$ between two dots. This
$\Delta g$ serves as an effective magnetic field gradient and allows for qubit
rotations with a rate that increases linearly with an external magnetic field.
We measured several interdot transitions and found that this valley introduced
$\Delta g$ is universal and electrically tunable. This could potentially
simplify scaling up quantum information processing in the SiGe platform by
removing the requirement for magnetic field gradients which are difficult to
engineer.

Burgers equation whose solution develops a finite-time singularity. Our
renormalized reduced order models are stable and accurate for long times while
using for their calibration only data from a full order simulation before the
occurrence of the singularity. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the 3D
Euler equations of incompressible fluid flow, where the problem of finite-time
singularity formation is still open and where brute force simulation is only
feasible for short times. Our approach allows us to obtain for the first time a
perturbatively renormalizable model which is stable for long times and includes
all the complex effects present in the 3D Euler dynamics. We find that, in each

The ash produced during helium shell burning can lead to light curves and
spectra that are inconsistent with normal SNe~Ia, but may be viable for some
objects showing a light curve bump within the days following explosion. We
present a series of radiative transfer models designed to mimic predictions
from double detonation explosion models. We consider a range of core and shell
masses, and systematically explore multiple post-explosion compositions for the
helium shell. We find that a variety of luminosities and timescales for early
light curve bumps result from those models with shells containing $^{56}$Ni,
$^{52}$Fe, or $^{48}$Cr. Comparing our models to SNe~Ia with light curve bumps,
we find that these models can reproduce the shapes of almost all of the bumps
observed, but only those objects with red colours around maximum light ($B-V
\gtrsim 1$) are well matched throughout their evolution. Consistent with
previous works, we also show that those models in which the shell does not
contain iron-group elements provide good agreement with normal SNe~Ia of
different luminosities from shortly after explosion up to maximum light. While
our models do not amount to positive evidence in favour of the double
detonation scenario, we show that provided the helium shell ash does not
contain iron-group elements, it may be viable for a wide range of normal
SNe~Ia.

recent work, we give an affirmative answer to this question when $g \leq 4$ by
completely classifying the possible Betti tables of Koszul algebras defined by
height-two ideals of four quadrics. Continuing this work, the current paper
proves a structure theorem for Koszul algebras defined by four quadrics. We
show that all these Koszul algebras are LG-quadratic, proving that an example
of Conca of a Koszul algebra that is not LG-quadratic is minimal in terms of
number of defining equations. We then characterize precisely when these rings
are absolutely Koszul, and establish the equivalence of the absolutely Koszul

characterized at the nanoscale by HRTEM, EDX, and by SIMS. HRTEM decisively
excluded a presence of foreign Mn-rich phases. The structures, up to medium Mg
doping, show no Mg over-doping effects. Magnetic studies of these structures
are aided by the employment of a dedicated experimental approach of the in situ
compensation of the magnetic contribution from the substrate, allowing up to
about fifty-fold reduction of this contribution. This technique, dedicated to
these structures, simultaneously provides a tenfold reduction of temporal
instabilities of the magnetometric unit and lowers the experimental jitter to
merely $5 \times 10^{-7}$~emu at 70~kOe, vastly increasing the precision and
the credibility of the results of the standard integral SQUID magnetometry in
high magnetic fields. The magnetic characteristics of the trilayers structures
established here prove identical with the already known properties of the thick
(Ga,Mn)N single layers, namely (i) the low temperature ferromagnetism among
Mn$^{3+}$ ions driven by superexchange and (ii) purely paramagnetic response at
higher temperatures. The possible cause of the lack of any effects brought
about by the adjacent Mg-doping is a presence of residual Mn in the cladding
layers, resulting in the deactivation of the p-type doping intended there. This
finding points out that a more intensive technological effort has to be exerted
to promote the co-doping-driven carrier-mediated ferromagnetic coupling in
Mn-enriched GaN, especially at elevated temperatures.

randomly-crosslinked polymer networks play an important role in many different
fields, ranging from cellular biology to industrial processes. In order to
elucidate how these properties are controlled by the physical details of the
network (\textit{e.g.} chain-length and end-to-end distributions), we generate
disordered phantom networks with different crosslinker concentrations $C$ and
initial density $\rho_{\rm init}$ and evaluate their elastic properties. We
find that the shear modulus computed at the same strand concentration for
networks with the same $C$, which determines the number of chains and the
chain-length distribution, depends strongly on the preparation protocol of the
network, here controlled by $\rho_{\rm init}$. We rationalise this dependence
by employing a generic stress-strain relation for polymer networks that does
not rely on the specific form of the polymer end-to-end distance distribution.
We find that the shear modulus of the networks is a non-monotonic function of
the density of elastically-active strands, and that this behaviour has a purely
entropic origin. Our results show that if short chains are abundant, as it is
always the case for randomly-crosslinked polymer networks, the knowledge of the
exact chain conformation distribution is essential for predicting correctly the
elastic properties. Finally, we apply our theoretical approach to published

flourished across many scientific disciplines, the complexities these models
generate are often difficult to manage and quantify. This research reduces
population-driven, spatial modeling of individuals to the simplest
configurations and parameters: an equal resource opportunity landscape with
equally capable individuals; and asks the question, ""Will valid complex
population and inequality dynamics emerge from this simple economic model?"" Two
foraging economies are modeled: subsistence and surplus. The resulting,
emergent population dynamics are characterized by their sensitivities to agent
and landscape parameters. The various steady and oscillating regimes of
single-species population dynamics are generated by appropriate selection of
model growth parameters. These emergent dynamics are shown to be consistent
with the equation-based, continuum modeling of single-species populations in
biology and ecology. The intrinsic growth rates, carry capacities, and delay
parameters of these models are implied for these simple economies. Aggregate
measures of individual distributions are used to understand the sensitivities
to model parameters. New local measures are defined to describe complex
behaviors driven by spatial effects, especially extinctions. This simple
economic model is shown to generate significantly complex population and
inequality dynamics. Model parameters generating the intrinsic growth rate have
strong effects on these dynamics, including large variations in inequality.
Significant inequality effects are shown to be caused by birth costs above and
beyond their contribution to the intrinsic growth rate. The highest levels of
inequality are found during the initial non-equilibrium period and are driven
by factors different than those driving steady state inequality.

recognizing traffic categories related to different data packets transmitted on

to enhance user experience. As internet traffic becomes increasingly encrypted,
the mainstream classic traffic recognition technique, payload inspection, is
rendered ineffective. This paper uses machine learning techniques for encrypted
traffic classification, looking only at packet size and time of arrival.
Spiking neural networks (SNN), largely inspired by how biological neurons
operate, were used for two reasons. Firstly, they are able to recognize
time-related data packet features. Secondly, they can be implemented
efficiently on neuromorphic hardware with a low energy footprint. Here we used
a very simple feedforward SNN, with only one fully-connected hidden layer, and
trained in a supervised manner using the newly introduced method known as
Surrogate Gradient Learning. Surprisingly, such a simple SNN reached an
accuracy of 95.9% on ISCX datasets, outperforming previous approaches. Besides
better accuracy, there is also a very significant improvement on simplicity:
input size, number of neurons, trainable parameters are all reduced by one to
four orders of magnitude. Next, we analyzed the reasons for this good accuracy.
It turns out that, beyond spatial (i.e. packet size) features, the SNN also
exploits temporal ones, mostly the nearly synchronous (within a 200ms range)
arrival times of packets with certain sizes. Taken together, these results show
that SNNs are an excellent fit for encrypted internet traffic classification:
they can be more accurate than conventional artificial neural networks (ANN),
and they could be implemented efficiently on low power embedded systems.

First, they need to be able to make

tasks at meta-test time again by using only a small amount of training data
from that task. It is the second objective where meta-learning models fail for
non-mutually exclusive tasks due to task overfitting. Given that guaranteeing
mutually exclusive tasks is often difficult, there is a significant need for
regularization methods that can help reduce the impact of task-memorization in
meta-learning. For example, in the case of N-way, K-shot classification
problems, tasks becomes non-mutually exclusive when the labels associated with
each task is fixed. Under this design, the model will simply memorize the class
labels of all the training tasks, and thus will fail to recognize a new task
(class) at meta-test time. A direct observable consequence of this memorization
is that the meta-learning model simply ignores the task-specific training data
in favor of directly classifying based on the test-data input. In our work, we
propose a regularization technique for meta-learning models that gives the
model designer more control over the information flow during meta-training. Our
method consists of a regularization function that is constructed by maximizing
the distance between task-summary statistics, in the case of black-box models
and task specific network parameters in the case of optimization based models
during meta-training. Our proposed regularization function shows an accuracy
boost of $\sim$ $36\%$ on the Omniglot dataset for 5-way, 1-shot classification

represent a pathway to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Using
density functional theory based systematic screening and investigation of
thermodynamic, magnetic and topological properties of heterostructures, we
demonstrate that forming a type-I heterostructure between a wide gap
antiferromagnetic insulator Cr$_2$O$_3$ and a TI-film, such as Sb$_2$Te$_3$,
can lead to pinning of the Fermi-level at the center of the gap, even when
magnetically doped. Cr-doping in the heterostructure increases the gap to
$\sim$ 64.5 meV, with a large Zeeman energy from the interfacial Cr dopants,
thus overcoming potential metallicity due to band bending effects. By fitting
the band-structure around the Fermi-level to a 4-band k.p model Hamiltonian, we
show that Cr doped Sb$_2$Te$_3$/Cr$_2$O$_3$ is a Chern insulator with a Chern
number C = -1. Transport calculations further show chiral edge-modes localized
at the top/bottom of the TI-film to be the dominant current carriers in the
material. Our predictions of a large interfacial magnetism due to Cr-dopants,
that coupled antiferromagnetically to the AFM substrate is confirmed by our
polarised neutron reflectometry measurements on MBE grown Cr doped
Sb$_2$Te$_3$/Cr$_2$O$_3$ heterostructures, and is consistent with a positive
exchange bias measured in such systems recently. Consequently, Cr doped
Sb$_2$Te$_3$/Cr$_2$O$_3$ heterostructure represents a promising platform for
the development of functional topological magnetic devices, with high

have a readily apparent source and should be rapidly photochemically destroyed

the reported PH$_3$ spectral line at 266.94 GHz is nearly co-located with an
SO$_2$ spectral line, the non-detection of stronger SO$_2$ lines in the
wideband ALMA data is used to rule out SO$_2$ as the origin of the feature. We
present a reassessment of wideband and narrowband datasets derived from these
ALMA observations. The ALMA observations are re-reduced following both the
initial and revised calibration procedures discussed by the authors of the
original study. We also investigate the phenomenon of apparent spectral line
dilution over varying spatial scales resulting from the ALMA antenna
configuration. A 266.94 GHz spectral feature is apparent in the narrowband data
using the initial calibration procedures, but this same feature can not be
identified following calibration revisions. The feature is also not reproduced
in the wideband data. While the SO$_2$ spectral line is not observed at 257.54

two-phase modeling are investigated: (i) drop in a shear flow, (ii) oscillating
drop and (iii) rising bubble. Data of the interface position over time is
generated by numerical simulation. An effective way to distribute spatial

Oxford, 3rd-4th July 2006",,,,"cs.NE math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Traditional methods present a very restrictive range of applications, mainly
limited by the features of the function to be optimized and of the constraint
functions. In contrast, evolutionary algorithms present almost no restriction
to the features of these functions, although the most appropriate
constraint-handling technique is still an open question. The particle swarm
optimization (PSO) method is sometimes viewed as another evolutionary algorithm
because of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the same
metaphor. Namely, they evolve a population of individuals taking into
consideration previous experiences and using stochastic operators to introduce
new responses. The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to
traditional methods have been greatly discussed in the literature for decades.
While all such advantages are valid when comparing the PSO paradigm to
traditional methods, its main advantages with respect to evolutionary
algorithms consist of its noticeably lower computational cost and easier
implementation. In fact, the plain version can be programmed in a few lines of
code, involving no operator design and few parameters to be tuned. This paper
deals with three important aspects of the method: the influence of the
parameters' tuning on the behaviour of the system; the design of stopping
criteria so that the reliability of the solution found can be somehow estimated
and computational cost can be saved; and the development of appropriate
techniques to handle constraints, given that the original method is designed
for unconstrained optimization problems.

spectrally active near 266.94 GHz, the contribution to this line from SO$_2$
must be determined before it can be attributed, in whole or part, to PH$_3$. An
undetected SO$_2$ reference line, interpreted as an unexpectedly low SO$_2$
abundance, suggested that the 266.94 GHz feature could be attributed primarily
to PH$_3$. However, the low SO$_2$ and the inference that PH$_3$ was in the
cloud deck posed an apparent contradiction. Here we use a radiative transfer
model to analyze the PH$_3$ discovery, and explore the detectability of
different vertical distributions of PH$_3$ and SO$_2$. We find that the 266.94
GHz line does not originate in the clouds, but above 80 km in the Venus
mesosphere. This level of line formation is inconsistent with chemical modeling
that assumes generation of PH$_3$ in the Venus clouds. Given the extremely
short chemical lifetime of PH$_3$ in the Venus mesosphere, an implausibly high
source flux would be needed to maintain the observed value of 20$\pm$10 ppb. We
find that typical Venus SO$_2$ vertical distributions and abundances fit the
JCMT 266.94 GHz feature, and the resulting SO$_2$ reference line at 267.54 GHz
would have remained undetectable in the ALMA data due to line dilution. We
conclude that nominal mesospheric SO$_2$ is a more plausible explanation for
the JCMT and ALMA data than PH$_3$.

evolution of the coarse-scales from the fine-scales. VMS modeling requires the
approximation of the impact of the fine scales in terms of the coarse scales.
In linear problems, our formulation reduces the problem of learning the
sub-scales to learning the projected element Green's function basis
coefficients. For the purpose of this approximation, a special neural-network
structure - the variational super-resolution N-N (VSRNN) - is proposed. The
VSRNN constructs a super-resolved model of the unresolved scales as a sum of
the products of individual functions of coarse scales and physics-informed
parameters. Combined with a set of locally non-dimensional features obtained by
normalizing the input coarse-scale and output sub-scale basis coefficients, the
VSRNN provides a general framework for the discovery of closures for both the
continuous and the discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. By training this
model on a sequence of $L_2-$projected data and using the subscale to compute
the continuous Galerkin subgrid terms, and the super-resolved state to compute
the discontinuous Galerkin fluxes, we improve the optimality and the accuracy
of these methods for the convection-diffusion problem, linear advection and
turbulent channel flow. Finally, we demonstrate that - in the investigated
examples - the present model allows generalization to out-of-sample initial
conditions and Reynolds numbers. Perspectives are provided on data-driven
closure modeling, limitations of the present approach, and opportunities for
improvement.

relation of samples only models the sample-to-sample relation, while neglects
the specificity of different tasks. That is, this method of measuring relation
does not take the task-level information into account. To this end, we propose
a new relation measure method, namely the task-level relation module (TLRM), to
explicitly model the task-level relation of one sample to all the others. The

We studied the photometric properties of AGB stars and compared them to
theoretical models derived from synthetic spectra analysis. We observe the
following features: i) the spread of AGB stars in photometric indices sensitive
to variations of light-elements and helium is typically larger than that
expected from photometric errors; ii) the fraction of metal-enhanced stars in
the AGB is lower than in the RGB in most of the type II GCs; iii) the fraction

pre-processed single-channel ICAs and generated the probability map of vessels;
(ii) during the Stage II, a three-channel image consisting of the original

Therefore, the performance of a trained model partially depends on how its
decision boundaries are extended outside the convex hull of its training data.
From this perspective which is not studied before, over-parameterization of
deep learning models may be considered a necessity for shaping the extension of
decision boundaries. At the same time, over-parameterization should be
accompanied by a specific training regime, in order to yield a model that not
only fits the training set, but also its decision boundaries extend desirably

the entire galaxy field. Using mock galaxies, we demonstrate that combining a
series of cross-correlation functions (CCFs) offers improvements over the 2PCF
as follows: 1. The distribution of peculiar velocities in each split density is
nearly Gaussian. This allows the Gaussian streaming model for RSD to perform
accurately within the statistical errors of a ($1.5\,h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$ volume for
almost all scales and all split densities. 2. The PDF of the density field at
small scales is non-Gaussian, but the CCFs of split densities capture the
non-Gaussianity, leading to improved cosmological constraints over the 2PCF. We
can obtain unbiased constraints on the growth parameter $f\sigma_{12}$ at the
per-cent level, and Alcock-Paczynski (AP) parameters at the sub-per-cent level
with the minimal scale of $15\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. This is a $\sim$30 per cent
and $\sim$6 times improvement over the 2PCF, respectively. The diverse and
steep slopes of the CCFs at small scales are likely to be responsible for the
improved constraints of AP parameters. 3. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)
are contained in all CCFs of split densities. Including BAO scales helps to
break the degeneracy between the line-of-sight and transverse AP parameters,
allowing independent constraints on them. We discuss and compare models for RSD
around spherical densities.

randomized experiments, including those that arise in solving multi-armed
bandit problems. In an experiment with $n$ time steps, we let the mean reward
gaps between actions scale to the order $1/\sqrt{n}$ so as to preserve the
difficulty of the learning task as $n$ grows. In this regime, we show that the
sample paths of a class of sequentially randomized experiments -- adapted to
this scaling regime and with arm selection probabilities that vary continuously
with state -- converge weakly to a diffusion limit, given as the solution to a
stochastic differential equation. The diffusion limit enables us to derive
refined, instance-specific characterization of stochastic dynamics, and to
obtain several insights on the regret and belief evolution of a number of
sequential experiments including Thompson sampling (but not UCB, which does not
satisfy our continuity assumption). We show that all sequential experiments
whose randomization probabilities have a Lipschitz-continuous dependence on the
observed data suffer from sub-optimal regret performance when the reward gaps
are relatively large. Conversely, we find that a version of Thompson sampling
with an asymptotically uninformative prior variance achieves near-optimal
instance-specific regret scaling, including with large reward gaps, but these
good regret properties come at the cost of highly unstable posterior beliefs.

ultrafast aggregation of distributed data. However, its performance cannot be
guaranteed in long-distance transmission due to the distortion induced by the
channel fading and noise. To unleash the full potential of AirComp, this paper
proposes to use a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acting as a mobile
base station to assist AirComp systems. Specifically, due to its controllable
high-mobility and high-altitude, the UAV can move sufficiently close to the
sensors to enable line-of-sight transmission and adaptively adjust all the
links' distances, thereby enhancing the signal magnitude alignment and noise
suppression. Our goal is to minimize the time-averaging mean-square error for
AirComp by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, the scaling factor at the
UAV, and the transmit power at the sensors, under constraints on the UAV's
predetermined locations and flying speed, sensors' average and peak power
limits. However, due to the highly coupled optimization variables and
time-dependent constraints, the resulting problem is non-convex and
challenging. We thus propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the
block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques.
Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithm and
demonstrate the performance gains and robustness of the proposed design
compared with benchmarks.

that is encouraged to accurately describe the novel object labels. This is
achieved via a specialised reward function in the SCST reinforcement learning
framework (Rennie et al., 2017) that encourages novel object mentions while
maintaining the caption quality. We further restrict the SCST training to the
images where detected objects are mentioned in reference captions to train the
ECOL-R model. We additionally improve our copy mechanism via Abstract Labels,
which transfer knowledge from known to novel object types, and a Morphological
Selector, which determines the appropriate inflected forms of novel object
labels. The resulting model sets new state-of-the-art on the nocaps (Agrawal et

to perform denoising and demosaicking jointly. However, most existing CNN-based
joint denoising and demosaicking (JDD) methods work on a single image while
assuming additive white Gaussian noise, which limits their performance on
real-world applications. In this work, we study the JDD problem for real-world
burst images, namely JDD-B. Considering the fact that the green channel has
twice the sampling rate and better quality than the red and blue channels in
CFA raw data, we propose to use this green channel prior (GCP) to build a
GCP-Net for the JDD-B task. In GCP-Net, the GCP features extracted from green
channels are utilized to guide the feature extraction and feature upsampling of
the whole image. To compensate for the shift between frames, the offset is also
estimated from GCP features to reduce the impact of noise. Our GCP-Net can
preserve more image structures and details than other JDD methods while
removing noise. Experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy images
demonstrate the effectiveness of GCP-Net quantitatively and qualitatively.

correlation. Meanwhile, recent years have witnessed the rapid development of
full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method to tackle
electron correlation. In this study, we carry out FCIQMC simulations to ScO,
TiO and VO molecules and obtain accurate descriptions of 13 low-lying
electronic states (ScO $^2\Sigma^+$, $^2\Delta$, $^2\Pi$; TiO $^3\Delta$,
$^1\Delta$, $^1\Sigma^+$, $^3\Pi$, $^3\Phi$; VO $^4\Sigma^-$, $^4\Phi$,
$^4\Pi$, $^2\Gamma$, $^2\Delta$), including states that have significant
multi-configurational character. The FCIQMC results are used to assess the
performance of several other wave function theory and density functional theory
methods. Our study highlights the challenging nature of electronic structure of
transition metal oxides and demonstrates FCIQMC as a promising technique going
forward to treat more complex transition metal oxide molecules and materials.

we prove that, with Gaussian kernel, one can set the kernel bandwidth parameter

such TSO-DSO coordination include the combinatorial nature of the operational

increase the complexity even under the deterministic setting. In this paper, a
deterministic TSO-DSO operational planning coordination problem is considered

new method, the problem is decomposed into TSO and DSO subproblems, which are
efficiently coordinated by updating Lagrangian multipliers. The nonlinearities
at the TSO level caused by AC power flow constraints are resolved through a
dynamic linearization while guaranteeing feasibility through ""$l_1$-proximal""

intrusion attacks on networks of such IoT devices. Existing NN training
solutions in this domain either ignore privacy considerations or assume that
the privacy requirements are homogeneous across all users. We show that the

non-identical clients and heterogeneous privacy requirements. We propose two
novel continual-learning based DP training methods that are designed to improve

ours is the first system that employs a continual learning-based approach to
handle heterogeneity in client privacy requirements. We evaluate our approach
on real datasets and show that our techniques outperform the baselines. We also
show that our methods are robust to hyperparameter changes. Lastly, we show
that one of our proposed methods can easily adapt to post-hoc relaxations of

includes a set of parallel detectors, which are designed based on the

identify the attacked actuator(s). For what regards the control unit, a
constrained optimization approach is developed to determine the control input

irreversibility of the 2D trajectory was likewise discussed by decomposing its
entropy into additive and non-additive parts. We numerically verified the

situation where conventional methods using either the usual centralized model
predictive control (MPC), or even the distributed counterpart, would suffer
from substantial difficulty in balancing optimality and computational
efficiency. Additionally, the non-convex characteristics that invariably arise
in such collision-free control and optimization problems render it difficult to
effectively derive a reliable solution (and also to thoroughly analyze the
associated convergence properties). To overcome these challenging issues, this
work establishes a suitably novel parallel computation framework through an
innovative mathematical problem formulation; and then with this framework and
formulation, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm
is presented to solve the sub-problems arising from the resulting parallel

developed to accelerate the optimization process, and the optimum is thus
determined with significantly improved computational efficiency. As supported

continuous image acquired from a fixed camera. Recent deep learning methods
based on supervised learning show superior performance compared to classical
background subtraction algorithms. However, there is still a room for
improvement in static foreground, dynamic background, hard shadow, illumination
changes, camouflage, etc. In addition, most of the deep learning-based methods
operates well on environments similar to training. If the testing environments
are different from training ones, their performance degrades. As a result,
additional training on those operating environments is required to ensure a
good performance. Our previous work which uses spatio-temporal input data
consisted of a number of past images, background images and current image
showed promising results in different environments from training, although it
uses a simple U-NET structure. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation
technique suitable for visual surveillance for additional performance
improvement using the same network used in our previous work. In deep learning,
most data augmentation techniques deal with spatial-level data augmentation
techniques for use in image classification and object detection. In this paper,
we propose a new method of data augmentation in the spatio-temporal dimension
suitable for our previous work. Two data augmentation methods of adjusting
background model images and past images are proposed. Through this, it is shown
that performance can be improved in difficult areas such as static foreground
and ghost objects, compared to previous studies. Through quantitative and
qualitative evaluation using SBI, LASIESTA, and our own dataset, we show that
it gives superior performance compared to deep learning-based algorithms and
background subtraction algorithms.

widely used in large scale face recognition(FR) recently. Existing methods have
achieved good performance on many FR benchmarks. However, most of them suffer
from two major problems. First, these methods converge quite slowly since they
optimize the loss functions in a high-dimensional and sparse Gaussian Sphere.
Second, the high dimensionality of features, despite the powerful descriptive
ability, brings difficulty to the optimization, which may lead to a sub-optimal
local optimum. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet efficient
training mechanism called MultiFace, where we approximate the original
high-dimensional features by the ensemble of low-dimensional features. The
proposed mechanism is also generic and can be easily applied to many advanced
FR models. Moreover, it brings the benefits of good interpretability to FR
models via the clustering effect. In detail, the ensemble of these
low-dimensional features can capture complementary yet discriminative
information, which can increase the intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can
accelerate 2-3 times with the softmax loss and 1.2-1.5 times with Arcface or
Cosface, while achieving state-of-the-art performances in several benchmark
datasets. Especially, the significant improvements on large-scale
datasets(e.g., IJB and MageFace) demonstrate the flexibility of our new
training mechanism.

the brightest and most massive dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellite of the
Andromeda galaxy (M 31). Although M 31 is surrounded by several dSph companions
with old stellar populations and low metallicity, it has a metal-rich stellar
halo with an age of 6$-$8 Gyr. This indicates that any evolutionary association
between the stellar halo of M 31 and its dSph system is frail. Therefore, the
question is whether And VII (a high-metallicity dSph located $\sim$220 kpc from
M 31), can be associated with M 31's young, metal-rich halo. Here, we perform
the first reconstruction of the SFH of And VII employing long-period variable
(LPV) stars. As the most-evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red
supergiant (RSG) stars, the birth mass of LPVs can be determined by connecting
their near-infrared photometry to theoretical evolutionary tracks. We found 55
LPV candidates within two half-light radii, using multi-epoch imaging with the
Isaac Newton Telescope in the $i$ and $V$ bands. Based on their birth mass
function, the star-formation rate (SFR) of And VII was obtained as a function
of cosmic time. The main epoch of star formation occurred $\simeq 6.2$ Gyr ago
with a SFR of $0.006\pm0.002$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Over the past 6 Gyr, we find
slow star formation, which continued until 500 Myr ago with a SFR
$\sim0.0005\pm0.0002$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We determined And VII's stellar mass
$M=(13.3\pm5.3)\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ within a half-light radius

exotic structural property of metamateirals rather than electrostatic

biomedical knowledge hidden to be mined such as drug interactions. However, it
is difficult to extract the heterogeneous knowledge to retrieve or even
discover the latest and novel knowledge in an efficient manner. To address such
a problem, we propose EGFI for extracting and consolidating drug interactions
from large-scale medical literature text data. Specifically, EGFI consists of
two parts: classification and generation. In the classification part, EGFI
encompasses the language model BioBERT which has been comprehensively
pre-trained on biomedical corpus. In particular, we propose the multi-head
attention mechanism and pack BiGRU to fuse multiple semantic information for
rigorous context modeling. In the generation part, EGFI utilizes another
pre-trained language model BioGPT-2 where the generation sentences are selected
based on filtering rules. We evaluated the classification part on ""DDIs 2013""
dataset and ""DTIs"" dataset, achieving the FI score of 0.842 and 0.720
respectively. Moreover, we applied the classification part to distinguish
high-quality generated sentences and verified with the exiting growth truth to
confirm the filtered sentences. The generated sentences that are not recorded
in DrugBank and DDIs 2013 dataset also demonstrate the potential of EGFI to
identify novel drug relationships.

computer-aided diagnosis system, it is essential to not only classify diseases
but also present the locations of the diseases. However, collecting
instance-level annotations for various thoracic diseases is expensive.
Therefore, weakly supervised localization methods have been proposed that use
only image-level annotation. While the previous methods presented the disease
location as the most discriminative part for classification, this causes a deep
network to localize wrong areas for indistinguishable X-ray images. To solve
this issue, we propose a spatial attention method using disease masks that
describe the areas where diseases mainly occur. We then apply the spatial
attention to find the precise disease area by highlighting the highest
probability of disease occurrence. Meanwhile, the various sizes, rotations and
noise in chest X-ray images make generating the disease masks challenging. To
reduce the variation among images, we employ an alignment module to transform
an input X-ray image into a generalized image. Through extensive experiments on
the NIH-Chest X-ray dataset with eight kinds of diseases, we show that the
proposed method results in superior localization performances compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

matter power. In this paper, we explore the redshift evolution of the
observable effective optical depth $\tau_{\rm eff} (z)$ from the Lyman-$\alpha$
data as a discriminator between dark matter models that differ from the
$\Lambda$CDM model on small scales. We consider the thermal warm dark matter
(WDM) and the ultra-light axion (ULA) models for the following set of
parameters: the mass of ULA, $m_a \simeq 10^{-24}\hbox{--}5 \times 10^{-22} \,
\rm eV$ and WDM mass, $m_{\rm wdm} = 0.1 \hbox{--} 4.6 \, \rm keV$. We simulate
the line-of-sight HI density and velocity fields using semi-analytic methods.
The simulated effective optical depth for the alternative dark matter models
diverges from the $\Lambda$CDM model for $z \gtrsim 3$, which provides a
meaningful probe of the matter power at small scales. Using likelihood
analysis, we compare the simulated data with the high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$
forest data in the redshift range $2 < z < 4.2$. The analysis yields the
following 1$\sigma$ bounds on dark matter masses: $m_{\rm wdm} > 0.7\, {\rm

efficacy of our proposed method, we simulate synthetic data sets compatible
with the $\Lambda$CDM model in the redshift range $2 \leq z \leq 6.5$ and
compare with theory. The 1$\sigma$ bounds obtained are significantly tighter:
$m_{\rm wdm} > 1.5 \, {\rm keV}$ and $m_{\rm a} > 7 \times 10^{-23} \, {\rm

$P(G,\Pi,k)$ has been proved to be NP-complete by Lewis and Yannakakis. The
parameterized complexity of this problem is shown to be W[1]-complete by Khot

vice versa; and is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), otherwise. As the problem
is W[1]-complete on general graphs when $\Pi$ includes all trivial graphs but
not all complete graphs and vice versa, it is natural to further investigate
the problem on restricted graph classes.
  Motivated by this line of research, we study the problem on graphs which also
belong to a hereditary graph class and establish a framework which settles the
parameterized complexity of the problem for various hereditary graph classes.
In particular, we show that:
  $P(G,\Pi,k)$ is solvable in polynomial time when the graph $G$ is
co-bipartite and $\Pi$ is the property of being planar, bipartite or
triangle-free (or vice-versa).

However, the effects of varying IT in conjunction with respiratory rate (RR) on
airway flow remain unknown. Using 3D numerical simulations of oscillatory flow
through an idealized airway model consisting of a mouth inlet, glottis, trachea
and symmetric double bifurcation at trachea Reynolds number ($Re$) of 4,200, we
investigated how varying the ratio of IT to breathing time (BT) from 25% to 50%
and RR from 10 breaths per minute (bpm) corresponding to Womersley number
($Wo$) of 2.37 to 1,000 bpm ($Wo$=23.7) impacts airway flow characteristics.
Irrespective of IT/BT, axial flow during inhalation at tracheal cross-sections
was non-uniform for $Wo$=2.37 as compared to centrally concentrated
distribution for $Wo$=23.7. For a given $Wo$ and IT/BT, both axial and
secondary (lateral) flow components unevenly split between left and right
branches of a bifurcation. Irrespective of $Wo$, IT/BT and airway generation,
lateral dispersion was stronger than axial flow streaming. Despite left-right
symmetry of the lower airway in our model, the right-sided mouth-to-glottis
portion generated turbulence in the upper airway. Varying IT/BT for a given
$Wo$ did not noticeably change flow characteristics. Discrepancy in the
oscillatory flow relation $Re$/$Wo^2$=2$L$/$D$ ($L$=stroke length; $D$=trachea
diameter) was observed for IT/BT$\neq$50%, as $L$ changed with IT/BT. We
developed a modified dimensionless stroke length term including IT/BT. While
viscous forces and convective acceleration were dominant for lower $Wo$,
unsteady acceleration was dominant for higher $Wo$.

reason for energy-level shifts. We also demonstrate that the VB- defects still
exist stably at least at 600 K. Moreover, we propose a scheme for detecting
laser intensity using the VB- defects in hBN nanopowders, which is based on the

the evolution of the propulsion force with propelled particle displacement,
both in the quasistatic flow regime. By mapping shear stress and shear rate to

brightening, which are likely signatures of tether-cutting reconnection that
builds the flux rope near the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the inner
bipolar region. In the next stage, with the onset of M8.7 flare, there is a
substantial enhancement in the brightening of circular ribbon which essentially
suggests an increase in the rate of ongoing null-point reconnection. Finally,
the eruption of underlying flux rope triggers ``standard flare reconnection""

the response of the mean square particle displacement to the increase of

the normal modes of vibration of the zero-temperature solids. We find that, in

indicating the criticality of the jamming transition. The scaling collapse
suggests a diverging length scale and marginal instability at the jamming

a cavity-magnomechanical system. It comprises of two microwave cavities, a
magnon mode and a vibrational mode, and the last two elements come from a YIG
sphere trapped in the second cavity. The two microwave cavities are connected
by a superconducting transmission line, resulting in a linear coupling between
them. The magnon mode is driven by a strong microwave field and coupled to
cavity photons via magnetic dipole interaction, and at the same time interacts
with phonons via magnetostrictive interaction. By breaking symmetry of the

frictionless particles corresponds to the rigidity percolation. When the range
of attraction is long, the distribution of the size of rigid clusters, $P(s)$,
is continuous and shows a power-law decay. For systems with short-range
attractions, however, $P(s)$ appears discontinuous. There is a power-law decay
for small cluster sizes, followed by a low probability gap and a peak near the
system size. We find that this appearing ``discontinuity'' does not mean that
the transition is discontinuous. In fact, it signifies the coexistence of two
distinct length scales, associated with the largest cluster and smaller ones,
respectively. The comparison between the largest and second largest clusters
indicates that their growth rates with system size are rather different.
However, both cluster sizes tend to diverge in the large system size limit,
suggesting that the jamming transition of systems with short-range attractions
is still continuous. In the framework of the two-scale scenario, we also derive
a generalized hyperscaling relation. With robust evidence, our work challenges
the former single-scale view of the rigidity percolation.

1/r 12 of the scalar part of the effective two-electron potential reproduces
the long-range interaction of the range-separated density functional theory.
The resulting correlation factor exactly imposes the cusp and is tuned by a
unique parameter $\mu$ which controls both the depth of the coulomb hole and
its typical range in r 12. The transcorrelated Hamiltonian obtained with such a
new correlation factor has a straightforward analytical expression depending on
the same parameter $\mu$, and its physical contents continuously change by
varying $\mu$ : one can change from a non divergent repulsive Hamiltonian at
large $\mu$ to a purely attractive one at small $\mu$. We investigate the

skyrmionics enable the possibility of compact, high density,
ultrafast,all-electronic, low-energy devices, which is the basis for the
emerging area of skyrmionics. The topological winding of skyrmion spins affects
their overall lifetime, energetics and dynamical behavior. In this review, we
discuss skyrmionics in the context of the present day solid state memory
landscape, and show how their size, stability and mobility can be controlled by
material engineering, as well as how they can be nucleated and detected.
Ferrimagnetsnear their compensation points are important candidates for this
application, leading to detailed exploration of amorphous CoGd as well as the
study of emergent materials such as Mn$_4$N and Inverse Heusler alloys. Along
with material properties, geometrical parameters such as film thickness, defect
density and notches can be used to tune skyrmion properties, such as their size
and stability. Topology, however, can be a double-edged sword, especially for
isolated metastable skyrmions, as it brings stability at the cost of additional
damping and deflective Magnus forces compared to domain walls. Skyrmion
deformation in response to forces also makes them intrinsically slower than
domain walls. We explore potential analog applications of skyrmions, including
temporal memory at low density, and decorrelator for stochastic computing at a
higher density that capitalizes on their interactions. We summarize the main
challenges to achieve a skyrmionics technology, including maintaining
positional stability with very high accuracy, electrical readout, especially
for small ferrimagnetic skyrmions, deterministic nucleation and annihilation,

signal-dependent graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) can efficiently promote
piecewise constant (PWC) signal reconstruction for various image restoration
tasks. However, for planar image patches, like total variation (TV), GLR may
suffer from the well-known ""staircase"" effect. To remedy this problem, we
generalize GLR to gradient graph Laplacian regularizer (GGLR) that provably
promotes piecewise planar (PWP) signal reconstruction for the image
interpolation problem -- a 2D grid with random missing pixels that requires
completion. Specifically, we first construct two higher-order gradient graphs
to connect local horizontal and vertical gradients. Each local gradient is
estimated using structure tensor, which is robust using known pixels in a small
neighborhood, mitigating the problem of larger noise variance when computing
gradient of gradients. Moreover, unlike total generalized variation (TGV), GGLR
retains the quadratic form of GLR, leading to an unconstrained quadratic
programming (QP) problem per iteration that can be solved quickly using
conjugate gradient (CG). We derive the means-square-error minimizing weight
parameter for GGLR, trading off bias and variance of the signal estimate.
Experiments show that GGLR outperformed competing schemes in interpolation
quality for severely damaged images at a reduced complexity.

are vulnerable to antenna element blockages and failures, which necessitate
diagnostic techniques to locate faulty antenna elements for calibration

diagnosis problem as a joint sparse recovery problem. Then, the atomic norm is
introduced to induce the sparsity of mmWave channel over continuous Fourier

phenomenon of matter-wave diffraction-in-time. Subsequently, results of a
trailblazing experiment, to be superseded by a Hanbury Brown-Twiss type
conclusive test of free fermion antibunching with electrons, is reported. In
this experiment, the statistical distribution of the emitted electrons is
studied taking advantage of a double-detector coincidence detection technique.
The utilized electron emitters are ultrafast photoemission tungsten nanotip

emission statistics is found to be sub-Poissonian. The second project involves
introduction and full characterization of a novel laser-driven electron nanotip

their non-trivial state. Their unique properties might be originated from the
odd number of Kramers doublets in PAHs. The H\""uckel rule describing
aromaticity can be reinterpreted with a topological viewpoint. It suggests that
the (4n+2) rule can be split into two pairs of (2n+1) electrons each, namely,
electrons and holes with spin up and down. Therefore, it always forms an odd
number of Kramers` doublet. Moreover, n in the H\""uckel rule can be interpreted
as the winding number in global next-nearest-neighbor(NNN) hopping. This work

adopting higher memories results in improved SC code performance, obtaining

or more separate components, while bredges are edges whose removal would split
the network component on which they are located into two separate components.
Both articulation points and bredges play an important role in processes of
network dismantling and it is therefore useful to know the evolution of the
probability of nodes or edges to be articulation points and bredges,
respectively, when a fraction of edges is randomly removed from the network in
a percolation process. Due to the heterogeneity of the network, the probability

maximum mean discrepancy (joint maximum mean discrepancy, JMMD) will involve
complex tensor-product operator that is hard to manipulate. To solve this
issue, this paper theoretically derives a unified form of JMMD that is easy to

conditional probability distribution distances are our special cases with
different label kernels, among which the weighted class conditional one not
only can realize feature alignment across domains in the category level, but
also deal with imbalance dataset using the class prior probabilities. From the
revealed unified JMMD, we illustrate that JMMD degrades the feature-label
dependence (discriminability) that benefits to classification, and it is
sensitive to the label distribution shift when the label kernel is the weighted
class conditional one. Therefore, we leverage Hilbert Schmidt independence
criterion and propose a novel MMD matrix to promote the dependence, and devise
a novel label kernel that is robust to label distribution shift. Finally, we
conduct extensive experiments on several cross-domain datasets to demonstrate
the validity and effectiveness of the revealed theoretical results.

in different disciplines. These frameworks are implemented and adapted into a
Commercial software, 'LiverVision'. It is aimed to reveal the most effective
and accurate DL architecture for fully automatic liver segmentation. Equal
conditions were provided to all architectures in the experiments so as to
measure the effectiveness of algorithms accuracy, and Dice coefficient metrics
were also employed to support comparative analysis. Experimental results prove
that 'U-Net' and 'SegNet' have been superior in line with the experiments
conducted considering the concepts of time, cost, and effectiveness.
Considering both architectures, 'SegNet' was observed to be more successful in
eliminating false-positive values. Besides, it was seen that the accuracy
metric used to measure effectiveness in image segmentation alone was not
enough. Results reveal that DL algorithms are able to automate organ
segmentation from DICOM images with high accuracy. This contribution is
critical for surgical preplanning and motivates author to apply this approach
to the different organs and field of medicine.

first time, X-ray pulsations with the pulsar spin period of the point-like
source coinciding by position with the pulsar. This confirms the pulsar nature
of the source. In the 0.15--0.5 keV band, there is a single pulse per period
and the pulsed fraction is $\approx18\pm6$ per cent. In this band, the pulsar
spectrum is dominated by a thermal emission component that likely comes from
the entire surface of the neutron star, while at higher energies ($\gtrsim0.7$
keV) it is described by a power law with the photon index $\Gamma \approx 1.6$.
We construct new hydrogen atmosphere models for neutron stars with dipole
magnetic fields and non-uniform surface temperature distributions with
relatively low effective temperatures. We use them in the spectral analysis and
derive the pulsar average effective temperature of $\approx(2-3)\times10^5$ K.
This makes J1957+5033 the coldest among all known thermally emitting neutron
stars with ages below 1 Myr. Using the interstellar extinction--distance
relation, we constrain the distance to the pulsar in the range of 0.1--1 kpc.
We compare the obtained X-ray thermal luminosity with those for other neutron
stars and various neutron star cooling models and set some constraints on
latter. We observe a faint trail-like feature, elongated $\sim 8$ arcmin from
J1957+5033. Its spectrum can be described by a power law with a photon index
$\Gamma=1.9\pm0.5$ suggesting that it is likely a pulsar wind nebula powered by

applications of image analysis, one of the main challenges still open is the
training of a CNN on high resolution images. Different strategies have been
proposed involving either a rescaling of the image or an individual processing
of parts of the image. Such strategies cannot be applied to images, such as
gigapixel histopathological images, for which a high reduction in resolution
inherently effects a loss of discriminative information, and in respect of
which the analysis of single parts of the image suffers from a lack of global
information or implies a high workload in terms of annotating the training
images in such a way as to select significant parts. We propose a method for
the analysis of gigapixel histopathological images solely by using weak
image-level labels. In particular, two analysis tasks are taken into account: a
binary classification and a prediction of the tumor proliferation score. Our
method is based on a CNN structure consisting of a compressing path and a
learning path. In the compressing path, the gigapixel image is packed into a
grid-based feature map by using a residual network devoted to the feature
extraction of each patch into which the image has been divided. In the learning
path, attention modules are applied to the grid-based feature map, taking into
account spatial correlations of neighboring patch features to find regions of
interest, which are then used for the final whole slide analysis. Our method
integrates both global and local information, is flexible with regard to the
size of the input images and only requires weak image-level labels. Comparisons
with different methods of the state-of-the-art on two well known datasets,

thermal equilibrium provided by classical hydrodynamics in terms of dissipative
transport phenomena receives important corrections once the effects of
stochastic fluctuations are taken into account. One such physical effect is the
occurrence of long-time power law tails in correlation functions of conserved
currents. In the hydrodynamic regime $\vec{k} \rightarrow 0$ this amounts to
non-analytic dependence of the correlation functions on the frequency $\omega$.
In this article, we consider a relativistic fluid with a conserved global
$U(1)$ charge in the presence of a strong background magnetic field, and
compute the long-time tails in correlation functions of the stress tensor. The
presence of the magnetic field renders the system anisotropic. In the absence
of the magnetic field, there are three out-of-equilibrium transport parameters
that arise at the first order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion, all of
which are dissipative. In the presence of a background magnetic field, there
are ten independent out-of-equilibrium transport parameters at the first order,
three of which are non-dissipative and the rest are dissipative. We provide the
most general linearized equations about a given state of thermal equilibrium
involving the various transport parameters in the presence of a magnetic field,
and use them to compute the long-time tails for the fluid.

subhalos that do not host any baryonic content and therefore lack any
multiwavelength counterpart. If the DM is made of weakly interacting massive
particles (WIMPs), these dark subhalos may thus appear in the gamma-ray sky as
unidentified sources. A detailed characterization of the instrumental response
of CTA to dark subhalos is performed, for which we use the {\it ctools}
analysis software and simulate CTA observations under different array
configurations and pointing strategies, such as the scheduled extragalactic
survey. This, together with information on the subhalo population as inferred
from N-body cosmological simulations, allows us to predict the CTA
detectability of dark subhalos, i.e., the expected number of subhalos in each
of the considered observational scenarios. In the absence of detection, for
each observation strategy we set competitive limits to the annihilation cross
section as a function of the DM particle mass, that are at the level of
$\langle\sigma v\rangle\sim4\times10^{-24}$ ($7\times10^{-25}$)
$\mathrm{cm^3s^{-1}}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ ($\tau^+\tau^-$) annihilation channel

no dedicated observations, as we obtain the best limits by just accumulating
exposure time from all scheduled CTA programs and pointings over the first 10
years of operation. This way CTA will offer the most constraining limits from
subhalo searches in the intermediate range between $\sim 1-3$ TeV,
complementing previous results with \textit{Fermi}-LAT and HAWC at lower and

However, only approximate methods are available for estimating the variance of

uncertainty in the efficacy rate could be underestimated when the disease risk
is low. Factoring in the baseline rate of the disease, we estimate broader

One of the primary barriers is the complexity of biological materials: the
geometrical, structural, and material properties vary in a wide range, and they
depend on many factors. Despite these difficulties, there is a tremendous
effort to develop a reliable and implementable thermal model. In the present
paper, we focus on the continuum modeling of heterogeneous materials with
biological origin. There are numerous examples in the literature for
non-Fourier thermal models. However, as we realized, they are associated with a
few common misconceptions. Therefore, we first aim to clarify the basic
concepts of non-Fourier thermal models. These concepts are demonstrated by
revisiting two experiments from the literature in which the Cattaneo-Vernotte
and the dual phase lag models are utilized. Our investigation revealed that
using these non-Fourier models is based on misinterpretations of the measured
data, and the seeming deviation from Fourier's law originates in the source
terms and boundary conditions.

allows one to embed a fine-grained access control mechanism into encrypted

Efficient Abe with Broadcast REvocation for Wireless networks), which is suited
for Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) applications. In
contrast to state-of-the-art ABE schemes, ours is capable of securely
performing key revocations with a single short broadcast message, instead of a
number of unicast messages that is linear with the number of nodes. This is
desirable for low-bitrate Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) which
often are the heart of (I)IoT systems. In SEA-BREW, sensors, actuators, and
users can exchange encrypted data via a cloud server, or directly via wireless
if they belong to the same WSAN. We formally prove that our scheme is secure
also in case of an untrusted cloud server that colludes with a set of users,
under the generic bilinear group model. We show by simulations that our scheme
requires a constant computational overhead on the cloud server with respect to
the complexity of the access control policies. This is in contrast to
state-of-the-art solutions, which require instead a linear computational
overhead.

exhaustive evaluation of the attack's effect on the task of object detection,
investigating the effect of attack parameters. We validate our model against
empirical data collected on two separate cameras, showing that by simply using
information from the camera's datasheet the adversary can accurately predict
the injected distortion size and optimize their attack accordingly. We find
that an adversary can hide up to 75% of objects perceived by state-of-the-art

stealthiness of the attack in comparison to a na\""{i}ve camera blinding attack,
showing that common image distortion metrics can not detect the attack

performance of many machine intelligence tasks. However, the CNN models are
usually computationally intensive and energy consuming, since they are often
designed with numerous multiply-operations and considerable parameters for the
accuracy reason. Thus, it is difficult to directly apply them in the
resource-constrained environments such as 'Internet of Things' (IoT) devices
and smart phones. To reduce the computational complexity and energy burden,
here we present a novel minimalist hardware architecture using adder
convolutional neural network (AdderNet), in which the original convolution is
replaced by adder kernel using only additions. To maximally excavate the
potential energy consumption, we explore the low-bit quantization algorithm for
AdderNet with shared-scaling-factor method, and we design both specific and
general-purpose hardware accelerators for AdderNet. Experimental results show
that the adder kernel with int8/int16 quantization also exhibits high
performance, meanwhile consuming much less resources (theoretically ~81% off).
In addition, we deploy the quantized AdderNet on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate
Array) platform. The whole AdderNet can practically achieve 16% enhancement in
speed, 67.6%-71.4% decrease in logic resource utilization and 47.85%-77.9%
decrease in power consumption compared to CNN under the same circuit
architecture. With a comprehensive comparison on the performance, power
consumption, hardware resource consumption and network generalization
capability, we conclude the AdderNet is able to surpass all the other
competitors including the classical CNN, novel memristor-network, XNOR-Net and
the shift-kernel based network, indicating its great potential in future high
performance and energy-efficient artificial intelligence applications.

between the fusion category associated to a quantum group at a certain root of

a suitable positive integer level. We develop ideas by Wenzl. Our results rely
on the notion of weak-quasi-Hopf algebra of Drinfeld-Mack-Schomerus. We were
also guided by Drinfeld original proof, by Bakalov and Kirillov and Neshveyev
and Tuset work for a generic parameter. Wenzl described a fusion tensor product
in quantum group fusion categories, and related it to the unitary structure.
Given two irreducible objects, the inner product of the fusion tensor product
is induced by the braiding of U_q(g), with q a suitable root of 1. Moreover,
the paper suggests a suitable untwisting procedure to make the unitary
structure trivial. Then it also describes a continuous path that intuitively
connects objects of the quantum group fusion category to representations of the
simple Lie group defining the affine Lie algebra. We study this procedure. One
of our main results is the construction of a Hopf algebra in a weak sense
associated to quantum group fusion category and of a twist of it giving a wqh
structure on the Zhu algebra and a unitary modular fusion category structure on
the representation category of the affine Lie algebra, confirming an early view
by Frenkel and Zhu. We show that this modular fusion category structure is
equivalent to that obtained via the tensor product theory of VOAs by Huang and
Lepowsky. This gives a direct proof of FKL theorem.

maps, and the nuclear activity of the galaxies using information from the BPT
diagnostic diagrams. Using these tools, we group a sample of 238 galaxies from
the CALIFA survey in six quenching stages (QS): objects dominated by recent
star formation; systems that present a quiescent-nuclear-ring structure in
their centre; galaxies that are centrally-quiescent; galaxies with no clear
pattern in their ionisation gas distribution - mixed; systems that posses only
a few star-forming regions - nearly-retired, or galaxies that are completely
quiescent - fully-retired. Regarding their nuclear activity, we further divide
the galaxies into two groups - active systems that host a weak or strong AGN in
their centre, and non-active objects. Galaxies grouped into quenching stage
classes occupy specific locations on the star-formation-rate versus stellar
mass diagram. The ""Blue cloud"" is populated by the star-forming and the
quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, the ""Green valley"" is populated by
centrally-quiescent and mixed systems, ""Red sequence"" by the nearly- and
fully-retired objects. Generally, galaxies that host a weak or strong AGN show
properties, comparable to the non-active counterparts at the same quenching
stages, except for the AGN-hosting star-forming systems. The degree of the
star-formation quenching increases along the present emission-line pattern
sequence from star-forming to fully-retired. The proposed emission-line classes
reinforce the ""inside-out"" quenching scenario, which foresees that the

observable as a sum of resonant-pole pairs under an appropriate
parameterization which expresses the observable to be single-valued, and
fitting it to experimental data of the invariant-mass distribution of
$\pi^+\Sigma^-$, $\pi^-\Sigma^+$, $\pi^0\Sigma^0$ final states in the reaction,
$\gamma p \rightarrow K^+ \pi \Sigma$, and the elastic and inelastic cross
section, $K^-p\to K^-p$, $\bar{K}^0n$, $\pi^+\Sigma^-$, $\pi^-\Sigma^+$. As we
gradually increase the number of pairs from one to three, the first pair
converges while the second and third pairs emerge further and further away from
the first pair, implying that the Uniformized Mittag-Leffler expansion with
three pairs is almost convergent in the vicinity of the $\Lambda(1405)$. The
broad peak structure between the $\pi\Sigma$ and $\bar{K} N$ thresholds
regarded to be $\Lambda(1405)$ is explained by a single pair with a resonant
energy of 1420 $\pm$ 1 MeV, and a half width of 48 $\pm$ 2 MeV, which is
consistent with the single-pole picture of $\Lambda(1405)$. We conclude that
the Uniformized Mittag-Leffler expansion turns out to be a very powerful method

  Magnitude Learning","Accepted to ICCV 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomaly detection with weakly supervised video-level labels is typically
formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, in which we aim to
identify snippets containing abnormal events, with each video represented as a
bag of video snippets. Although current methods show effective detection
performance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal
snippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative
instances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that
exhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is
exacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies.
To address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method,
named Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature
magnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances,
substantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative
instances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and
self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal
dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive
experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets
(ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence and UCSD-Peds) and (ii) achieves
significantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.

a gravitational theory in $(d+1)$-dimensional conical spacetime and a CFT on
the $(d+1-n)$-dimensional defects. Similar to wedge holography, the cone
holography can be obtained by taking the zero-volume limit of holographic
defect CFT. Remarkably, it can be regarded as a holographic dual of the edge
modes on the defects. For one class of solutions, we prove that the cone
holography is equivalent to AdS/CFT, by showing that the classical
gravitational action and thus the CFT partition function in large N limit are
the same for the two theories. In general, cone holography and AdS/CFT are
different due to the infinite towers of massive Kaluza-Klein modes on the
branes. We test cone holography by studying Weyl anomaly, Entanglement/R\'enyi
entropy and correlation functions, and find good agreements between the
holographic and the CFT results. In particular, the c-theorem is obeyed by cone
holography. These are strong supports for our proposal. We discuss two kinds of
boundary conditions, the mixed boundary condition and Neumann boundary
condition, and find that they both define a consistent theory of cone
holography. We also analyze the mass spectrum on the brane and find that the
larger the tension is, the more continuous the mass spectrum is. The cone
holography can be regarded as a generalization of the wedge holography, and it
is closely related to the defect CFT, entanglement/R\'enyi entropy and
AdS/BCFT(dCFT). Thus it is expected to have a wide range of applications.

When
pore fluids are present and drainage is insufficient, dilation leads to pore
pressure drops, which in turn lead to strengthening of the material. We
conducted laboratory rock fracture experiments with direct in-situ fluid
pressure measurements which demonstrate that dynamic rupture propagation and
fault slip can be stabilised (i.e., become quasi-static) by such a dilatancy
strengthening effect. We also observe that, for the same effective pressures
but lower pore fluid pressures, the stabilisation process may be arrested when
the pore fluid pressure approaches zero and vaporises, resulting in dynamic
shear failure. In case of a stable rupture, we witness continued prolonged slip
after the main failure event that is the result of pore pressure recharge of
the fault zone. All our observations are quantitatively explained by a
spring-slider model combining slip-weakening behaviour, slip-induced dilation,
and pore fluid diffusion. Using our data in an inverse problem, we estimate the
key parameters controlling rupture stabilisation, fault dilation rate and fault
zone storage. These estimates are used to make predictions for the pore
pressure drop associated with faulting, and where in the crust we may expect
dilatancy stabilisation or vaporisation during earthquakes. For intact rock and
well consolidated faults, we expect strong dilatancy strengthening between 4
and 6 km depth regardless of ambient pore pressure, and at greater depths when
the ambient pore pressure approaches lithostatic pressure. In the uppermost
part of the crust ($<4$ km), we predict vaporisation of pore fluids that limits
dilatancy strengthening. The depth estimates where dilatant stabilisation is
most likely coincide with geothermal energy reservoirs in crystalline rock and
in regions where slow slip events are observed.

The first two authors contributed equally",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One-class classification (OCC) aims to learn an effective data description to
enclose all normal training samples and detect anomalies based on the deviation
from the data description. Current state-of-the-art OCC models learn a compact
normality description by hyper-sphere minimisation, but they often suffer from
overfitting the training data, especially when the training set is small or
contaminated with anomalous samples. To address this issue, we introduce the
interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD) method, a novel OCC model that learns a
one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated
training samples. The Gaussian anomaly classifier differentiates the training
samples based on their distance to the Gaussian centre and the standard
deviation of these distances, offering the model a discriminability w.r.t. the
given samples during training. The adversarial interpolation is enforced to
consistently learn a smooth Gaussian descriptor, even when the training data is
small or contaminated with anomalous samples. This enables our model to learn
the data description based on the representative normal samples rather than
fringe or anomalous samples, resulting in significantly improved normality
description. In extensive experiments on diverse popular benchmarks, including
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, MVTec AD and two medical datasets, IGD achieves
better detection accuracy than current state-of-the-art models. IGD also shows
better robustness in problems with small or contaminated training sets. Code is

that the large scale tides can be described as a mean shear flow which is
damped by small scale fluctuating convective eddies. The convective Reynolds
stress is calculated using mixing length theory, accounting for a sharp
suppression of dissipation when the turnover timescale is larger than the tidal
period. This yields tidal dissipation rates several orders of magnitude too
small to account for the circularization periods of late-type binaries or the
tidal dissipation factor of giant planets. Here, we argue that the above
description is inconsistent, because fluctuations and mean flow should be
identified based on the timescale, not on the spatial scale, on which they
vary. Therefore, the standard picture should be reversed, with the fluctuations
being the tidal oscillations and the mean shear flow provided by the largest
convective eddies. We assume that energy is locally transferred from the tides
to the convective flow. Using this assumption, we obtain values for the tidal
$Q$ factor of Jupiter and Saturn and for the circularization periods of PMS
binaries in good agreement with observations. The timescales obtained with the
equilibrium tide approximation are however still 40 times too large to account
for the circularization periods of late-type binaries. For these systems, shear
in the tachocline or at the base of the convective zone may be the main cause
of tidal dissipation.

parametrised GSO (PGSO) is proposed, where specific parameter values result in
the most commonly used GSOs and message-passing operators in graph neural

standard GSOs that are used in state-of-the-art GNN architectures and the
optimisation of the PGSO parameters is seamlessly included in the model
training. It is proved that the PGSO has real eigenvalues and a set of real
eigenvectors independent of the parameter values and spectral bounds on the

found to automatically replicate the GSO regularisation found in the

the space-time. It is shown that the change of entropic force with the position
ratio of two horizons in some region is similar to that of Lennard-Jones force

lead to a geometrical distortion free behavior compared to other PET detectors.
To this end, the sensors chosen for the light readout are SiPMs, which provide
large area, high gain and very low noise. In order to take advantage of the
unique PETALO detector characteristics a read-out architecture must be designed
to meet the following specifications: Electronics associated to detector

size. Read-out scheme must be compatible with the non-segmented structure of

level, that is to say front-end and read-out electronics should not degrade LXe
time performance. In these proceedings, a new readout concept is introduced

moderately volatile element abundances but refractory element concentrations

The presence of lobes would otherwise be difficult to explain, as surface
tension should have rapidly imposed a spherical shape at the temperature peak.
In fact, since most chondrules across chondrite groups are nonspherical, a
majority are probably compounds variously relaxed toward sphericity. The lack
of correlation of refractory elements between conjoined compound chondrule
components is inconsistent with derivation of chondrules from the disruption of
homogenized melt bodies as in impact scenarios and evokes rather the melting of
independent mm-size nebular aggregates. Yet a ""nebular"" setting for chondrule
formation would need to involve not only increased solid concentration, e.g. by
settling to the midplane, but also a boost in relative velocities between

ultrashort x-ray pulses, has brought a new way of creating and analyzing hot
and warm dense plasmas in the laboratory. Because of the ultrashort pulse
duration, the XFEL-produced plasma will be out of equilibrium at the beginning
and even the electronic subsystem may not reach thermal equilibrium while
interacting with a femtosecond time-scale pulse. In the dense plasma, the
ionization potential depression (IPD) induced by the plasma environment plays a
crucial role for understanding and modeling microscopic dynamical processes.
However, all theoretical approaches for IPD have been based on local thermal
equilibrium (LTE) and it has been controversial to use LTE IPD models for the
nonthermal situation. In this work, we propose a non-LTE (NLTE) approach to
calculate the IPD effect by combining a quantum-mechanical electronic-structure
calculation and a classical molecular dynamics simulation. This hybrid approach
enables us to investigate the time evolution of ionization potentials and IPDs
during and after the interaction with XFEL pulses, without the limitation of
the LTE assumption. In our NLTE approach, the transient IPD values are
presented as distributions evolving with time, which cannot be captured by
conventional LTE-based models. The time-integrated ionization potential values
are in good agreement with benchmark experimental data on solid-density
aluminum plasma and other theoretical predictions based on LTE. The present
work is promising to provide critical insights into nonequilibrium dynamics of
dense plasma formation and thermalization induced by XFEL pulses.

to predict how well each sentence could be compressed while meeting the

applied to a sequence of sentences (e.g., a paragraph) as a whole, rather than

we solve using bounded dynamic programming. We evaluate B-BOC on both scenarios

system. We achieve this by extracting diffraction-limited imaging information
from 'memory-effect' speckle-correlations in the conventionally detected
ultrasound-modulated scattered-light fields. Specifically, we identify that
since speckle correlations allow to estimate the Fourier-magnitude of the field
inside the ultrasound focus, scanning the ultrasound focus enables robust
diffraction-limited reconstruction of extended objects using ptychography, i.e.
we exploit the ultrasound focus as the scanned spatial-gate 'probe' required
for ptychographic phase-retrieval. Moreover, we exploit the short speckle
decorrelation-time in dynamic media, which is usually considered a hurdle for
wavefront-shaping based approaches, for improved ptychographic reconstruction.
We experimentally demonstrate non-invasive imaging of targets that extend well
beyond the memory-effect range, with a 40-times resolution improvement over
conventional AOI, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches.

disks are commonly found in the analysis of X-ray observations of black hole
binaries and AGN, but there is some debate about their exact origin. While
steep reflection emissivity profiles can be naturally produced by compact
coronae close to black holes, the measured radial emissivity parameter can be
further increased by the radial disk ionization profile when the theoretical
model assumes a disk with constant ionization. In this paper, we implement the
possibility of a radial disk ionization profile in the reflection model
RELXILL_NK, which is a package designed to calculate reflection spectra of
""deformed"" Kerr black holes. We analyze a NuSTAR observation of the black hole
binary EXO 1846-031, which was previously found to have a very high inner
emissivity index. We find that the model with a radial disk ionization profile
improves the fit, but the impact on the estimate of the black hole spin
parameter and on the constraint of the deformation parameter is modest.
However, we show that the analysis of future observations of Athena and eXTP
will necessarily require models with a radial disk ionization profile to have
accurate constraints of the deformation parameters.

more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to
existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in
a prototypical tool named DeepPAC. As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional
inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepPAC, with 4 baselines (using formal
verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN

that DeepPAC outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO, and
it achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal verification

thin films and its fascinating thermodynamic behaviours is presented. A chiral
magnetic film can have many metastable states with an arbitrary skyrmion
density up to a maximal value when a parameter $\kappa$, which measures the
relative Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) strength, is large enough. The
lowest energy state of an infinite film is a long zig-zagged ramified stripe
skyrmion occupied the whole film in the absence of a magnetic field. Under an
intermediate field perpendicular to the film, the lowest energy state has a
finite skyrmion density. This is why a chiral magnetic film is often in a
stripy state at a low field and a SkX only around an optimal field when
$\kappa$ is above a critical value. The lowest energy state is still a stripy
helical state no matter with or without a field when $\kappa$ is below the
critical value. The multi-metastable states explains the thermodynamic path
dependences of various metastable states of a film. Decrease of $\kappa$ value
with the temperature explains why SkXs become metastable at low temperature in
many skyrmion systems. These findings open a new avenue for SkX manipulation
and skyrmion-based applications.

The aim is to investigate the observed change in the well known asymmetric
energy of spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf as the fragments pass through
increasingly thick absorber foils. Two different types of absorbers have been
used: one elemental and the other an organic compound. The stopping powers have
been determined as a function of energy for three fragment mass groups with
average masses with $<A>$ = 106.5, 141.8, 125.8 corresponding to light, heavy
and symmetric fragment of $^{252}$Cf. Using the effective charge (Z$_{eff}$) in
the stopping power relation in the classical Bohr theory best describes the
stopping power data. Spectrum shape parameters, subsequently have been
extracted from the energy spectra of fission fragments for different foil
thickness. The effective charge (Z$_{eff}$) correction term determined from the
stopping power data is then used in the simulation for the absorber thickness
dependence of the shape parameters of the energy spectrum. The present
simulation results are compared with the TRIM prediction. The trends of the
absorber thickness dependence of the spectrum shape parameters, for both Mylar

~366 msh for the values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA, respectively, at the maximum

The difficulty of regaining plasma control if it is lost resembles driving on

estimated on a quantum computer for an $n$-qubit state using $2n$ qubits. The
sub-QFI is based on the super-fidelity, an upper bound on Uhlmann's fidelity.
We analyze the sub-QFI in the context of unitary families, where we derive
several crucial properties including its geometrical interpretation. In
particular, we prove that the QFI and the sub-QFI are maximized for the same
optimal state, which implies that the sub-QFI is faithful to the QFI in the
sense that both quantities share the same global extrema. Based on this
faithfulness, the sub-QFI acts as an efficiently computable surrogate for the
QFI for quantum sensing and quantum metrology applications. Finally, we provide
additional meaning to the sub-QFI as a measure of coherence, asymmetry, and

modelling of this system based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes.

model where the operator centrally dispatches generation and consumption under
forecasting uncertainty, it is shown that almost all uniform pricing schemes,
including the standard locational marginal pricing (LMP), result in lost
opportunity costs that require out-of-the-market settlements. It is also shown
that such settlements give rise to disincentives for generating firms and
storage participants to bid truthfully, even when these market participants are
rational price-takers in a competitive market. Temporal locational marginal
pricing (TLMP) is proposed for ESRs as a generalization of LMP to an in-market
discriminative form. TLMP is a sum of the system-wide energy price, LMP, and
the individual state-of-charge price. It is shown that, under arbitrary
forecasting errors, the rolling-window implementation of TLMP eliminates the
lost opportunity costs and provides incentives to price-taking firms to bid
truthfully with their marginal costs. Numerical examples show insights into the
effects of uniform and non-uniform pricing mechanisms on dispatch following and

and finally one classifier to provide the final rotation period. We test our
machine learning pipeline on 23,431 stars of the Kepler K and M dwarf reference
rotation catalog of Santos et al. (2019) for which 60% of the stars have been
visually inspected. For the sample of 21,707 stars where all the input

classified (as rotating or not). Among the stars that have a rotation period in
the reference catalog, the machine learning provides a period that agrees
within 10% of the reference value for 95.3% of the stars. Moreover, the yield
of correct rotation periods is raised to 99.5% after visually inspecting 25.2%

discovery$^{9,10}$. A major shortcoming is that, to avoid expensive
calculations of the entropy, crystal structure prediction was done at zero
Kelvin and searched for the global minimum of the enthalpy, rather than free
energy. As a consequence, high-temperature phases (especially those which are
not quenchable to zero temperature) could be missed. Here we develop an
accurate and affordable solution, enabling crystal structure prediction at
finite temperatures. Structure relaxation and fully anharmonic free energy
calculations are done by molecular dynamics with a force field (which can be
anything from a parametric force field for simpler cases to a trained

simulated annealing is known to have prohibitively slow sampling dynamics when
the optimization landscape is rough or glassy. Here we show that by
generalizing the target distribution with a parameterized model, an analogous

These neural networks can detect phase transitions in the system via `anomaly
detection', without the need for any label or a priori knowledge of the phases.
We present different ways of training these autoencoders and we evaluate them
to discriminate between distinct magnetic phases. In this process, we highlight
the case of high temperature or even random training data. Finally, we analyze
the capability of the autoencoder to detect the ground state degeneracy through
the reconstruction error.

operations on (semi)finished products using different tools. In practical
scenarios, the selection of a next operation is complicated, since each expert
has only a local view on the total set of operations to be performed. As a

as tools and specialists. The resources are flexible and can perform one or
more operations depending on their properties. The problem is modeled using
Answer Set Programming (ASP) in which the time assignments are efficiently done

considering grasp poses as nodes and object poses for edges. We consider
regrasping and constrained in-hand slip (drooping) during building graphs and
find mixed regrasping and drooping sequences by searching the graph. The
generated sequences autonomously divide the object weight between the arm and
the support surface and avoid configuration obstacles. Cartesian planning is
used at the robot motion level to generate motions between adjacent critical
grasp poses of the sequence found by the task level layer. Various experiments
are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed planner. The results
show improved capability of robot arms to manipulate long and heavy objects
using the proposed planner. Our contribution is we initially develop a
graph-based planning system that reasons both in-hand and regrasp manipulation
motion considering external supports. On one hand, the planner integrates
regrasping and drooping to realize in-hand manipulation with external support.
On the other hand, it switches states by releasing and regrasping objects when
the object is in stably placed. The search graphs' nodes could be retrieved
from remote cloud servers that provide a large amount of pre-annotated data to
implement cyber intelligence.

to uniform sea-surface temperature (SST) is studied. Specifically, the latent
heat (Lv) of water vapor is varied, so that for small Lv, water substance is
essentially a passive tracer from a dynamical point of view. Despite the lack
of SST gradients, a general circulation with Hadley and Ferrel cells is
observed for relatively stronger moist coupling. Organized precipitation
patterns via equatorial waves appear to play a significant role in tropical
ascent, and along with the equatorial deformation radius, the Hadley cell width
increases with coupling strength. An abrupt switch to a much shallower tropical
cell is noted when the system becomes completely passive. In all cases, the
Hadley cell is thermally indirect and is influenced by eddy fluxes which are
strong in the upper and lower troposphere. Moist static energy is transported
equatorward in the tropics and a larger amount is directed poleward in the
midlatitudes. Transient extratropical activity is seen in the form of intense
warm-core vortices for strong coupling, and these systems become weaker and
smaller as Lv decreases. The drift of these moist vortices results in the
observed poleward energy transport in the midlatitudes. In the tropics,
intraseasonal variability is dominant and systematically shifts to longer time
periods with stronger coupling. In fact, large-scale, low-frequency Kelvin
waves and MJO-like modes disappear as water vapor becomes passive in nature.
Finally, extreme rainfall events associated with cyclonic storms vanish as
water vapor becomes dynamically inactive. Tropospheric heating due to a
saturation of the outgoing longwave radiation results in an increase in the
stability of the atmosphere for strong coupling, and provides a plausible
physical mechanism for interpreting the behavior of precipitation.

phenomena but also confirms for the first time in self-consistent potential
profiles the importance of gyro-bounce-resonance detrapping and consequent
velocity diffusion on stochastic orbits. The averaging strongly reduces the
trapped electron deficit that can be sustained by any potential profile whose
transverse width is comparable to the gyro-radius $r_g$. It effectively
prevents equilibrium widths smaller than $\sim r_g$ for times longer than a

Transversely magnetized nano-conduits, which are of great interest in this
regard as they offer a large group velocity and a potentially chirality-based
protected transport of energy, have not yet been investigated due to their
complex internal magnetic field distribution. Here, we present a study of
propagating spin waves in a transversely magnetized nanoscopic yttrium iron
garnet conduit of 50 nm width. Space and time-resolved micro-focused
Brillouin-light-scattering spectroscopy is employed to measure the spin-wave
group velocity and decay length. A long-range spin-wave propagation is observed
with a decay length of up to (8.0+-1.5) {\mu}m and a large spin-wave lifetime
of up to (44.7+-9.1) ns. The results are supported with micromagnetic
simulations, revealing a single-mode dispersion relation in contrast to the
common formation of localized edge modes for microscopic systems. Furthermore,
a frequency non-reciprocity for counter-propagating spin waves is observed in
the simulations and the experiment, caused by the trapezoidal cross-section of
the structure. The revealed long-distance spin-wave propagation on the
nanoscale is particularly interesting for an application in spin-wave devices,
allowing for long-distance transport of information in magnonic circuits, as

the features of the object variables, and of both the objective and the

optimization capabilities are emergent properties, such as evolutionary
algorithms and particle swarm optimization, present almost no restriction on
those features and can handle different optimization problems with few or no
adaptations. Their main drawbacks consist of their comparatively higher
computational cost and difficulty in handling equality constraints. The
particle swarm optimization method is sometimes viewed as an evolutionary
algorithm because of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the
same metaphor: they evolve a population of individuals taking into account
previous experiences and using stochastic operators to introduce new responses.
The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods
have been greatly discussed in the literature for decades. While the particle
swarm optimizers share such advantages, their main desirable features when
compared to evolutionary algorithms are their lower computational cost and
easier implementation, involving no operator design and few parameters to be

the dynamics of the swarm. This paper deals with the effect of the settings of

by padding the input into hexagon-shape as preprocessing. In this case, we show
that the time and space efficiency of HexCNN still outperforms existing

swarm optimization paradigm was inspired by previous simulations of the
cooperative behaviour observed in social beings. It is a bottom-up, randomly
weighted, population-based method whose ability to optimize emerges from local,
individual-to-individual interactions. As opposed to traditional methods, it
can deal with different problems with few or no adaptation due to the fact that
it does profit from problem-specific features of the problem at issue but
performs a parallel, cooperative exploration of the search-space by means of a
population of individuals. The main goal of this thesis consists of developing
an optimizer that can perform reasonably well on most problems. Hence, the
influence of the settings of the algorithm's parameters on the behaviour of the
system is studied, some general-purpose settings are sought, and some
variations to the canonical version are proposed aiming to turn it into a more
general-purpose optimizer. Since no termination condition is included in the
canonical version, this thesis is also concerned with the design of some
stopping criteria which allow the iterative search to be terminated if further
significant improvement is unlikely, or if a certain number of time-steps are
reached. In addition, some constraint-handling techniques are incorporated into
the canonical algorithm to handle inequality constraints. Finally, the
capabilities of the proposed general-purpose optimizers are illustrated by

vehicles is often the only opportunity for pedestrians to cross the street.
This research aims to investigate effective factors on pedestrian gap
acceptance at uncontrolled mid-block crosswalks. In this regard, several
variables such as individual, environmental, and traffic variables were
considered and their related data were extracted by filming the location. from
video images, they were analyzed using logit regression model and the behavior
After extracting the data of pedestrian while he is crossing the street was

illustrate that conflict flow rate, the temporal gap among vehicles, and driver

not affect the pedestrian's decision about rejecting or accepting the gap. The
results also show that individual characteristics such as age and gender of

including problems of remarkably higher complexity than those traditional
methods can handle. The main procedure consists of successively updating a
population of candidate solutions, performing a parallel exploration instead of
traditional sequential exploration. While the origins of the PSO method are
linked to bird flock simulations, it is a stochastic optimization method in the
sense that it relies on random coefficients to introduce creativity, and a
bottom-up artificial intelligence-based approach in the sense that its
intelligent behaviour emerges in a higher level than the individuals' rather
than deterministically programmed. As opposed to EAs, the PSO involves no
operator design and few coefficients to be tuned. Since this paper does not
intend to study such tuning, general-purpose settings are taken from previous
studies. The PSO algorithm requires the incorporation of some technique to
handle constraints. A popular one is the penalization method, which turns the
original constrained problem into unconstrained by penalizing infeasible
solutions. Other techniques can be specifically designed for PSO. Since these
strategies present advantages and disadvantages when compared to one another,
there is no obvious best constraint-handling technique (CHT) for all problems.
The aim here is to develop and compare different CHTs suitable for PSOs, which
are incorporated to an algorithm with general-purpose settings. The comparisons
are performed keeping the remaining features of the algorithm the same, while
comparisons to other authors' results are offered as a frame of reference for
the optimizer as a whole. Thus, the penalization, preserving feasibility and
bisection methods are discussed, implemented, and tested on two suites of
benchmark problems. Three neighbourhood sizes are also considered in the

  Design Optimization",,,,"cs.NE math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Particle Swarm Optimization is a global optimizer in the sense that it has
the ability to escape poor local optima. However, if the spread of information
within the population is not adequately performed, premature convergence may
occur. The convergence speed and hence the reluctance of the algorithm to
getting trapped in suboptimal solutions are controlled by the settings of the
coefficients in the velocity update equation as well as by the neighbourhood
topology. The coefficients settings govern the trajectories of the particles
towards the good locations identified, whereas the neighbourhood topology
controls the form and speed of spread of information within the population
(i.e. the update of the social attractor). Numerous neighbourhood topologies
have been proposed and implemented in the literature. This paper offers a
numerical comparison of the performances exhibited by five different
neighbourhood topologies combined with four different coefficients' settings
when optimizing a set of benchmark unconstrained problems. Despite the optimum
topology being problem-dependent, it appears that dynamic neighbourhoods with
the number of interconnections increasing as the search progresses should be
preferred for a non-problem-specific optimizer.

recent times. The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model and its variants
are often used for epidemic modeling. One important issue in epidemic modeling
is the determination of the spreading ability of the nodes in the network.
Thus, for example, can be detected in the early stages. In this study, we
developed a centrality measure called Lexical Sorting Centrality (LSC) that
distinguishes the spreading ability of the nodes. Using other centrality
measures calculated for the nodes, LSC sorts the nodes in a way similar to
alphabetical order. We conducted simulations on six datasets using SIR to
evaluate the performance of LSC and compared LSC with degree centrality (DC),
eigenvector centrality (EC), closeness centrality (CC), betweenness centrality
(BC) and Gravitational Centrality (GC). Experimental results show that LSC
distinguishes the spreading ability of the nodes more accurately, more
decisively, and faster.

operator design and few coefficients to be tuned. However, even marginal
variations in the settings of these coefficients greatly influence the dynamics

general-purpose settings are taken from previous studies, and virtually the

Thus, following a review of the paradigm, the algorithm is tested on a set of

complementary lines of code are incorporated to adapt the method to

alternative to classical Navier-Stokes solvers. This is particularly true for
hemodynamics in complex geometries. However, in its most basic formulation,
{i.e.} with the so-called single relaxation time (SRT) collision operator, it
has been observed to have a limited stability domain in the Courant/Fourier
space, strongly constraining the minimum time-step and grid size. The
development of improved collision models such as the multiple relaxation time
(MRT) operator in central moments space has tremendously widened the stability
domain, while allowing to overcome a number of other well-documented artifacts,
therefore opening the door for simulations over a wider range of grid and
time-step sizes. The present work focuses on implementing and validating a
specific collision operator, the central Hermite moments multiple relaxation
time model with the full expansion of the equilibrium distribution function, to
simulate blood flows in intracranial aneurysms. The study further proceeds with
a validation of the numerical model through different test-cases and against
experimental measurements obtained via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry
(PIV) and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI). For a
patient-specific aneurysm both PIV and PC-MRI agree fairly well with the
simulation. Finally, low-resolution simulations were shown to be able to
capture blood flow information with sufficient accuracy, as demonstrated
through both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the flow field {while
leading to strongly reduced computation times. For instance in the case of the
patient-specific configuration, increasing the grid-size by a factor of two led
to a reduction of computation time by a factor of 14 with very good similarity

our society at large. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2,
is the latest example of a highly infectious disease ravaging the world, since
late 2019. It is therefore imperative to develop efficient mathematical models,
able to substantially curb the damages of a pandemic by unveiling disease
spreading dynamics and symmetries. This will help inform (non)-pharmaceutical
prevention strategies. For the reasons above we wrote this report that goes at
the heart of mathematical modelling of infectious disease diffusion by
simultaneously investigating the underlying microscopic dynamics in terms of
percolation models, effective description via compartmental models and the
employment of temporal symmetries naturally encoded in the mathematical
language of critical phenomena. Our report reviews these approaches and
determines their common denominators, relevant for theoretical epidemiology and
its link to important concepts in theoretical physics. We show that the
different frameworks exhibit common features such as criticality and
self-similarity under time rescaling. These features are naturally encoded
within the unifying field theoretical approach. The latter leads to an
efficient description of the time evolution of the disease via a framework in
which (near) time-dilation invariance is explicitly realised. As important test
of the relevance of symmetries we show how to mathematically account for
observed phenomena such as multi-wave dynamics. The models presented here are
of immediate relevance for different realms of scientific enquiry from medical
applications to the understanding of human behaviour. Our review offers novel
perspectives on how to model, capture, organise and understand epidemiological

ecosystem. We argue that each platform archetype involves a gradual development
of platform architecture, platform services, and platform governance, which
mirror each other. We also find that each platform archetype is characterized
by a specific innovation mechanism that contributes to the platform service
discovery and expands the platform value. Our study extends the co-evolution
perspective of platform ecosystem literature and digital servitization
literature.

there have been several benchmarks and many tracking algorithms, more expected
to appear in the future. In this report, I focus on single object tracking and
revisit the details of tracker evaluation based on widely used OTB\cite{otb}
benchmark by introducing a simpler, accurate, and extensible method for tracker
evaluation and comparison. Experimental results suggest that there may not be
an absolute winner among tracking algorithms. We have to perform detailed
analysis to select suitable trackers for use cases.

mounted on both a customized UAV and a ground station for full 3D wireless
propagation analysis is described in this work. The developed system represents
a flexible solution for the characterization of wireless channels and
especially of urban propagation, as the drone might be easily located almost
anywhere from ground level to the buildings rooftop and beyond. The double
directional properties of the channel can be achieved by rotating directive
antennas at the link ends. Other possible applications in urban contexts
include above ground level propagation, outdoor-to-indoor penetration,
line-of-sight to non-line-of-sight transition, scattering from buildings and
air-to-ground channel characterization for UAV-assisted wireless
communications.

networks; however, the design of beamforming vectors that maximize the weighted
sum rate (WSR) is an NP-hard problem and iterative algorithms are typically
applied to solve it. The weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm
is the most widely used one, which iteratively minimizes the WSR and converges
to a local optimal. Motivated by the recent developments in meta-learning
techniques to solve non-convex optimization problems, we propose a
meta-learning based iterative algorithm for WSR maximization in a MISO downlink
channel. A long-short-term-memory (LSTM) network-based meta-learning model is
built to learn a dynamic optimization strategy to update the variables
iteratively. The learned strategy aims to optimize each variable in a less
greedy manner compared to WMMSE, which updates variables by computing their
first-order stationary points at each iteration step. The proposed algorithm
outperforms WMMSE significantly in the high signal to noise ratio(SNR) regime
and shows the comparable performance when the SNR is low.
