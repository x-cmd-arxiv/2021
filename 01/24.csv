of the software components that implement virtualization -- the virtualization
infrastructure (VI). To mitigate the impact of such failures, we introduce a
resilient VI (RVI) that can recover individual VI components from failure,
caused by hardware or software faults, transparently to the hosted virtual
machines (VMs). Much of the focus is on the ReHype mechanism for recovery from
hypervisor failures, that can lead to state corruption and to inconsistencies
among the states of system components. ReHype's implementation for the Xen
hypervisor was done incrementally, using fault injection results to identify
sources of critical corruption and inconsistencies. This implementation
involved 900 LOC, with memory space overhead of 2.1MB. Fault injection
campaigns, with a variety of fault types, show that ReHype can successfully
recover, in less than 750ms, from over 88% of detected hypervisor failures. In
addition to ReHype, recovery mechanisms for the other VI components are
described. The overall effectiveness of our RVI is evaluated hosting a Web
service application, on a cluster of VMs. With faults in any VI component, for
over 87% of detected failures, our recovery mechanisms allow services provided
by the application to be continuously maintained despite the resulting failures
of VI components.

represented in the form of a procedure that, using heuristics $A$ and $B$,
select the variable $x$ from the input formula $\varphi$ and the value $b$ and
runs recursively on the formulas $\varphi[x := b]$ and $\varphi[x := 1 - b]$.
Exponential lower bounds on the running time of DPLL algorithms on
unsatisfiable formulas follow from the lower bounds for tree-like resolution
proofs. Lower bounds on satisfiable formulas are also known for some classes of
DPLL algorithms such as ""myopic"" and ""drunken"" algorithms.
  All lower bounds are made for the classes of DPLL algorithms that limit
heuristics access to the formula. In this paper we consider DPLL algorithms
with heuristics that have unlimited access to the formula but use small memory.
We show that for any pair of heuristics with small memory there exists a family
of satisfiable formulas $\Phi_n$ such that a DPLL algorithm that uses these
heuristics runs in exponential time on the formulas $\Phi_n$.

the ubiquitous presence of magnetic switchbacks, whose origin is under debate.
Using a three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of the equations of
compressible magnetohydrodynamics from the corona to 40 solar radii, we
investigate whether magnetic switchbacks emerge from granulation-driven
Alfv\'en waves and turbulence in the solar wind. The simulated solar wind is an
Alfv\'enic slow-solar-wind stream with a radial profile consistent with various
observations, including observations from PSP. As a natural consequence of
Alfv\'en-wave turbulence, the simulation reproduced magnetic switchbacks with
many of the same properties as observed switchbacks, including Alfv\'enic v-b
correlation, spherical polarization (low magnetic compressibility), and a
volume filling fraction that increases with radial distance. The analysis of
propagation speed and scale length shows that the magnetic switchbacks are
large-amplitude (nonlinear) Alfv\'en waves with discontinuities in the magnetic
field direction. We directly compare our simulation with observations using a
virtual flyby of PSP in our simulation domain. We conclude that at least some
of the switchbacks observed by PSP are a natural consequence of the growth in
amplitude of spherically polarized Alfv\'en waves as they propagate away from
the Sun.

The dust sample consisted of various spherical and irregular particles with

dust and beads with different dust volume fractions (~0.2-1). We used 1.5 and
4.8 $\mu$m particles as dust as a first step, although the typical size of

results show that the primordial parent bodies are likely to have higher
porosity than the chondrites. Moreover, the relatively higher volume fraction

porous aquifer with mechanical dispersion. Existing studies have investigated
the behaviour and geometry of immiscible fluid flow in this setting, where the
injected fluid displaces the resident fluid, forming a sharp interface between
the two. The present study extends analytical solutions to include mechanical
dispersion of the interface. The solutions are inverted to solve for time as a
function of position (r,z), giving each position in the aquifer an intersection
time corresponding to the moment the travelling interface intersects a point of
interest. The set of (r0,z0) positions which share an intersection time are
treated as dummy variables that represent an 'effective surface' and are
integrated over to solve for the velocity field within the aquifer. Using this
velocity field, the concentration profile resulting from mechanical dispersion
can be found analytically.It is shown that the concentration of the injected
fluid smoothly decays around the position of the interface from immiscible
solutions, allowing for the injected fluid to be present in detectable
quantities beyond the extent of these interfaces. This concentration spread
should be considered in defining outer boundaries on fluids in injection well
applications such as carbon capture and storage or groundwater applications.

The objective is to mitigate the risks of exposure to the virus in high-dense

approach recommends pedestrians' route in a real-time manner while considering
other devices' mobility. First, the IoT devices are clustered into communities
according to two SIoT relations that consider the devices' locations and the
friendship levels among their owners. Accordingly, the city map roads are
assigned weights representing their safety levels. Afterward, a navigation
algorithm, namely the Dijkstra algorithm, is applied to recommend the safest
route to follow. Simulation results applied on a real-world IoT data set have
shown the ability of the proposed approach in achieving trade-offs between both
safest and shortest paths according to the pedestrian preference.

sparsely (in space) acquired data, often in irregular geometry. These surveys
can trade off subsurface information for efficiency/cost - creating a problem
of ""missing seismic data"" that can greatly hinder subsequent processing and
interpretation. Reconstruction of regularly sampled dense data from highly
sparse, irregular data can therefore aid in processing and interpretation of
these far sparser, more efficient seismic surveys. Here, two methods are
compared to solve the reconstruction problem in both space-time and
wavenumber-frequency domain. This requires an operator that maps sparse to
dense data: the operator is generally unknown, being the inverse of a known
data sampling operator. As such, here the deterministic inversion is
efficiently solved by least squares optimisation using a numerically efficient
Python-based linear operator representation. An alternative approach is
probabilistic and uses deep learning. Here, two deep learning architectures are
benchmarked against each other and the deterministic approach; a Recurrent
Inference Machine (RIM), which is designed specifically to solve inverse
problems given known forward operators, and the well-known U-Net. The trained
deep learning networks are capable of successfully mapping sparse to dense
seismic data for a range of different datasets and decimation percentages,
thereby significantly reducing spatial aliasing in the wavenumber-frequency
domain. The deterministic inversion on the contrary, could not reconstruct the
missing data and thus did not reduce the undesired spatial aliasing. Results
show that the application of Deep Learning for seismic reconstruction is
promising, but the treatment of large-volume, multi-component seismic datasets
will require dedicated learning architectures not yet realisable with existing
tools.

scattering mechanisms $viz.$ electron-electron (EEI), electron-phonon (EPI) and
phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) in a promising half-Heusler thermoelectric
FeVSb. Using the full-$GW$ method, the effect of EEI and temperature on the
valence and conduction band extrema and band gap are studied. The lifetime of
carriers with temperature are estimated at these band extrema. At 300 K,
estimated value of lifetime at VBM (CBM) is $\sim$1.91 x10$^{-14}s$ ($\sim$2.05
x10$^{-14}s$). The estimated ground state band gap considering EEI is $\sim$378
meV. Next, the effect of EPI on the lifetime of electrons and phonons with
temperature are discussed. The comparison of two electron lifetimes suggests
that EEI should be considered in transport calculations along with EPI. The
average acoustic, optical and overall phonon lifetimes due to EPI are studied
with temperature. Further, the effect of PPI is studied by computing average
phonon lifetime for acoustic and optical phonon branches. The lifetime of the
acoustic phonons are higher compared to optical phonons which indicates
acoustic phonons contribute more to lattice thermal conductivity
($\kappa_{ph}$). The comparison of phonon lifetime due to EPI and PPI suggests
that, above 500 K EPI is the dominant phonon scattering mechanism and cannot be
ignored in $\kappa_{ph}$ calculations. Lastly, a prediction of the power factor
and figure of merit of n-type and p-type FeVSb is made by considering the
temperature dependent carrier lifetime for the electronic transport terms. This
study shows the importance of considering EEI in electronic transport
calculations and EPI in phonon transport calculations. Our study is expected to
provide results to further explore the thermoelectric transport in this
material.

define the notion of Pad\'e\ approximation of Weyl-Stiltjes transforms on an
arbitrary compact Riemann surface of higher genus. The data consists of a
contour in the Riemann surface and a measure on it, together with the
additional datum of a local coordinate near a point and a divisor of degree
$g$. The denominators of the resulting Pad\'e--like approximation also satisfy
an orthogonality relation and are sections of appropriate line bundles. A
Riemann--Hilbert problem for a square matrix of rank two is shown to
characterize these orthogonal sections, in a similar fashion to the ordinary
orthogonal polynomial case.
  The second part extends this idea to explore its connection to integrable
systems. The same data can be used to define a pairing between two sequences of
line bundles. The locus in the deformation space where the pairing becomes
degenerate for fixed degree coincides with the zeros of a ""tau"" function. We
show how this tau function satisfies the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili hierarchy with
respect to either deformation parameters, and a certain modification of the
2--Toda hierarchy when considering the whole sequence of tau functions. We also
show how this construction is related to the Krichever construction of
algebro--geometric solutions.

knowledge transfer from multiple teachers. The student model with a single

multiple teachers achieved better performance than the teachers. The salient

ease of implementation for downstream tasks by using the downstream task

standard way to study the interdependence between software packages is to infer
a package dependency network by parsing manifest data. Such networks help
answer questions such as ""How many packages have dependencies to packages with
known security issues?"" or ""What are the most used packages?"". However, an
overlooked aspect in existing studies is that manifest-inferred relationships
do not necessarily examine the actual usage of these dependencies in source
code. To better model dependencies between packages, we developed Pr\""azi, an
approach combining manifests and call graphs of packages. Pr\""azi constructs a
dependency network at the more fine-grained function-level, instead of at the
manifest level. This paper discusses a prototypical Pr\""azi implementation for
the popular system programming language Rust. We use Pr\""azi to characterize

metadata-based networks generalize how packages use their dependencies. Using
Pr\""azi, we find packages call only 40% of their resolved dependencies, and

have become widely used in multimedia forensics for tasks such as detecting and
identifying image forgeries. Meanwhile, anti-forensic attacks have been
developed to fool these CNN-based forensic algorithms. Previous anti-forensic
attacks often were designed to remove forgery traces left by a single
manipulation operation as opposed to a set of manipulations. Additionally,
recent research has shown that existing anti-forensic attacks against forensic
CNNs have poor transferability, i.e. they are unable to fool other forensic
CNNs that were not explicitly used during training. In this paper, we propose a
new anti-forensic attack framework designed to remove forensic traces left by a
variety of manipulation operations. This attack is transferable, i.e. it can be
used to attack forensic CNNs are unknown to the attacker, and it introduces
only minimal distortions that are imperceptible to human eyes. Our proposed
attack utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to build a generator
that can attack color images of any size. We achieve attack transferability
through the use of a new training strategy and loss function. We conduct
extensive experiment to demonstrate that our attack can fool many state-of-art
forensic CNNs with varying levels of knowledge available to the attacker.

  Limits with Uncoded Prefetching","11 pages and 2 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decentralized coded caching scheme, introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen,
assumes that the caches are filled with no coordination. This work identifies a
decentralized coded caching scheme -- under the assumption of uncoded placement
-- for shared cache network, where each cache serves multiple users. Each user
has access to only a single cache and the number of caches is less than or
equal to the number of users. For this setting, we derive the optimal
worst-case delivery time for any user-to-cache association profile where each
such profile describes the number of users served by each cache. The optimality
is shown using an index-coding based converse. Further, we improve the delivery
scheme to accommodate redundant demands. Also, an optimal linear error
correcting delivery scheme is proposed for the worst-case demand scenario.
Next, we consider the Least Recently Sent (LRS) online coded caching scheme
where the caches need to be updated based on the sequence of demands made by
the users. Cache update happens if any of the demanded file was not partially
cached at the users. The update is done by replacing the least recently sent
file with the new file. But, the least recently sent file need not be unique.
In that case, there needs to be some ordering of the files which are getting
partially cached, or else centralized coordination would have to be assumed
which does not exist. If each user removes any of the least recently used files
at random, then the next delivery phase will not serve the purpose. A
modification is suggested for the scheme by incorporating an ordering of files.
Moreover, all the above results with shared caches are extended to the online
setting.

as high-throughput biology and social sciences. The approaches of the popular
Relief family of algorithms assign importances to features by iteratively
accounting for nearest relevant and irrelevant instances. Despite their high
utility, these algorithms can be computationally expensive and not-well suited
for high-dimensional sparse input spaces. In contrast, recent embedding-based
methods learn compact, low-dimensional representations, potentially
facilitating down-stream learning capabilities of conventional learners. This
paper explores how the Relief branch of algorithms can be adapted to benefit
from (Riemannian) manifold-based embeddings of instance and target spaces,
where a given embedding's dimensionality is intrinsic to the dimensionality of
the considered data set. The developed ReliefE algorithm is faster and can
result in better feature rankings, as shown by our evaluation on 20 real-life
data sets for multi-class and multi-label classification tasks. The utility of
ReliefE for high-dimensional data sets is ensured by its implementation that
utilizes sparse matrix algebraic operations. Finally, the relation of ReliefE
to other ranking algorithms is studied via the Fuzzy Jaccard Index.

workloads, based on container replication, using a hybrid of checkpointing and
replay. HyCoR derives from two insights regarding replication mechanisms: 1)
deterministic replay can overcome a key disadvantage of checkpointing alone --
unacceptably long delays of outputs to clients, and 2) checkpointing can
overcome a key disadvantage of active replication with deterministic replay
alone -- vulnerability to even rare replay failures due to an untracked
nondeterministic events. With HyCoR, the primary sends periodic checkpoints to
the backup and logs the outcomes of sources of nondeterminism. Outputs to
clients are delayed only by the short time it takes to send the corresponding
log to the backup. Upon primary failure, the backup replays only the short
interval since the last checkpoint, thus minimizing the window of
vulnerability. HyCoR includes a ""best effort"" mechanism that results in a high
recovery rate even in the presence of data races, as long as their rate is low.
The evaluation includes measurement of the recovery rate and recovery latency
based on fault injection. On average, HyCoR delays responses to clients by less
than 1ms and recovers in less than 1s. For a set of eight real-world
benchmarks, if data races are eliminated, the performance overhead of HyCoR is

is proposed to capture the essential components of the underactuated and
actuated part of the robotic walking. The robot walking gait is then directly
synthesized based on the H-LIP. We comprehensively characterize the periodic
orbits of the H-LIP and provably derive the stepping stabilization via its
step-to-step (S2S) dynamics, which is then utilized to approximate the S2S
dynamics of the horizontal state of the center of mass (COM) of the robotic
walking. The approximation facilities a H-LIP based stepping controller to
provide desired step sizes to stabilize the robotic walking. By realizing the
desired step sizes, the robot achieves dynamic and stable walking. The approach
is fully evaluated in both simulation and experiment on the 3D underactuated
bipedal robot Cassie, which demonstrates dynamic walking behaviors with both
high versatility and robustness.

incidence geometry. We formulate the following conjecture: Given a point set in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ that is covered by constant-sized sets of parallel hyperplanes,
there exists an affine subspace that accounts for a large (i.e.,
$2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}$) fraction of the incidences. Alternatively,
our conjecture may be interpreted linear-algebraically as follows: Any rank-$d$
matrix containing at most $O(1)$ distinct entries in each column contains a
submatrix of fractional size $2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}$, in which each
column contains one distinct entry. We prove that our conjecture is equivalent
to the log-rank conjecture.
  Motivated by the connections above, we revisit well-studied questions in
point-hyperplane incidence geometry without structural assumptions (i.e., the
existence of partitions). We give an elementary argument for the existence of
complete bipartite subgraphs of density $\Omega(\epsilon^{2d}/d)$ in any
$d$-dimensional configuration with incidence density $\epsilon$. We also
improve an upper-bound construction of Apfelbaum and Sharir (SIAM J. Discrete
Math. '07), yielding a configuration whose complete bipartite subgraphs are
exponentially small and whose incidence density is $\Omega(1/\sqrt d)$.
Finally, we discuss various constructions (due to others) which yield
configurations with incidence density $\Omega(1)$ and bipartite subgraph
density $2^{-\Omega(\sqrt d)}$.
  Our framework and results may help shed light on the difficulty of improving
Lovett's $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\operatorname{rank}(f)})$ bound (J. ACM '16) for the
log-rank conjecture; in particular, any improvement on this bound would imply
the first bipartite subgraph size bounds for parallel $3$-partitioned
configurations which beat our generic bounds for unstructured configurations.

capable of generating novel and perceptually realistic signals (e.g., images
and sound waves). With the emergence of deep models for graph structured data,
natural interests seek extensions of these generative models for graphs.
Successful extensions were seen recently in the case of learning from a
collection of graphs (e.g., protein data banks), but the learning from a single
graph has been largely under explored. The latter case, however, is important
in practice. For example, graphs in financial and healthcare systems contain so
much confidential information that their public accessibility is nearly
impossible, but open science in these fields can only advance when similar data
are available for benchmarking.
  In this work, we propose an approach to generating a doppelganger graph that
resembles a given one in many graph properties but nonetheless can hardly be
used to reverse engineer the original one, in the sense of a near zero edge
overlap. The approach is an orchestration of graph representation learning,
generative adversarial networks, and graph realization algorithms. Through
comparison with several graph generative models (either parameterized by neural
networks or not), we demonstrate that our result barely reproduces the given
graph but closely matches its properties. We further show that downstream
tasks, such as node classification, on the generated graphs reach similar
performance to the use of the original ones.

AGNs and BHXRBs. For this purpose, we construct a sample of low-mass AGNs
($M_{\rm BH}<3\times 10^{6} M_{\rm \odot}$) from the XMM-Newton archive and
measure frequency-resolved time delays between the soft (0.3-1 keV) and hard
(1-4 keV) X-ray emissions. We report that the soft band lags behind the hard
band emission at high frequencies $\sim[1.3-2.6]\times 10^{-3}$ Hz, which is
interpreted as a sign of reverberation from the inner accretion disc in
response to the direct coronal emission. At low frequencies ($\sim[3-8]\times
10^{-4}$ Hz), the hard band lags behind the soft band variations, which we
explain in the context of the inward propagation of luminosity fluctuations
through the corona. Assuming a lamppost geometry for the corona, we find that
the X-ray source of the sample extends at an average height and radius of $\sim
10r_{\rm g}$ and $\sim 6r_{\rm g}$, respectively. Our results confirm that the
scaling relations between the BH mass and soft lag amplitude/frequency derived
for higher-mass AGNs can safely extrapolate to lower-mass AGNs, and the
accretion process is indeed independent of the BH mass.

combine image classification and restoration tasks to improve the performance

explore the influence of degradation types and levels on four widely-used

polarimeter to be deployed on the Tibetan plateau at 5,250m above sea level.
AliCPT-1 is a 90/150 GHz 72 cm aperture, two-lens refracting telescope cooled
down to 4 K. Alumina lenses, 800mm in diameter, image the CMB in a 33.4{\deg}
field of view on a 636mm wide focal plane. The modularized focal plane consists
of dichroic polarization-sensitive Transition-Edge Sensors (TESes). Each module
includes 1,704 optically active TESes fabricated on a 150mm diameter silicon
wafer. Each TES array is read out with a microwave multiplexing readout system
capable of a multiplexing factor up to 2,048. Such a large multiplexing factor
has allowed the practical deployment of tens of thousands of detectors,
enabling the design of a receiver that can operate up to 19 TES arrays for a
total of 32,376 TESes. AliCPT-1 leverages the technological advancements in the
detector design from multiple generations of previously successful
feedhorn-coupled polarimeters, and in the instrument design from BICEP-3, but
applied on a larger scale. The cryostat receiver is currently under integration
and testing. During the first deployment year, the focal plane will be
populated with up to 4 TES arrays. Further TES arrays will be deployed in the
following years, fully populating the focal plane with 19 arrays on the fourth
deployment year. Here we present the AliCPT-1 receiver design, and how the
design has been optimized to meet the experimental requirements.

relational systems. A standard analysis task is to identify clusters of closely
related or densely interconnected nodes. Many graph algorithms for this task
are based on variants of the stochastic blockmodel, a random graph with
flexible cluster structure. However, there are few models and algorithms for
hypergraph clustering. Here, we propose a Poisson degree-corrected hypergraph
stochastic blockmodel (DCHSBM), a generative model of clustered hypergraphs
with heterogeneous node degrees and edge sizes. Approximate maximum-likelihood
inference in the DCHSBM naturally leads to a clustering objective that
generalizes the popular modularity objective for graphs. We derive a general
Louvain-type algorithm for this objective, as well as a a faster, specialized
""All-Or-Nothing"" (AON) variant in which edges are expected to lie fully within
clusters. This special case encompasses a recent proposal for modularity in
hypergraphs, while also incorporating flexible resolution and edge-size
parameters. We show that AON hypergraph Louvain is highly scalable, including
as an example an experiment on a synthetic hypergraph of one million nodes. We
also demonstrate through synthetic experiments that the detectability regimes
for hypergraph community detection differ from methods based on dyadic graph
projections. We use our generative model to analyze different patterns of
higher-order structure in school contact networks, U.S. congressional bill
cosponsorship, U.S. congressional committees, product categories in
co-purchasing behavior, and hotel locations from web browsing sessions, finding
interpretable higher-order structure. We then study the behavior of our AON
hypergraph Louvain algorithm, finding that it is able to recover ground truth
clusters in empirical data sets exhibiting the corresponding higher-order
structure.

require all the hidden layers to be wide with width at least $\Omega(N^8)$ ($N$

Unlike many recent proofs based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), our proof

quantities related to the changes of activation patterns during training.
Instead, we only need to track the evolution of the output at the last hidden
layer, which can be done much more easily thanks to the Lipschitz property of
ReLU. Some highlights of our setting: (i) all the layers are trained with
standard gradient descent, (ii) the network has standard parameterization as

associated horizon is the geometric horizon. We study this conjecture by
tracing the level--$0$ set of the complex scalar polynomial invariant,
$\mathcal{D}$, through a quasi-circular binary black hole merger. We
approximate these level--$0$ sets of $\mathcal{D}$ with level--$\varepsilon$

closely to the level--$\varepsilon$ sets of $|\mathcal{D}|$ and we also compare
with the level--$0$ sets of $\text{Re}(\mathcal{D})$. The analysis provides
evidence that the level--$\varepsilon$ sets track a unique geometric horizon.
By studying the behaviour of the zero sets of $\text{Re}(\mathcal{D})$ and
$\text{Im}(\mathcal{D})$ and also by studying the MOTSs and apparent horizons
of the initial black holes, we observe that the level--$\varepsilon$ set that

simulations of the CCSN explosion with a simplified neutrino-transport, in
which anti-correlated dipolar emissions of $\nu_{\rm e}$ and ${\bar \nu}_{\rm
e}$ are imposed. We then evaluate abundances and masses of the CCSN ejecta in a
post-processing manner. We find that the asymmetric $\nu$-emission leads to the
abundant ejection of $p$- and $n$-rich matter in the high-$\nu_{\rm e}$ and
-${\bar \nu}_{\rm e}$ hemispheres, respectively. It substantially affects the
abundances of the ejecta for elements heavier than Ni regardless of
progenitors, although those elements lighter than Ca are less sensitive. Based
on these results, we calculate the IMF-averaged abundances of the CCSN ejecta
with taking into account the contribution from Type Ia SNe. For $m_{\rm asy} =
10/3\%$ and $10\%$, where $m_{\rm asy}$ denotes the asymmetric degree of the
dipole components in the neutrino emissions, the averaged abundances for
elements lighter than Y are comparable to those of the solar abundances,
whereas those of elements heavier than Ge are overproduced in the case with
$m_{\rm asy} \ge 30\%$. Our result also suggests that the effect of the
asymmetric neutrino emissions is imprinted in the difference of abundance ratio
of [Ni/Fe] and [Zn/Fe] between the high-$\nu_{\rm e}$ and -${\bar \nu}_{\rm e}$
hemispheres, indicating that the future spectroscopic X-ray observations of a
CCSN remnant will bring evidence of the asymmetric neutrino emissions if exist.

in time, and it asymptotically converges to the exact direction of steepest
descent as $t \rightarrow \infty$. We rigorously prove that the online adjoint

downstream tasks such as audio retrieval. More recently, with the emergence of
deep learning technology, which has driven revolutionary changes in research

made for speaker diarization. In this paper, we review not only the historical
development of speaker diarization technology but also the recent advancements

Surface wetting helps the bonding between powder and substrate and the

around the laser beam and causes voids, discontinuities, and poor surface
roughness during the printing process. To better understand the transient
dynamics, a theoretical model with a simplified 2D configuration is developed
to investigate the underlying fluid flow and heat transfer, phase transition,
and interfacial instability along with the laser heating. We demonstrate that
the degree of wetting and fast solidification counter-balance the balling

progesterone activation of elephant shark PR. Cys-528 in elephant shark PR
corresponds to Gly-722 in human PR, which is essential for RU486 inhibition of
human PR. Confirming the importance of this site on elephant shark PR, RU486
inhibited progesterone activation of the Cys528Gly mutant PR. There also was a
decline in activation of elephant shark Cys528Gly PR by 11-deoxycortisol,
17-hydroxy-progesterone and 20beta-hydroxy-progesterone and an increase in

forced by a steady, uniform inflow and outflow of equal magnitude. The
resulting equilibrated circulation is characterized by unstable,
western-intensified boundary currents and flow along f/H contours atop the
ridge near the crest that closes the forced circulation. We find that bottom
Ekman dynamics localized to lateral boundary currents amplify the
stratification expected by simple stretching/squashing: a strongly stratified
bottom front (high PV anomaly) along the anticyclonic boundary current
associated with net upslope transport, and a bottom mixed layer front
(vanishing PV anomaly) localized to the cyclonic boundary current where there
is net downslope transport. PV anomalies associated with the two fronts are
advected by both the mean flow and eddies that result from baroclinic growth,
resulting in a spatial distribution where high PV is concentrated along the
ridge, and low PV is advected into the interior ocean downstream from the
ridge, at mid-depth. Using a framework of volume integrated PV conservation
which incorporates the net fluxes associated with bottom topography, we conform
an approximate integral balance between the PV injection from the bottom
boundary layer on the ridge and net advection across the ridge. Implications of
these findings for understanding the interplay between large scale and bottom
boundary dynamics are discussed.

FlowReg-O which performs pixel-wise deformations on a slice-by-slice basis for
fine tuning in 2D. The affine network regresses the 3D affine matrix based on a

FlowNet-Simple but with three loss components. The photometric loss minimizes
pixel intensity differences differences, the smoothness loss encourages similar
magnitudes between neighbouring vectors, and a correlation loss that is used to
maintain the intensity similarity between fixed and moving image slices. The
proposed method is compared to four open source registration techniques ANTs,
Demons, SE, and Voxelmorph. In total, 4643 FLAIR MR imaging volumes are used

which agents interact with one another over a network. Agents update their
behaviors in a random and decentralized manner according to a policy that
depends only on the agent's current state and an estimate of the macroscopic
population state, given by a weighted average of the neighboring states. When
the number of agents is large and the network is a complete graph (has
all-to-all information access), the macroscopic behavior of the population can
be well-approximated by a set of deterministic differential equations called a
{\it mean-field approximation}. For incomplete networks such characterizations
remained previously unclear, i.e., in general whether a suitable mean-field
approximation exists for the macroscopic behavior of the population. The paper
addresses this gap by establishing a generic theory describing when various
mean-field approximations are accurate for \emph{arbitrary} interaction
structures.
  Our results are threefold. Letting $W$ be the matrix describing agent
interactions, we first show that a simple mean-field approximation that
incorrectly assumes a homogeneous interaction structure is accurate provided
$W$ has a large spectral gap. Second, we show that a more complex mean-field
approximation which takes into account agent interactions is accurate as long
as the Frobenius norm of $W$ is small. Finally, we compare the predictions of
the two mean-field approximations through simulations, highlighting cases where

decision processes and recurrent neural network (RNN) based models have
achieved impressive progress on various time series forecasting tasks. However,
most of the existing methods focus on single-task forecasting problems by
learning separately based on limited supervised objectives, which often suffer
from insufficient training instances. As the Transformer architecture and other
attention-based models have demonstrated its great capability of capturing long
term dependency, we propose two self-attention based sharing schemes for
multi-task time series forecasting which can train jointly across multiple
tasks. We augment a sequence of paralleled Transformer encoders with an
external public multi-head attention function, which is updated by all data of
all tasks. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-task time series
forecasting tasks show that our proposed architectures can not only outperform
the state-of-the-art single-task forecasting baselines but also outperform the

improved level set method for computing reachable tubes is proposed in this
paper. The reachable tube is described as a sublevel set of a value function,
which is the viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with running
cost. We generalize the concept of reachable tubes and propose a new class of
reachable tubes, which are referred to as cost-limited one. In particular, a
performance index can be specified for the system, and a cost-limited reachable
tube is a set of initial states of the system's trajectories that can reach the
target set before the performance index increases to a given admissible cost.
Such a reachable tube can be obtained by specifying the corresponding running
cost function for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Different non-zero sublevel
sets of the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation at a certain
time point can be used to characterize the cost-limited reachable tubes with
different admissible costs (or the reachable tubes with different time
horizons), thus reducing the storage space consumption. Several examples are
provided to illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed method.

model, has taken the NLP community by storm. BERT-based models have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks, including dialog tasks. One of
the limitation of BERT is the lack of ability to handle long text sequence. By
default, BERT has a maximum wordpiece token sequence length of 512. Recently,
there has been renewed interest to tackle the BERT limitation to handle long
text sequences with the addition of new self-attention based architectures.
However, there has been little to no research on the impact of this limitation
with respect to dialog tasks. Dialog tasks are inherently different from other
NLP tasks due to: a) the presence of multiple utterances from multiple
speakers, which may be interlinked to each other across different turns and b)
longer length of dialogs. In this work, we empirically evaluate the impact of
dialog length on the performance of BERT model for the Next Response Selection
dialog task on four publicly available and one internal multi-turn dialog
datasets. We observe that there is little impact on performance with long
dialogs and even the simplest approach of truncating input works really well.

incorporate the estimated expert consistency into a predictive model through a

channel-spatial attention module for the FGVC, which employs the Grad-CAM to
supervise and constrain the attention weights by generating the coarse
localization maps. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
conduct comprehensive experiments on three popular FGVC datasets, including
CUB-$200$-$2011$, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets. The proposed
method outperforms the SOTA attention modules in the FGVC task. In addition,
visualizations of feature maps also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed

network, in which each user is linked with location information and $d$

weights) are usually inherently uncertain and can only be estimated with
bounded accuracy, because a human user is not able to designate exact values

model suitable for multi-criteria decision making, called multi-attributed
community (MAC), based on the concepts of $k$-core and a novel dominance
relationship specific to preferences. Given uncertain user preferences, namely,
an approximate representation of weights, the MAC search reports the exact
communities for each of the possible weight settings. We devise an elegant
index structure to maintain the dominance relationships, based on which two
algorithms are developed to efficiently compute the top-$j$ MACs. The
efficiency and scalability of our algorithms and the effectiveness of MAC model

extraordinary abilities in the field of computer vision. However, complex
network architectures challenge efficient real-time deployment and require
significant computation resources and energy costs. These challenges can be
overcome through optimizations such as network compression. Network compression
can often be realized with little loss of accuracy. In some cases accuracy may
even improve. This paper provides a survey on two types of network compression:
pruning and quantization. Pruning can be categorized as static if it is
performed offline or dynamic if it is performed at run-time. We compare pruning
techniques and describe criteria used to remove redundant computations. We
discuss trade-offs in element-wise, channel-wise, shape-wise, filter-wise,
layer-wise and even network-wise pruning. Quantization reduces computations by
reducing the precision of the datatype. Weights, biases, and activations may be
quantized typically to 8-bit integers although lower bit width implementations
are also discussed including binary neural networks. Both pruning and
quantization can be used independently or combined. We compare current
techniques, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, present compressed network
accuracy results on a number of frameworks, and provide practical guidance for
compressing networks.

  Channel Estimation for 3D Massive MIMO Communications",,,"10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3058019",,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Channel estimation has long been deemed as one of the most critical problems
in three-dimensional (3D) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), which
is recognized as the leading technology that enables 3D spatial signal
processing in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications and beyond.
Recently, by exploring the angular channel model and tensor decompositions, the
accuracy of single-user channel estimation for 3D massive MIMO communications
has been significantly improved given a limited number of pilot signals.
However, these existing approaches cannot be straightforwardly extended to the
multi-user channel estimation task, where the base station (BS) aims at
acquiring the channels of multiple users at the same time. The difficulty is
that the coupling among multiple users' channels makes the channel estimation
deviate from widely-used tensor decompositions. It gives a non-standard tensor
decomposition format that has not been well tackled. To overcome this
challenge, besides directly fitting the new tensor model for channel estimation
to the wireless data via block coordinate descent (BCD) method, which is prone
to the overfitting of noises or requires regularization parameter tuning, we
further propose a novel tuning-free channel estimation algorithm that can
automatically control the channel model complexity and thus effectively avoid
the overfitting. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the excellent
performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both estimation accuracy and
overfitting avoidance.

and analyse the gender bias present in contextual language models when tackling
the WinoBias pronoun resolution task. We find evidence that gender stereotype
correlates approximately negatively with gender skew in out-of-the-box models,
suggesting that there is a trade-off between these two forms of bias. We
investigate two methods to mitigate bias. The first approach is an online
method which is effective at removing skew at the expense of stereotype. The
second, inspired by previous work on ELMo, involves the fine-tuning of BERT
using an augmented gender-balanced dataset. We show that this reduces both skew
and stereotype relative to its unaugmented fine-tuned counterpart. However, we
find that existing gender bias benchmarks do not fully probe professional bias
as pronoun resolution may be obfuscated by cross-correlations from other
manifestations of gender prejudice. Our code is available online, at

correlated sensitive information $S$. We propose a linear method to generate
the sanitized data $Y$ with the same alphabet $\mathcal{Y} = \mathcal{X}$ that
attains local differential privacy (LDP) and log-lift at the same time. It is
revealed that both LDP and log-lift are inversely proportional to the
statistical distance between conditional probability $P_{Y|S}(x|s)$ and
marginal probability $P_{Y}(x)$: the closer the two probabilities are, the more
private $Y$ is. Specifying $P_{Y|S}(x|s)$ that linearly reduces this distance
$|P_{Y|S}(x|s) - P_Y(x)| = (1-\alpha)|P_{X|S}(x|s) - P_X(x)|,\forall s,x$ for
some $\alpha \in (0,1]$, we study the problem of how to generate $Y$ from the
original data $S$ and $X$. The Markov randomization/sanitization scheme
$P_{Y|X}(x|x') = P_{Y|S,X}(x|s,x')$ is obtained by solving linear equations.
The optimal non-Markov sanitization, the transition probability
$P_{Y|S,X}(x|s,x')$ that depends on $S$, can be determined by maximizing the
data utility subject to linear equality constraints. We compute the solution
for two linear utility function: the expected distance and total variance
distance. It is shown that the non-Markov randomization significantly improves
data utility and the marginal probability $P_X(x)$ remains the same after the
linear sanitization method: $P_Y(x) = P_X(x), \forall x \in \mathcal{X}$.

compounds may display a more local or more itinerant character depending on the
interplay of the exchange interactions among the $4f$ electrons and the Kondo
coupling between $4f$ and conduction electrons. For the more itinerant case,
the materials form heavy-fermions once the Kondo effect is developed at low
temperatures. Hence, a temperature variation occurs in the electronic structure
that can be traced by investigating the optical conductivity ($\sigma(\omega)$)
spectra. Remarkably, the temperature variation in the $\sigma(\omega)$ spectrum
is still present in the more localized case, even though the Kondo effect is
strongly suppressed. Here, we clarify the local and itinerant character in the
electronic structure by investigating the temperature dependence in the
$\sigma(\omega)$ spectra of various Ce and Yb compounds with a tetragonal
ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type crystal structure. We explain the temperature change in a
unified manner. Above temperatures of about 100 K, the temperature dependence
of the $\sigma(\omega)$ spectra is mainly due to the electron-phonon
interaction, while the temperature dependence below is due to the Kondo effect.

Recently, non-autoregressive decoding has been proposed in machine translation
to speed up the inference time by generating all words in parallel. Typically,
these models use the word-level cross-entropy loss to optimize each word
independently. However, such a learning process fails to consider the

formulates NAG as a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where element
positions in the target sequence are viewed as agents that learn to
cooperatively maximize a sentence-level reward. On MSCOCO image captioning
benchmark, our NAG method achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art

been the inspiration for the improvement in the performance of robotic systems.
These mechanisms include the adaptability of their locomotion to any change
registered in the environment through their biological sensors. In this regard,
we aim to replicate such kind of adaptability in legged robots through a
Spiking Central Pattern Generator. This Spiking Central Pattern Generator
generates different locomotion (rhythmic) patterns which are driven by an
external stimulus, that is, the output of a Force Sensitive Resistor connected
to the robot to provide feedback. The Spiking Central Pattern Generator
consists of a network of five populations of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons
designed with a specific topology in such a way that the rhythmic patterns can
be generated and driven by the aforementioned external stimulus. Therefore, the
locomotion of the end robotic platform (any-legged robot) can be adapted to the
terrain by using any sensor as input. The Spiking Central Pattern Generator
with adaptive learning has been numerically validated at software and hardware
level, using the Brian 2 simulator and the SpiNNaker neuromorphic platform for
the latest. In particular, our experiments clearly show an adaptation in the
oscillation frequencies between the spikes produced in the populations of the
Spiking Central Pattern Generator while the input stimulus varies. To validate
the robustness and adaptability of the Spiking Central Pattern Generator, we
have performed several tests by variating the output of the sensor. These
experiments were carried out in Brian 2 and SpiNNaker; both implementations
showed a similar behavior with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.905.

sparse coding discovers patterns from the data set, which can be used to
estimate a set of stimulus parameters by simple readout. In this study, we
chose a model of stereo vision to test our hypothesis. We used the Locally
Competitive Algorithm (LCA), followed by a na\""ive Bayes classifier, to infer
stereo disparity. From the results we report three observations. First,
disparity inference was successful with this naturalistic processing pipeline.
Second, an expanded, highly redundant representation is required to robustly
identify the input patterns. Third, the inference error can be predicted from
the number of active coefficients in the LCA representation. We conclude that
sparse coding can generate a suitable general representation for subsequent

  Access in 5G URLLC","Accepted by IEEE TIFS",,,,"eess.SP cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Secure wireless access in ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC),
which is a critical aspect of 5G security, has become increasingly important
due to its potential support of grant-free configuration. In grant-free URLLC,
precise allocation of different pilot resources to different users that share
the same time-frequency resource is essential for the next generation NodeB
(gNB) to exactly identify those users under access collision and to maintain
precise channel estimation required for reliable data transmission. However,
this process easily suffers from attacks on pilots. We in this paper propose a
quantum learning based nonrandom superimposed coding method to encode and
decode pilots on multidimensional resources, such that the uncertainty of
attacks can be learned quickly and eliminated precisely. Particularly,
multiuser pilots for uplink access are encoded as distinguishable subcarrier
activation patterns (SAPs) and gNB decodes pilots of interest from observed
SAPs, a superposition of SAPs from access users, by joint design of attack mode
detection and user activity detection though a quantum learning network (QLN).
We found that the uncertainty lies in the identification process of codeword
digits from the attacker, which can be always modelled as a black-box model,
resolved by a quantum learning algorithm and quantum circuit. Novel analytical
closed-form expressions of failure probability are derived to characterize the
reliability of this URLLC system with short packet transmission. Simulations
how that our method can bring ultra-high reliability and low latency despite
attacks on pilots.

bottleneck in developing these IBFD networks. We design and analyze a
subarray-based hybrid beamforming IBFD-IAB system with the RF beamformers
obtained via RF codebooks given by a modified Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm.
The SI is canceled in three stages, where the first stage of antenna isolation
is assumed to be successfully deployed. The second stage consists of the
optical domain (OD)-based RF cancellation, where cancelers are connected with
the RF chain pairs. The third stage is comprised of the digital cancellation
via successive interference cancellation followed by minimum mean-squared error

zero-forcing at the IAB-node transmitter. Simulations show that under 400 MHz

tasks in the spatially resolved SED fitting. The SED fitting module uses the
Bayesian inference technique with two kinds of posteriors sampling methods:
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and random densely-sampling of parameter space
(RDSPS). We test the performance of the SED fitting module using mock SEDs of
simulated galaxies from IllustrisTNG. The SED fitting with both posteriors
sampling methods can recover physical properties and star formation histories
of the IllustrisTNG galaxies well. We further test the performance of piXedfit
modules by analyzing 20 galaxies observed by the CALIFA and MaNGA surveys. The
data comprises of 12-band imaging data from GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE, and
the IFS data from CALIFA or MaNGA. piXedfit can spatially match (in resolution
and sampling) of the imaging and IFS data. By fitting only the photometric
SEDs, piXedfit can predict the spectral continuum, $\text{D}_{\rm n}4000$,
$H_{\alpha}$, and $H_{\beta}$ well. The star formation rate (SFR) derived by
piXedfit is consistent with that derived from $H_{\alpha}$ emission. The RDSPS
method gives equally good fitting results as the MCMC and it is much faster

worldwide, proton and carbon are the most used heavily charged particles in
heavy ion therapy. However, there is a recent increasing trend in using new ion
beams. Each heavy ion has a different effect on the target. As each heavy ion
moves through the tissue, they lose enormous energy in collisions, so their
range is not long. Ionization accounts for the majority of this loss in energy.
During this interaction of the heavily charged particles with the target, the
particles do not only ionize, but also lose energy with the recoil. Recoil
occurs by atom-to-atom collisions. With these collisions, crystalline atoms
react with different combinations and form cascades in accordance with their
energies. Thus, secondary particles create ionization and recoil. In this
study, recoil values of boron, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen beams in the water
phantom were computed in the energy range of 2.0-2.5 GeV using Monte Carlo
simulation and the results were compared with carbon. It was observed that
there is a regular increase in the recoil peak amplitude for carbon and boron
ions, unlike oxygen and nitrogen where such a regularity could not be seen.
Moreover, the gaps in the crystal structure increased as the energy increases.

one-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (DBEC) in widely varying
trapping geometries. The chief goal is to characterize the energy levels of
this system by analytical methods and the significance of this study arises
from the commonly known fact that in the presence of interactions the energy
levels of a trapped BEC are hard to calculate analytically. The latter
characterization is achieved by a matching of the PR energies to energy levels
of the confining trap using perturbative methods. Further, this work reveals
the role of the interplay between dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and trapping
geometry in defining the energies and amplitudes of the PRs. The PRs are
induced by a negative Gaussian potential whose depth oscillates with time.
Moreover, the DDI play a role in this induction. The dynamics of this system is
modeled by the time-dependent Gross- Pitaevskii equation (TDGPE) that is
numerically solved by the Crank-Nicolson method. The PRs are discussed basing
on analytical methods: first, it is shown that it is possible to reproduce PRs
by the Lagrangian variational method that are similar to the ones obtained from
TDGPE. Second, the energies at which the PRs arise are closely matched with the
energy levels of the corresponding trap calculated by time-independent
perturbation theory. Third, the most probable transitions between the trap
energy levels yielding PRs are determined by time-dependent perturbation
theory. The most significant result of this work is that we have been able to
characterize the above mentioned energy levels of a DBEC in a complex trapping
potential.

changing their shape, even if they have no net angular momentum. Similarly,
swimmers immersed in ""perfect fluids"" are able to use cyclic shape changes to
both translate and rotate even if the swimmer-fluid system has no net linear or
angular momentum. Finally, systems fully constrained by direct nonholonomic
constraints (e.g., passive wheels) can push against these constraints to move
through the world. Previous work has demonstrated that the net displacement
induced by these shape changes corresponds to the amount of *constraint
curvature* that the gaits enclose.
  To properly assess or optimize the utility of a gait, however, we must also
consider the time or resources required to execute it: A gait that produces a
small displacement per cycle, but that can be executed in a short time, may
produce a faster average velocity than a gait that produces a large
displacement per cycle, but takes much longer to complete a cycle at the same
average instantaneous effort.
  In this paper, we consider two effort-based cost functions for assessing the
costs associated with executing these cycles. For each of these cost functions,
we demonstrate that fixing the average instantaneous cost to a unit value
allows us to transform the effort costs into time-to-execute costs for any
given gait cycle. We then illustrate how the interaction between the constraint
curvature and these costs leads to characteristic geometries for optimal
cycles, in which the gait trajectories resemble elastic hoops distended from

  The paper first explores the Laplace operator and the Poisson equation and
studies the corresponding Green's functions under various boundary conditions

These examples include several novel forms of the Green's function that, to the
author's knowledge, have not previously been presented. Next we present a

factors in college students in different periods over the course of a semester
and models their relationships with students' academic performance. The data
analyzed was collected through smartphones and Fitbit. The use of machine
learning models derived from the gathered data was employed to observe the
extent of students' behavior associated with their GPA, lifestyle, physical
health, mental health, and personality attributes. A mutual agreement method
was used in which rather than looking at the accuracy of results, the model
parameters and weights of features were used to find common behavioral trends.
From the results of the model creation, it was determined that the most
significant indicator of academic success defined as a higher GPA, was the
places a student spent their time. Lifestyle and personality factors were
deemed more significant than mental and physical factors. This study will
provide insight into the impact of different factors and the timing of those
factors on students' academic performance.

  Management","58 pages, 9 tables, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Human resource management technologies have moved from biometric surveillance
to emotional artificial intelligence (AI) that monitor employees' engagement
and productivity, analyze video interviews and CVs of job applicants. The rise
of the US$20 billion emotional AI industry will transform the future workplace.
Yet, besides no international consensus on the principles or standards for such
technologies, there is a lack of cross-cultural research on future job seekers'
attitude toward such use of AI technologies. This study collects a
cross-sectional dataset of 1,015 survey responses of international students
from 48 countries and 8 regions worldwide. A majority of the respondents (52%)
are concerned about being managed by AI. Following the hypothetico-deductivist
philosophy of science, we use the MCMC Hamiltonian approach and conduct a
detailed comparison of 10 Bayesian network models with the PSIS-LOO method. We
consistently find having a higher income, being male, majoring in business,
and/or self-rated familiarity with AI correlate with a more positive view of
emotional AI in the workplace. There is also a stark cross-cultural and
cross-regional difference. Our analysis shows people from economically less
developed regions (Africa, Oceania, Central Asia) tend to exhibit less concern
for AI managers. And for East Asian countries, 64% of the Japanese, 56% of the
South Korean, and 42% of the Chinese professed the trusting attitude. In
contrast, an overwhelming majority of 75% of the European and Northern American
possesses the worrying/neutral attitude toward being managed by AI. Regarding
religion, Muslim students correlate with the most concern toward emotional AI
in the workplace. When religiosity is higher, the correlation becomes stronger
for Muslim and Buddhist students.

  and Novel Solution","8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in AAAI 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted considerable attention
recently owing to its various advanced applications such as document
understanding, automatic marking and intelligent education. Most existing works
decoupled this problem into several independent sub-tasks of text spotting
(text detection and recognition) and information extraction, which completely
ignored the high correlation among them during optimization. In this paper, we
propose a robust visual information extraction system (VIES) towards real-world
scenarios, which is a unified end-to-end trainable framework for simultaneous
text detection, recognition and information extraction by taking a single
document image as input and outputting the structured information.
Specifically, the information extraction branch collects abundant visual and
semantic representations from text spotting for multimodal feature fusion and
conversely, provides higher-level semantic clues to contribute to the
optimization of text spotting. Moreover, regarding the shortage of public
benchmarks, we construct a fully-annotated dataset called EPHOIE
(https://github.com/HCIILAB/EPHOIE), which is the first Chinese benchmark for
both text spotting and visual information extraction. EPHOIE consists of 1,494
images of examination paper head with complex layouts and background, including
a total of 15,771 Chinese handwritten or printed text instances. Compared with
the state-of-the-art methods, our VIES shows significant superior performance
on the EPHOIE dataset and achieves a 9.01% F-score gain on the widely used
SROIE dataset under the end-to-end scenario.

from other intrinsic processes and noise in naturalistic functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). Most studies rely on inter-subject correlations (ISC)
of low-level regional activity and neglect varying responses in individuals. We
propose a novel, data-driven approach based on low-rank plus sparse (L+S)
decomposition to isolate stimulus-driven dynamic changes in brain functional
connectivity (FC) from the background noise, by exploiting shared network
structure among subjects receiving the same naturalistic stimuli. The
time-resolved multi-subject FC matrices are modeled as a sum of a low-rank
component of correlated FC patterns across subjects, and a sparse component of
subject-specific, idiosyncratic background activities. To recover the shared
low-rank subspace, we introduce a fused version of principal component pursuit
(PCP) by adding a fusion-type penalty on the differences between the rows of
the low-rank matrix. The method improves the detection of stimulus-induced
group-level homogeneity in the FC profile while capturing inter-subject
variability. We develop an efficient algorithm via a linearized alternating
direction method of multipliers to solve the fused-PCP. Simulations show
accurate recovery by the fused-PCP even when a large fraction of FC edges are
severely corrupted. When applied to natural fMRI data, our method reveals FC
changes that were time-locked to auditory processing during movie watching,
with dynamic engagement of sensorimotor systems for speech-in-noise. It also
provides a better mapping to auditory content in the movie than ISC.

activities of animal neurons during the training of animals performing
behavioral tasks. A key problem is that they fail to record all the relevant
neurons in the animal brain. To alleviate this problem, we develop an RNN-based
Actor-Critic framework, which is trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to
solve two tasks analogous to the monkeys' decision-making tasks. The trained
model is capable of reproducing some features of neural activities recorded
from animal brain, or some behavior properties exhibited in animal experiments,
suggesting that it can serve as a computational platform to explore other
cognitive functions. Furthermore, we conduct behavioral experiments on our
framework, trying to explore an open question in neuroscience: which episodic
memory in the hippocampus should be selected to ultimately govern future
decisions. We find that the retrieval of salient events sampled from episodic
memories can effectively shorten deliberation time than common events in the
decision-making process. The results indicate that salient events stored in the
hippocampus could be prioritized to propagate reward information, and thus
allow decision-makers to learn a strategy faster.

error correcting codes and employ messages that are computed in an
autoregressive manner. The outgoing messages of the variable nodes are
conditioned not only on the incoming messages, but also on an estimation of the
SNR and on the inferred codeword and on two downstream computations: (i) an
extended vector of parity check outcomes, (ii) the mismatch between the
inferred codeword and the re-encoding of the information bits of this codeword.
Unlike most learned methods in the field, our method violates the symmetry
conditions that enable the other methods to train exclusively with the
zero-word. Despite not having the luxury of training on a single word, and the
inability to train on more than a small fraction of the relevant sample space,
we demonstrate effective training. The new method obtains a bit error rate that
outperforms the latest methods by a sizable margin.
