that impede liberation. This paper addresses the particular case of Black folk
in the United States, but is relevant to the global decolonization movement.
Using notions of abolition and infrastructures of feeling developed by Ruth
Wilson Gilmore, I view Historically Black Colleges and Universities ( HBCUs )
as a particular kind of abolitionist project, created for the explicit purpose
of nurturing and sustaining Black excellence particularly within the sciences.
I then examine how artificial intelligence (AI) in particular and computing in
general have contributed to racial oppression and the further confinement and
diminishing of Black existence. I conclude by examining how the space held by
HBCUs in computing might contribute to a re-imagining of AI as a technology
that enhances the possibility and actualization of Black life.

present a low-security quality expressed by vulnerabilities that can be
exploited by cyber-criminals. This lack of quality and security is particularly
dangerous if the software which contains the vulnerabilities is deployed in

Capture-the-Flag(CTF) events, have shown promising results in improving secure
coding awareness of software developers in the industry. The challenges in the
CTF event, to be useful, must be adequately designed to address the target
group. This paper presents novel contributions by investigating which challenge
types are adequate to improve software developers' ability to write secure code
in an industrial context. We propose 1) six challenge types usable in the
industry context, and 2) a structure for the CTF challenges. Our investigation
also presents results on 3) how to include hints and penalties into the
cyber-security challenges. We evaluated our work through a survey with security

exceedingly difficult to carry out even small computations. In this paper we
are concerned with the modelling of noise in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) computers. We focus on three error groups that represent the main
sources of noise during a computation and present quantum channels that model
each source. We engineer a noise model that combines all three noise channels
and simulates the evolution of the quantum computer using its calibrated error
rates. We run various experiments of our model, showcasing its behaviour
compared to other noise models and an IBM quantum computer. We find that our
model provides a better approximation of the quantum computer's behaviour than
the other models. Following this, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the
parameters used by our noise model, bringing the behaviour of the model even
closer to the quantum computer. Finally, a comparison between the pre and
postoptimization parameters reveals that, according to our model, certain
operations can be more or less erroneous than the hardware-calibrated
parameters show.

asset management, which can be divided into three dimensions. The first
dimension covers liability liquidity risk (or funding liquidity) modeling, the
second dimension focuses on asset liquidity risk (or market liquidity)
modeling, and the third dimension considers asset-liability liquidity risk
management (or asset-liability matching). The purpose of this research is to
propose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity
stress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019)
and are useful for fund managers. The review of the academic literature and
professional research studies shows that there is a lack of standardized and
analytical models. The aim of this research project is then to fill the gap
with the goal to develop mathematical and statistical approaches, and provide
appropriate answers.
  In this first part that focuses on liability liquidity risk modeling, we
propose several statistical models for estimating redemption shocks. The
historical approach must be complemented by an analytical approach based on
zero-inflated models if we want to understand the true parameters that
influence the redemption shocks. Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate
population models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral
approaches. Once these different statistical models are calibrated, the second
big issue is the risk measure to assess normal and stressed redemption shocks.
Finally, the last issue is to develop a factor model that can translate stress
scenarios on market risk factors into stress scenarios on fund liabilities.

streamwise-varying wall rotation are performed. This control method is able to
achieve drag reduction and even relaminarize the flow under certain control
parameters at low Reynolds number. Two control parameters, which are velocity
amplitude and wavelength, are considered. An annular boundary layer, called
Spatial Stokes Layer (SSL), is formed by the wall rotation. Based on the
thickness of SSL, two types of drag reduction scenarios are identified. When
the thickness is low, the SSL acts as a spacer layer, obstructing the impact of
fluids against the wall and hence reducing the shear stress. The flow
structures in the outer layer are less affected and are stretched in streamwise
direction due to the increased velocity gradient. Within the SSL, the
turbulence intensity diminishes dramatically. When the thickness is large, a
streamwise wavy pattern of near-wall low-speed streaks is formed. The
orientation of streaks is found to lag behind the direction of local mean
velocity in phase and conform to the direction of local resultant shear stress.
The streamwise scale of near-wall flow structures is significantly reduced,
resulting in the disruption of downstream development of flow structures and
hence leading to the drag reduction. Besides, it is found that it requires both
large enough thickness of SSL and velocity amplitude to relaminarize the
turbulence. The relaminarization mechanism is that the annular SSL can
continuously absorb energy from wall-normal stress due to the rotation effect,
thereby the turbulence self-sustaining process could not be maintained. For the
relaminarization cases, the laminar state is stable to even extremely large
perturbations, which possibly makes laminar state the only fixed point for the
whole system.

obfuscated gradients, we find we are unable to build a reliable backward

model reaches a good natural accuracy with a hybrid backpropagation - synthetic

adversarial examples. We find the combination of a random projection and
binarization in the optical system also improves robustness against various
types of black-box attacks. Finally, our hybrid training method builds robust

prove that if there exists a family of quasimodes (as is the case when the

eigenvalues of the standard variational formulation of the exterior Dirichlet
problem (recall that this formulation involves truncating the exterior domain

  Our motivation for proving this result is that a) the finite-element method

especially near-zero ones, plays a key role in understanding how iterative
solvers such as the generalised minimum residual method (GMRES) behave when
used to solve linear systems, in particular those arising from the
finite-element method. The result proved in this paper is thus the first step
towards rigorously understanding how GMRES behaves when applied to

number of consumed resources that firmly provides hybrid CV-DV entanglement for

CV states is introduced. Each of such CV states is first superimposed on a
beam-splitter with a delocalized photon and then detected by a photo-detector
behind the beam-splitter. Detection of any photon number heralds generation of
a hybrid CV-DV entangled state in the outputs, independent of
transmission/reflection coefficients of the beam-splitter and size of the input
CV state. Nonclassical properties of the generated state are studied and their
entanglement degree in terms of negativity is calculated. There are wide
domains of values of input parameters of the experimental setup that can be
chosen to make the generated state maximally entangled. The proposed method is
also applicable to truncated versions of the input CV states. We also propose a

wide range of applications including but not limited to forecasting electricity
consumption, traffic, and air quality. Traditional forecasting models rely on
rolling averages, vector auto-regression and auto-regressive integrated moving
averages. On the other hand, deep learning and matrix factorization models have
been recently proposed to tackle the same problem with more competitive
performance. However, one major drawback of such models is that they tend to be
overly complex in comparison to traditional techniques. In this paper, we
report the results of prominent deep learning models with respect to a
well-known machine learning baseline, a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree
(GBRT) model. Similar to the deep neural network (DNN) models, we transform the
time series forecasting task into a window-based regression problem.
Furthermore, we feature-engineered the input and output structure of the GBRT
model, such that, for each training window, the target values are concatenated
with external features, and then flattened to form one input instance for a
multi-output GBRT model. We conducted a comparative study on nine datasets for
eight state-of-the-art deep-learning models that were presented at top-level
conferences in the last years. The results demonstrate that the window-based
input transformation boosts the performance of a simple GBRT model to levels
that outperform all state-of-the-art DNN models evaluated in this paper.

PDV system, an interferometer is used for measuring frequency shifts due to the
Doppler effect from the target motion. However, the sampling rate of the
electronics could limit the velocity range of a PDV system. A four-wave-mixing
(FWM) time lens applies a quadratic temporal phase to an optical signal within
a nonlinear FWM medium (such as an integrated photonic waveguide or highly
nonlinear optical fiber). By spectrally isolating the mixing product, termed
the idler, and with appropriate lengths of dispersion prior and after to this
FWM time lens, a temporally magnified version of the input signal is generated.
Therefore, the frequency shifts of PDV can be ""slowed down"" with the
magnification factor $M$ of the time lens. $M=1$ corresponds to a regular PDV
without a TL. $M=10$ has been shown to be feasible for a TL-PDV. Use of this

lower bandwidth electronics. TL-PDV will open up new avenues for various
dynamic materials experiments.

success of semantic segmentation approaches. We propose a concept of
object-by-object learning technique to detect 11 types of facial skin lesions
using semantic segmentation methods. Detecting individual skin lesion in a
dense group is a challenging task, because of ambiguities in the appearance of
the visual data. We observe that there exist co-occurrent visual relations
between object classes (e.g., wrinkle and age spot, or papule and whitehead,
etc.). In fact, rich contextual information significantly helps to handle the
issue. Therefore, we propose REthinker blocks that are composed of the locally
constructed convLSTM/Conv3D layers and SE module as a one-shot attention
mechanism whose responsibility is to increase network's sensitivity in the
local and global contextual representation that supports to capture ambiguously
appeared objects and co-occurrence interactions between object classes.
Experiments show that our proposed model reached MIoU of 79.46% on the test of
a prepared dataset, representing a 15.34% improvement over Deeplab v3+ (MIoU of
64.12%).

provides only partial information about nonlocal response composed from both

how a nonlocal shot noise measurement delivers a missing puzzle piece in NSN
InAs nanowire-based devices. We demonstrate that in a trivial superconducting
phase quasiparticle response is practically charge-neutral, dominated by the
heat transport component with a thermal conductance being on the order of
conductance quantum. This is qualitatively explained by numerous Andreev
reflections of a diffusing quasiparticle, that makes its charge completely
uncertain. Consistently, strong fluctuations and sign reversal are observed in
the sub-gap nonlocal conductance, including occasional Andreev rectification
signals. Our results prove conductance and noise as complementary measurements
to characterize quasiparticle transport in superconducting proximity devices.

extraction of closed shapes) in order to achieve such a task. The evaluation of
our approach on a public dataset shows its effectiveness for extracting the

identify the threats in the earlier stages of the system design activity. In
this paper, we propose a threat modelling approach to analyze and mitigate the
botnet attacks in an IoT smart home use case. The proposed methodology
identifies the development-level and application-level threats in smart home

learning in latent variables models. Training these models by maximizing the
evidence (marginal likelihood) is typically intractable. Thus, a common
approximation is to maximize the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) instead.
Variational autoencoders (VAE) are a powerful and widely-used class of
generative models that optimize the ELBO efficiently for large datasets.
However, the VAE's default Gaussian choice for the prior imposes a strong
constraint on its ability to represent the true posterior, thereby degrading
overall performance. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) would be a richer prior,
but cannot be handled efficiently within the VAE framework because of the
intractability of the Kullback-Leibler divergence for GMMs. We deviate from the
common VAE framework in favor of one with an analytical solution for Gaussian
mixture prior. To perform efficient inference for GMM priors, we introduce a
new constrained objective based on the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence, which can be
computed analytically for GMMs. This new objective allows us to incorporate
richer, multi-modal priors into the autoencoding framework. We provide

synchronous BFT consensus protocols that are meant to serve as core consensus
engines for Proof of Stake blockchain systems. While the state-of-the-art
solutions attain virtually optimal performance under this theoretical model,
there is still room for improvement, as several practical aspects of such
systems are not captured by this model. Most notably, during regular execution,
due to financial incentives in such systems, one expects an overwhelming
fraction of nodes to honestly follow the protocol rules and only few of them to
be faulty, most likely due to temporary network issues. Intuitively, the fact
that almost all nodes behave honestly should result in stronger confidence in
blocks finalized in such periods, however it is not the case under the
classical model, where finality is binary.
  We propose Highway, a new consensus protocol that is safe and live in the
classical partially synchronous BFT model, while at the same time offering
practical improvements over existing solutions. Specifically, block finality in
Highway is not binary but is expressed by fraction of nodes that would need to
break the protocol rules in order for a block to be reverted. During periods of
honest participation finality of blocks might reach well beyond 1/3 (as what
would be the maximum for classical protocols), up to even 1 (complete
certainty). Having finality defined this way, Highway offers flexibility with
respect to the configuration of security thresholds among nodes running the
protocol, allowing nodes with lower thresholds to reach finality faster than
the ones requiring higher levels of confidence.

renormalisation of the model both in a fully on-shell (OS) scheme and a mixed
scheme combining on-shell (for the masses) and a $\overline{{\rm MS}}$ approach
when the partial invisible width is closed and does not allow the use of a full
OS scheme. The scale dependence introduced by the mixed scheme is shown to be
tracked through an analysis of a parametrisation of the tree-level
cross-section and the $\beta$ constant of a specific coupling. We discuss how
to minimise the scale dependence. The theoretical uncertainty brought by the
scale dependence leads us to introduce a new criterion on the perturbativity of
the IDM. This criterion further delimits the allowed parameter space which we
investigate carefully by including a host of constraints, both theoretical and
experimental, including in particular, new data from the LHC. We come up with a
set of benchmark points that cover three different mechanisms for a viable
relic density of DM: {\it i)} a dominance of co-annihilation into a fermion
pair, { \it ii)} annihilation into 2 vector bosons of which one is off-shell
that requires the calculation of a $2 \to 3$ process at one-loop, {\it iii)}
annihilation that proceeds through the very narrow standard model Higgs
resonance. Since the $2 \to 3$ vector boson channel features in all three
channels and is essentially a build up on the simpler annihilation to OS vector
bosons, we study the latter in detail in the present paper. We confirm again
that the corrected cross-sections involve a parameter that represents
rescattering in the dark sector that a tree-level computation in not sensitive

on the renormalisation scale. These combined effects should be taken into

literature, while two additional ones (ME1 and ME4) are new methods. Methods.
As far as possible, the synthetic orbits were compared with the orbits of the
observed meteoroids. For quantitative comparison, we applied a few tests: the
chi-square distance and the nearest neighbor NN_N tests used in previous works,
and one-dimensional chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, as well as a
two-dimensional K-S test implemented in this study. To estimate a general
property of the orbital sample, we proposed the use of the entropy H_N of the
data set based on the nearest neighbor distances. Finally, we did a cluster
analysis of the synthetic orbits. We calculated and compared the values of the
orbital similarity thresholds. Results. We showed that generating 'realistic'
meteoroid orbits and testing their quality is a complex issue. An assessment of
the quality of the generated orbits depends on the type of test applied, and it
refers to the sample of the observed orbits used. Different tests give
different assessments. However, in practice, the investigated methods produced
similar results if they were applied correspondingly.

mimic the diffusion of diseases, information, and opinions in real-world
systems. Existing theoretical approaches to the characterization of the models
in terms of microscopic configurations rely on some approximation of
independence among dynamical variables, thus introducing a systematic bias in
the prediction of the ground-truth dynamics. Here, we develop a combinatorial
framework based on the approximation that spreading may occur only along the
shortest paths connecting pairs of nodes. The approximation overestimates
dynamical correlations among node states and leads to biased predictions.
Systematic bias is, however, pointing in the opposite direction of existing
approximations. We show that the combination of the two biased approaches
generates predictions of the ground-truth dynamics that are more accurate than
the ones given by the two approximations if used in isolation. We further take
advantage of the combinatorial approximation to characterize theoretical
properties of some inference problems, and show that the reconstruction of
microscopic configurations is very sensitive to both the place where and the
time when partial knowledge of the system is acquired.

extrapolated nonlinear force-free field show that the first two, impulsive
flares, SOL2015-06-21T01:42, result from the confined eruption of highly
sheared low-lying flux, presumably a seed flux rope. The eruption spawns a
vertical current sheet, where magnetic reconnection creates flare ribbons and
loops, a nonthermal microwave source, and a sigmoidal hot channel which can
only be interpreted as a magnetic flux rope. Until the subsequent long-duration
flare, SOL2015-06-21T02:36, the sigmoid's elbows expand, while its center
remains stationary, suggesting non-equilibrium but not yet instability. The
""flare reconnection"" during the confined eruptions acts like ""tether-cutting
reconnection"" whose flux feeding of the rope leads to instability. The
subsequent full eruption is seen as an accelerated rise of the entire hot
channel, seamlessly evolving into the fast halo CME. Both the confined and
ejective eruptions are consistent with the onset of the torus instability in
the dipped decay index profile which results from the region's two-scale
magnetic structure. We suggest that the formation or enhancement of a
non-equilibrium but stable flux rope by confined eruptions is a generic process

changing lighting condition that can alter the appearance of the objects or the

present a high throughput robust active lighting-based camera system that
generates consistent images in all lighting conditions. We detail experiments
that show the consistency in images quality leading to relatively fewer images
to train deep neural networks for the task of object detection. We further
present results from field experiment under extreme lighting conditions where
images without active lighting significantly lack to provide consistent

different RG flows, and have correlation functions controlled by a continuously
varying exponent $\eta$, which characterizes the anomalous dimension of the
bosonic field. We show that when $\eta>1$, these phases are stable with respect
to all symmetric perturbations. These theories may be of relevance to several
physical situations, including frustrated quantum magnets, rotons in superfluid
He, and superconductors with finite-momentum pairing. As a concrete
application, we show that coupling a Bose-Luttinger liquid to a conventional

argue that this may provide an explanation for the non-Fermi liquid resistivity
observed in the paramagnetic phase of MnSi.

communications have errors? How much communication noise can FL handle and what
is its impact to the learning performance? This work is devoted to answering
these practically important questions by explicitly incorporating both uplink
and downlink noisy channels in the FL pipeline. We present several novel
convergence analyses of FL over simultaneous uplink and downlink noisy
communication channels, which encompass full and partial clients participation,
direct model and model differential transmissions, and non-independent and
identically distributed (IID) local datasets. These analyses characterize the
sufficient conditions for FL over noisy channels to have the same convergence
behavior as the ideal case of no communication error. More specifically, in
order to maintain the O(1/T) convergence rate of FedAvg with perfect
communications, the uplink and downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for direct
model transmissions should be controlled such that they scale as O(t^2) where t
is the index of communication rounds, but can stay constant for model
differential transmissions. The key insight of these theoretical results is a
""flying under the radar"" principle - stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an
inherent noisy process and uplink/downlink communication noises can be
tolerated as long as they do not dominate the time-varying SGD noise. We
exemplify these theoretical findings with two widely adopted communication
techniques - transmit power control and diversity combining - and further
validating their performance advantages over the standard methods via extensive
numerical experiments using several real-world FL tasks.

contour. To aid our investigation, we extend the coset construction to account
for $p$-form symmetries at zero and finite temperature. Additionally we
investigate how, out of equilibrium, symmetries of the action need not lead to
meaningful conserved currents at the level of the equations of motion. For
reasons that will become apparent, we term symmetries with conserved currents
St\""uckelberg symmetries and those without meaningful conserved currents
non-St\""uckelberg symmetries (NSS). Ordinarily any action constructed
exclusively from building-blocks furnished by the coset construction will have
St\""uckelberg symmetries associated with each symmetry generator. To expand the
set of systems describable by the coset construction, we devise a method by
which NSS generators can be included as well. While 0-form NSS are quite common
in non-equilibrium effective actions, the introduction of $p$-form NSS is
novel. We use these $p$-form NSS to investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking
of $p$-form symmetries. We find that in non-equilibrium systems, whether or not
a symmetry appears spontaneously broken can depend on the time-scale over which
the system is observed. Finally, using our new coset construction, we formulate
actions for a number of systems including chemically reacting fluids,
Yang-Mills theory, Chern-Simons theory, magnetohydrodynamic systems, and dual

leading FT implementations of the T gate in 2D color codes under circuit noise
across a wide range of parameters in regimes of practical interest. We report
that implementing the T gate via code switching to a 3D color code does not
offer substantial savings over state distillation in terms of either space or

($V\simeq8.3$~mag), evolved ($T_{\rm eff, giant}\simeq4440$~K, and $L_{\rm

0.01~M_\odot$, nearly circular binary ($P=59.9$ d, $e\simeq 0$). V723 Mon is a
known variable star, previously classified as an eclipsing binary, but its
All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS), Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT),
and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves are those of a
nearly edge-on ellipsoidal variable. Detailed models of the light curves
constrained by the period, radial velocities and stellar temperature give an
inclination of $87.0^\circ{}^{+1.7^{\circ}}_{-1.4^{\circ}} $, a mass ratio of
$q\simeq0.33\pm0.02$, a companion mass of $M_{\rm comp}=3.04\pm0.06~M_\odot$, a
stellar radius of $R_{\rm giant}=24.9\pm0.7~R_\odot$, and a giant mass of
$M_{\rm giant}=1.00\pm0.07~ M_\odot$. We identify a likely non-stellar, diffuse
veiling component with contributions in the $B$ and $V$-band of ${\sim}63\%$
and ${\sim}24\%$, respectively. The SED and the absence of continuum eclipses
imply that the companion mass must be dominated by a compact object. We do
observe eclipses of the Balmer lines when the dark companion passes behind the
giant, but their velocity spreads are low compared to observed accretion disks.
The X-ray luminosity of the system is $L_{\rm X}\simeq7.6\times10^{29}~\rm
ergs~s^{-1}$, corresponding to $L/L_{\rm edd}{\sim}10^{-9}$. The simplest
explanation for the massive companion is a single compact object, most likely a
black hole in the ""mass gap"".

an effective theory that describes the coupling of the fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) system with photons in resonant Raman scattering experiments. Our theory
is applicable in the regime when the energy of the photons $\omega_0$ is close
to the energy gap $E_G$, but $|\omega_0-E_G|$ is much larger than the energy
scales of the quantum Hall problem. In the literature, it is often assumed that
Raman scattering measures the dynamic structure factor $S(\omega,\mathbf{k})$
of the FQH. However, in this paper, we find that the light scattering spectrum
measured in the experiments are proportional to the spectral densities of a
pair of operators which we identified with the spin-2 components of the kinetic
part of the stress tensor. In contrast with the dynamic structure factor, these
spectral densities do not vanish in the long-wavelength limit $k\to0$. We show
that Raman scattering with circularly polarized light can measure the spin of
the magnetoroton excitation in the FQH system. We give an explicit expression
for the kinetic stress tensor that works on any Landau level and which can be
used for numerical calculations of the spectral densities that enter the Raman
scattering amplitudes. We propose that Raman scattering provides a way to probe
the bulk of the $\nu=5/2$ quantum Hall state to determine its nature.

Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey.
At $z\sim1$, cluster mass function studies are rare regardless of wavelength
and have never been attempted from an optical/near-infrared perspective. This
work serves as a proof of concept that $z\sim1$ cluster mass functions are
achievable without supplemental X-ray or Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data.
Measurements of the cluster mass function provide important contraints on
cosmological parameters and are complementary to other probes. With ORELSE, a
new cluster finding technique based on Voronoi tessellation Monte-Carlo (VMC)
mapping, and rigorous purity and completeness testing, we have obtained
$\sim$240 galaxy overdensity candidates in the redshift range $0.55<z<1.37$ at
a mass range of $13.6<\log(M/M_{\odot})<14.8$. This mass range is comparable to
existing optical cluster mass function studies for the local universe. Our
candidate numbers vary based on the choice of multiple input parameters related
to detection and characterization in our cluster finding algorithm, which we
incorporated into the mass function analysis through a Monte-Carlo scheme. We
find cosmological constraints on the matter density of $\Omega_{m} =
0.250^{+0.104}_{-0.099}$ and on the amplitude of fluctuations of $\sigma_{8} =
1.150^{+0.260}_{-0.163}$. While our $\Omega_{m}$ value is close to concordance,
our $\sigma_{8}$ value is $\sim2\sigma$ higher because of the inflated observed
number densities compared to theoretical mass function models owing to how our
survey targeted overdense regions. With Euclid and several other large,
unbiased optical surveys on the horizon, VMC mapping will enable optical/NIR
cluster cosmology at redshifts much higher than what has been possible before.

at this redshift, more recent studies indicate SPT-CL J2106-5844 is undergoing
a major merger, and is not an isolated system with a singular, well-defined
halo. We use sensitive, high spatial resolution measurements from ALMA and ACA
of the thermal SZ effect to reconstruct the pressure distribution of the
intracluster medium in this system. These measurements are coupled with radio
observations from the EMU pilot survey, using ASKAP and the ATCA to search for
diffuse nonthermal emission. Further, to better constrain the thermodynamic
structure of the cluster, we complement our analysis with reprocessed archival
$Chandra$ observations. We fit the ALMA+ACA SZ data in $uv$-space using a
Bayesian forward modelling technique. The ASKAP and ATCA data are processed and
imaged to specifically highlight any potential diffuse radio emission. In the
ALMA+ACA SZ data, we reliably identify at high significance two main gas
components associated with the mass clumps inferred from weak lensing. Our
statistical test excludes at the ~9.9$\sigma$ level the possibility of
describing the system with a single SZ component. While the components had been
more difficult to identify in the X-ray data alone, we find that the bimodal
gas distribution is supported by the X-ray hardness distribution. The EMU radio
observations reveal a diffuse radio structure ~400 kpc in projected extent
along the northwest-southeast direction, indicative of strong activity from the
active galactic nucleus within the brightest cluster galaxy. Interestingly, a
putative optical star-forming filamentary structure detected in the HST image

stellar initial mass function (IMF) may not be universal, suggesting
specifically that the IMF grows increasingly top-heavy with decreasing
metallicity and increasing gas density. Non-canonical IMFs can greatly affect
the evolution of GCs, mainly because the high end determines how many black
holes (BHs) form. Here we compute a new set of GC models, varying the IMF
within observational uncertainties. We find that GCs with top-heavy IMFs lose
most of their mass within a few Gyr through stellar winds and tidal stripping.
Heating of the cluster through BH mass segregation greatly enhances this
process. We show that, as they approach complete dissolution, GCs with
top-heavy IMFs can evolve into 'dark clusters' consisting of mostly BHs by
mass. In addition to producing more BHs, GCs with top-heavy IMFs also produce
many more binary BH (BBH) mergers. Even though these clusters are short-lived,
mergers of ejected BBHs continue at a rate comparable to, or greater than, what
is found for long-lived GCs with canonical IMFs. Therefore these clusters,
although they are no longer visible today, could still contribute significantly
to the local BBH merger rate detectable by LIGO/Virgo, especially for sources
with higher component masses well into the BH mass gap. We also report that one
of our GC models with a top-heavy IMF produces dozens of intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs) with masses $M>100\,{\rm M_\odot}$, including one with
$M>500\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Ultimately, additional gravitational wave observations
will provide strong constraints on the stellar IMF in old GCs and the formation
of IMBHs at high redshift.

occurs and give nontrivial examples in various dimensions, including in
strongly coupled QFTs. Unraveling the anomalies of TQFTs leads us to develop
the construction of the Hilbert spaces, the action of operators and the modular

beyond the Local Group. We measure a flat radial age gradient ($m_{\rm age}
\sim +0.01_{-0.08}^{+0.07}$ log Gyr kpc$^{-1}$) and a flat-to-positive
metallicity gradient ($m_{\rm [Fe/H]} \sim +0.08_{-0.11}^{+0.11}$ dex
kpc$^{-1}$), which are inconsistent with the gradients measured in similarly
pressure-supported dwarf galaxies. We also measure a flat-to-negative [Mg/Fe]
gradient ($m_{\rm [Mg/Fe]} \sim -0.18_{-0.17}^{+0.17}$ dex kpc$^{-1}$) such
that the central $1.5$ kpc of DF44 has stellar population parameters comparable
to metal-poor globular clusters. Overall, DF44 does not have internal
properties similar to other dwarf galaxies and is inconsistent with it having
been puffed up through a prolonged, bursty star-formation history, as suggested
by some simulations. Rather, the evidence indicates that DF44 experienced an
intense epoch of ""inside-out"" star formation and then quenched early and
catastrophically, such that star-formation was cut off more quickly than in
canonical dwarf galaxies.

the red giant branch (TRGB) calibrated from the maser distance to NGC4258.
These two SBF calibrations are consistent with each other and with theoretical
predictions from stellar population models. From a weighted average of the
Cepheid and TRGB calibrations, we derive $H_0=73.3{\,\pm\,}0.7{\,\pm\,}2.4$
km/s/Mpc, where the error bars reflect the statistical and systematic
uncertainties. This result accords well with recent measurements of $H_0$ from
Type~Ia supernovae, time delays in multiply lensed quasars, and water masers.
The systematic uncertainty could be reduced to below 2% by calibrating the SBF
method with precision TRGB distances for a statistical sample of massive

effective potential receives equal contributions at leading order from
monopoles associated with the entire $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ root system. Even though
the center symmetry of the semi-Abelian gauge theory is given by
$\mathbb{Z}_N$, we observe that the string tensions do not obey the $N$-ality
rule and carry more detailed information on the representations of the gauge
group. We find that this refinement is due to the presence of non-invertible
topological lines as a remnant of $\mathrm{U}(1)^{N-1}$ one-form symmetry in
the original Abelian lattice theory. Upon adding charged particles
corresponding to $W$-bosons, such non-invertible symmetries are explicitly
broken so that the $N$-ality rule should emerge in the deep infrared regime.

considered to be a major cosmological probe of dark energy. Our capacity to
constrain the dark energy equation of state relies on the accurate knowledge of
the galaxy mean redshift $\langle z \rangle$. We investigate the possibility of
measuring $\langle z \rangle$ with an accuracy better than $0.002\,(1+z)$, in
ten tomographic bins spanning the redshift interval $0.2<z<2.2$, the
requirements for the cosmic shear analysis of Euclid. We implement a
sufficiently realistic simulation to understand the advantages,
complementarity, but also shortcoming of two standard approaches: the direct
calibration of $\langle z \rangle$ with a dedicated spectroscopic sample and
the combination of the photometric redshift probability distribution function
(zPDF) of individual galaxies. We base our study on the Horizon-AGN
hydrodynamical simulation that we analyse with a standard galaxy spectral
energy distribution template-fitting code. Such procedure produces photometric
redshifts with realistic biases, precision and failure rate. We find that the
Euclid current design for direct calibration is sufficiently robust to reach
the requirement on the mean redshift, provided that the purity level of the
spectroscopic sample is maintained at an extremely high level of $>99.8\%$. The
zPDF approach could also be successful if we debias the zPDF using a
spectroscopic training sample. This approach requires deep imaging data, but is
weakly sensitive to spectroscopic redshift failures in the training sample. We
improve the debiasing method and confirm our finding by applying it to
real-world weak-lensing data sets (COSMOS and KiDS+VIKING-450).

At the same time, the introduction of topological physics in photonic systems

design photonic devices with novel functionalities and inherent robustness
against fabrication disorders. Here, we use topological design principles to
theoretically propose the generation of optical frequency combs and temporal
Kerr solitons in a two-dimensional array of coupled ring resonators that
creates a synthetic magnetic field for photons and exhibits topological edge
states. We show that these topological edge states constitute a traveling-wave
super-ring resonator that leads to the generation of coherent nested optical
frequency combs, and self-formation of nested temporal solitons and Turing
rolls that are remarkably phase-locked over >40 rings. In the nested soliton
regime, our system operates as a pulsed optical frequency comb and achieves a
mode efficiency of >50%, an order of magnitude higher than single ring
frequency combs that are theoretically limited to only ~5%. Furthermore, we
show that the topological nested solitons are robust against defects in the
lattice. This topological frequency comb works in a parameter regime that can
be readily accessed using existing low loss integrated photonic platforms like
silicon-nitride. Our results could pave the way for efficient on-chip optical
frequency combs, and investigations of various other soliton solutions in
conjunction with synthetic gauge fields and topological phenomena in large

solving unseen new tasks by leveraging experiences obtained from previous
tasks. We consider the setting where all tasks (MDPs) share the same
environment dynamic except reward function. In this setting, the MDP dynamic is
a good knowledge to transfer, which can be inferred by uniformly random policy.
However, trajectories generated by uniform random policy are not useful for
policy improvement, which impairs the sample efficiency severely. Instead, we
observe that the binary MDP dynamic can be inferred from trajectories of any
policy which avoids the need of uniform random policy. As the binary MDP
dynamic contains the state structure shared over all tasks we believe it is
suitable to transfer. Built on this observation, we introduce a method to infer
the binary MDP dynamic on-line and at the same time utilize it to guide state
embedding learning, which is then transferred to new tasks. We keep state
embedding learning and policy learning separately. As a result, the learned
state embedding is task and policy agnostic which makes it ideal for transfer
learning. In addition, to facilitate the exploration over the state space, we
propose a novel intrinsic reward based on the inferred binary MDP dynamic. Our
method can be used out-of-box in combination with model-free RL algorithms. We
show two instances on the basis of \algo{DQN} and \algo{A2C}. Empirical results
of intensive experiments show the advantage of our proposed method in various

so-called Mean Field Games (MFGs) theory. The proposed framework is the
combination of two main components including (i) the reaction of travelers to
the traffic congestion by choosing their departure times to optimize their
travel cost; and (ii) the aggregation of the actions of the travelers, which
determines the system level of service. In this paper, we first present a
continuous departure time choice model and investigate the equilibria of the
system. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of the equilibrium and
characterize the DTUE. Then, a discrete approximation of the system is provided
based on deterministic differential game models to numerically obtain the
equilibrium of the system. To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we
compare it with the departure time choice models in the literature. We apply
our framework to a standard test case and observe that the solutions obtained
based on our model are 5.6\% better in terms of relative cost compared to the
solutions determined based on models in the literature. Moreover, our proposed
model converges with less number of iterations than the reference solution
method in the literature. Finally, the model is scaled up to the real test case
corresponding to the whole Lyon Metropolis with real demand pattern. The
results show that the proposed framework is able to tackle much larger test
case than usual to includes multiple preferred travel times and heterogeneous
trip lengths more accurately than existing models in the literature.

surfacing thematic elements of text corpora. These models remain challenging to
optimize and often require a ""human-in-the-loop"" approach where domain experts
use their knowledge to steer and adjust. However, the fragility,
incompleteness, and opacity of these models means even minor changes could
induce large and potentially undesirable changes in resulting model. In this
paper we conduct a simulation-based analysis of human-centered interactions
with topic models, with the objective of measuring the sensitivity of topic
models to common classes of user actions. We find that user interactions have
impacts that differ in magnitude but often negatively affect the quality of the
resulting modelling in a way that can be difficult for the user to evaluate. We
suggest the incorporation of sensitivity and ""multiverse"" analyses to topic
model interfaces to surface and overcome these deficiencies.

clinical sites in the body. By bending around sensitive anatomical structures,
steerable needles have the potential to reduce the invasiveness of many medical
procedures. However, inserting these needles with curved trajectories increases
the risk of tissue damage due to perpendicular forces exerted on the
surrounding tissue by the needle's shaft, potentially resulting in lateral
shearing through tissue. Such forces can cause significant damage to
surrounding tissue, negatively affecting patient outcomes. In this work, we
derive a tissue and needle force model based on a Cosserat string formulation,
which describes the normal forces and frictional forces along the shaft as a
function of the planned needle path, friction model and parameters, and tip
piercing force. We propose this new force model and associated cost function as
a safer and more clinically relevant metric than those currently used in motion
planning for steerable needles. We fit and validate our model through physical
needle robot experiments in a gel phantom. We use this force model to define a
bottleneck cost function for motion planning and evaluate it against the
commonly used path-length cost function in hundreds of randomly generated 3-D
environments. Plans generated with our force-based cost show a 62% reduction in
the peak modeled tissue force with only a 0.07% increase in length on average
compared to using the path-length cost in planning. Additionally, we
demonstrate the ability to plan motions with our force-based cost function in a
lung tumor biopsy scenario from a segmented computed tomography (CT) scan. By
planning motions for the needle that aim to minimize the modeled
needle-to-tissue force explicitly, our method plans needle paths that may
reduce the risk of significant tissue damage while still reaching desired
targets in the body.

networks with the help of random graphs is offered by hyperbolic models,
centred around the idea of placing nodes in a low-dimensional hyperbolic space,
and connecting node pairs with a probability depending on the hyperbolic
distance. It is widely appreciated that these models can generate random graphs
that are small-world, highly clustered and scale-free at the same time; thus,
reproducing the most fundamental common features of real networks. In the
present work, we focus on a less well-known property of the
popularity-similarity optimisation (PSO) model and the
$\mathbb{S}^1/\mathbb{H}^2$ model from this model family, namely that the
networks generated by these approaches also contain communities for a wide
range of the parameters, which was certainly not an intention at the design of
the models. We extracted the communities from the studied networks using
well-established community finding methods such as Louvain, Infomap and label
propagation. The observed high modularity values indicate that the community
structure can become very pronounced under certain conditions. In addition, the
modules found by the different algorithms show good consistency, implying that
these are indeed relevant and apparent structural units. Since the appearance
of communities is rather common in networks representing real systems as well,
this feature of hyperbolic models makes them even more suitable for describing
real networks than thought before.

that the existence of committed volunteers can promote cooperation but adding

monitoring data to test this hypothesis for more objects is lacking. By
applying our novel photometric approach to TESS data, we extract a
high-precision lightcurve of the closest brown dwarfs, which form the binary
system Luhman 16AB. Our observations, that cover about 100 rotations of Luhman
16B, display continuous lightcurve evolution. The periodogram analysis shows
that the rotational period of the component that dominates the lightcurve is
5.28 h. We also find evidence for periods of 2.5 h, 6.94 h, and 90.8 h. We show
that the 2.5 h and 5.28 h periods emerge from Luhman 16B and that they consist
of multiple, slightly shifted peaks, revealing the presence of high-speed jets
and zonal circulation in this object. We find that the lightcurve evolution is
well fit by the planetary-scale waves model, further supporting this
interpretation. We argue that the 6.94 h peak is likely the rotation period of
Luhman 16A. By comparing the rotational periods to observed v sin(i)
measurements, we show that the two brown dwarfs are viewed at angles close to
their equatorial planes. We also describe a long-period (P~91 h) evolution in
the lightcurve, which we propose emerges from the vortex-dominated polar
regions. Our study paves the way toward direct comparisons of the predictions

Because their functionality arises from cell-cell interactions, they are also a
model system for collective organization among cells. There are currently two
contradictory pictures of this organization: the hub-cell idea pointing at
leaders who coordinate the others, and the electrophysiological theory
describing all cells as equal. We use new data and computational modeling to
reconcile these pictures. We find via a network representation of interacting
$\beta$-cells that leaders emerge naturally (confirming the hub-cell idea), yet
all cells can take the hub role following a perturbation (in line with
electrophysiology). A useful network representation of complex systems is via
pairwise cross-correlations between a system's constituents. Recently, attempts
have been made at representing pancreatic $\beta$-cells collectives as
networks, giving birth to the concept of hub cells, which contradicts
established electrophysiological theory. Here, we reconcile the hub-cell idea
with electrophysiology using empirical and computational methods. While the
former reveals the functional importance of hubs, the latter show that hubs are
an emergent property of communication among identical peers. Thus, individual
cells are perfectly capable of playing the hub role, but in line with
electrophysiology, they do not have to be genetically predisposed to do so.
This points to an ultra-robust architecture of $\beta$-cell collectives and
underpins some of their vital features.

language processing requires the ability to extract recursively nested tree
structures. However, it remains unclear whether and how this code could be
implemented in neural circuits. Recent advances in Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs), which achieve near-human performance in some language tasks, provide a
compelling model to address such questions. Here, we present a new framework to
study recursive processing in RNNs, using subject-verb agreement as a probe
into the representations of the neural network. We trained six distinct types
of RNNs on a simplified probabilistic context-free grammar designed to
independently manipulate the length of a sentence and the depth of its
syntactic tree. All RNNs generalized to subject-verb dependencies longer than
those seen during training. However, none systematically generalized to deeper
tree structures, even those with a structural bias towards learning nested tree
(i.e., stack-RNNs). In addition, our analyses revealed primacy and recency
effects in the generalization patterns of LSTM-based models, showing that these
models tend to perform well on the outer- and innermost parts of a
center-embedded tree structure, but poorly on its middle levels. Finally,
probing the internal states of the model during the processing of sentences
with nested tree structures, we found a complex encoding of grammatical
agreement information (e.g. grammatical number), in which all the information
for multiple words nouns was carried by a single unit. Taken together, these
results indicate how neural networks may extract bounded nested tree
structures, without learning a systematic recursive rule.

where multiple elements move randomly, the rate by which they physically
interact is proportional to the product of their densities. This law predicts
the rate of elementary chemical reactions and many other phenomena in biology,
physics, and social sciences. Using combinatorial mathematics, this study shows
that this law inherently overestimates the rate of homotypic interactions, i.e.
whereby identical elements interact with each other. This overestimation
depends on how many of them interact simultaneously (homointeractivity), and on
the difference between the density of interactants and homointeractivity. When
this difference is large, as in most systems, the rate expression given by the
law of mass action for any homotypic interaction is corrected by dividing it by
the factorial of homointeractivity. This modification should yield better
agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental determinations of
interaction rates in a wide range of natural phenomena.

achievements of turbulence research in classical fluids. For quantum fluids
such as atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, superfluid helium, and superfluid
neutron stars, turbulence can also exist in the presence of a chaotic tangle of
evolving quantized vortex lines. However, due to the lack of suitable
experimental tools to directly probe the vortex-tangle motion, so far little is
known about possible scaling laws that characterize the velocity correlations
and trajectory statistics of the vortices in quantum-fluid turbulence (QT).
Acquiring such knowledge could greatly benefit the development of advanced
statistical models of QT. Here we report an experiment where a tangle of
vortices in superfluid $^4$He are decorated with solidified deuterium tracer
particles. Under experimental conditions where these tracers follow the motion
of the vortices, we observed an apparent superdiffusion of the vortices. Our
analysis shows that this superdiffusion is not due to L\'{e}vy flights, i.e.,
long-distance hops that are known to be responsible for superdiffusion of
random walkers. Instead, a previously unknown power-law scaling of the
vortex-velocity temporal correlation is uncovered as the cause. This finding
may motivate future research on hidden scaling laws in QT.

exploits statistical redundancies in the data according to its prior

statistics of data, but has some information about a transformation that is
going to be applied to it, we propose a novel method for data compression
called reverse compression. It is defined in such a way that works for both
classical and quantum information processes, and furthermore relies exclusively
on the channel to be used: all input data leading to indistinguishable outputs
is compressed to the same state, regardless of their prior distribution.
Moreover, this process can be characterized as a higher order operation within
the type of preprocessing. We also consider as an example the application of
the method to the classical and quantum erasure channel. The examples suggest
that noiseless reverse compression can take place only in trivial cases,

participants to jointly train a model without having to share their private,
potentially sensitive local datasets with others. Despite its benefits, FL is
vulnerable to so-called backdoor attacks, in which an adversary injects
manipulated model updates into the federated model aggregation process so that
the resulting model will provide targeted false predictions for specific
adversary-chosen inputs. Proposed defenses against backdoor attacks based on
detecting and filtering out malicious model updates consider only very specific
and limited attacker models, whereas defenses based on differential
privacy-inspired noise injection significantly deteriorate the benign
performance of the aggregated model. To address these deficiencies, we
introduce FLAME, a defense framework that estimates the sufficient amount of
noise to be injected to ensure the elimination of backdoors. To minimize the
required amount of noise, FLAME uses a model clustering and weight clipping
approach. This ensures that FLAME can maintain the benign performance of the
aggregated model while effectively eliminating adversarial backdoors. Our
evaluation of FLAME on several datasets stemming from application areas
including image classification, word prediction, and IoT intrusion detection
demonstrates that FLAME removes backdoors effectively with a negligible impact

training a conversion optimizer model, one of the most crucial aspects is
handling delayed feedback with respect to conversions, which can happen
multiple times with varying delay. This task is difficult, as the delay
distribution is different for each advertiser, is long-tailed, often does not
follow any particular class of parametric distributions, and can change over
time. We tackle these challenges using an unbiased estimation model based on
three core ideas. The first idea is to split the label as a sum of labels with
different delay buckets, each of which trains only on mature label, the second
is to use thermometer encoding to increase accuracy and reduce inference cost,
and the third is to use auxiliary information to increase the stability of the
model and to handle drift in the distribution.

pericenter, destroying the inner disk in the process, and then intersects with
the disk a second time at radii ranging from a few to hundreds of times the

form as the dilute stream is stopped by the denser disk. Compton cooling of the
shocked material produces hard X-rays, even soft gamma-rays, with most of the
energy emitted between ~10 keV and 1 MeV. The luminosity follows the
mass-return rate, peaking between ~$10^{42}$ and $10^{44}$ erg/s. The X-ray
hardness and the smoothness of the light curve provide possible means for
distinguishing the second impact from ordinary AGN flares, which exhibit softer

Bi-2212 developed during a partial melt heat treatment should favor high $J_c$,
even though its $\sim$15$^{\circ}$ full width at half maximum (FWHM)
grain-to-grain misorientation is well beyond the commonly accepted
strong-coupling range. Its ability to be strongly overdoped should be valuable
too, since underdoped cuprate grain boundaries are widely believed to be weakly
linked. Accordingly, we here study property changes after oxygen underdoping
the optimized, overdoped wire. While $J_c$ and vortex pinning diminish
significantly in underdoped wires, we were not able to develop the prominent
weak-link signature (a hysteretic $J_c$(H) characteristic) evident in even the
very best Bi-2223 tapes with a $\sim$ 15$^{\circ}$ FWHM uniaxial texture. We
attribute the high $J_c$ and lack of weak link signature in our Bi-2212 round

produced by partial-melt processing of Bi-2212 which enables $c$-axis
Brick-Wall current flow when $ab$-plane transport is blocked. We conclude that
the presently optimized biaxial texture of Bi-2212 intrinsically constitutes a
strongly coupled current path, regardless of its oxygen doping state.

of the cosmological constant does not depend on one's renormalization scheme,
whether or not a fine tuning is involved does. The cosmological constant
problem is avoided in the sense that the renormalization process no longer
requires finetuning. This is achieved essentially by renormalization
scheme-independence of a physical quantity, which in turn is assured by bare
perturbation theory. The proposal shifts the cosmological constant problem to a
peculiarity of the consequent perturbation series for the Higgs mass (and other
massive sectors of the Standard Model); the peculiarity is interpreted as an
indicator of new physics after the expected mathematical structure of the

effective potential is observed and its interpretation is given. A consistency
check in the cosmology context is suggested.

in quantum sensing, communication, and computation, it is important to design
error correction codes suitable for these systems against various different
types of noises. While most efforts aim at protecting qubits encoded into the
infinite dimensional Hilbert space of a bosonic mode, [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125,
080503 (2020)] proposed an error correction code to maintain the
infinite-dimensional-Hilbert-space nature of bosonic systems by encoding a
single bosonic mode into multiple bosonic modes. Enabled by
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states as ancilla, the code overcomes the no-go
theorem of Gaussian error correction. In this work, we generalize the error
correction code to the scenario with general correlated and heterogeneous
Gaussian noises, including memory effects. We introduce Gaussian pre-processing
and post-processing to convert the general noise model to an independent but
heterogeneous collection of additive white Gaussian noise channels and then
apply concatenated codes in an optimized manner. To evaluate the performance,
we develop a theory framework to enable the efficient calculation of the noise
standard deviation after the error correction, despite the non-Gaussian nature
of the codes. Our code provides the optimal scaling of the residue noise
standard deviation with the number of modes and can be widely applied to
distributed sensor-networks, network communication and composite quantum memory

system operational models, which typically represent key physical and economic

reflect regional resource opportunities, data availability, and applications of
interest. While there are model intercomparison papers, there is however no
model-agnostic characterization and systematic overview of the state-of-the-art
process representations in operational power system models. To address our
objective, we conceptualize power system operational models with four core
processes: physical grid assets (generation, transmission, loads, and storage),
model objectives and purpose, institutions and decision agents, and performance
metrics. We taxonomize the representations of these core processes based on a
review of 23 existing open-source and commercial models. As we acknowledge the
computational burden of certain representations, we leverage this taxonomy to
describe tradeoffs in process fidelity and tractability that have been adopted

tradeoffs are used to identify technical gaps and recommend future model

rational tetra-inner function of degree $n$. The prescription exploits a known
construction of the finite Blaschke products of given degree which satisfy some
interpolation conditions with the aid of a Pick matrix formed from the
interpolation data. It is known that if $x= (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is a rational
tetra-inner function of degree $n$, then $x_1 x_2 - x_3$ either is identically
$0$ or has precisely $n$ zeros in the closed unit disc $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$,
counted with multiplicity.
  It turns out that a natural choice of data for the construction of a rational
tetra-inner function $x= (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ consists of the points in
$\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ for which $x_1 x_2 - x_3=0$ and the values of $x$ at
these points.

identifiable model: directed mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (DiMMSB)
for directed mixed membership networks. DiMMSB allows that row nodes and column
nodes of the adjacency matrix can be different and these nodes may have
distinct community structure in a directed network. We also develop an
efficient spectral algorithm called DiSP designed based on simplex structures
inherent in the left and right singular vectors of the population adjacency
matrix to estimate the mixed memberships for both row nodes and column nodes in
a directed network. We show that DiSP is asymptotically consistent under mild
conditions by providing error bounds for the inferred membership vectors of
each row node and each column node using delicate spectral analysis. Numerical
results on computer-generated directed mixed membership networks support our
theoretical findings and show that our DiSP outperforms its competitor in both
error rates and run-time. Applications of DiSP to real-world directed networks
demonstrate the advantages of DiSP in studying the asymmetric structure of

method and the emerging graph convolutional network (GCN) are two popular
semi-supervised solutions to this problem. The LP method is not effective in
modeling node attributes and labels jointly or facing a slow convergence rate

initial label vector embeddings, each iteration of GraphHop contains two steps:
1) label aggregation and 2) label update. In Step 1, each node aggregates its
neighbors' label vectors obtained in the previous iteration. In Step 2, a new
label vector is predicted for each node based on the label of the node itself
and the aggregated label information obtained in Step 1. This iterative
procedure exploits the neighborhood information and enables GraphHop to perform
well in an extremely small label rate setting and scale well for very large

by A.M. Turing (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) in 1950. Following one important
implication of Turing Test for enabling a machine with a human-like behavior or
performance, we define human-like robustness (HLR) for AI machines. The
objective of the new definition aims to enforce AI machines with HLR, including
to evaluate them in terms of HLR. A specific task is discussed only on object
identification, because it is the most common task for every person in daily
life. Similar to the perspective, or design, position by Turing, we provide a
solution of how to achieve HLR AI machines without constructing them and
conducting real experiments. The solution should consists of three important
features in the machines. The first feature of HLR machines is to utilize
common sense from humans for realizing a causal inference. The second feature
is to make a decision from a semantic space for having interpretations to the
decision. The third feature is to include a ""human-in-the-loop"" setting for
advancing HLR machines. We show an ""identification game"" using proposed design
of HLR machines. The present paper shows an attempt to learn and explore
further from Turing Test towards the design of human-like AI machines.

identify the most anomalous observations. A pair of algorithms are defined here
to be similar if they assign their highest scores to roughly the same small

extremal similarity in scoring distributions through a novel upper quadrant
modeling approach, and contrast it with tail and other dependence measures. We
illustrate our method with simulated and real experiments, applying spectral

generalization of the recently introduced Quantum Overlapping Tomography to the
problem of reconstruction of readout noise with restricted locality. The
procedure allows to characterize $k$-local measurement cross-talk on $N$-qubit

(Rigetti's) devices to test both the noise model and the error-mitigation
scheme, and obtain an average reduction of errors by a factor $>22$ ($>5.5$)

Furthermore, we study numerically the effects of readout noise on the

  We present a novel method that aims to control for the latent space when
estimating a DAG by iteratively deriving proxies for the latent space from the
residuals of the inferred model. Under mild assumptions, our method improves
structural inference of Gaussian graphical models and enhances identifiability
of the causal effect. In addition, when the model is being used to predict

the critical threshold and size of the giant component analytically and
validate the theoretical results with numerical simulations. We find a rich
phase transition phenomenon as we tune the inter-layer coupling strength.
Specifically speaking, in the ER-ER multiplex networks, with the increase of
coupling strength, the size of the giant component in each layer first
undergoes a first-order transition and then a second-order transition and
finally a first-order transition. This is due to the nature of inter-layer
links with both connectivity and dependency simultaneously. The system is more
robust if the dependency on the initial robust network is strong and more
vulnerable if the dependency on the initial attacked network is strong. These
effects are even amplified in the cascading process. When applying our model to
the SF-SF multiplex networks, the type of transition changes. The system
undergoes a first-order phase transition first only when the two layers'
mutually coupling is very strong and a second-order transition in other
conditions.

Neumann's extraction algorithm is detailed, analyzed and implemented in
standard C++. Given a sequence of independently and identically distributed
biased Bernoulli random variables, to extract randomness from the
aforementioned sequence pertains to produce a new sequence of independently and
identically distributed unbiased Bernoulli random variables. The iterative
construction here is inspired from the work of Stout and Warren 1984 who
modified appropriately the tree of probabilities produced by recursively
repeating the Von Neumann's extraction algorithm. The correctness of the
iterative algorithm is proven. The number of biased Bernoulli random variables
needed to produce one unbiased instance is the complexity of interest. The
complexity depends on the bias of the source. The expected complexity converges
toward 3.10220648... when the bias tends to 0 and diverges when the bias tends
to 1/2. In addition to the expected complexity, some other results that concern
the limiting asymptotic construction, and that seem unnoticed in the literature
so far, are proven.

investigate the formation of multiple stellar populations (MSPs) in globular
clusters (GCs) within the context of their parent galaxies. In our scenario,
the second generation (2G) of stars originate from both asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) polluters and pristine gas accreted from the host galaxy. Previous
theoretical and numerical studies have demonstrated that this 'AGB with
dilution' model has the potential to alleviate several problems faced by the
classical AGB scenario. However, the accretion of pristine gas on to the GC has
yet to be investigated within the context of the parent galaxy. This paper
presents the preliminary results from our original simulation code which models
GC formation from giant molecular clouds in a host galaxy, and subsequent gas
accretion on to the GC. By simulating the genesis of the 2G over a 370 Myr time
frame, we demonstrate that the fraction of 2G stars are inextricably linked to
the GC's environment. Our simulations rationalize the wide variety of abundance
patterns, kinematics, and 2G concentrations by altering the initial conditions
of both the GC progenitor and the host galaxy itself. Most notably, we
reproduce a positive correlation between the fraction of 2G stars and the
initial mass of the cluster. We discuss the physical implications of our
scenario and compare our simulations with observations of the Galactic GC 47
Tucanae (47 Tuc). Finally, we present scaling relations that encompass the
wider GC population and serve as a reference for future observations.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in a co-operative setting, where the

applications, in addition to optimizing the goal, the agents are required to
satisfy certain constraints specified on their actions. Under this setting, the
objective of the agents is to not only learn the actions that optimize the

Actor-Critic algorithm with an attention mechanism has been successfully
applied to obtain optimal actions for RL agents in multi-agent environments. In
this work, we extend this algorithm to the constrained multi-agent RL setting.
The idea here is that optimizing the common goal and satisfying the constraints
may require different modes of attention. By incorporating different attention
modes, the agents can select useful information required for optimizing the
objective and satisfying the constraints separately, thereby yielding better
actions. Through experiments on benchmark multi-agent environments, we show the

the augmentation search stage, the augmentation strategy is optimized in the

fine-tuned with the full training set in order to select the model with the

verified on the HAM10000 dataset using EfficientNets as a baseline. With the

we compare the $D^0$ meson spectra and elliptic flow from a hydrodynamic model

effective charm chemical potential at the freeze-out temperature to account for
the initial charm quark production from hard processes and assume that they are
thermalized in local comoving frame of the medium before freeze-out. $D^0$
mesons are sampled statistically from the freeze-out hyper-surface of the
expanding QGP as described by the event-by-event (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic
model CLVisc. Both hydrodynamic and transport model can describe the elliptic
flow of $D^0$ mesons at $p_T<3$ GeV/$c$ as measured in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. Though the experimental data on $D^0$ spectra are
consistent with the hydrodynamic result at small $p_T\sim 1$ GeV/$c$, they
deviate from the hydrodynamic model at high transverse momentum $p_T>2$
GeV/$c$. The diffusion and parton energy loss mechanisms in the transport model
can describe the measured spectra reasonably well within the theoretical
uncertainty. Our comparative study indicates that charm quarks only approach to
local thermal equilibrium at small $p_T$ even though they acquire sizable
elliptic flow that is comparable to light-quark hadrons at both small and

differently affects not only the chemistry but also the macroscopic gas
dynamics in space, and thus, the ortho-to-para abundance ratio (OPR) of H2 has
significant impacts on various astronomical phenomena. For a long time, the OPR
of nascent H2 upon formation on dust grains has been assumed to have a
statistical value of three and to gradually equilibrate in the gas phase at the

measurement, acting on a joint bipartite quantum state, in a distributed
manner. In the distributed setup, the constituent sub-systems of the joint
quantum state are measured by two agents, Alice and Bob. A third agent, Charlie
receives the measurement outcomes sent by Alice and Bob. Charlie uses local and
pairwise shared randomness to compute a bivariate function of the measurement
outcomes. The objective of three agents is to faithfully simulate the given
distributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state while
minimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new
achievable information-theoretic rate-region that exploits the bivariate
function using random structured POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic
codes. The algebraic structure of these codes is matched to that of the
bivariate function that models the action of Charlie. The conventional approach
for this class of problems has been to reconstruct individual measurement
outcomes corresponding to Alice and Bob, at Charlie, and then compute the
bivariate function, achieved using mutually independent approximating POVMs
based on random unstructured codes. In the present approach, using algebraic
structured POVMs, the computation is performed on the fly, thus obviating the
need to reconstruct individual measurement outcomes at Charlie. Using this, we
show that a strictly larger rate region can be achieved. One of the challenges
in analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only pairwise
independence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions. To address
this, we use nesting of algebraic codes and develop a covering lemma applicable
to pairwise-independent POVM ensembles. Combining these techniques, we provide
a multi-party distributed faithful simulation and function computation
protocol.

grain porosity, are affected by interstellar processing, in particular,
coagulation and shattering, which take place in the dense and diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM), respectively. In this paper, we formulate and
calculate the evolution of grain size distribution and grain porosity through
shattering and coagulation. For coagulation, we treat the grain evolution
depending on the collision energy. Shattering is treated as a mechanism of
forming small compact fragments. The balance between these processes are
determined by the dense-gas mass fraction $\eta_\mathrm{dense}$, which
determines the time fraction of coagulation relative to shattering. We find
that the interplay between shattering supplying small grains and coagulation
forming porous grains from shattered grains is fundamentally important in
creating and maintaining porosity. The porosity rises to 0.7--0.9 (or the
filling factor 0.3--0.1) around grain radii $a\sim 0.1~\mu$m. We also find
that, in the case of $\eta_\mathrm{dense}=0.1$ (very efficient shattering with
weak coagulation) porosity significantly enhances coagulation, creating fluffy
submicron grains with filling factors lower than 0.1. The porosity enhances the
extinction by 10--20 per cent at all wavelengths for amorphous carbon and at
ultraviolet wavelengths for silicate. The extinction curve shape of silicate
becomes steeper if we take porosity into account. We conclude that the
interplay between shattering and coagulation is essential in creating porous
grains in the interstellar medium and that the resulting porosity can impact
the grain size distributions and extinction curves.

based on the results of a systematic literature review and include three client

problem due to drastic appearance and illumination changes of scenes in

In this paper, we develop an efficient point cloud learning network (EPC-Net)
to form a global descriptor for visual place recognition, which can obtain good
performance and reduce computation memory and inference time. First, we propose
a lightweight but effective neural network module, called ProxyConv, to
aggregate the local geometric features of point clouds. We leverage the spatial
adjacent matrix and proxy points to simplify the original edge convolution for
lower memory consumption. Then, we design a lightweight grouped VLAD network
(G-VLAD) to form global descriptors for retrieval. Compared with the original
VLAD network, we propose a grouped fully connected (GFC) layer to decompose the
high-dimensional vectors into a group of low-dimensional vectors, which can
reduce the number of parameters of the network and maintain the discrimination
of the feature vector. Finally, to further reduce the inference time, we
develop a simple version of EPC-Net, called EPC-Net-L, which consists of two
ProxyConv modules and one max pooling layer to aggregate global descriptors. By
distilling the knowledge from EPC-Net, EPC-Net-L can obtain discriminative
global descriptors for retrieval. Extensive experiments on the Oxford dataset
and three in-house datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve
state-of-the-art performance with lower parameters, FLOPs, and runtime per

encodes the geometrical features of a manifold and is widely used in Machine
Learning (i.e., Manifold Learning). The resulting spectra are an intrinsic
geometrical feature of each part, and thus can be compared between parts
avoiding the part to part registration (or ""part localization"") pre-processing
or the need for equal size meshes, characteristics which are required in
previous approaches for SPC of 3D parts. The recent spectral SPC methods,
however, are limited to monitoring surface data from objects such that the
scanned meshes have no boundaries, holes, or missing portions. In this paper,
we extend spectral methods by first considering a more accurate and general
estimator of the LB spectrum that is obtained by application of Finite Element
Methods (FEM) to the solution of Helmholtz's equation with boundaries. It is
shown how the new spectral FEM approach, while it retains the advantages of not
requiring part localization/registration or equal size datasets scanned from
each part, it provides more accurate spectrum estimates, which results in
faster detection of out of control conditions than earlier methods, can be
applied to both mesh or volumetric (solid) scans, and furthermore, it is shown
how it can be applied to partial scans that result in open meshes (surface or
volumetric) with boundaries, increasing the practical applicability of the
methods. The present work brings SPC methods closer to contemporary research in

usually being ignored in 3D point cloud segmentation where ambiguous features
might be generated in feature extraction, leading to misclassification in the
transition area between two objects. In this paper, firstly, we propose a
Boundary Prediction Module (BPM) to predict boundary points. Based on the
predicted boundary, a boundary-aware Geometric Encoding Module (GEM) is
designed to encode geometric information and aggregate features with
discrimination in a neighborhood, so that the local features belonging to
different categories will not be polluted by each other. To provide extra
geometric information for boundary-aware GEM, we also propose a light-weight
Geometric Convolution Operation (GCO), making the extracted features more
distinguishing. Built upon the boundary-aware GEM, we build our network and
test it on benchmarks like ScanNet v2, S3DIS. Results show our methods can
significantly improve the baseline and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

To this aim, we first derive an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to describe

calculate the response of the non-Hermitian system to a constant electric
field. We observe that the environment leads the Hall conductance to be a
weighted integration of curvature of the ground band and hence the conductance
is no longer quantized in general. And the environment induces a delay in the
response of the system to the electric field. A discussion on the validity of
the non-Hermitian model compared with the master equation description is also

present a conceptually different approach that explicitly takes into account
the type of the tokens, such as note types and metric types. And, we propose a
new Transformer decoder architecture that uses different feed-forward heads to
model tokens of different types. With an expansion-compression trick, we
convert a piece of music to a sequence of compound words by grouping
neighboring tokens, greatly reducing the length of the token sequences. We show
that the resulting model can be viewed as a learner over dynamic directed
hypergraphs. And, we employ it to learn to compose expressive Pop piano music
of full-song length (involving up to 10K individual tokens per song), both
conditionally and unconditionally. Our experiment shows that, compared to
state-of-the-art models, the proposed model converges 5--10 times faster at
training (i.e., within a day on a single GPU with 11 GB memory), and with
comparable quality in the generated music.

mathematical biology. However, cell division times can be significantly
correlated, due to physical properties of cells that are passed through

Euler-Lotka equation which is valid in the presence of correlations. Our exact
result is based on large deviation theory and does not require particularly
strong assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our theory to a

equivalent to all-pass filtering and an all-pass filter can be represented in
terms of a ratio of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter and its time
reversal. Using these elements, we propose an adaptive filtering algorithm with
an LMS style update that estimates the FIR filter coefficients and the time
delay. Specifically, at each time step, the algorithm updates the filter

of the time delay from the filter. We validate our algorithm on synthetic data

Its underlying reason is due to the fact that it is usually difficult to change
the relative strength between the singlet and triplet channels for the
electron-electron interaction in material. Here we show that by considering
superconductivity occurring on surfaces of topological insulators (TIs), the
relative strength between the singlet and triplet channels can be changed by
geometry and sizes of TIs. Specifically, we show that pairing of electrons at
different locations on the surface of a topological insulator generally tends
to favor the triplet pairing and can induce topological superconductivity by
controlling the surface curvature and size of the topological insulator. We
illustrate the effects in two configurations, thin film geometry and the
spherical geometry with a sphere or a hemisphere, and find that topological
superconductivity arises with the $p \pm ip$ pairing symmetry dominated in
nanoscale size of the TI. As a consequence, vortices can spontaneously form on
surfaces of topological insulators with roughness of appropriate curvature.
These vortices support a Majorana zero mode inside each core and can be used as
a platform to host Majorana zero modes without invoking real magnetic fields.
Our theoretical discovery opens a new route to realize topological
superconductivity in material.

field and the chemical potential, a rich phase diagram hosting trivial and
different types of non-trivial phases can be achieved. Here, we theoretically
consider such a two-dimensional assembly of spin-orbit coupled superconducting
nanowires and calculate the collective tunneling conductance between normal
electrodes and the wires in the topological regime. When the number of wires in
the assembly is $N$, as a consequence of the way the Majorana bonding and
anti-bonding states form, we find that $N$ conductance peaks symmetric about
the bias $V = 0$ appear, for even $N$. When $N$ is odd, a ZBCP also appears.
Such an assembly can be realized by standard nano-fabrication techniques where
individual nanowires can be turned $ON$ or $OFF$ by using mechanical switch (or
local top gating) to make $N$ either even or odd -- thereby switching the ZBCP
$OFF$ or $ON$, respectively. Hence, our results can be used to realize and

B_2\ell^+\ell^-(\ell=e,\mu,\tau)$ semi-leptonic weak decays with the SU(3)
flavor symmetry, where $B_{1,2}$ are the spin-1/2 baryons of single bottomed
anti-triplet $T_{b3}$, single charmed anti-triplet $T_{c3}$ or light baryon
octet $T_{8}$. Using the SU(3) irreducible representation approach, we first
obtain the amplitude relations among different decays, and then predict the
relevant not-yet measured observables of these decays. (a) We calculate the
branching ratios of the $T_{b3}\to T_8 \mu^+\mu^-$ and $T_{b3}\to T_8
\tau^+\tau^-$ in the whole $q^2$ region and in the different $q^2$ bins by the
measurement of $\Lambda^0_b\to \Lambda^0 \mu^+\mu^-$. Many of them are obtained
for the first time. In addition, the longitudinal polarization fractions and
the leptonic forward-backward asymmetries of all $T_{b3}\to T_{8}\ell^+\ell^-$
decays are very similar to each other in certain $q^2$ bin due to the SU(3)
flavor symmetry. (b) We analyze the upper limits of $B(T_{c3}\to
T_{8}\ell^+\ell^-)$ by using the experimental upper limits of $B(\Lambda^+_c\to
p\mu^+\mu^-)$ and $B(\Lambda^+_c\to pe^+e^-)$, and find the experimental upper
limit of $B(\Lambda^+_c\to p\mu^+\mu^-)$ giving effective bounds on the
relevant SU(3) flavor symmetry parameters. The predictions of $B(\Xi^0_c \to
\Xi^0e^+e^-)$ and $B(\Xi^0_c \to \Xi^0\mu^+\mu^-)$ will be different between
the single-quark transition dominant contributions and the W-exchange dominant
ones. (c) As for $T_{8}\to T'_8 \ell^+\ell^-$ decays, we analyze the
single-quark transition contributions and the W-exchange contributions by using
two measurements of $ B(\Xi^0\to \Lambda^0 e^+e^-)$ and $ B(\Sigma^+\to
p\mu^+\mu^-)$, and give the branching ratio predictions by assuming either
single-quark transition dominant contributions or the W-exchange dominant ones.

volume-averaged flow fields from particle-resolved simulations; secondly, they
are applied in Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations, and the results are compared to
the particle-resolved simulations.
  The results show that both correction schemes significantly improve the
particle force predictions, but the average total impulse on the particles is
still underpredicted by both correction schemes in both tests. With the volume
averaged flow fields as input, the volume fraction correction gives the best

that the velocity fluctuation model, associated with the velocity correction

is an important non-convex optimization problem with numerous applications and
promising performance in layerwise deep learning. In this paper, we develop
exact convex optimization formulations for two-layer neural networks with
second degree polynomial activations based on semidefinite programming.
Remarkably, we show that semidefinite lifting is always exact and therefore
computational complexity for global optimization is polynomial in the input
dimension and sample size for all input data. The developed convex formulations
are proven to achieve the same global optimal solution set as their non-convex
counterparts. More specifically, the globally optimal two-layer neural network
with polynomial activations can be found by solving a semidefinite program
(SDP) and decomposing the solution using a procedure we call Neural
Decomposition. Moreover, the choice of regularizers plays a crucial role in the
computational tractability of neural network training. We show that the
standard weight decay regularization formulation is NP-hard, whereas other
simple convex penalties render the problem tractable in polynomial time via
convex programming. We extend the results beyond the fully connected
architecture to different neural network architectures including networks with
vector outputs and convolutional architectures with pooling. We provide
extensive numerical simulations showing that the standard backpropagation
approach often fails to achieve the global optimum of the training loss. The

illuminates the accretion disk and gives rise to the discrete (lines) and
continuum-reflected components. The main goal of this work is to investigate
whether the extended, mildly relativistic jet that is present in black hole
binaries in the hard and hard-intermediate states is the hard X-ray source that
illuminates the accretion disk. We use a Monte Carlo code that simulates the
process of inverse Compton scattering in a mildly relativistic jet. Blackbody
photons from the thin accretion disk are injected at the base of the jet and
interact with the energetic electrons that move outward. Despite the fact that
the jet moves away from the disk at a mildly relativistic speed, we find that
approximately $15-20$\% of the input soft photons are scattered back toward the
accretion disk. The vast majority of the Comptonized, back-scattered photons
escape very close to the black hole ($h\lesssim 6 r_g$, where $r_g$ is the
gravitational radius), but a non-negligible amount escape at a wide range of
heights. At high heights, $h\sim 500-2000\,r_g$, the distribution falls off
rapidly. The high-height cutoff strongly depends on the width of the jet at its
base and is almost insensitive to the optical depth. The disk illumination
spectrum is softer than the direct jet spectrum of the radiation that escapes
in directions that do not encounter the disk. We conclude that an extended jet
is an excellent candidate source of hard photons in reflection models.

deriving the classical and quantum models of magnetic resonance, we deem the
dramatic anisotropic shift of the measured $g$ factor to originate from
fluctuations with anisotropic interactions. The deduction of the $g$ factor
behind the fluctuations is consistent with the spin-only state (${g\approx}$
2.050(10) for $\rm CrSiTe_3$ and 2.039(10) for $\rm CrGeTe_3$). Furthermore,
the abnormal enhancement of $g$ shift, supplemented by specific heat and
magnetometry measurements, suggests that $\rm CrSiTe_3$ exhibits a more typical
two-dimensional nature than $\rm CrGeTe_3$ and may be closer to the quantum
critical point.

  Jan 2021, Milan, Italy",,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Working with a non-stationary stream of data requires for the analysis system
to evolve its model (the parameters as well as the structure) over time. In
particular, concept drifts can occur, which makes it necessary to forget
knowledge that has become obsolete. However, the forgetting is subjected to the
stability-plasticity dilemma, that is, increasing forgetting improve reactivity
of adapting to the new data while reducing the robustness of the system. Based
on a set of inference rules, Evolving Fuzzy Systems-EFS-have proven to be
effective in solving the data stream learning problem. However tackling the
stability-plasticity dilemma is still an open question. This paper proposes a
coherent method to integrate forgetting in Evolving Fuzzy System, based on the
recently introduced notion of concept drift anticipation. The forgetting is
applied with two methods: an exponential forgetting of the premise part and a
deferred directional forgetting of the conclusion part of EFS to preserve the
coherence between both parts. The originality of the approach consists in
applying the forgetting only in the anticipation module and in keeping the EFS
(called principal system) learned without any forgetting. Then, when a drift is
detected in the stream, a selection mechanism is proposed to replace the
obsolete parameters of the principal system with more suitable parameters of
the anticipation module. An evaluation of the proposed methods is carried out
on benchmark online datasets, with a comparison with state-of-the-art online
classifiers (Learn++.NSE, PENsemble, pclass) as well as with the original
system using different forgetting strategies.

regularization has been gradually used in image de-noising and
de-blurring.Unlike low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) which handles RGB images
by recovering each color channel separately, the QMC models utilize the
connection of three channels by processing them as a whole. Most of the
existing quaternion-based methods formulate low-rank QMC (LRQMC) as a
quaternion nuclear norm (a convex relaxation of the rank) minimization
problem.The main limitation of these approaches is that the singular values
being minimized simultaneously so that the low-rank property could not be
approximated well and efficiently. To achieve a more accurate low-rank
approximation, the matrix-based truncated nuclear norm has been proposed and
also been proved to have the superiority. In this paper, we introduce a
quaternion truncated nuclear norm (QTNN) for LRQMC and utilize the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to get the optimization.We further
propose weights to the residual error quaternion matrix during the update
process for accelerating the convergence of the QTNN method with admissible
performance. The weighted method utilizes a concise gradient descent strategy
which has a theoretical guarantee in optimization. The effectiveness of our
method is illustrated by experiments on real visual datasets.

individual utilities are calculated by mixing the quality of service (QoS),
security, and cost dimensions with the proportions determined by the

STPS, the CCPS network jointly selects the best performing physical layer

the previously developed spectral method to measure the linear attenuation of
solid breast lesions. A total of 56 malignant and 5 benign lesions were

thickness measurement. Spectral (energy-resolved) images of the samples were
acquired and the image signal was mapped to equivalent thicknesses of two known
reference materials, which can be used to derive the x-ray attenuation as a
function of energy. The spread in equivalent material thicknesses was
relatively large between samples, which is likely to be caused mainly by
natural variation and only to a minor extent by random measurement errors and
sample inhomogeneity. No significant difference in attenuation was found
between benign and malignant solid lesions, or between different types of
malignant lesions. The separation between cyst-fluid and tumour attenuation
was, however, significant, which suggests it may be possible to distinguish
cystic from solid breast lesions, and the results lay the groundwork for a

the wreath product of symmetric groups.
  Our purpose here, after a brief introduction to this semilattice and graph,
is to establish some properties of this graph. The diagonal graph
$\Gamma_D(G,m)$ is a Cayley graph for the group~$G^m$, and so is

the visual inspection of 30-second epochs of polysomnography signals. Numerous
automatic approaches have been developed to replace this tedious and expensive
task. Although these methods demonstrated better performance than human sleep
experts on specific datasets, they remain largely unused in sleep clinics. The
main reason is that each sleep clinic uses a specific PSG montage that most
automatic approaches cannot handle out-of-the-box. Moreover, even when the PSG
montage is compatible, publications have shown that automatic approaches
perform poorly on unseen data with different demographics. To address these
issues, we introduce RobustSleepNet, a deep learning model for automatic sleep
stage classification able to handle arbitrary PSG montages. We trained and
evaluated this model in a leave-one-out-dataset fashion on a large corpus of 8
heterogeneous sleep staging datasets to make it robust to demographic changes.
When evaluated on an unseen dataset, RobustSleepNet reaches 97% of the F1 of a
model explicitly trained on this dataset. Hence, RobustSleepNet unlocks the
possibility to perform high-quality out-of-the-box automatic sleep staging with
any clinical setup. We further show that finetuning RobustSleepNet, using a
part of the unseen dataset, increases the F1 by 2% when compared to a model
trained specifically for this dataset. Therefore, finetuning might be used to
reach a state-of-the-art level of performance on a specific population.

velocity and line width of the broad blue-shifted [OIII] components in SDSS
quasars. Broad blue-shifted [OIII] components are commonly treated as
indicators of outflows related to central engine, however, it is still an open
question whether the outflows are related to central accretion properties or
related to local physical properties of NLRs (narrow emission line regions).
Here, the reported strong linear correlation with the Spearman Rank correlation
coefficient 0.75 can be expected under the assumption of AGN (active galactic
nuclei) feedback driven outflows, through a large sample of 535 SDSS quasars
with reliable blue-shifted broad [OIII] components. Moreover, there are much
different detection rates for broad blue-shifted and broad red-shifted [OIII]
components in quasars, and no positive correlation can be found between shifted
velocity and line width of the broad red-shifted [OIII] components, which
provide further and strong evidence to reject possibility of local outflows in
NLRs leading to the broad blue-shifted [OIII] components in quasars. Thus, the
strong linear correlation can be treated as strong evidence for the broad
blue-shifted [OIII] components as better indicators of outflows related to
central engine in AGN. Furthermore, rather than central BH masses, Eddington
ratios and continuum luminosities have key roles on properties of the broad
blue-shifted [OIII] components in quasars.

biological and engineered soft matter. Simple micellisation, emulsion
formation, and polymer mixing principles are well understood. However, the
principles behind emergence of structures with competing length scales in soft
matter systems remain an open question. Examples include the
droplet-inside-droplet assembly in many biomacromolecular systems undergoing
liquid-liquid phase separation, analogous multiple emulsion formation in
oil-surfactant-water formulations, and polymer core-shell particles with
internal structure. We develop here a microscopic theoretical model based on
effective interactions between the constituents of a soft matter system to
explain self-organization both at single and multiple length scales. The model
identifies how spatial ordering at multiple length scales emerges due to
competing interactions between the system components, e.g. molecules of
different sizes and different chemical properties. As an example of single and
multiple-length-scale assembly, we map out a generic phase diagram for a
solution with two solute species differing in their mutual and solvent
interactions. By performing molecular simulations on a block-copolymer system,
we further demonstrate how the phase diagram can be connected to a molecular
system that has a transition from regular single-core polymer particles to
multi-core aggregates that exhibit multiple structural length scales. The
findings provide guidelines to understanding the length scales rising
spontaneously in biological self-assembly, but also open new venues to the
development and engineering of biomolecular and polymeric functional materials.

explored in the analysis of medical images or other sensory data, and it is
recognised that each of the established approaches has different strengths and
weaknesses. As an important motor symptom, gait disturbance is usually used for
diagnosis and evaluation of diseases; moreover, the use of multi-modality
analysis of the patient's walking pattern compensates for the one-sidedness of
single modality gait recognition methods that only learn gait changes in a
single measurement dimension. The fusion of multiple measurement resources has
demonstrated promising performance in the identification of gait patterns
associated with individual diseases. In this paper, as a useful tool, we
propose a novel hybrid model to learn the gait differences between three
neurodegenerative diseases, between patients with different severity levels of
Parkinson's disease and between healthy individuals and patients, by fusing and
aggregating data from multiple sensors. A spatial feature extractor (SFE) is
applied to generating representative features of images or signals. In order to
capture temporal information from the two modality data, a new correlative
memory neural network (CorrMNN) architecture is designed for extracting
temporal features. Afterwards, we embed a multi-switch discriminator to
associate the observations with individual state estimations. Compared with
several state-of-the-art techniques, our proposed framework shows more accurate

Furthermore, many applications such as autonomous driving or crowd analysis
require pose estimation of a large number of people possibly at low-resolution.
In this work, we present PandaNet (Pose estimAtioN and Dectection Anchor-based
Network), a new single-shot, anchor-based and multi-person 3D pose estimation
approach. The proposed model performs bounding box detection and, for each
detected person, 2D and 3D pose regression into a single forward pass. It does
not need any post-processing to regroup joints since the network predicts a
full 3D pose for each bounding box and allows the pose estimation of a possibly
large number of people at low resolution. To manage people overlapping, we
introduce a Pose-Aware Anchor Selection strategy. Moreover, as imbalance exists
between different people sizes in the image, and joints coordinates have
different uncertainties depending on these sizes, we propose a method to
automatically optimize weights associated to different people scales and joints
for efficient training. PandaNet surpasses previous single-shot methods on
several challenging datasets: a multi-person urban virtual but very realistic
dataset (JTA Dataset), and two real world 3D multi-person datasets (CMU

bipartite tournaments, which model situations in which two different kinds of

examples include education (students/exam questions) and solo sports
(golfers/courses). In particular, we look to find rankings via chain graphs,
which correspond to bipartite tournaments in which the sets of adversaries
defeated by the players on one side are nested with respect to set inclusion.
Tournaments of this form have a natural and appealing ranking associated with
them. We apply chain editing -- finding the minimum number of edge changes
required to form a chain graph -- as a new mechanism for tournament ranking.
The properties of these rankings are investigated in a probabilistic setting,
where they arise as maximum likelihood estimators, and through the axiomatic
method of social choice theory. Despite some nice properties, two problems
remain: an important anonymity axiom is violated, and chain editing is NP-hard.
We address both issues by relaxing the minimisation constraint in chain
editing, and characterise the resulting ranking methods via a greedy
approximation algorithm.

able to change the relative intensity of certain attributes, but not explicitly

capabilities in GANs. Unlike these methods, our control is not constrained to
morphable 3D face model parameters and is extendable beyond the domain of human
faces. Using contrastive learning, we obtain GANs with an explicitly

control-encoders mapping human-interpretable inputs to suitable latent vectors,
thus allowing explicit control. In the domain of human faces we demonstrate

increasingly efficient on many applications, they require a huge number of
labelled examples to reach operational performances. Therefore, the labelling
effort linked to the creation of the datasets required is also increasing. When
working on defense-related remote sensing applications, labelling can be
challenging due to the large areas covered and often requires military experts
who are rare and whose time is primarily dedicated to operational needs.
Limiting the labelling effort is thus of utmost importance. This study aims at
reviewing the most relevant active learning techniques to be used for object
detection on very high resolution imagery and shows an example of the value of
such techniques on a relevant operational use case: aircraft detection.

popular distance for mixed type variables is derived as the complement of the
Gower's similarity coefficient; it is appealing because ranges between 0 and 1

setting the contribution of the single variables to the overall Gower's
distance is unbalanced because of the different nature of the variables
themselves. This article tries to address the main drawbacks that affect the
overall unweighted Gower's distance by suggesting some modifications in
calculating the distance on the interval and ratio scaled variables. Simple
modifications try to attenuate the impact of outliers on the scaled Manhattan

experimentally investigated. Application of a few types of source, which differ
in the force driving the interface, and two surfactants with different
rheological properties made it possible to generalize the results and to
develop a unified approach to describing the flow patterns observed in this
study. It is shown that, regardless of source type and surfactant used, the
problem under consideration can be completely described in terms of two
non-dimensional parameters. The first is the elasticity number introduced
earlier by Homsy and Meiburg (J. Fluid Mech., v.139, 1984). This parameter is
the ratio of two shear stresses formed at the interface by surfactant and
source, and it defines the formation of the convective zone at the center
nearby the source and the size of the stagnant zone at the periphery. The
second, called the surface Rayleigh number, is introduced for the first time in
this paper. It is responsible for the appearance of the multi-vortex flow
structure within the stagnant zone. We suppose that this structure occurs as a
result of the mechanical equilibrium instability of the surfactant layer under
the action of the momentum flux transported from the subphase by the viscous
mechanism. Based on our results and those reported earlier by other
researchers, we have determined the critical value of the surface Rayleigh
number and analyzed the possibility and conditions for the occurrence of this
instability, called by us the shear-driven surfactant layer (SDSL) instability,

with cavity ring down spectroscopy to overcome these absorption losses.
However, the amplifier inside the fiber loop suffers from inherent gain
fluctuations that limit the sensing system's overall performance. Here, we
provide a novel sensor using the wavelength-scanned phase shift-cavity ring
down spectroscopy (PS-CRDS) in conjunction with a linear active fiber cavity
that potentially offers a more sensitive solution than traditional fiber loop

built from fiber Bragg gratings. We derive a theoretical phase shift expression
for our system and simulate it using the finite element method to determine
optimum tapered fiber diameter for glucose sensing in DI water. Compared to a
non-amplified system, we find that our amplified system can increase the
sensitivity by fourteen times via the amplifier gain tuning. We also conduct
experimental measurements using 0-15.5~mM glucose solutions and find them in
excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. Experimentally we obtain

previous studies that ID and OOD samples are separated distinctly, we consider
samples lying in the intermediate of the two and use them for training a
network. We generate such samples using multiple image transformations that
corrupt inputs in various ways and with different severity levels. We estimate
where the generated samples by a single image transformation lie between ID and
OOD using a network trained on clean ID samples. To be specific, we make the
network classify the generated samples and calculate their mean classification
accuracy, using which we create a soft target label for them. We train the same
network from scratch using the original ID samples and the generated samples
with the soft labels created for them. We detect OOD samples by thresholding
the entropy of the predicted softmax probability. The experimental results show
that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in the standard
benchmark tests. We also analyze the effect of the number and particular
combinations of image corrupting transformations on the performance.

not substantially impact Planck-like surveys, we find that they can
significantly degrade the cosmological constraints for a Euclid-like survey.
Consequently, the current precision on the HMF will not be sufficient for

disciplines. Nevertheless, we present the first research that investigates the
discovery problem of independence in data. In its arguably simplest form,
independence is a statement between two sets of columns expressing that for
every two rows in a table there is also a row in the table that coincides with
the first row on the first set of columns and with the second row on the second
set of columns. We show that the problem of deciding whether there is an
independence statement that holds on a given table is not only NP-complete but
$W[3]$-complete in its arguably most natural parameter, namely its arity. We
establish the first algorithm to discover all independence statement that hold
on a given table. We illustrate in experiments with benchmark data that our
algorithm performs well within the limits established by our hardness results.
In practice, it is often useful to determine the ratio with which independence
statements hold on a given table. For that purpose, we show that our treatment
of independence and the design of our algorithm enables us to extend our
findings to approximate independence. In our final experiments, we provide some
insight into the trade-off between run time and the approximation ratio.
Naturally, the smaller the ratio, the more approximate independence statements
hold, and the more time it takes to discover all of them. While this research
establishes first insight into the computational properties of discovering
independence from data, we hope to initiate research into more sophisticated
notions of independence, including embedded multivalued dependencies, as well
as their context-specific and probabilistic variants.

confront them to concrete realizations that are complete in the ultraviolet
regime. In this paper, we compare effective Higgs-portal models with scalar,

taking into account all existing constraints from collider and astroparticle
physics. These complete realizations include the inert doublet with scalar DM,
the singlet-doublet model for fermionic DM and models based on spontaneously

discuss the simpler scenarios in which a new scalar singlet field that mixes
with the standard Higgs field is introduced with minimal couplings to
isosinglet spin--$0, \frac12$ and 1 DM states. We show that in large regions of

provides a consistent limit and thus, can be safely adopted, in particular for
the interpretation of searches for invisible Higgs boson decays at the LHC. The
phenomenological implications of assuming or not that the DM states generate

February 10 - April 26, 2020), consisting of ~1.5 billion trips. In comparison
to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by
49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than 5
people, which is estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by
venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such,
human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7-13 days ahead. A 1%
reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88-1.11% reduction in daily reported
COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via
telecommunication data can support public decision-makers in two ways. First,

microcalorimeter with Monte Carlo simulations, before and after all the
solutions adopted to reduce its level. Concerning the GCR induced component the
background level is compliant with the mission requirement. Regarding the Soft
Protons component, the analysis does not predict dramatically different
backgrounds in the L1 and L2 orbits. However, the lack of data concerning the
L2 environment labels it as very weakly characterizable, and thus we advise
against its choice as orbit for X-ray missions. We then use these background
levels to simulate the observation of a typical galaxy cluster from its center
out to 1.2 R200 to probe the characterization capabilities of the instrument
out to the outskirts. We find that without any background reduction it is not

motivated by the fact that matrix and fibers can easily meshed independently.
Our main interest is in fiber reinforce polymers where the Young's modulus are
quite different. Thus the modeling error from the overlapping approach is of no
significance. The coupling conditions acknowledge both, the forces and the
moments of the beam model and transfer them to the background material. A
suitable static condensation procedure is applied to remove the beam balance
equations. The condensed system then forms our starting point for a numerical
approximation in terms of isogeometric analysis. The choice of our discrete
basis functions of higher regularity is motivated by the fact, that as a result
of the static condensation, we obtain second gradient terms in fiber direction.
Eventually, a series of benchmark tests demonstrate the flexibility and

the theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation of multiplexed

designed transmission-type acoustic metamaterial. The proposed meta-hologram is
composed of two Fabry-Perot resonant channels per unit cell, which enables the
simultaneous modulation of the transmitted amplitude and phase at two desired

the design strategy proposed here, provides a new degree of freedom (frequency)
that can actively tailor holograms that are otherwise completely passive and
hence significantly enhances the information encoded in acoustic metamaterials.
To demonstrate the multiplexed acoustic metamaterial, we first show the

ultrasound focusing and annular beams generation for the incident ultrasonic

random realizations to reduce the statistical effects, resulting in similar
redshift accuracy for both high-SNR (signal to noise ratio) and low-SNR data.
The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the predicted redshifts are
also derived via Gaussian random realizations of the testing data, and then the
best-fit redshifts and 1-sigma errors also can be obtained. We find that our
networks can provide excellent redshift estimates with accuracies ~0.001 and
0.01 on spec-z and photo-z, respectively. Compared to existing photo-z codes,
our MLP has similar accuracy but is more efficient in the training process. The
fractions of catastrophic redshifts or outliers can be dramatically suppressed

Thus, it is of interest to consider autonomous self-healing software systems,
which can automatically detect, diagnose, and contain unanticipated problems at
runtime. Most research in this area has adopted a model-driven approach, where
actual behavior is checked against a model specifying the intended behavior,
and a controller takes action when the system behaves outside of the

keep them up-to-date as the system evolves. We pose that, with the recent

lose considerable detailed information in network propagation, which affects

performs as a feature extractor.Then the fusion model constructs a feature
pyramid by concatenating the outputs from the different depths of the backbone,
which can help the network better comprehend the signals in different scales.
The Markov-based sequential correction algorithm is designed to reduce the
output jitters generated by the classifier. The algorithm depends on a prior
stage distribution associated with the sleep stage transition rule and the
Markov chain. Experiment results demonstrate the competitive performance of our

between low-temperature magnetic-ordered phase to high-temperature paramagnetic
phase. A paramount question is if such paramagnetic phase of the correlated
solids can be well described by single-particle band theory to facilitate the
experimental observations. In this work, we investigate the properties of
temperature-driven paramagnetic phase via two different approaches within the
framework of density functional theory, monomorphous and polymorphous
description. From a comprehensive comparison of total energies, symmetries and
band structures, we demonstrate the necessity for a proper treatment of
paramagnetic phases with several prototypical examples. For Pauli paramagnetism
phase, the vanishing of spin moments permits us to apply a nonmagnetic
monomorphous description, while for paramagnetism with disordered local
moments, such description imposes unrealistic high symmetry, leading to a
metallic state in certain cases, inconsistent with the experimental
observation. In contrast, the polymorphous description based on a large-enough
supercell with disordered local moments is able to count in the effects of
distinct local environments, such as symmetry lowing, providing a more reliable
paramagnetic electronic structure and total energy compared with experiments.
Our work shed new insights on discovering the temperature-dependent magnetic
phase transition in the field of magnetic quantum materials.

  stress",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In some conditions, bacteria self-organise into biofilms, supracellular
structures made of a self-produced embedding matrix, mainly composed on
polysaccharides, DNA, proteins and lipids. It is known that bacteria change
their colony/matrix ratio in the presence of external stimuli such as
hydrodynamic stress. However, little is still known about the molecular
mechanisms driving this self-adaptation. In this work, we monitor structural
features of Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms grown with and without
hydrodynamic stress. Our measurements show that the hydrodynamic stress
concomitantly increases the cell density population and the matrix production.
At short growth timescales, the matrix mediates a weak cell-cell attractive
interaction due to the depletion forces originated by the polymer constituents.
Using a population dynamics model, we conclude that hydrodynamic stress causes
a faster diffusion of nutrients and a higher incorporation of planktonic
bacteria to the already formed microcolonies. This results in the formation of
more mechanically stable biofilms due to an increase of the number of
crosslinks, as shown by computer simulations. The mechanical stability also
lies on a change in the chemical compositions of the matrix, which becomes
enriched in carbohydrates, known to display adhering properties. Overall, we
demonstrate that bacteria are capable of self-adapting to hostile hydrodynamic
stress by tailoring the biofilm chemical composition, thus affecting both the
mesoscale structure of the matrix and its viscoelastic properties that
ultimately regulate the bacteria-polymer interactions.

kind of Generalized Markov Shift (GMS) that coincides with $\Sigma_A$ in the
locally compact case. The set $\Sigma_A$ is dense in $X_A$, and its complement,
a set of finite allowed words, is dense in $X_A$ when non-empty. We develop the

in it, and exploring its connections with the usual formalism for $\Sigma_A$.
New phenomena appear, as different types of phase transitions and new conformal
measures undetected by the classical thermodynamic formalism for $A$ not
row-finite. Given a potential $F$ and inverse of temperature $\beta$, we study
the existence of conformal measures $\mu_{\beta}$ associated to $\beta F$. We
present examples where there exists a critical $\beta_c$ s. t. we have
existence of conformal probabilities satisfying $\mu_{\beta}(\Sigma_A)=0$ for

probabilities for $\beta >\beta_c$ collapses to the standard conformal
probability $\mu_{\beta_c}$, $\mu_{\beta_c}(\Sigma_A)=1$, for the limit

redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) absorbers using observed extinction curves.
This is the first time such an approach is employed to constrain the
metallicities of extragalactic absorbers. To demonstrate our method, we use the
spectra of 13 quasars and one GRB with DLA absorbers detected along their
sightlines. By using the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation, which relates the
wavelength-integrated extinction to the total volume occupied by dust per
hydrogen nucleon, we set some robust lower limits on the metallicity of the
DLAs. The resulting lower limits are all consistent with the DLA metallicities
from the literature. The GRB extinction curve exhibits a very strong 2175 A
extinction bump. We try to constrain the metallicity of the GRB DLA by modeling
the GRB extinction curve using dust models with two (graphite and silicates)
and three (PAH, hydrogenated amorphous carbon, and silicates) dust components.
The two-component model resulted in a metallicity of $Z\sim$$-$0.45 while the
three-component model gives $Z\sim$$-$0.50. On the other hand, the lower limit
from the KK approach for this DLA is $Z\ge$$-$0.60. Modeling a large sample of
extinction curves with 2175 A extinction bump and measured DLA metallicities
would allow a thorough comparison between the KK and the model-dependent
approach. In cases where the precise measurement of the metallicity of a DLA is
not possible (e.g. due to the saturation of important absorption lines), the
approach presented in this paper can be used to constrain the metallicity.

first extracts the representative features and then enhances the speech signals

weights based on DNN-SI to prepare better representative features for LSTM-SE.
We tested the proposed ATM system on Taiwan Mandarin hearing in noise test

railpads along railway track may lead to large wheel/rail interaction forces,
and a high rate of deterioration for track components. Despite the importance
of railpad, the track infrastructure managers use no inspection tool for
monitoring in-service railpads over time. In this paper, a novel data-driven
monitoring tool for long-term performance analysis of in-service railpads is
developed based on train-induced vibration data collected by a track-side
measurement system. The monitoring tool consists of a method for track
resonance frequencies estimation, a temperature-frequency model for describing
railpad behavior with respect to ambient temperature, and a generalized
likelihood ratio test based on the generalized extreme value distribution for
detecting changes in the railpad status over time. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed monitoring system, the status of railpads at four different
locations along a railway turnout is monitored over a period of 18 months. It
is shown that the monitoring system can successfully detect changes in railpad
properties over the considered period.

solar cycles onto a single normalized epoch for the approximately 22 year Hale
(magnetic polarity) cycle, using the Hilbert transform of daily sunspot numbers
(SSN) since 1818. The occurrences of solar maxima show almost no Hale cycle
dependence, confirming that the clock is synchronized to polarity reversals.
The odd cycle minima lead the even cycle minima by ~ 1.1 normalized years,
whereas the odd cycle terminators (McIntosh et al. (2019)) lag the even cycle
terminators by ~ 2.3 normalized years. The mimimum-terminator interval is thus
relatively extended for odd cycles and shortened for even ones. We re-engineer
the Sargent(1985,2021) R27 index and combine it with our epoch analysis to
obtain a high time resolution parameter for 27 day recurrence in aa, <acv(27)>.
This reveals that the transition to recurrence, that is, to an ordered solar
wind dominated by high speed streams, is fast, occurring within 2-3 solar
rotations or less. It resolves an extended late declining phase which is
approximately twice as long on even Schwabe cycles as odd. Galactic Cosmic Ray
flux rises in step with <acv(27)> but then stays high. Our analysis also
identifies a slow timescale trend in SSN that simply tracks the Gleissberg
cycle. We find that this trend is in phase with the slow timescale trend in the
modulus of sunspot latitudes, and in antiphase with that of the R27 index.

layers of high Z and low Z materials with a typical thickness of 10-100
Angstrom, on a suitable substrate. Such coatings play an important role in
enhancing the reflectivity of X-ray mirrors by allowing reflections at angles
much larger than the critical angle of X-ray reflection for the given
materials. Coating with an equal thickness of each bilayer enhances the
reflectivity at discrete energies, satisfying Bragg condition. However, by
systematically varying the bilayer thickness in the multilayer stack, it is
possible to design X-ray mirrors having enhanced reflectivity over a broad
energy range. One of the most important applications of such a depth graded
multilayer mirror is to realize hard X-ray telescopes for astronomical
purposes. Design of such multilayer X-ray mirrors and their characterization
with X-ray reflectivity measurements require appropriate software tools. We
have initiated the development of hard X-ray optics for future Indian X-ray
astronomical missions, and in this context, we have developed a program,
DarpanX, to calculate X-ray reflectivity for single and multilayer mirrors. It
can be used as a stand-alone tool for designing multilayer mirrors with
required characteristics. But more importantly, it has been implemented as a
local model for the popular X-ray spectral fitting program, XSPEC, and thus can
be used for accurate fitting of the experimentally measured X-ray reflectivity
data. DarpanX is implemented as a Python 3 module, and an API is provided to
access the underlying algorithms. Here we present details of DarpanX

that a planar digraph $G$ can be preprocessed in $O(n\log^2{n}/\log\log{n})$

$O(\log{n})$ time whether $u$ can reach $v$ in $G$ if the vertex $x$ (the

structure for planar directed graphs with nearly optimal preprocessing time
that answers all-pairs queries under any kind of failures in polylogarithmic

  We also consider 2-reachability problems, where we are given a planar digraph
$G$ and we wish to determine if there are two vertex-disjoint (edge-disjoint)
paths from $u$ to $v$, for query vertices $u,v$. In this setting we provide a
nearly optimal 2-reachability oracle, which is the existential variant of the
reachability oracle under single failures, with the following bounds. We can
construct in $O(n\log^{O(1)}{n})$ time an $O(n\log^{3+o(1)}{n})$-space data

  Impact",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AR cs.FL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Logic locking is a hardware security technique to intellectual property (IP)
against security threats in the IC supply chain, especially untrusted fabs.
Such techniques incorporate additional locking circuitry within an IC that
induces incorrect functionality when an incorrect key is provided. The amount
of error induced is known as the effectiveness of the locking technique. ""SAT
attacks"" provide a strong mathematical formulation to find the correct key of
locked circuits. In order to achieve high SAT resilience(i.e. complexity of SAT
attacks), many conventional logic locking schemes fail to inject sufficient
error into the circuit. For example, in the case of SARLock and Anti-SAT, there
are usually very few (or only one) input minterms that cause any error at the
circuit output. The state-of-the-art stripped functionality logic locking
(SFLL) technique introduced a trade-off between SAT resilience and
effectiveness. In this work, we prove that such a trade-off is universal in
logic locking. In order to attain high effectiveness of locking without
compromising SAT resilience, we propose a novel logic locking scheme, called
Strong Anti-SAT (SAS). In addition to SAT attacks, removal-based attacks are
also popular against logic locking. Based on SAS, we propose Robust SAS (RSAS)
which is resilient to removal attacks and maintains the same SAT resilience and
as effectiveness as SAS. SAS and RSAS have the following significant
improvements over existing techniques. (1) SAT resilience of SAS and RSAS
against SAT attack is not compromised by increase in effectiveness. (2) In
contrast to prior work focusing solely on the circuit-level locking impact, we
integrate SAS-locked modules into a processor and show that SAS has a high
application-level impact. (3) Our experiments show that SAS and RSAS exhibit
better SAT resilience than SFLL and have similar effectiveness.

significant strengthening of the formed product through grain refinement.
However, significant residual stresses are developed in the extruded product
whose quantification is necessary for accurate process design and subsequent
heat treatment. Experimental evaluation of residual stress provides the through
thickness (normal) variation at chosen sampling points on the formed product
and may provide inaccurate estimates if variations along the extrusion
(longitudinal) directions are present. Process models can complement the
experimental measurements and improve the estimates of residual stress
distribution. While models of this process have been developed, very few of
them have been applied to understand the variation of residual stress in the
formed products. The present work aims to address this limitation by providing
a complete map of residual stress distribution in angular extrusion process
through numerical simulations. Interestingly, our simulations show that the
angular channel extruded product can have significant longitudinal variation of
residual stress depending on the extrusion ratio and strain hardening rate.
Detailed analyses of the process reveals that these spatial oscillations occur
due to cyclic movement of the contact location between the die and the
top-billet surface in the exit channel. The outcome of this study suggests that
accurate measurement technique of residual stress field in angular channel
extruded products should consider the possibility of longitudinal variations.
The findings can be extended to other continuous forming processes as well.

respiration disorder characterized by repeated disrupted breathing events
during sleep. It is diagnosed via polysomnography which is an expensive test
conducted in a sleep lab requiring sleep experts to manually score the recorded
data. Since the symptoms of sleep apnea are often ambiguous, it is difficult
for a physician to decide whether to prescribe polysomnography. In this study,
we investigate whether helpful information can be obtained by collecting and
automatically analysing sleep data using a smartphone and an inexpensive strain
gauge respiration belt. We evaluate how accurately we can detect sleep apnea
with wide variety of machine learning techniques with data from a clinical
study with 49 overnight sleep recordings. With less than one hour of training,
we can distinguish between normal and apneic minutes with an accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity of 0.7609, 0.7833, and 0.7217, respectively. These
results can be achieved even if we train only on high-quality data from an
entirely separate, clinically certified sensor, which has the potential to
substantially reduce the cost of data collection. Data from a complete night
can be analyzed in about one second on a smartphone.

is associated with the constituent dislocations subject to the constraint of
Frank's formula. The orientation-dependent continuous distributions of
dislocation lines on grain boundaries are described conveniently using the
dislocation density potential functions, whose contour lines on the grain
boundaries represent the dislocations. The energy of a grain boundary is the
total energy of the constituent dislocations derived from discrete dislocation

dislocations. The constrained energy minimization problem is solved by the
augmented Lagrangian method and projection method. Comparisons with atomistic
simulation results show that our continuum model is able to give excellent

exposure to opinions might result in echo chambers, i.e., political
fragmentation and social polarization of user interactions. When echo chambers
form, opinions have a bimodal distribution with two peaks on opposite sides. In
certain issues, where either extreme positions contain a degree of
misinformation, neutral consensus is preferable for promoting discourse. In
this paper, we use an opinion dynamics model that naturally forms echo chambers
in order to find a feedback mechanism that bridges these communities and leads
to a neutral consensus. We introduce random dynamical nudge (RDN), which
presents each agent with input from a random selection of other agents'
opinions and does not require surveillance of every person's opinions. Our
computational results in two different models suggest that the RDN leads to a
unimodal distribution of opinions centered around the neutral consensus.
Furthermore, the RDN is effective both for preventing the formation of echo
chambers and also for depolarizing existing echo chambers. Due to the simple
and robust nature of the RDN, social media networks might be able to implement

financial analysis problem. Prevailing methods depend predominantly on
quantitative ratios and techniques, which suffer from limitations like window
dressing and past focus. Most of the information in a firm's financial
disclosures is in unstructured text and contains valuable information about its
health. Humans and machines fail to analyze it satisfactorily due to the
enormous volume and unstructured nature, respectively. Researchers have started
analyzing text content in disclosures recently. This paper covers the previous
work in unstructured data analysis in Finance and Accounting. It also explores
the state of art methods in computational linguistics and reviews the current
methodologies in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, it focuses on
research related to text source, linguistic attributes, firm attributes, and
mathematical models employed in the text analysis approach. This work
contributes to disclosure analysis methods by highlighting the limitations of
the current focus on sentiment metrics and highlighting broader future research

observations suggest the influence of mechanical effects upon chemically active
metamorphic minerals. Thus, the understanding of such a coupling is crucial to
describe the dynamics of geomaterials. In this effort, we derive a
thermodynamically-consistent framework to characterize the evolution of
chemically active minerals. We model the metamorphic mineral assemblages as a
solid-species solution where the species mass transport and chemical reaction
drive the stress generation process. The theoretical foundations of the
framework rely on modern continuum mechanics, thermodynamics far from
equilibrium, and the phase-field model. We treat the mineral solid solution as
a continuum body, and following the Larch\'e and Cahn network model, we define
displacement and strain fields. Consequently, we obtain a set of coupled
chemo-mechanical equations. We use the aforementioned framework to study single
minerals as solid solutions during metamorphism. Furthermore, we emphasise the
use of the phase-field framework as a promising tool to model complex
multi-physics processes in geoscience. Without loss of generality, we use
common physical and chemical parameters found in the geoscience literature to
portrait a comprehensive view of the underlying physics. Thereby, we carry out
2D and 3D numerical simulations using material parameters for metamorphic
minerals to showcase and verify the chemo-mechanical interactions of mineral
solid solutions that undergo spinodal decomposition, chemical reactions, and
deformation.

[0,1]$, it follows the PA rule. Otherwise, this new edge is added between two
uniformly chosen nodes. Such mixture makes the in- and out-degrees of a fixed

lighter distributional tails. Useful inference methods for the proposed hybrid
model are then provided and applied to both synthetic and real datasets. We see
that with extra flexibility given by the parameter $p$, the hybrid random
network provides a better fit to real-world scenarios, where lighter tails from
in- and out-degrees are observed.

(GUP) on the stochastic gravitational wave (SGW) background signal that
produced during first order cosmological QCD phase transition in early
universe. A modified formula of entropy is used to calculate the temporal
evolution of temperature of the universe as a function of the Hubble parameter.
The pressure that results from the recent lattice calculations, which provides
parameterizations of the pressure due to $u,~d,~s$ quarks and gluons, with
trace anomaly is used to describe the equation of state around QCD epoch. A
redshift in the peak frequency of SGW at current epoch is calculated. The
results indicate an increase in the frequency peak due to GUP effect, which
improves the ability to detect it. Taking into account bubble wall collisions
(BWC) and turbulent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as a source of SGW, a fractional
energy density is investigated. It is found that the GUP effect weakens the SGW
signal generated during QCD phase transition in comparison to its counterpart
in the absence of GUP. These results support understanding the cosmological QCD
phase transition and test the effectiveness of the GUP theory.

In

approach that combines the opinion of two decision-making systems with
complementary properties: ($DS_1$) a simpler system based on very fast
handcrafted image feature extraction and support vector machine classification
and ($DS_2$) a more complex system based on a deep neural network, Vgg-16, for
image feature extraction and classification. $DS_1$ is much faster than $DS_2$,
but it is less accurate than $DS_2$. Fortunately, the errors of $DS_1$ are not
the same of $DS_2$. During training, we use a validation set to learn the
probabilities of misclassification by $DS_1$ on each class based on its
confidence values. When $DS_1$ quickly classifies all images from a microscopy
slide, the method selects a number of images with higher chances of
misclassification for characterization and reclassification by $DS_2$. Our
hybrid system can improve the overall effectiveness without compromising
efficiency, being suitable for the clinical routine -- a strategy that might be
suitable for other real applications. As demonstrated on large datasets, the
proposed system can achieve, on average, 94.9%, 87.8%, and 92.5% of Cohen's

forecasting and climate modelling as cloud properties depend on interdependent
natural processes at micro and macro scales. Turbulence plays an important role
in particle dynamics inside clouds; however, turbulence mechanisms are not yet
fully understood partly due to the difficulty of measuring clouds at the
smallest scales. To address these knowledge gaps, an experimental method for
measuring the influence of fine-scale turbulence in cloud formation in-situ and
producing an in-field cloud Lagrangian dataset is being developed by means of
innovative ultra-light radioprobes. This paper presents the electronic system
design along with the obtained results from laboratory and field experiments
regarding these compact (diameter about 30 cm), light-weight (about 20 g), and
expendable devices designed to passively float and track small-scale turbulence
fluctuations inside warm clouds. The fully customized mini radioprobe board (5
cm x 5 cm) embeds sensors to measure local fluctuations and transmit data to
the ground in near real-time. The tests confirm that the newly developed probes
perform well providing accurate information about atmospheric variables,
referenced in space. The integration of multiple radioprobes allows for a
systematic and accurate monitoring of atmospheric turbulence and its impact on
cloud formation.

the ruminants. Thus, changes in the livestock behavior are a critical indicator
for early detection and prevention of several diseases. Rumination behavior is
a significant variable for tracking the development and yield of animal
husbandry. Therefore, various monitoring methods and measurement equipment have
been used to assess cattle behavior. However, these modern attached devices are
invasive, stressful and uncomfortable for the cattle and can influence
negatively the welfare and diurnal behavior of the animal. Multiple research
efforts addressed the problem of rumination detection by adopting new methods
by relying on visual features. However, they only use few postures of the dairy
cow to recognize the rumination or feeding behavior. In this study, we
introduce an innovative monitoring method using Convolution Neural Network

two main labels: ruminating and other, using all cow postures captured by the

hierarchy of information plays an important role in diffusion and opinion
dynamics within communities. For example at the individual agent level, more
recently acquired information may exert greater influence during
decision-making processes. To facilitate further exploration of this effect, we
introduce an efficient method for modelling temporally asynchronous opinion
updates, where the timing of updates depends on the timing of incoming opinion
states received from neighbours. The framework enables the introduction of
information arrival-time lag by means of lag-vectors. These are used to weight
the relevance of information received by agents, based on the delay between its
receipt and the subsequent opinion update. The temporal dynamics (i.e. the
times at which information is transmitted) are governed by an underlying
algebraic structure called max-plus algebra. We investigate the resulting
continuous opinion dynamics under the max-plus regime using a modified
Hegselmann-Krause model, replacing the conventional confidence-interval based
on the distance between opinions with one based instead on the recency of
information received by agents.
