for non-Markovian problems and illustrate it by optimizing the shape of a laser
pulse to prepare a quantum dot in a specific state. The optimization of open
quantum system dynamics with strong coupling to structured environments --
where time-local descriptions fail -- is a computationally challenging task. We
modify the numerically exact time evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO)
method, such that it allows the repeated computation of the time evolution of
the reduced system density matrix for various sets of control parameters at
very low computational cost. This method is potentially useful for studying
numerous quantum optimal control problems, in particular in solid state quantum
devices where the coupling to vibrational modes is typically strong.

empirically demonstrate that both laws are tied to each other and derive an

pronounced in countries with fewer small cities and more metropolises (small

scaling does not solely emerge from intra-city processes, as population
distribution and scaling of urban GDP are correlated to each other.

Knowing the sparsity of such a graphical model is valuable for modeling
multivariate distributions and for efficiently performing inference. While the
problem of learning graph structure from data has been studied extensively for
certain parametric families of distributions, most existing methods fail to
consistently recover the graph structure for non-Gaussian data. Here we propose
an algorithm for learning the Markov structure of continuous and non-Gaussian

based on integrated Hessian information from the joint log-density, and we
prove that this score upper bounds the conditional mutual information for a
general class of distributions. To compute the score, our algorithm SING
estimates the density using a deterministic coupling, induced by a triangular
transport map, and iteratively exploits sparse structure in the map to reveal
sparsity in the graph. For certain non-Gaussian datasets, we show that our

polycation chitosan results in cellulose model surfaces with higher film
thicknesses and a tunable roughness. The PEMs prepared from both polycations
exhibit a high water uptake when exposed to a humid environment. The resulting
PEMs are suitable water-stable but water swellable model surfaces with a
controllable roughness and topography.

properties of propositional sequent systems such as admissibility,
invertibility, cut-elimination, and identity expansion. Although undecidable in
general, these structural properties are crucial in proof theory because they
can reduce the proof-search effort and further be used as scaffolding for
obtaining other meta-results such as consistency. The algorithms -- which take
advantage of the rewriting logic meta-logical framework, and use rewrite- and
narrowing-based reasoning -- are explained in detail and illustrated with
examples throughout the paper. They have been fully mechanized in the
L-Framework, thus offering both a formal specification language and
off-the-shelf mechanization of the proof-search algorithms coming together with
semi-decision procedures for proving theorems and meta-theorems of the object

achieves a great degree of automation when used on several propositional

field $K$ of characteristic zero and $O$ one of the $(2g+2)$ Weierstrass points
in $C(K)$. Let $J$ be the jacobian of $C$, which is a $g$-dimensional abelian
variety over $K$. Let us consider the canonical embedding of $C$ into $J$ that
sends $O$ to the zero of the group law on $J$. This embedding allows us to
identify $C(K)$ with a certain subset of the commutative group $J(K)$.
  A special case of the famous theorem of Raynaud (Manin--Mumford conjecture)
asserts that the set of torsion points in $C(K)$ is finite. It is well known
that the points of order 2 in $C(K)$ are exactly the ""remaining"" $(2g+1)$
Weierstrass points. One of the authors proved that there are no torsion points
of order $n$ in $C(K)$ if $3\le n\le 2g$. So, it is natural to study torsion
points of order $2g+1$ (notice that the number of such points in $C(K)$ is
always even). Recently, the authors proved that there are infinitely many (for
a given $g$) mutually nonisomorphic pairs $C,O)$ such that $C(K)$ contains at
least four points of order $2g+1$.
  In the present paper we prove that (for a given $g$) there are at most
finitely many (up to a isomorphism) pairs $(C,O)$ such that $C(K)$ contains at
least six points of order $2g+1$.

classical phase space description of gravity in terms of $SU(2)$ connections
and electric fields. As emphasized recently [1], on this phase space, classical
gravitational evolution in $time$ can be understood in terms of certain gauge
covariant generalizations of Lie derivatives with respect to a $spatial$
$SU(2)$ Lie algebra valued vector field called the Electric Shift. We present a
derivation of a quantum dynamics for Euclidean LQG which is informed by this
understanding. In addition to the physically motivated nature of the action of
the Euclidean Hamiltonian constraint so derived, the derivation implies that
the spin labels of regulating holonomies are determined by corresponding labels
of the spin network state being acted upon thus eliminating the `spin
$j$-ambiguity' pointed out by Perez. By virtue of Thiemann's seminal work, the
Euclidean quantum dynamics plays a crucial role in the construction of the
Lorentzian quantum dynamics so that our considerations also have application to
Lorentzian LQG.

from the simplified analysis of the plasma quasi-thermal noise (QTN) spectrum

Combining observations from E01, E02, E04, and E05, the averaged energy flux
value normalized to 1 $R_\odot{}$ plus the energy necessary to overcome the

similar to the average value (79$\pm$18 $W m^{-2}$) derived by Le Chat et al

over the Clifford+T gate set. First we construct a special subset of T-depth 1
unitaries, such that it is possible to express the T-depth-optimal
decomposition of any unitary as product of unitaries from this subset and a
Clifford (up to global phase). The cardinality of this subset is at most
$n\cdot 2^{5.6n}$. We use nested meet-in-the-middle (MITM) technique to develop
algorithms for synthesizing provably \emph{depth-optimal} and
\emph{T-depth-optimal} circuits for exactly implementable unitaries.
Specifically, for synthesizing T-depth-optimal circuits, we get an algorithm
with space and time complexity $O\left(\left(4^{n^2}\right)^{\lceil
d/c\rceil}\right)$ and $O\left(\left(4^{n^2}\right)^{(c-1)\lceil
d/c\rceil}\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the minimum T-depth and $c\geq 2$
is a constant. This is much better than the complexity of the algorithm by Amy

2^{kn^2}\right)^{\lceil \frac{d}{2}\rceil}\cdot 2^{kn^2}\right)$, where $k>2.5$
is a constant. We design an even more efficient algorithm for synthesizing
T-depth-optimal circuits. The claimed efficiency and optimality depends on some
conjectures, which have been inspired from the work of Mosca and Mukhopadhyay
(2020). To the best of our knowledge, the conjectures are not related to the
previous work. Our algorithm has space and time complexity $poly(n,2^{5.6n},d)$

the biggest challenge for the practical applications of any near-term quantum
devices. Full quantum error correction cannot be implemented in these devices
due to their limited scale. Therefore instead of relying on engineered code
symmetry, symmetry verification was developed which uses the inherent symmetry
within the physical problem we try to solve. In this article, we develop a
general framework named symmetry expansion which provides a wide spectrum of
symmetry-based error mitigation schemes beyond symmetry verification, enabling
us to achieve different balances between the estimation bias and the sampling
cost of the scheme. We show that certain symmetry expansion schemes can achieve
a smaller estimation bias than symmetry verification through cancellation
between the biases due to the detectable and undetectable noise components. A
practical way to search for such a small-bias scheme is introduced. By
numerically simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model for energy estimation, the
small-bias symmetry expansion we found can achieve an estimation bias 6 to 9
times below what is achievable by symmetry verification when the average number
of circuit errors is between 1 to 2. The corresponding sampling cost for random
shot noise reduction is just 2 to 6 times higher than symmetry verification.
Beyond symmetries inherent to the physical problem, our formalism is also
applicable to engineered symmetries. For example, the recent scheme for
exponential error suppression using multiple noisy copies of the quantum device
is just a special case of symmetry expansion using the permutation symmetry
among the copies.

gravitational field strengths that they experience. We report here some hints
for such a differential tidal effects in structural parameters of star clusters
in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which is nearly 10 times less massive than
the LMC. A key contribution to this study is the consideration of the SMC as a
triaxial spheroid, from which we estimate the deprojected distances to the SMC
center of the statistically significant sample of star clusters analyzed. By
adopting a 3D geometry of the SMC, we avoid the spurious effects caused by
considering that a star cluster observed along the line-of-sight is close to
the galaxy center. When inspecting the relationships between the star cluster
sizes (represented by the 90% light radii), their eccentricities, masses and
ages with the deprojected distances, we find: (i) the star cluster sizes are
not visibly affected by tidal effects, because relatively small and large
objects are spread through the SMC body. (ii) Star clusters with large
eccentricities (> 0.4) are preferentially found located at deprojected
distances smaller than $\sim$ 7-8 kpc, although many star clusters with smaller
eccentricities are also found occupying a similar volume. (iii) Star clusters
more massive than log(M /Mo) $\sim$ 4.0 are among the oldest star clusters,
generally placed in the outermost SMC region and with a relative small level of
flattening. These findings contrast with the more elongated, generally younger,
less massive and innermost star clusters.

dilute emulsion of monodispersed ferrofluid droplets, immersed in a
non-magnetizable immiscible fluid, is investigated using direct numerical
simulations. The direction of the applied magnetic field is normal to the shear
flow direction. The droplets extra stress tensor arising from the presence of
interfacial forces of magnetic nature is modeled on the basis of the seminal
work of G. K. Batchelor, J. Fluid Mech., 41.3 (1970) under the assumptions of a
linearly magnetizable ferrofluid phase and negligible inertia. The results show
that even relatively small magnetic fields can have significant consequences on
the rheological properties of the emulsion due to the magnetic forces that
contribute to deform and orient the droplets towards the direction of the
applied magnetic vector. In particular, we have observed an increase of the
effective (bulk) viscosity and a reversal of the sign of the two normal stress
differences with respect to the case without magnetic field for those
conditions where the magnetic force prevails over the shearing force.
Comparisons between the results of our model with a direct integration of the
viscous stress have provided an indication of its reliability to predict the
effective viscosity of the suspension. Moreover, this latter quantity has been
found to behave as a monotonic increasing function of the applied magnetic
field for constant shearing flows (""magneto-thickening"" behaviour), which
allowed us to infer a simple constitutive equation describing the emulsion
viscosity.

Peccei-Quinn mechanism to solve the strong CP problem. It is therefore natural
to use an effective field theory (EFT) to describe its interactions. Loop
processes calculated in the EFT may, however, explicitly depend on the
ultraviolet cutoff. In general the UV cutoff is not uniquely defined, but the
dimensionful couplings suggest to identify it with the Peccei-Quinn
symmetry-breaking scale. An example are $K \rightarrow \pi + a$ decays that
will soon be tested to improved precision in NA62 and KOTO and whose amplitude
is dominated by the term logarithmically dependent on the cutoff. In this
paper, we critically examine the adequacy of using such a naive EFT approach to
study loop processes by comparing EFT calculations with ones performed in
complete QCD axion models. In DFSZ models, for example, the cutoff is found to
be set by additional Higgs degrees of freedom and to therefore be much closer
to the electroweak scale than to the Peccei-Quinn scale. In fact, there are
non-trivial requirements on axion models where the cutoff scale of loop
processes is close to the Peccei-Quinn scale, such that the naive EFT result is
reproduced. This suggests that the existence of a suitable UV embedding may
impose restrictions on axion EFTs. We provide an explicit construction of a
model with suitable fermion couplings and find promising prospects for NA62 and
IAXO.

the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. Using the full 6D measurements, we compute
the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the stars in six different groups
within the Orion Complex. We find that the motions of stars in all diffuse
groups exhibit strong characteristics of turbulence. Their first-order VSFs
have a power-law exponent ranging from $\sim0.2-0.5$ on scales of a few to a
few tens of pc, generally consistent with Larson's relation. On the other hand,
dense star clusters, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), have experienced
rapid dynamical relaxation, and have lost the memory of the initial turbulent
kinematics. The VSFs of several individual groups and the whole Complex all
show features supporting local energy injection from supernovae. The measured
strength of turbulence depends on the location relative to the supernova
epicenters and the formation history of the groups. Our detection of turbulence
traced by young stars introduces a new method of probing the turbulent
kinematics of the ISM. Unlike previous gas-based studies with only projected
measurements accessible to observations, we utilize the full 6D information of
stars, presenting a more complete picture of the 3D interstellar turbulence.

this, we directly compare the substructure of galaxy clusters and of
surrounding galaxy groups in hydrodynamical and dark matter-only simulations.
We utilise TheThreeHundred project, a suite of 324 simulations of galaxy
clusters that have been simulated with hydrodynamics, and in dark matter-only.
We find that dark matter-only simulations underestimate the number density of
galaxies in the centres of groups and clusters relative to hydrodynamical
simulations, and that this effect is stronger in denser regions. We also look
at the phase space of infalling galaxy groups, to show that dark matter-only
simulations underpredict the number density of galaxies in the centres of these

of infalling groups may be different to that predicted by dark matter-only

reveal a SMBH with a mass of $(1.6\pm0.4) \times10^9M_\odot$ in this quasar.
The existence of such a massive SMBH just $\sim$670 million years after the Big

the quasar spectrum exhibits strong broad absorption line (BAL) features in CIV

relativistic BAL features, combined with a strongly blueshifted CIV emission
line, indicate that there is a strong active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven

anticipation of the JWST mission, we model the physical and chemical structure
of a T Tauri disk to predict the abundances and mid-infrared fluxes of

the destruction of refractory carbon materials and alterations to the total
elemental (volatile and refractory) C/O ratio. Photon-driven chemistry in the
inner disk surface layers largely destroys the initial carbon and oxygen
carriers. This causes models with the same physical structure and C/O ratio to
have similar steady state surface compositions, regardless of the initial
chemical abundances. Initial disk compositions are better preserved in the
shielded inner disk midplane. The degree of similarity between the surface and
midplane compositions in the inner disk will depend on the characteristics of
vertical mixing at these radii. Our modeled fluxes of observable molecules
respond sensitively to changes in the disk gas temperature, inner radius, and
the total elemental C/O ratio. As a result, mid-infrared observations of disks
will be useful probes of these fundamental disk parameters, including the C/O

dew point results in micro-sized water droplets. Lord Rayleigh discussed the
phenomenon called such behavior Breath Figures (BF). Historically, utilizing
dew as a water source was investigated by several scientists dating back to
Aristotle. However, due to the degrading effects of air as a non-condensable
gas (NCG) such efforts are limited to small scale water production systems.
Recently, the concept of BF has been utilized extensively in the generation of
micro-scale polymer patterns as a self-assembly process. However, the
generation of BF on surfaces while being impinged by a humid air jet has not
been quantified. In this work, we illustrate that a BF spot generated on a
cooled surface is a manifestation of a recovery concentration. The concept is
analogous to the concept of adiabatic-wall temperature defined for heat
transfer applications. Upon closer examination of the vapor concentration
distribution on a cooled impinged surface, we found that the distribution
exhibits distinct regimes depending on the radial location from the center of
the impingement region. The first regime is confined within the impingement
region, whereas the second regime lies beyond this radial location including
the wall jet region. Scaling analysis as well as numerical solution of the
former regime shows that the maximum concentration on the surface is equivalent
to its counterpart of a free unbounded jet with similar geometrical conditions.
Additionally, the scaling analysis of the latter regime reveals that the jet
speed and standoff distance are not important in determining the recovery
concentration. However, the recovery concentration is found to vary
monotonically with the radial location. Our conclusions are of great importance
in optimizing jet impingement where condensation phase change is prevalent.

Hamiltonian with up to 100 spins. The method allow us to choose the arrival of
the transferred state by changing the range available to the exchange coupling
strengths. We consider short transferred times, in particular shorter than
those achievable with known time-dependent control schemes. The chains obtained
with the optimization method show some remarkable and interesting traits as,
for instance, the scaling of the magnitude of the exchange couplings needed to
achieve near perfect state transfer with the length of the chain and the
arrival time. This scaling makes it possible to decide if the chain with
site-dependent coefficients can be implemented in an actual system according to
the range of interactions allowed in it. We compare the robustness of the
transmission protocol against static disorder on the exchange coefficients
using different figures of merit, which allow us to conclude that the isotropic
Heisenberg chain is the best option when compared with anisotropic chains. This
comparison is relevant since the method allow us to start with chains that all
achieve near perfect quantum state transfer, regime that was not available
previously in these chains without time-dependent external control.

to the soil. Adjusting the right percentages of clover and grass in a field
reduces the need for external fertilization. Existing approaches for estimating
the grass-clover composition of a field are expensive and time consuming -
random samples of the pasture are clipped and then the components are
physically separated to weigh and calculate percentages of dry grass, clover

learning based approaches to non-destructively extract pasture phenotype
indicators and biomass yield predictions of different plant species from
agricultural imagery collected from the field. Providing these indicators and

perform well with large datasets, it is tedious to acquire large and diverse

Following a strong photoexcitation, the band gap closes transiently within 100
fs, i.e., on a time scale faster than the typical lattice vibrational period.
Furthermore, we find that the characteristic time associated with the rise of
the photoemission intensity above the Fermi energy decreases with increasing
excitation strength, while the relaxation time of the electron population
towards equilibrium shows an opposite behaviour. We argue that these
experimental observations can be consistently explained by an excitonic origin

microscopic calculations based on the non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism for an interacting two-band system. We interpret the speedup of the
rise time with fluence in terms of an enhanced scattering probability between
photo-excited electrons and excitons, leading to an initially faster decay of
the order parameter. We show that the inclusion of electron-phonon coupling at

SN 2019yvr obtained 2.6 years before its explosion as a type Ib supernova (SN
Ib). Aligning to a post-explosion Gemini-S/GSAOI image, we demonstrate that
there is a single source consistent with being the SN 2019yvr progenitor
system, the second SN Ib progenitor candidate after iPTF13bvn. We also analyzed
pre-explosion Spitzer/IRAC imaging, but we do not detect any counterparts at
the SN location. SN 2019yvr was highly reddened, and comparing its spectra and
photometry to those of other, less extinguished SNe Ib we derive
$E(B-V)=0.51\substack{+0.27\\-0.16}$ mag for SN 2019yvr. Correcting photometry
of the pre-explosion source for dust reddening, we determine that this source
is consistent with a $\log(L/L_{\odot}) = 5.3 \pm 0.2$ and $T_{\mathrm{eff}} =
6800\substack{+400\\-200}$ K star. This relatively cool photospheric
temperature implies a radius of 320$\substack{+30\\-50} R_{\odot}$, much larger
than expectations for SN Ib progenitor stars with trace amounts of hydrogen but
in agreement with previously identified SN IIb progenitor systems. The
photometry of the system is also consistent with binary star models that
undergo common envelope evolution, leading to a primary star hydrogen envelope
mass that is mostly depleted but seemingly in conflict with the SN Ib
classification of SN 2019yvr. SN 2019yvr had signatures of strong circumstellar
interaction in late-time ($>$150 day) spectra and imaging, and so we consider
eruptive mass loss and common envelope evolution scenarios that explain the SN
Ib spectroscopic class, pre-explosion counterpart, and dense circumstellar
material. We also hypothesize that the apparent inflation could be caused by a
quasi-photosphere formed in an extended, low-density envelope or circumstellar
matter around the primary star.

problem of interest in Natural Language Processing in the recent years. Our
work leverages state of the art Transformer language models to identify hate
speech in a multilingual setting. Capturing the intent of a post or a comment
on social media involves careful evaluation of the language style, semantic
content and additional pointers such as hashtags and emojis. In this paper, we
look at the problem of identifying whether a Twitter post is hateful and
offensive or not. We further discriminate the detected toxic content into one
of the following three classes: (a) Hate Speech (HATE), (b) Offensive (OFFN)
and (c) Profane (PRFN). With a pre-trained multilingual Transformer-based text
encoder at the base, we are able to successfully identify and classify hate
speech from multiple languages. On the provided testing corpora, we achieve
Macro F1 scores of 90.29, 81.87 and 75.40 for English, German and Hindi
respectively while performing hate speech detection and of 60.70, 53.28 and
49.74 during fine-grained classification. In our experiments, we show the
efficacy of Perspective API features for hate speech classification and the
effects of exploiting a multilingual training scheme. A feature selection study
is provided to illustrate impacts of specific features upon the architecture's
classification head.

combining three catalogs of WR galaxies/regions previously selected from the
SDSS and SDSS-IV/MaNGA surveys. We measure the equivalent widths of the WR blue

Both singular evolution and binary evolution are considered. We also use a

stellar population spectra from BPASS as fitting templates. We then make model
selection among different {\alpha} assumptions based on Bayesian evidence.
These analyses have consistently led to a positive correlation of IMF high-mass
slope {\alpha} with stellar metallicity Z, i.e. with steeper IMF (more
bottom-heavy) at higher metallicities. Specifically, an IMF with {\alpha}=1.00
is preferred at the lowest metallicity (Z~0.001), and a Salpeter or even
steeper IMF is preferred at the highest metallicity (Z~0.03). These conclusions
hold even when binary population models are adopted.

predictor of individual solo publishing rate is the average team size,
publishing in STEM fields negatively affects the rate, publishing in

computational challenge in factorizing huge template matrices. Previously, [in
Kulkarni et al. [6]], we introduced the idea of random projection (RP)-based
matrix factorization as a computationally viable alternative to SVD, applicable
for large template banks. This follow-up paper demonstrates the application of
a block-wise randomized matrix factorization (RMF) algorithm for computing
low-rank factorizations at a preset average fractional loss of SNR. This new
scheme is shown to be more efficient in the context of the LLOID framework of
the GstLAL search pipeline. Further, it is well-known that for huge template
banks, the total computational cost of the search is dominated by
reconstructing the detection statistic compared to that of filtering the data.
However, optimizing the reconstruction cost has not been addressed
satisfactorily so far in the available literature. We show that it is possible
to approximately reconstruct the time-series of the matched-filter detection
statistic at a fraction of the total cost using the matching pursuit algorithm.
Combining the two algorithms presented in this paper can handle online searches
involving large template banks more efficiently. We have analyzed the total
computational cost in detail and offer various tips for optimally applying the
RMF scheme in different parts of the parameter space. The algorithms presented
in this paper are designed in a suitable manner that can be efficiently
implemented over a distributed computing architecture.

quickly to decide satisfiability, both to declare and prove unsatisfiability

are partly chosen to be small enough to plot the performance against exhaustive
search, which takes around 2 hours 20 minutes to comb through the parameter

rather simple and effective, while a more careful Boolean SAT encoding provides
a significant speed-up -- determining satisfiability or unsatisfiability has,
in our experiments varied between 0.03 and 0.06 seconds, while determining all
models (where models exist) took 19 seconds for a constraint system that allows
for 2048 models and 8.4 seconds for a constraint system that admits 640 models.
We thus gain several orders of magnitude in speed, and this advantage is set to
grow with a growing parameter space. This holds the promise that the method
scales well beyond the initial problem we have used it for in this paper.

non-wetting phase into voxel images. This method is complementary to the
traditional morphological image opening method which mimics pressure-based
invasion. A key advantage of the volume-based approach is that all saturations
between 0 and 1 can obtained rather than the irregularly and widely spaced
saturation steps obtained by pressure-based methods. Because of the incremental
increases in saturation, it becomes possible to correctly predict defending
phase trapping, which is not the case when pressure-based steps are applied.
The algorithm is validated against morphological image opening and obtains near
perfect agreement at equal saturations as expected from theory. It is also
demonstrated that a volume-controlled capillary pressure curve can be obtained
that displays the characteristic jumps in capillary pressure, and moreover, the
envelop of peak pressures yields the pressure-based capillary pressure obtained
by morphological opening, so in fact the results of the proposed algorithm are
a superset of the morphological approach. Finally, results are compared to
multiphase lattice Boltzmann and qualitatively similar results were achieved in
substantially less time. The lattice Boltzmann method is more flexible in terms
of variable contact angle and inclusion of viscous effects, but for
quasi-static volume-based injection of a non-wetting fluid, the proposed method
is viable alternative.

the quiet conditions during the eruption and the lack of interactions during
the interplanetary CME transport to the Earth, the associated MFR preserved its
configuration and reached the Earth with a strong magnetic field, low density,
and a very low turbulence level compared to the local background, thus
generating the ideal conditions to redirect and guide GCRs (in the $\sim$ 8 to

the mean field. To disentangle these effects we employ three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations that explore a wide range of
initial turbulent and magnetic states, i.e., sub-Alfv\'enic to super-Alfv\'enic

(HRO) and the associated projected Rayleigh statistics (PRS) to study the
orientation of density and, in order to compare with observations, the
integrated density relative to the magnetic field. We find that in
sub-Alfv\'enic systems the initial coherence of the magnetic is maintained
inside the cloud and filaments form perpendicular to the field. This trend is
not observed in super-Alfv\'enic models, where the lines are dragged by gravity
and turbulence and filaments are mainly aligned to the field. The PRS analysis
of integrated maps shows that LOS effects are important only for sub-Alfv\'enic
clouds. When the LOS is perpendicular to the initial field orientation most of
the filaments are perpendicular to the projected magnetic field. The inclusion
of gravity increases the number of dense structures perpendicular to the

allow for frequent automated assessments so care staff could be automatically
notified when signs of pain are displayed. However, existing computer vision
techniques for pain detection are not validated on faces of older adults or
people with dementia, and this population is not represented in existing facial
expression datasets of pain. We present the first fully automated vision-based
technique validated on a dementia cohort. Our contributions are threefold.
First, we develop a deep learning-based computer vision system for detecting
painful facial expressions on a video dataset that is collected unobtrusively
from older adult participants with and without dementia. Second, we introduce a
pairwise comparative inference method that calibrates to each person and is
sensitive to changes in facial expression while using training data more

framework to model heterogeneous service demand of nursing home residents and
further identify appropriate staffing strategies by combing survival model and
computer simulation techniques as well as domain knowledge. Specifically, in
the analysis, we develop an agent-based simulation tool consisting of four main
modules, namely individual length of stay predictor, individual daily staff
time generator, facility level staffing strategy evaluator, and graphical user
interface. We use real nursing home data to validate the proposed model, and
demonstrate that the identified staffing strategy significantly reduces the
total labor cost of certified nursing assistants compared to the benchmark
strategies. Additionally, the proposed length of stay predictive model that
considers multiple discharge dispositions exhibits superior accuracy and offers
better staffing decisions than those without the consideration. Further, we
construct different census scenarios of nursing home residents to demonstrate
the capability of the proposed framework in helping adjust staffing decisions
of nursing home administrators in various realistic settings.

a sparse sub-network that can match the performance of the original dense
network when trained in isolation from scratch. Most works retrain the sparse
sub-network with the same training protocols as its dense network, such as
initialization, architecture blocks, and training recipes. However, till now it
is unclear that whether these training protocols are optimal for sparse
networks.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that it is unnecessary for spare retraining to
strictly inherit those properties from the dense network. Instead, by plugging
in purposeful ""tweaks"" of the sparse subnetwork architecture or its training
recipe, its retraining can be significantly improved than the default,
especially at high sparsity levels. Combining all our proposed ""tweaks"" can
yield the new state-of-the-art performance of LTH, and these modifications can
be easily adapted to other sparse training algorithms in general. Specifically,
we have achieved a significant and consistent performance gain of1.05% - 4.93%

This paper presents a trust-based route planning approach for automated

Markov decision process (POMDP) and model trust as a partially observable state
variable of the POMDP, representing the human's hidden mental state. We build
data-driven models of human trust dynamics and takeover decisions, which are

optimal routes for automated vehicles by solving optimal policies in the POMDP
planning, and evaluate the resulting routes via human subject experiments with
22 participants on a driving simulator. The experimental results show that
participants taking the trust-based route generally reported more positive
responses in the after-driving survey than those taking the baseline
(trust-free) route. In addition, we analyze the trade-offs between multiple
planning objectives (e.g., trust, distance, energy consumption) via
multi-objective optimization of the POMDP. We also identify a set of open

counterparts with the overall gain of 10-15% in its efficiency. Qualitatively
and more significantly, DeepCQ+ maintains remarkably similar performance gains
under many scenarios that it was not trained for in terms of network sizes,
mobility conditions, and traffic dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first successful demonstration of MADRL for the MANET routing problem

reconstruct solar wind inhomogeneous structures, or transients, using dual-view
white-light images (Li et al. 2020; Li et al. 2018). This method is proved to
be useful for studying the morphological and dynamical properties of transients
like blobs and coronal mass ejection (CME), but the accuracy of reconstruction
may be affected by the separation angle between the two spacecraft (Lyu et al.
2020). Based on the dual-view CME events from the Heliospheric Imager CME Join
Catalogue (HIJoinCAT) in the HELCATS (Heliospheric Cataloguing, Analysis and
Techniques Service) project, we study the quality of the CME reconstruction by
the CORAR method under different STEREO stereoscopic angles. We find that when
the separation angle of spacecraft is around 150{\deg}, most CME events can be
well reconstructed. If the collinear effect is considered, the optimal
separation angle should locate between 120{\deg} and 150{\deg}. Compared with
the CME direction given in the Heliospheric Imager Geometrical Catalogue
(HIGeoCAT) from HELCATS, the CME parameters obtained by the CORAR method are
reasonable. However, the CORAR-obtained directions have deviations towards the
meridian plane in longitude, and towards the equatorial plane in latitude. An
empirical formula is proposed to correct these deviations. This study provides
the basis for the spacecraft configuration of our recently proposed Solar Ring
mission concept (Wang et al. 2020b).

to the special Dirac-cone band structure of graphene, the Dirac model
reproduces results of the tight-binding method for energy smaller than
\SI{3}{\electronvolt}. For doped graphene, the intra-band transitions dominate
at low energies and can be described by the Lindhard formula for

competitive performances. Here, we propose a novel PGM without imposing any
distributional assumptions on attributes, which is superior to the existing
PGMs that require attributes to be categorical or Gaussian distributed. Based
on the block model of graph structure, our model incorporates the attribute by
describing its effect on node popularity. To characterize the effect
quantitatively, we analyze the community detectability for our model and then
establish the requirements of the node popularity term. This leads to a new
scheme for the crucial model selection problem in choosing and solving
attributed community detection models. With the model determined, an efficient
algorithm is developed to estimate the parameters and to infer the communities.
The proposed method is validated from two aspects. First, the effectiveness of
our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed by the detectability condition.
Second, extensive experiments indicate that our method not only outperforms the
competing approaches on the employed datasets, but also shows better
applicability to networks with various node attributes.

Colonoscopy videos may contain blurry images and frames displaying feces and
water jet sprays to clean the colon -- such frames can mistakenly be detected
as anomalies, so we have implemented a classifier to reject these two types of

polyp, our method localises (with a bounding box around the polyp) and
classifies it into five different classes. Furthermore, we study a method to
improve the reliability and interpretability of the classification result using
uncertainty estimation and classification calibration. Classification

rejecting low-confidence and high-uncertain results, but can be used by doctors
to decide how to decide on the classification of a polyp. All the proposed

proposed, where the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs) are
transformed into parametrized ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The
zero-level set of implicit function is updated through updating the weights and
biases of networks. The parametrized reinitialization is applied periodically
to prevent the implicit function from being too steep or too flat in the
vicinity of its zero-level set. The proposed method is implemented in the
framework of minimum compliance, which is a well-known benchmark for topology

where they can choose a better conceptual design base on their design

captioning tasks, the medical image report composition task poses more
task-oriented challenges by requiring both the highly-accurate medical term
diagnosis and multiple heterogeneous forms of information including impression
and findings. Current methods often generate the most common sentences due to
dataset bias for individual case, regardless of whether the sentences properly
capture key entities and relationships. Such limitations severely hinder their
applicability and generalization capability in medical report composition where
the most critical sentences lie in the descriptions of abnormal diseases that
are relatively rare. Moreover, some medical terms appearing in one report are
often entangled with each other and co-occurred, e.g. symptoms associated with
a specific disease. To enforce the semantic consistency of medical terms to be
incorporated into the final reports and encourage the sentence generation for
rare abnormal descriptions, we propose a novel framework that unifies template
retrieval and sentence generation to handle both common and rare abnormality
while ensuring the semantic-coherency among the detected medical terms.
Specifically, our approach exploits hybrid-knowledge co-reasoning: i) explicit
relationships among all abnormal medical terms to induce the visual attention
learning and topic representation encoding for better topic-oriented symptoms
descriptions; ii) adaptive generation mode that changes between the template
retrieval and sentence generation according to a contextual topic encoder.
Experimental results on two medical report benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed framework in terms of both human and metrics

classes is the primary or only aim, the goal of generalized zero-shot learning
(GZSL) is to recognise both seen and unseen classes. Most GZSL methods
typically learn to synthesise visual representations from semantic information
on the unseen classes. However, these types of models are prone to overfitting
the seen classes, resulting in distribution overlap between the generated
features of the seen and unseen classes. The overlapping region is filled with
uncertainty as the model struggles to determine whether a test case from within
the overlap is seen or unseen. Further, these generative methods suffer in
scenarios with sparse training samples. The models struggle to learn the
distribution of high dimensional visual features and, therefore, fail to
capture the most discriminative inter-class features. To address these issues,
in this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages dual variational
autoencoders with a triplet loss to learn discriminative latent features and
applies the entropy-based calibration to minimize the uncertainty in the
overlapped area between the seen and unseen classes. Specifically, the dual
generative model with the triplet loss synthesises inter-class discriminative
latent features that can be mapped from either visual or semantic space. To
calibrate the uncertainty for seen classes, we calculate the entropy over the
softmax probability distribution from a general classifier. With this approach,
recognising the seen samples within the seen classes is relatively
straightforward, and there is less risk that a seen sample will be
misclassified into an unseen class in the overlapped region. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

bowshock. Although it was theoretically predicted before, it is the first time
that such a jet-DW interaction is directly observed and resolved, and it is
crucial for the proper interpretation and modeling of non-resolved DW
candidates. The resolved kinematics and brightness distribution both support
the wide-angle outflow to be an extended MHD DW dominating the local angular

demonstrate that a topological localized state stands erect in the bulk gap,
and the corresponding pressure distributions are confined at the position with
the maximal curvature. Moreover, we experimentally verify the robustness of the
topological localized state by introducing defects near the localized position.
To understand the underlying mechanism of the topological localized state, a
tight-binding model considering the geometric potential effect is proposed. The
interaction between the geometrical curvature and topology in the system
provides a novel scheme for manipulating and trapping wave propagation along
the boundary of curved TIs, thereby offering potential applications in flexible
devices.

transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we study traffic speed and travel
time estimations in ITS, where portions of the collected data are missing due
to sensor instability and communication errors at collection points. These
practical issues can be remediated by missing data analysis, which are mainly
categorized as either statistical or machine learning(ML)-based approaches.
Statistical methods require the prior probability distribution of the data
which is unknown in our application. Therefore, we focus on an ML-based
approach, Multi-Directional Recurrent Neural Network (M-RNN). M-RNN utilizes
both temporal and spatial characteristics of the data. We evaluate the
effectiveness of this approach on a TomTom dataset containing spatio-temporal
measurements of average vehicle speed and travel time in the Greater Toronto

demonstrate that M-RNN outperforms existing solutions,e.g., spline

elusive, the splitting process has the potential of revealing the filament
structure and eruption mechanism. Here we investigate the pre-eruption
splitting of an apparently single filament and its subsequent partial eruption
on 2012 September 27. The evolution is characterized by three stages with
distinct dynamics. During the quasi-static stage, the splitting proceeds
gradually for about 1.5 hrs, with the upper branch rising at a few kilometers
per second and displaying swirling motions about its axis. During the precursor
stage that lasts for about 10 min, the upper branch rises at tens of kilometers
per second, with a pair of conjugated dimming regions starting to develop at
its footpoints; with the swirling motions turning chaotic, the axis of the
upper branch whips southward, which drives an arc-shaped EUV front propagating
in the similar direction. During the eruption stage, the upper branch erupts
with the onset of a C3.7-class two-ribbon flare, while the lower branch remains
stable. Judging from the well separated footpoints of the upper branch from
those of the lower one, we suggest that the pre-eruption filament processes a
double-decker structure composed of two distinct flux bundles, whose formation
is associated with gradual magnetic flux cancellations and converging
photospheric flows around the polarity inversion line.

two steps. First, we specify the part of data to be focused on and the measure
to be predicted by slicing, dicing, and aggregating the data. Second, a
forecasting model is trained on the aggregated results to predict the trend of
the specified measure. While there are a number of forecasting models

utilize sampling to obtain approximate aggregations in real time as the input
to train the forecasting model. Our scalable real-time forecasting system
FlashP (Flash Prediction) is built based on this idea, with two major

decentralized FL framework, termed VBFL, by exploiting two mechanisms in a
blockchained architecture. First, we introduced a novel decentralized
validation mechanism such that the legitimacy of local model updates is
examined by individual validators. Second, we designed a dedicated
proof-of-stake consensus mechanism where stake is more frequently rewarded to
honest devices, which protects the legitimate local model updates by increasing
their chances of dictating the blocks appended to the blockchain. Together,
these solutions promote more federation within legitimate devices, enabling
robust FL. Our emulation results of the MNIST classification corroborate that
with 15% of malicious devices, VBFL achieves 87% accuracy, which is 7.4x higher
than Vanilla FL.

and the other is weaker spurs that coincide positionally with local spiral arms
in our Galaxy (LAS, local arm spur). Our analysis finds that the X-ray
emissions, not only from the NPS but from the SPS are closer to the Galactic
center by ~5 deg compared with the corresponding radio emission. Furthermore,
larger offsets of 10-20 deg are observed in the LASs; however, they are
attributed to different physical origins. Moreover, the temperature of the
X-ray emission is kT ~ 0.2 keV for the LAS, which is systematically lower than
those of the NPS and SPS (kT ~ 0.3 keV) but consistent with the typical
temperature of Galactic halo gas. We argue that the radio/X-ray offset and the
slightly higher temperature of the NPS/SPS X-ray gas are due to the shock
compression/heating of halo gas during a significant Galactic explosion in the
past, whereas the enhanced X-ray emission from the LAS may be due to the weak
condensation of halo gas in the arm potential or star formation activity
without shock heating.

we proposed LightXML, which adopts end-to-end training and dynamic negative

Through these networks, negative labels are sampled dynamically during label

improve the capacity and reliability of a wireless communication system by
smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. To achieve the
promising gains of IRS, the acquisition of the channel state information (CSI)
is essential, which however is practically difficult since the IRS does not
employ any transmit/receive radio frequency (RF) chains in general and it has
limited signal processing capability. In this paper, we study the uplink
channel estimation problem for an IRS-aided multiuser single-input multi-output
(SIMO) system, and propose a novel two-phase channel estimation (2PCE) strategy
which can alleviate the negative effects caused by error propagation in the
existing three-phase channel estimation approach, i.e., the channel estimation
errors in previous phases will deteriorate the estimation performance in later
phases, and enhance the channel estimation performance with the same amount of
channel training overhead as in the existing approach. Moreover, the asymptotic
mean squared error (MSE) of the 2PCE strategy is analyzed when the least-square
(LS) channel estimation method is employed, and we show that the 2PCE strategy
can outperform the existing approach. Finally, extensive simulation results are
presented to validate the effectiveness of the 2PCE strategy.

in the diamond absorber of a composite semiconducting bolometer `Bolo 184'.
Previous measurements of the response of this bolometer to impacts by $\alpha$
particles show a strong dependence on the location of particle incidence, and
the shape of the response function is determined by the propagation and
thermalisation of athermal phonons. The specific mechanisms of athermal phonon
propagation at this time were undetermined, and hence we have developed three
models for probing this behaviour by attempting to reproduce the statistical
features seen in the experimental data. The first two models assume a phonon
thermalisation length determined by a mean free path $\lambda$, where the first
model assumes that phonons thermalise at the borders of the disc (with a small
$\lambda$) and the second assumes that they reflect (with a $\lambda$ larger
than the size of the disc). The third model allows athermal photons to
propagate along their geometrical line of sight (similar to ray optics),
gradually losing energy. We find that both the reflective model and the
geometrical model reproduce the features seen in experimental data, whilst the
model assuming phonon thermalisation at the disc border produces unrealistic
results. There is no significant dependence on directionality of energy
absorption in the geometrical model, and in the schema of this thin crystalline
diamond, a reflective absorber law and a geometrical law both produce
consistent results.

gravitationally anomalous two-dimensional theories because they do not admit a
local tensor factorization of the Hilbert space into local Hilbert spaces.
Qualitatively, the modular flow cannot act consistently and unitarily in a
finite region, if there are different numbers of states with a given energy
traveling in the two opposite directions. We make this precise by decomposing
it into two observations: First, a two-dimensional CFT admits a consistent
quantization on a space with boundary only if it is not anomalous. Second, a
local tensor factorization always leads to a definition of consistent, unitary,
energy-preserving boundary condition. As a corollary we establish a
generalization of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to all two-dimensional unitary
local QFTs: No continuum quantum field theory in two dimensions can admit a
lattice regulator unless its gravitational anomaly vanishes. We also show that
the conclusion can be generalized to six dimensions by dimensional reduction on
a four-manifold of nonvanishing signature. We advocate that these points be
used to reinterpret the gravitational anomaly
quantum-information-theoretically, as a fundamental obstruction to the

a concrete surface for automated inspection of infrastructure, such as bridges.
Its overall accuracy is determined by how accurately thin cracks with sub-pixel
widths can be detected. Our interest is in making it possible to detect cracks
close to the limit of thinness if it can be defined. Toward this end, we first
propose a method for training a CNN to make it detect cracks more accurately
than humans while training them on human-annotated labels. To achieve this
seemingly impossible goal, we intentionally lower the spatial resolution of
input images while maintaining that of their labels when training a CNN. This
makes it possible to annotate cracks that are too thin for humans to detect,
which we call super-human labels. We experimentally show that this makes it
possible to detect cracks from an image of one-third the resolution of images
used for annotation with about the same accuracy. We additionally propose three
methods for further improving the detection accuracy of thin cracks: i)
P-pooling to maintain small image structures during downsampling operations;
ii) Removal of short-segment cracks in a post-processing step utilizing a prior
of crack shapes learned using the VAE-GAN framework; iii) Modeling uncertainty
of the prediction to better handle hard labels beyond the limit of CNNs'
detection ability, which technically work as noisy labels. We experimentally
examine the effectiveness of these methods.

the homology group dimension represented by Betti numbers demonstrates a strong
dependency on the Hurst exponent ($H$). The coefficients of the birth and death
curve of the $k$-dimensional topological holes ($k$-holes) at a given threshold
depend on $H$ which is almost not affected by finite sample size. We show that
the distribution function of a lifetime for $k$-holes decays exponentially and
the corresponding slope is an increasing function versus $H$, and more
interestingly, the sample size effect completely disappears in this quantity.
The persistence entropy logarithmically grows with the size of the visibility
graph of a system with almost $H$-dependent prefactors. On the contrary, the
local statistical features are not able to determine the corresponding Hurst
exponent of fGn data, while the moments of eigenvalue distribution ($M_{n}$)
for $n\ge1$ reveal a dependency on $H$, containing the sample size effect.

spoken by a target or an imposter speaker. For most studies, a log-likelihood
ratio (LLR) score is estimated based on a generative probability model on
speaker features and compared with a threshold for making a decision. However,
the generative model usually focuses on individual feature distributions, does
not have the discriminative feature selection ability, and is easy to be
distracted by nuisance features. The SV could be formulated as a binary
discrimination task where neural network-based discriminative learning could be
applied. In discriminative learning, the nuisance features could be removed
with the help of label supervision. However, discriminative learning pays more
attention to classification boundaries and is prone to overfitting to a
training set which may result in bad generalization on a test set. Thus, we
propose a hybrid learning framework, i.e., coupling a joint Bayesian (JB)
generative model structure and parameters with a neural discriminative learning
framework for SV. A two-branch Siamese neural network is built with dense
layers that are coupled with factorized affine transforms as used in the JB
model. The LLR score estimation in the JB model is formulated according to the
distance metric in the discriminative learning framework. By initializing the
two-branch neural network with the generatively learned model parameters of the
JB model, we train the model parameters with the pairwise samples as a binary
discrimination task. Moreover, a direct evaluation metric in SV based on
minimum empirical Bayes risk is designed and integrated as an objective
function in discriminative learning. We carried out SV experiments on Speakers
in the wild and Voxceleb. Experimental results showed that our proposed model
improved the performance with a large margin compared with state-of-art models
for SV.

(2013), to generate initial-boundary value problems for ruin probabilities of

Applying the approximation theory of solutions of linear ordinary differential
equations developed in Fedoryuk (1993), we derive the asymptotics of the ruin
probabilities when the initial reserve tends to infinity. When considering
premiums that are {\it linearly} dependent on reserves, representing for
instance returns on risk-free investments of the insurance capital, we firstly
derive explicit formulas for the ruin probabilities, from which we can easily
determine their asymptotics, only to match the ones obtained for general

equivalent ruin probabilities when the premium rate is fixed over time, to
measure the gain generated by this additional mechanism of binding the premium
rates with the amount of reserve own by the insurance company.

choosing a candidate material is through its evaluation using transport
descriptors. Using a data-driven screening, we selected 12 potential candidates
in the trigonal ABX2 family, followed by charge transport property simulations
from first principles. The results suggest that carrier scattering processes in
these materials are dominated by ionised impurities and polar optical phonons,
contrary to the oft-assumed acoustic-phonon-dominated scattering. Combined with
calculations of thermal conductivity based on three-phonon scattering, we
predict p-type AgBiS2 and TlBiTe2 as potential high-performance thermoelectrics
in the intermediate temperature range for low grade waste heat harvesting, with
a predicted zT above 1 at 500 K. Using these data, we further derive
ground-state transport descriptors for the carrier mobility and the
thermoelectric power factor. In addition to low carrier mass, high dielectric
constant was found to be an important factor towards high carrier mobility. A
quadratic correlation between dielectric constant and transport performance was
established and further validated with literature. Looking ahead, dielectric

improving the thermoelectric performance.

  lumping",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivation: Stochastic reaction networks are a widespread model to describe
biological systems where the presence of noise is relevant, such as in cell
regulatory processes. Unfortu-nately, in all but simplest models the resulting
discrete state-space representation hinders analytical tractability and makes
numerical simulations expensive. Reduction methods can lower complexity by
computing model projections that preserve dynamics of interest to the user.
Results: We present an exact lumping method for stochastic reaction networks
with mass-action kinetics. It hinges on an equivalence relation between the
species, resulting in a reduced network where the dynamics of each
macro-species is stochastically equivalent to the sum of the original species
in each equivalence class, for any choice of the initial state of the system.
Furthermore, by an appropriate encoding of kinetic parameters as additional
species, the method can establish equivalences that do not depend on specific
values of the parameters. The method is supported by an efficient algorithm to
compute the largest species equivalence, thus the maximal lumping. The
effectiveness and scalability of our lumping technique, as well as the physical
interpretability of resulting reductions, is demonstrated in several models of
signaling pathways and epidemic processes on complex networks. Availability:
The algorithms for species equivalence have been implemented in the software
tool ERODE, freely available for download from https://www.erode.eu.

multiple access (NOMA) technique, has received research attention in recent
years. The codebook design problem for SCMA has also been studied to some
extent since codebook choices are highly related to the system's error rate
performance. In this paper, we approach the SCMA codebook design problem by
formulating an optimization problem to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance
(MED) of superimposed codewords under power constraints. While SCMA codebooks
with a larger MED are expected to obtain a better BER performance, no optimal
SCMA codebook in terms of MED maximization, to the authors' best knowledge, has
been reported in the SCMA literature yet. In this paper, a new iterative
algorithm based on alternating maximization with exact penalty is proposed for
the MED maximization problem. The proposed algorithm, when supplied with
appropriate initial points and parameters, achieves a set of codebooks of all
users whose MED is larger than any previously reported results. A Lagrange dual
problem is derived which provides an upper bound of MED of any set of
codebooks. Even though there is still a nonzero gap between the achieved MED
and the upper bound given by the dual problem, simulation results demonstrate
clear advantages in error rate performances of the proposed set of codebooks
over all existing ones not only in AWGN channels but also in some downlink
scenarios that fit in 5G/NR applications, making it a good codebook candidate
thereof. The proposed set of SCMA codebooks, however, are not shown to
outperform existing ones in uplink channels or in the case where
non-consecutive OFDMA subcarriers are used. The correctness and accuracy of
error curves in the simulation results are further confirmed by the

  Properties of 2d Array of Magnetic Nanoparticles","22 Pages, 6 Figures","Pramana - Journal of Physics, 95, 181 (2021)","10.1007/s12043-021-02222-w","95","cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study the ground state and magnetic hysteresis properties of 2$d$ arrays
($L^{}_x\times L^{}_y$) of dipolar interacting magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) by
performing micromagnetic simulations. Our primary interest is to understand the
effect of sample shape, $\Theta$- the ratio of the dipolar strength to the
anisotropy strength, and the direction of the applied field $\vec{H} =
H_{o}\hat{e}^{}_H$ on the ground state and the magnetic hysteresis in an array
of MNPs. To study the effect of shape of the sample, we have varied the aspect
ratio $A^{}_r=L^{}_y/L^{}_x$ which in turn, is found to induce shape anisotropy
in the system. Our main observations are: (a) When the dipolar interaction is
strong $(\Theta>1)$, the ground state morphology has in-plane ordering of
magnetic moments. (b) The ground state morphology has randomly oriented
magnetic moments which is robust with respect to system sizes and $A^{}_r$ for
weakly interacting MNPs ($\Theta<1$). (c) Micromagnetic simulations suggests
that the dipolar interaction decreases the coercive field $H^{}_c$. (d) The
remanence magnetization $M^{}_r$ is found to be strongly dependent not only on
the strength of dipolar interaction but also on the shape of the sample. (e)
Due to anisotropic nature of dipolar interaction, a strong effect of shape
anisotropy is observed when the field is applied along longer axis of the
sample. The dipolar interaction in such a case induces an effective
ferromagnetic coupling when the aspect ratio is very large. These results are
of vital importance in high-density recording systems, magneto-impedance
sensors, etc.

forming like a gigantic and complex network/web of value chains that explains
the transitional structures of global trade and development of the global
economy. It's truly a new wave of globalisation, and we term it as the global
value chains (GVCs), creating the nexus among firms, workers and consumers
around the globe. The emergence of this new scenario asks: how an economy's
firms, producers and workers connect in the global economy. And how are they
capturing the gains out of it in terms of different dimensions of economic
development? This GVC approach is very crucial for understanding the
organisation of the global industries and firms. It requires the statics and
dynamics of diverse players involved in this complex global production network.
Its broad notion deals with different global issues (including regional value
chains also) from the top down to the bottom up, founding a scope for policy
analysis (Gereffi & Fernandez-Stark 2011). But it is true that, as Feenstra
(1998) points out, any single computational framework is not sufficient to
quantification this whole range of economic activities. We should adopt an
integrative framework for accurate projection of this dynamic multidimensional
phenomenon.

extension experiments at 1200C, 300MPa confining pressure, and constant
displacement rate on three natural peridotites: a fine-grained mylonitic
harzburgite with a weak CPO and two coarse-grained well-equilibrated dunites
with CPO of variable intensity. Initial flow stresses show a limited range of
variation (115-165MPa), with the fine-grained sample showing the highest
initial strength. However, the evolution of both mechanical behavior and
microstructure differs between fine and coarse-grained peridotites. In the
fine-grained harzburgite, necking resulted in decrease in the apparent
differential stress. Focusing of strain and stress produced increase of the
olivine recrystallized fraction and decrease of the recrystallized grain size
in the neck. Analysis of the final stress and strain in the neck indicates
softening due to evolution of the microstructure and CPO. In contrast, necking
of the coarse-grained samples produced weak or no decrease in the apparent
differential stress. This implies hardening, consistently with the increase in
bulk intragranular misorientation and final stresses in the neck similar or
higher than initial ones. Coarse-grained dunites deformed heterogeneously.
Crystals well oriented to deform by dislocation glide became elongated, whereas
those in hard orientations remained almost undeformed. In the neck, stress and
strain concentration resulted in formation of kinks in hard crystals and
dynamic recrystallization in soft crystals. We interpret the more effective
strain-induced softening of the fine-grained peridotite as due to easier
dynamic recrystallization, probably due to the higher proportion of grain
boundaries acting as nucleation sites.

the NiCu cycle in the astrophysical rp-process is currently limited by
uncertainties in the statistical properties of the proton-rich nucleus
$^{60}$Zn. We have determined the nuclear level density of $^{60}$Zn using
neutron evaporation spectra from $^{58}$Ni($^3$He, n) measured at the Edwards

expected for excitation energies populated in the
$^{59}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{60}$Zn reaction under rp-process conditions. This
includes a level density plateau from roughly 5-6 MeV excitation energy, which
is counter to the usual expectation of exponential growth and all theoretical

undetected (both asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected (U), isolated (I),
hospitalized (H), threatened (T), extinct (E), and recovered (R). A suitable

and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is proposed with the aim of
reproducing the past history of the epidemic in Italy, surfaced in late
February and still ongoing to date, and of validating SUIHTER in terms of its
predicting capabilities. A distinctive feature of the new model is that it
allows a one-to-one calibration strategy between the model compartments and the
data that are daily made available from the Italian Civil Protection. The new
model is then applied to the analysis of the Italian epidemic with emphasis on
the second outbreak emerged in Fall 2020. In particular, we show that the

constituted of finite-size droplets, whose concentration Phi_0 is
systematically varied from small (Newtonian emulsions) to large values
(non-Newtonian emulsions). We focus on the characterisation of the heat
transfer properties close to the transition from conductive to convective
states, where it is known that a homogeneous Newtonian system exhibits a steady
flow and a time-independent heat flux. In marked contrast, emulsions exhibit a
non-steady dynamics with fluctuations in the heat flux. In this paper, we aim
at the characterisation of such non-steady dynamics via detailed studies on the
time-averaged heat flux and its fluctuations. To understand the time-averaged
heat flux, we propose a side-by-side comparison between the emulsion system and
a single-phase (SP) system, whose viscosity is constructed from the shear
rheology of the emulsion. We show that such local closure works well only when
a suitable degree of coarse-graining (at the droplet scale) is introduced in
the local viscosity. To delve deeper into the fluctuations in the heat flux, we
propose a side-by-side comparison between a Newtonian emulsion and a
non-Newtonian emulsion, at fixed time-averaged heat flux. This comparison
elucidates that finite-size droplets and the non-Newtonian rheology cooperate
to trigger enhanced heat-flux fluctuations at the droplet scales. These
enhanced fluctuations are rooted in the emergence of space correlations among
distant droplets, which we highlight via direct measurements of the droplets
displacement and the characterisation of the associated correlation function.
The observed findings offer insights on heat transfer properties for confined
systems possessing finite-size constituents.

  Trains",,,"10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00292",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimization algorithms play a central role in chemistry since optimization
is the computational keystone of most molecular and electronic structure
calculations. Herein, we introduce the iterative power algorithm (IPA) for
global optimization and a formal proof of convergence for both discrete and
continuous global search problems, which is essential for applications in
chemistry such as molecular geometry optimization. IPA implements the power
iteration method in quantics tensor train (QTT) representations. Analogous to
the imaginary time propagation method with infinite mass, IPA starts with an
initial probability distribution and iteratively applies the recurrence
relation $\rho_{k+1}({\bf x})=U({\bf x})\rho_k({\bf x})/\|U\rho_k\|_{L^1}$,
where $U({\bf x})=e^{-V({\bf x})}$ is defined in terms of the potential energy
surface (PES) $V({\bf x})$. Upon convergence, the probability distribution
becomes a delta function, so the global minimum can be obtained as the position
expectation value. QTT representations are generated by fast adaptive
interpolation of multidimensional arrays to bypass the curse of dimensionality
and the need to evaluate $V({\bf x})$ for all possible ${\bf x}$. We illustrate
the capabilities of IPA for global search optimization of two multidimensional
PESs, including a differentiable model PES of a DNA chain and a discrete
non-differentiable PES, $V(p)=\text{mod}(N,p)$, that resolves the prime factors
of an integer $N$, with $p$ in the space of prime numbers folded as a
$d$-dimensional $2_1 \times 2_2 \times \cdots \times 2_d$ tensor. We find that
IPA resolves multiple degenerate global minima even when separated by large
energy barriers in the highly rugged landscape of the potentials. Therefore,
IPA should be of great interest for a wide range of other optimization problems
ubiquitous in molecular and electronic structure calculations.

wireless systems, by simultaneously transmitting and receiving on the same

self-interference signal at the receiver, which requires the use of
cancellation techniques. A wide range of techniques for analog and digital
self-interference cancellation have already been presented in the literature.
However, their evaluation focuses on cases where the underlying physical
parameters of the full-duplex system do not vary significantly. In this paper,
we focus on adaptive digital cancellation, motivated by the fact that physical
systems change over time. We examine some of the different cancellation methods
in terms of their performance and implementation complexity, considering the
cost of both cancellation and training. We then present a comparative analysis
of all these methods to determine which perform better under different system
performance requirements. We demonstrate that with a neural network approach,
the reduction in arithmetic complexity for the same cancellation performance
relative to a state-of-the-art polynomial model is several orders of magnitude.

technology to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. As the vehicles are
operated in street traffic, the heat source is subject to strong fluctuations.
Consequently, such disturbances have to be considered to enable safe and
efficient operation. Herein, we find optimal operating policies for several
representative scenarios by means of dynamic optimization and discuss the
implications on control strategy design. First, we optimize operation of a
typical driving cycle with data from a test rig. Results indicate that
operating the cycle at minimal superheat is an appropriate operating policy.
Second, we consider a scenario where the permissible expander power is
temporarily limited, which is realistic in street traffic. In this case, an
operating policy with flexible superheat can reduce the losses associated with
operation at minimal superheat by up to 53 % in the considered scenario. As the
duration of power limitation increases, other constraints might become active
which results in part of the exhaust gas being bypassed, hence reduced savings.

robustness, make GAGG:Ce an interesting candidate as a component of new
space-based gamma-ray detectors. As a consequence of its novelty, literature on
GAGG:Ce is still lacking on points crucial to its applicability in space
missions. In particular, GAGG:Ce is characterized by unusually high and
long-lasting delayed luminescence. This afterglow emission can be stimulated by
the interactions between the scintillator and the particles of the near-Earth
radiation environment. By contributing to the noise, it will impact the
detector performance to some degree. In this manuscript we summarize the
results of an irradiation campaign of GAGG:Ce crystals with protons, conducted
in the framework of the HERMES-TP/SP (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of

was irradiated with 70 MeV protons, at doses equivalent to those expected in
equatorial and sun-synchronous Low-Earth orbits over orbital periods spanning 6
months to 10 years, time lapses representative of satellite lifetimes. We
introduce a new model of GAGG:Ce afterglow emission able to fully capture our
observations. Results are applied to the HERMES-TP/SP scenario, aiming at an
upper-bound estimate of the detector performance degradation due to the
afterglow emission expected from the interaction between the scintillator and

magnitudes of conserved angular momenta are not equal to each other. The
dependence of effective potential on conserved angular momenta is analyzed.
This study shows that the minimum of effective potential goes to a constant
derived from conserved angular momenta when one of the conserved angular
momenta is greater than the other one, and it goes to infinity when the other
one is greater. It also shows that the usage of strong or weak top separation
does not work adequately in all cases.

undesirable in applications requiring accurate environment information. To
recover such an image, a dehazing algorithm should localize and recover
affected regions while ensuring consistency between recovered and its
neighboring regions. However owing to fixed receptive field of convolutional
kernels and non uniform haze distribution, assuring consistency between regions
is difficult. In this paper, we utilize an encoder-decoder based network
architecture to perform the task of dehazing and integrate an spatially aware
channel attention mechanism to enhance features of interest beyond the
receptive field of traditional conventional kernels. To ensure performance
consistency across diverse range of haze densities, we utilize greedy localized
data augmentation mechanism. Synthetic datasets are typically used to ensure a
large amount of paired training samples, however the methodology to generate
such samples introduces a gap between them and real images while accounting for
only uniform haze distribution and overlooking more realistic scenario of
non-uniform haze distribution resulting in inferior dehazing performance when
evaluated on real datasets. Despite this, the abundance of paired samples
within synthetic datasets cannot be ignored. Thus to ensure performance
consistency across diverse datasets, we train the proposed network within an
adversarial prior-guided framework that relies on a generated image along with
its low and high frequency components to determine if properties of dehazed
images matches those of ground truth. We preform extensive experiments to
validate the dehazing and domain invariance performance of proposed framework
across diverse domains and report state-of-the-art (SoTA) results.

proton (ep) scattering, covering Q^2 < 1.0GeV^2, was fitted via a combined
modified eq-scatterings where q is a point particle. The modifications
represent the cloud-covering effects to q. An energy-decaying ratio (edr) was
derived by inspecting the generated dcs ep from the form factor data gathered
at Mainz Microtron (A1-Collaboration) and Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator
Facility (Jefferson Laboratory) when compared to the dcs eq with modified
relativistic recoil factor. The diminishing cloud layer, edr, has a decay rate
of -2.8 for the data sets under investigation. The formulated SBM and SEM
fitting models use the bare and effective u and d-quark masses, respectively,
while SCBM and SCEM integrate other considerations. Three comparison methods
were used and all of them favor the models with other additional
considerations. SCEM was the most favored model in general.

controlling its spread. X-ray machines are widely available worldwide and can
quickly provide images that can be used for diagnosis. A number of recent
studies claim it may be possible to build highly accurate models, using deep
learning, to detect Covid-19 from chest X-ray images. This paper explores the
robustness and generalization ability of convolutional neural network models in
diagnosing Covid-19 disease from frontal-view (AP/PA), raw chest X-ray images
that were lung field cropped. Some concerning observations are made about high
performing models that have learned to rely on confounding features related to
the data source, rather than the patient's lung pathology, when differentiating
between Covid-19 positive and negative labels. Specifically, these models
likely made diagnoses based on confounding factors such as patient age or image
processing artifacts, rather than medically relevant information.

electron and the fine structure constant \cite{Nottale1994}, which writes to
lowest order $\alpha \ln (m_{\mathbb{P}}/m_e) = 3/8$ (where $m_{\mathbb{P}}$ is
the Planck mass). We suggest the existence of a similar relation valid for
neutrinos, $\alpha \ln ({m_{\mathbb{P}}}/{m_\nu} ) =1/2$. From this relation,
we theoretically predict a lightest neutrino mass $m_{\nu} = m_{\mathbb{P}}\exp
(-\alpha^{-1}/2 )=0.0214$ eV. The masses of the two heavier neutrinos, $0.0231$
eV and $0.0552$ eV, can then be obtained from experimental results of neutrino
oscillations.
