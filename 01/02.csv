investigated in detail through a combination of vibrating sample magnetometry
and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) techniques. Two samples with average
particle sizes of 5 nm and 20 nm, respectively, were studied. For both samples,
the magnetometry and $\mu$SR results exhibit clear signatures of the
superparmagnetic state at high temperature and the magnetically blocked state
at low temperature. The $\mu$SR data demonstrate that the transition from the
superparamagnetic to the blocked state occurs gradually throughout the sample
volume over a broad temperature range due to the finite particle size
distribution of each sample. The transition occurs between approximately 3 K
and 45 K for the 5 nm sample and 150 K and 300 K for the 20 nm sample. The
magnetometry and $\mu$SR data are further analyzed to yield estimates of
microscopic magnetic parameters including the nanoparticle spin-flip activation
energy $E_A$, magnetic anisotropy $K$, and intrinsic nanoparticle spin reversal
attempt time $\tau_0$. These results highlight the complementary information
about magnetic nanoparticles that can be obtained by bulk magnetic probes such
as magnetometry and local magnetic probes such as $\mu$SR.

movement in lower dimensions. Despite the collective effort towards deriving an
advanced extension of a 3D human performance model based on Fitts' law, a
standardized metric is still missing. Moreover, most of the extensions to date

However the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) distribution is non-normalizable,
given that the usual partition function is divergent. For this regime, we have
previously shown that a regularization of BG statistics allows the prediction
of the values of dynamical and thermodynamical observables in the
non-normalizable quasi-equilibrium state. In this work, based on the
eigenfunction expansion of the time-dependent solution of the associated
Fokker-Planck equation with free boundary conditions, we obtain an approximate
time-independent solution of the BG form, valid for times which are long, but
still short compared to the exponentially large escape time. The escaped
particles follow a general free-particle statistics, where the solution is a an
error function, shifted due to the initial struggle to overcome the potential

show the validity of the regularized BG statistics and how it perfectly

of degeneracies in its predictions for CMB observables. These degeneracies
usually arise either because multiple inflationary models predict similar
values for the scalar spectral index $n_{_S}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio
$r$, or because within the same model, the values of $\lbrace n_{_S}, r
\rbrace$ are insensitive to some of the model parameters, making it difficult
for CMB observations alone to constitute a unique probe of inflationary
cosmology. We demonstrate that by taking into account constraints on the
post-inflationary reheating parameters such as the duration of reheating
$N_{_{\rm re}}$, its temperature $T_{_{\rm re}}$ and especially its equation of
state (EOS), $w_{_{\rm re}}$, it is possible to break this degeneracy in
certain classes of inflationary models where identical values of $\lbrace
n_{_S}, r \rbrace$ can correspond to different reheating $w_{_{\rm re}}$. In
particular, we show how reheating constraints can break inflationary
degeneracies in the T-model and the E-model $\alpha$-attractors. Non-canonical
inflation is also studied. The relic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum provides
us with another tool to break inflationary degeneracies. This is because the GW
spectrum is sensitive to the post-inflationary EOS of the universe. Indeed a
stiff EOS during reheating $(w_{_{\rm re}} > 1/3)$ gives rise to a small scale
blue tilt in the spectral index $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{d\log{\Omega_{_{\rm
GW}}}}{d\log{k}} > 0$, while a soft EOS $(w_{_{\rm re}} < 1/3)$ results in a
red tilt. Relic GWs therefore provide us with valuable information about the
post-inflationary epoch, and their spectrum can be used to cure inflationary
degeneracies in $\lbrace n_{_S}, r\rbrace$.

are observable in the far infrared (FIR). Recently it was proposed that the
coherence of oriented HI structures in velocity traces the line of sight
magnetic field tangling. Aims. We study the velocity-dependent coherence
between FIR emission at 857 GHz and HI on angular scales of 18 arcmin. Methods.
We use HI4PI HI data and Planck FIR data and apply the Hessian operator to
extract filaments. For coherence, we require that local orientation angles
{\theta} in the FIR at 857 GHz along the filaments be correlated with the HI.
Results. We find some correlation for HI column densities at |v_LSR | < 50 km/,
but a tight agreement between FIR and HI orientation angles {\theta} exists
only in narrow velocity intervals of 1 km/s. Accordingly, we assign velocities
to FIR filaments. Along the line of sight these HI structures show a high
degree of the local alignment with {\theta}, as well as in velocity space.
Interpreting these aligned structures in analogy to the polarization of dust
emission defines an HI polarization. We observe polarization fractions of up to
80%, with averages of 30%. Orientation angles {\theta} along the filaments,
projected perpendicular to the line of sight, are fluctuating systematically
and allow a characteristic distribution of filament curvatures to be
determined. Conclusions. Local HI and FIR filaments identified by the Hessian
analysis are coherent structures with well-defined radial velocities. HI
structures are also organized along the line of sight with a high degree of
coherence. The observed bending of these structures in the plane of the sky is
consistent with models for magnetic field curvatures induced by a Galactic
small-scale turbulent dynamo.

Subsequent system is subjected to a two-dimensional confining (harmonic)

in communications. Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) has attracted
considerable attention because of its outstanding key rates over long
distances. Recently, several demonstrations of TF-QKD have been realized.
Nevertheless, those experiments are implemented in the laboratory, remaining a
critical question about whether the TF-QKD is feasible in real-world
circumstances. Here, by adopting the sending-or-not-sending twin-field QKD
(SNS-TF-QKD) with the method of actively odd parity pairing (AOPP), we
demonstrate a field-test QKD over 428~km deployed commercial fiber and two
users are physically separated by about 300~km in a straight line. To this end,
we explicitly measure the relevant properties of the deployed fiber and develop
a carefully designed system with high stability. The secure key rate we
achieved breaks the absolute key rate limit of repeater-less QKD. The result
provides a new distance record for the field test of both TF-QKD and all types
of fiber-based QKD systems. Our work bridges the gap of QKD between laboratory
demonstrations and practical applications, and paves the way for intercity QKD
network with high-speed and measurement-device-independent security.

of augmented truncation approximations. The convergence to the solution is
investigated in terms of the assumption about the monotonicity of the first

Moreover, truncation approximations to the variance constant in central limit

lightweight (1.65 kg unilateral mass) and compliant pediatric knee exoskeleton

crouch gait using high torque density motor. Experimental results demonstrated
that the robot exhibited low mechanical impedance (1.79 Nm average backdrive

control. Root mean square (RMS) error of torque tracking result is less than

learns offset behaviors that are used to compensate for the inconsistency
between the actual and expected behaviors without requiring the explicit

importance of the multi-modal features to improve terrain representations for
better adaptation. In addition, we develop an algorithmic solver for our

the global optimal solution. To evaluate the method, we perform extensive

It can also be produced by using high-energy protons (150 to 800 MeV) for

to both processes. It can also be produced by the photonuclear reaction,
Ra-226({\gamma},n)Ra-225. The Ra-225 decays via beta decay to Ac-225 with a

petitions and supporters on Twitter, revealing implicit social dynamics
therein. We find that Twitter users do not exclusively share petitions on one
issue nor do they share exclusively popular petitions. Among the over 240,000
Twitter users, we find latent support groups, with the most central users
primarily being politically active ""average"" individuals. Twitter as a platform

Proximity, a natural structural condition that requires the environments to
have highly similar transition and reward functions and share a policy
providing optimal value. Despite such shared structure, we prove that tractable
generalization is impossible in the worst case. This holds even when each

and evolve, which are of interest to understand and cure heart rhythm
disorders. The analysis of these patterns is commonly performed by calculating
the local activation phase and searching for phase singularities (PSs), i.e.
points around which all phases are present. Here we propose an alternative
framework, which focuses on phase defect lines (PDLs) and surfaces (PDSs) as
more general mechanisms, which include PSs as a specific case. The proposed
framework enables two conceptual unifications: between the local activation
time and phase description, and between conduction block lines and the central
regions of linear-core rotors. A simple PDL detection method is proposed and
applied to data from simulations and optical mapping experiments. Our analysis
of ventricular tachycardia in rabbit hearts $(n=6)$ shows that nearly all
detected PSs were found on PDLs, but the PDLs had a significantly longer
lifespan than the detected PSs. Since the proposed framework revisits basic
building blocks of cardiac activation patterns, it can become a useful tool for
further theory development and experimental analysis.

unreliable, and easily leading to deviated solutions with propagated errors. In
this paper, we resort to the energy-based model and constrain the training of
the unlabeled target sample with the energy function minimization objective. It
can be applied as a simple additional regularization. In this framework, it is
possible to gain the benefits of the energy-based model, while retaining strong
discriminative performance following a plug-and-play fashion. We deliver
extensive experiments on the most popular and large scale UDA benchmarks of
image classification as well as semantic segmentation to demonstrate its
generality and effectiveness.

electron-nucleus hyperfine interactions offer sensitivity to explore basic
properties of the atomic nucleus and study fundamental symmetries, including
the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Such
measurements impose higher precision requirements on a theoretical description.
  Purpose: The nuclear charge density is composed of the proton point
distribution folded with the nucleonic charge distributions. The latter induce
subtle relativistic corrections due to the coupling of nucleon magnetic moments
with the nuclear spin-orbit density. We assess the precision of nuclear charge
density calculations by studying the behavior of relativistic corrections.
  Methods: The calculations are performed using Skyrme energy density
functionals and density-dependent pairing force. We used the general expression
for the spin-orbit form factor that is valid for spherical and deformed nuclei.
  Results: We studied the impact of various correction terms on the charge
radii, fourth radial moments, diffraction radii, and surface thickness of
spherical and deformed nuclei. The spin-orbit corrections to charge radial
moments and surface thickness show strong shell fluctuations which impact
high-precision predictions of isotopic shifts.
  Conclusions: To establish reliable constraints on the existence of new forces
from isotope shift measurements,precise calculations of nuclear charge
densities of deformed nuclei are needed. The proper inclusion of the spin-orbit
charge density and other correction terms is essential when aiming at
extraction of subtle effects which become particularly visible in isotopic
trends.

most practical settings, observations are missing not at random (MNAR): the
probability that a given entry is observed (also called the propensity) may

estimates the propensities using a convex relaxation and then predicts missing

the inverse propensities. We provide finite-sample error bounds on the

crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both
developed and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ,
FTSE, DAX, NIKKEI, CSI 300, HSI, BSESN, and BOVESPA. In order to effectively
distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash, we proposed using the
LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the
apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by
the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the
price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300,
BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed
endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes
for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic
instability of the stock markets, while the well-known external shocks such as
the COVID-19 pandemic etc. only acted as sparks during the 2020 global stock
market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not
been observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE,
NIKKEI, and HSI, signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are
exogenous, stemming from external shocks. The novel classification method of
crash types proposed in this study can also be used to analyze regime changes
of any price trajectories in global financial markets.

Fixing these vulnerabilities retrospectively can be expensive, challenging, or

vulnerabilities would be to identify attack attempts at runtime on the device
side, and thwart them with mitigating and corrective actions. Towards this
goal, in the paper we propose a general and extendable approach called Phoenix
for identifying n-day cellular network control-plane vulnerabilities as well as
dangerous practices of network operators from the device vantage point. Phoenix
monitors the device-side cellular network traffic for performing
signature-based unexpected behavior detection through lightweight runtime
verification techniques. Signatures in Phoenix can be manually-crafted by a
cellular network security expert or can be automatically synthesized using an
optional component of Phoenix, which reduces the signature synthesis problem to
the language learning from the informant problem. Based on the corrective
actions that are available to Phoenix when an undesired behavior is detected,
different instantiations of Phoenix are possible: a full-fledged defense when
deployed inside a baseband processor; a user warning system when deployed as a
mobile application; a probe for identifying attacks in the wild. One such
instantiation of Phoenix was able to identify all 15 representative n-day
vulnerabilities and unsafe practices of 4G LTE networks considered in our
evaluation with a high packet processing speed (~68000 packets/second) while

velocity profiles and pressure coefficient for three different locations over
the aircraft: the upstream region of the fuselage, the wing-body juncture, and
the wing-body juncture close to the trailing-edge. The last two locations are
characterized by strong mean-flow three-dimensionality and separation. The
message conveyed by our error analysis is that WMLES performs as expected in
regions where the flow resembles a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate boundary
layer. However, there is a clear decline of the current models in the presence
of wing-body junctions and, more acutely, in separated zones. The slow
convergence to the solution in these regions renders the brute-force
grid-refinement approach to improve the accuracy of the solution unfeasible.
The results reported above pertain to the mean velocity profile predicted using
the typical grid resolution for external aerodynamics applications, i.e., 5--20
points per boundary-layer thickness. The prediction of the pressure coefficient
is below 5\% error for all grid sizes considered, even when boundary layers
were marginally resolved. The latter accuracy can be attributed to the
outer-layer nature of the mean pressure, which becomes less sensitive to flow
details within the turbulent boundary layer. Finally, we show that
boundary-layer-conforming grids (i.e., grids maintaining a constant number of
points per boundary-layer thickness) allow for a more efficient distribution of
grid points and smaller errors. Our results suggest that novel modeling venues
encompassing physical insights, together with numerical and gridding
advancements, must be exploited to attain predictions within the tolerance

architecture search or tree-search methods. While significant progress has been
made for both policy gradient and differentiable architecture search,
tree-search methods have so far failed to achieve comparable accuracy or search
efficiency. In this paper, we formulate NAS as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed
Bandit (CMAB) problem (CMAB-NAS). This allows the decomposition of a large
search space into smaller blocks where tree-search methods can be applied more
effectively and efficiently. We further leverage a tree-based method called
Nested Monte-Carlo Search to tackle the CMAB-NAS problem. On CIFAR-10, our
approach discovers a cell structure that achieves a low error rate that is
comparable to the state-of-the-art, using only 0.58 GPU days, which is 20 times
faster than current tree-search methods. Moreover, the discovered structure
transfers well to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.

Euler equations. The MDG+ICE method is based on the space-time DG formulation,
where both flow field and grid geometry are considered as independent variables
and the conservation laws are enforced both on discrete elements and element
interfaces. The element conservation laws are solved in the standard
discontinuous solution space to determine conservative quantities, while the
interface conservation is enforced using a variational formulation in a
continuous space to determine discrete grid geometry. The resulting
over-determined system of nonlinear equations arising from the MDG+ICE
formulation can then be solved in a least-squares sense, leading to an
unconstrained nonlinear least-squares problem that is regularized and solved by
Levenberg-Marquardt method. A number of numerical experiments for compressible
flows are conducted to assess the accuracy and robustness of the MDG+ICE
method. Numerical results obtained indicate that the MDG+ICE method is able to
implicitly detect and track all types of discontinuities via interface
conservation enforcement and satisfy the conservation law on both elements and
interfaces via grid movement and grid management, demonstrating that an
exponential rate of convergence for Sod and Lax-Harden shock tube problems can
be achieved and highly accurate solutions without overheating to both

hyperparameters in the detection network itself. Apples which are on trees and
apples which are on the ground are treated as separate classes. A mean Average

to mitigate spurious results. Anchor box design is of key interest due to the
scale of the apples. As such, a k-means clustering approach, never before seen

stations (SBSs) prefetch popular files to cope with the ever-growing user
demand in 5G and beyond. In a UDCN, even a small misprediction of user demand
may render a large amount of prefetched data obsolete. Furtherproacmore, the
interference variance is high due to the short inter-SBS distances, making it
difficult to quantify data downloading rates. Lastly, since the caching
decision of each SBS interacts with those of all other SBSs, the problem
complexity of exponentially increases with the number of SBSs, which is unfit
for UDCNs. To resolve such challenging issues while reflecting time-varying and
location-dependent user demand, we leverage mean-field game (MFG) theory
through which each SBS interacts only with a single virtual SBS whose state is
drawn from the state distribution of the entire SBS population, i.e.,
mean-field (MF) distribution. This MF approximation asymptotically guarantees
achieving the epsilon Nash equilibrium as the number of SBSs approaches
infinity. To describe such an MFG-theoretic caching framework, this chapter

First, we obtain the spatial attention weights by extracting features of

spatial attention module to refine the attention weights. We further propose a
temporal gate module to determine how much the attended features contribute to

relationships between subpopulations. Various visualization methods that
provide many useful insights into those relationships are popular, especially
in bioinformatics. This paper proposes a novel and rigorous approach to
quantifying subpopulation relationships called the Population Difference
Criterion (PDC). PDC is simultaneously a quantitative and visual approach to
showing separation of subpopulations. It uses subpopulation centers, the
respective variation about those centers and the relative subpopulation sizes.
This is accomplished by drawing motivation for the PDC from classical
permutation based hypothesis testing, while taking that type of idea into
non-standard conceptual territory. In particular, the domain of very small P
values is seen to seem to provide useful comparisons of data sets. Simulated
permutation variation is carefully investigated, and we found that a balanced
permutation approach is more informative in high signal (i.e large
subpopulation difference) contexts, than conventional approaches based on all
permutations. This result is quite surprising in view of related work done in
low signal contexts, which came to the opposite conclusion. This issue is
resolved by the proposal of an appropriate adjustment. Permutation variation is
also quantified by a proposed bootstrap confidence interval, and demonstrated
to be useful in understanding subpopulation relationships with cancer data.

Establishing geometric ergodicity of these Markov chains provides crucial
technical justification for the accuracy of asymptotic standard errors for
Markov chain based estimates of posterior quantities. In this paper, we
establish geometric ergodicity for various Gibbs samplers corresponding to the

introduced in Piironen and Vehtari (2017), and prove geometric ergodicity for a
Gibbs sampling Markov chain to sample from the corresponding posterior without
any truncation constraint on the global and local shrinkage parameters.
Finally, we consider a variant of this regularized Horseshoe prior introduced

second part of his scientific life to the physical understanding of small-scale

theory of small-scale turbulence, based on the Liouville (1853) equation and a
perturbation variational approach to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,
which is compatible with the Kolmogorov-Oboukhov energy spectrum. His
statistical theory of small-scale turbulence, which appears mathematically and
physically valid, successfully led to his contributions to (i) the closure
problem of turbulence; (ii) one-dimensional turbulence; (iii) two-dimensional
turbulence; (iv) the turbulent passive scalar field; (v) the cascade model of
turbulence; (vi) the universal equilibrium range of turbulence; (vii) a simple
model of the bump phenomenon; (viii) universal constants of turbulence; (ix)
the intermittency of turbulence; and perhaps most importantly, (x) the effect
of the Taylor microscale Reynolds number on both the width of the inertial
range of finite Re turbulence and the scaling exponents of velocity structure
functions. In particular, Qian found that the inertial range cannot exist when
Re is smaller than 2000. In contrast to the prevailing intermittency models, he
discovered that normal scaling is valid in the real Kolmogorov inertial range
when Re approaches infinity while the anomalous scaling observed in experiments
reflects the finite Re effect. He then made a correction to the famous
Kolmogorov (1941c) equation and obtained the finite Re effect equation or the
Kolmogorov-Novikov-Qian equation. He also independently derived the decay law
of the finite Re effect. Qian steered us along the right path to an improved
understanding of small-scale turbulence and solutions to its problems.

contribute to the zero-point energy. A couple of steps are considered for

algorithm coupled to density functional theory, we performed an extensive and
systematic exploration of the potential/free energy surface of
Be$_6$B$_{11}^{-}$ cluster to locate the putative global minimum and elucidate
the low-energy structures. Second, the relative populations' temperature
effects are determined by considering the thermodynamic properties and
Boltzmann factors. The temperature-dependent relative populations show that the
entropies and temperature are essential for determining the global minimum. We
compute the temperature-dependent total infrared spectra employing the
Boltzmann factor weighted sums of each isomer's infrared spectrum and find that
at finite temperature, the total infrared spectrum is composed of an admixture
of infrared spectra that corresponds to the spectrum of the lowest energy

(ii) exploiting rateless erasure codes for P2P networks to increase
block-propagation efficiency. Since our protocols only need to rework the
current Bitcoin's networking protocol and does not modify the data structures
and crypto-functional components, they can be seamlessly incorporated into the
existing Bitcoin blockchain. To validate our designs, we perform analysis on
our protocols and implement a Bitcoin network simulator on NS3 to run different
block propagation protocols. The analysis and experimental results confirm that
our new block propagation protocols could increase the TPS of the Bitcoin
blockchain by 100x without compromising security and consensus-building.

individuals vulnerable to the generation of harmful information memorized by

investigate the capability of language models to generate conspiracy theory

language models for the memorization and elicitation of conspiracy theories
without access to the model's training data? We highlight the difficulties of
this task and discuss it in the context of memorization, generalization, and
hallucination. Utilizing a new dataset consisting of conspiracy theory topics
and machine-generated conspiracy theories helps us discover that many
conspiracy theories are deeply rooted in the pretrained language models. Our
experiments demonstrate a relationship between model parameters such as size

source aiming to transmit randomly generated status updates to a designated
destination as timely as possible under the help of a relay. We adopt a
recently proposed concept, the age of information (AoI), to characterize the
timeliness of the status updates. In the considered system, delivering the
status updates via the one-hop direct link will have a shorter transmission
time at the cost of incurring a higher error probability, while the delivery of
status updates through the two-hop relay link could be more reliable at the
cost of suffering longer transmission time. Thus, it is important to design the
relaying protocol of the considered system for optimizing the information
freshness. Considering the limited capabilities of IoT devices, we propose two
low-complexity age-oriented relaying (AoR) protocols, i.e., the
source-prioritized AoR (SP-AoR) protocol and the relay-prioritized AoR (RP-AoR)
protocol, to reduce the AoI of the considered system. By carefully analyzing
the evolution of the instantaneous AoI, we derive closed-form expressions of
the average AoI for both proposed AoR protocols. We further optimize the
generation probability of the status updates at the source in both protocols.
Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the
two proposed protocols outperform each other under various system parameters.
Moreover, the protocol with better performance can achieve near-optimal
performance compared with the optimal scheduling policy attained by applying
the Markov decision process (MDP) tool.

The stochastic maximal covering location problem (SMCLP) formulation is a mixed
integer programming formulation that effectively approximates the IMP by the
Monte-Carlo sampling. For IMPs with a large-scale network or a large number of
samplings, however, the SMCLP formulation cannot be efficiently solved by
existing exact algorithms due to its large problem size. In this paper, we
concentrate on deriving presolving methods to reduce the problem size and hence
enhance the capability of employing exact algorithms in solving large-scale
IMPs. In particular, we propose two effective presolving methods, called
strongly connected nodes aggregation (SCNA) and isomorphic nodes aggregation
(INA), respectively. The SCNA enables to build a new SMCLP formulation that is
potentially much more compact than the existing one, and the INA further
eliminates variables and constraints in the SMCLP formulation. A theoretical
analysis on two special cases of the IMP is provided to demonstrate the
strength of the SCNA and INA in reducing the problem size of the SMCLP
formulation. Finally, we integrate the proposed presolving methods, SCNA and
INA, into the Benders decomposition algorithm, which is recognized as one of
the state-of-the-art exact algorithms for solving the IMP. Numerical results
demonstrate that with the SCNA and INA, the Benders decomposition algorithm is
much more effective in solving the IMP in terms of solution time.

computation of vanishing ideals. Coefficient normalization, which normalizes a

approximate border basis computation of vanishing ideals, inspired by recent
developments in machine learning. The data-dependent nature of
gradient-weighted normalization leads to better stability against perturbation
and consistency in the scaling of input points, which cannot be attained by
coefficient normalization. Only a subtle change is needed to introduce gradient
normalization in the existing algorithms with coefficient normalization. The
analysis of algorithms still works with a small modification, and the order of
magnitude of time complexity of algorithms remains unchanged. We also prove
that, with coefficient normalization, which does not provide the scaling
consistency property, scaling of points (e.g., as a preprocessing) can cause an
approximate basis computation to fail. This study is the first to theoretically
highlight the crucial effect of scaling in approximate basis computation and
presents the utility of data-dependent normalization.

a low-resource scenario. Out-of-domain translations are often of poor quality
and prone to hallucinations, due to exposure bias and the decoder acting as a
language model. We adopt two approaches to alleviate this problem: lexical
shortlisting restricted by IBM statistical alignments, and hypothesis
re-ranking based on similarity. The methods are computationally cheap, widely
known, but not extensively experimented on domain adaptation. We demonstrate
success on low-resource out-of-domain test sets, however, the methods are
ineffective when there is sufficient data or too great domain mismatch. This is
due to both the IBM model losing its advantage over the implicitly learned
neural alignment, and issues with subword segmentation of out-of-domain words.

measurement channels without imposing any kind of threshold condition. We prove
Gaussianity of the average state of the optimal ensemble in general and discuss
the Hypothesis of Gaussian Maximizers concerning the structure of the ensemble.
The proof uses an approach of Wolf, Giedke and Cirac adapted to the convex
closure of the output differential entropy. Then we discuss the case of one
mode in detail, including the dual problem of accessible information of a
Gaussian ensemble.
  In quantum communications there are several studies of the classical capacity
in the transmission scheme where not only the Gaussian channel but also the
receiver is fixed, and the optimization is performed over certain set of the
input ensembles. These studies are practically important in view of the
complexity of the optimal receiver in the Quantum Channel Coding (HSW) theorem.
Our findings are relevant to such a situation where the receiver is Gaussian
and concatenation of the channel and the receiver can be considered as one
Gaussian measurement channel. Our efforts in this and preceding papers are then
aimed at establishing full Gaussianity of the optimal ensemble (usually taken
as an assumption) in such schemes.

the leading causes of annual human mortality rate. It is suggested that retinal
and conjunctival vascular tortuosity is a potential biomarker for such systemic
diseases. Most importantly, it is observed that the tortuosity depends on the
thickness of these vessels. Therefore, selective calculation of tortuosity
within specific vessel thicknesses is required depending on the disease being
analysed. In this paper, we propose a thickness sensitive vessel extraction
framework that is primarily applicable for studies related to retinal and
conjunctival vascular tortuosity. The framework uses a Convolutional Neural
Network based on the IterNet architecture to obtain probability maps of the
entire vasculature. They are then processed by a multi-scale vessel enhancement
technique that exploits both fine and coarse structural vascular details of
these probability maps in order to extract vessels of specified thicknesses. We
evaluated the proposed framework on four datasets including DRIVE and SBVPI,
and obtained Matthew's Correlation Coefficient values greater than 0.71 for all
the datasets. In addition, the proposed framework was utilized to determine the
association of diabetes with retinal and conjunctival vascular tortuosity. We
observed that retinal vascular tortuosity (Eccentricity based Tortuosity Index)
of the diabetic group was significantly higher (p < .05) than that of the
non-diabetic group and that conjunctival vascular tortuosity (Total Curvature
normalized by Arc Length) of diabetic group was significantly lower (p < .05)
than that of the non-diabetic group. These observations were in agreement with
the literature, strengthening the suitability of the proposed framework.

combine multiple information needs, and resolve ambiguity about the best order
in which to hop between training passages. We tackle these problems via Baleen,
a system that improves the accuracy of multi-hop retrieval while learning
robustly from weak training signals in the many-hop setting. To tame the search
space, we propose condensed retrieval, a pipeline that summarizes the retrieved
passages after each hop into a single compact context. To model complex
queries, we introduce a focused late interaction retriever that allows
different parts of the same query representation to match disparate relevant
passages. Lastly, to infer the hopping dependencies among unordered training
passages, we devise latent hop ordering, a weak-supervision strategy in which
the trained retriever itself selects the sequence of hops. We evaluate Baleen
on retrieval for two-hop question answering and many-hop claim verification,

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images. While supervised deep learning
(DL)-based approaches represent the state-of-the-art in automatic nuclei
instance segmentation, annotated datasets are required to train these models.
There are two main types of tissue processing protocols, namely formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE) and frozen tissue samples (FS). Although
FFPE-derived H&E stained tissue sections are the most widely used samples, H&E
staining on frozen sections derived from FS samples is a relevant method in
intra-operative surgical sessions as it can be performed fast. Due to
differences in the protocols of these two types of samples, the derived images
and in particular the nuclei appearance may be different in the acquired whole
slide images. Analysis of FS-derived H&E stained images can be more challenging
as rapid preparation, staining, and scanning of FS sections may lead to
deterioration in image quality.
  In this paper, we introduce CryoNuSeg, the first fully annotated FS-derived
cryosectioned and H&E-stained nuclei instance segmentation dataset. The dataset
contains images from 10 human organs that were not exploited in other publicly
available datasets, and is provided with three manual mark-ups to allow
measuring intra-observer and inter-observer variability. Moreover, we
investigate the effects of tissue fixation/embedding protocol (i.e., FS or
FFPE) on the automatic nuclei instance segmentation performance of one of the
state-of-the-art DL approaches. We also create a baseline segmentation
benchmark for the dataset that can be used in future research.

often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world ""mean"" to a
robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning.
With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects
of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural
language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like
increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics
is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. The field has received
significant attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews and
surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical research
issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics like mapping or
segmentation, or its relevance to one particular application domain like
autonomous driving. A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely
because so much relevant research has occurred since many of the key surveys
were published. This survey therefore provides an overarching snapshot of where
semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics
research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of
activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad
categories we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the
computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics,
including mapping, navigation and interaction with the world. The survey also

symmetric transonic flows in a concentric cylinder. Both cylindrical and
axi-symmetric perturbations are considered. The governing system here is of
mixed elliptic-hyperbolic and changes type and the suitable formulation of
boundary conditions at the boundaries is of great importance. First, we
establish the existence and uniqueness of smooth cylindrical transonic spiral
solutions with nonzero angular velocity and vorticity which are close to the
background transonic flow with small perturbations of the Bernoulli's function
and the entropy at the outer cylinder and the flow angles at both the inner and
outer cylinders independent of the symmetric axis, and it is shown that in this
case, the sonic points of the flow are nonexceptional and noncharacteristically
degenerate, and form a cylindrical surface. Second, we also prove the existence
and uniqueness of axi-symmetric smooth transonic rotational flows which are
adjacent to the background transonic flow, whose sonic points form an
axi-symmetric surface. The key elements in our analysis are to utilize the
deformation-curl decomposition for the steady Euler system introduced in
\cite{WengXin19} to deal with the hyperbolicity in subsonic regions and to find
an appropriate multiplier for the linearized second order mixed type equations
which are crucial to identify the suitable boundary conditions and to yield the
important basic energy estimates.

angular velocity in the structure of steady inviscid compressible flows. We
give a complete classification of flow patterns in terms of boundary conditions
at the inner and outer circle. Due to the nonzero angular velocity, many new
flow patterns will appear. There exists accelerating or decelerating smooth
transonic flows in an annulus satisfying one side boundary conditions at the
inner or outer circle with all sonic points being nonexceptional and
noncharacteristically degenerate. More importantly, it is found that besides
the well-known supersonic-subsonic shock in a divergent nozzle as in the case
without angular velocity, there exists a supersonic-supersonic shock solution,
where the downstream state may change smoothly from supersonic to subsonic.
Furthermore, there exists a supersonic-sonic shock solution where the shock
circle and the sonic circle coincide, which is new and interesting.

measurements utilizing linearly polarized synchrotron radiation to probe
magnetic phase transitions in iron-rich Fe1+yTe. X-ray magnetic linear
dichroism (XMLD) signals, which sense magnetic ordering processes at surfaces,
start to increase monotonically below the N\'eel temperature TN = 57 K. This
increase is due to a progressive bicollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) alignment
of Fe spins of the monoclinic Fe1+yTe parent phase. This AFM alignment was
achieved by a [100]-oriented biasing field favoring a single-domain state
during cooling across TN. Our specific heat and magnetization measurements
confirm the bulk character of this AFM phase transition. On longer time scales,
however, we observe that the field-biased AFM state is highly unstable even at
the lowest temperature of T = 3 K. After switching off the biasing field, the
XMLD signal decays exponentially with a time constant {\tau} = 1506 s. The
initial XMLD signal is restored only upon repeating a cycle consisting of
heating and field-cooling through TN. We explain the time effect by a gradual
formation of a multi-domain state with 90 deg rotated AFM domains, promoted by
structural disorder, facilitating the motion of twin-domains. Significant
disorder in our Fe1+yTe sample is evident from our X-ray diffraction and
specific heat data. The stability of magnetic phases in Fe-chalcogenides is an
important material property, since the Fe(Te1-xSex) phase diagram shows
magnetism intimately connected with superconductivity.

determine the usability of a system from an end user perspective once a
prototype is available for assessment. Individual scores are gathered using a
10-question survey with the survey results reported in terms of central
tendency (sample mean) as an estimate of the system's usability (the SUS study
score), and confidence intervals on the sample mean are used to communicate
uncertainty levels associated with this point estimate. When the number of
individuals surveyed is large, the SUS study scores and accompanying confidence
intervals relying upon the central limit theorem for support are appropriate.
However, when only a small number of users are surveyed, reliance on the
central limit theorem falls short, resulting in confidence intervals that
suffer from parameter bound violations and interval widths that confound
mappings to adjective and other constructed scales. These shortcomings are
especially pronounced when the underlying SUS score data is skewed, as it is in
many instances. This paper introduces an empirically-based remedy for such
small-sample circumstances, proposing a set of decision rules that leverage
either an extended bias-corrected accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence
interval or an empirical Bayesian credibility interval about the sample mean to
restore and bolster subsequent confidence interval accuracy. Data from
historical SUS assessments are used to highlight shortfalls in current
practices and to demonstrate the improvements these alternate approaches offer
while remaining statistically defensible. A freely available, online
application is introduced and discussed that automates SUS analysis under these
decision rules, thereby assisting usability practitioners in adopting the
advocated approaches.

the timescales of dust condensation in core-collapse supernova ejecta, grain
growth in cold clouds and dust destruction by shock waves. Throughout this
paper, we have adopted a hierarchical Bayesian approach, resulting in a single
large probability distribution of all the parameters of all the galaxies, to
ensure the most rigorous interpretation of our data. Results. We confirm the
drastic evolution with metallicity of the dust-to-metal mass ratio (by two
orders of magnitude), found by previous studies. We show that dust production
by core-collapse supernovae is efficient only at very low-metallicity, a single
supernova producing on average less than ~0.03 Msun/SN of dust. Our data
indicate that grain growth is the dominant formation mechanism at metallicity
above ~1/5 solar, with a grain growth timescale shorter than ~50 Myr at solar
metallicity. Shock destruction is relatively efficient, a single supernova
clearing dust on average in at least ~1200 Msun/SN of gas. These results are
robust when assuming different stellar initial mass functions. In addition, we
show that early-type galaxies are outliers in several scaling relations. This
feature could result from grain thermal sputtering in hot X-ray emitting gas,
an hypothesis supported by a negative correlation between the dust-to-stellar
mass ratio and the X-ray photon rate per grain. Finally, we confirm the
well-known evolution of the aromatic-feature-emitting grain mass fraction as a
function of metallicity and interstellar radiation field intensity. Our data
indicate the relation with metallicity is significantly stronger.

present force maps and probability density functions (PDFs) for values in the
streamwise and spanwise directions, and show that stronger forces are
experienced by grains at neither the crest nor leading edge of the barchan, but
in positions just upstream the dune centroid on the periphery of the dune. We
show also that a great part of grains undergo longitudinal forces of the order
of 10$^{-7}$ N, with negative values around the crest, resulting in
decelerations and grain deposition in that region. These data show that the
force distribution tends to route a great part of grains toward the crest and
horns of subaqueous barchans, being fundamental to comprehend their
morphodynamics. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, they are not
accessible from current experiments, making of our results an important step
toward understanding the behavior of barchan dunes.

interaction is demonstrated. Two types of interlayer interactions, an
attractive and a repulsive, between the Boron and Nitrogen dopant atoms in BLG
are found. In the presence of the attractive interaction, an AA-stacking of
BN-codoped BLG is formed with a less stable structure leading to weak
mechanical properties of the system. Low values of the Young modulus, the
ultimate strength and stress, and the fracture strength are observed comparing
to a pure BLG. In addition, the attractive interaction induces a small bandgap
that deteriorates the thermal and optical properties of the system. In
contrast, in the presence of a repulsive interaction between the B and N atoms,
the AA-stacking is converted to a AB-stacking with a more stable structure.
Improved mechanical properties such as higher Young modulus, the ultimate
strength and stress, fracture strength are obtained comparing to the AA-stacked
BN-codoped BLG. Furthermore, a larger bandgap of the AB-stacked bilayer
enhances the thermal and the optical characteristics of the system.

matrix) of a metro system is crucial in real-time metro operation. However,
this problem is notoriously difficult due to the high-dimensional, sparse,
noisy, and skewed nature of OD matrices. This paper proposes a High-order
Weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HW-DMD) model for short-term metro OD
matrices forecasting. DMD uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract
low-rank approximation from OD data, and a low-rank high-order vector
autoregression model is established for forecasting. To address a practical
issue that metro OD matrices cannot be observed in real-time, we use the
boarding demand to replace the unavailable OD matrices. Particularly, we
consider the time-evolving feature of metro systems and improve the forecast by
exponentially reducing the weights for old data. Moreover, we develop a
tailored online update algorithm for HW-DMD to update the model coefficients
daily without storing historical data or retraining. Experiments on data from a
large-scale metro system show the proposed HW-DMD is robust to the noisy and
sparse data and significantly outperforms baseline models in forecasting both
OD matrices and boarding flow. The online update algorithm also shows
consistent accuracy over a long time when maintaining an HW-DMD model at low
costs.

that confidence values of standard action recognition architectures do not

wide spread calibration method utilized in image classification. While
temperature scaling alone drastically improves the reliability of the

Emerging technology like IoT has a notable ability to hold patients secure and
healthful and also enhance how physicians supply care. Healthcare IoT also can
bolster affected person pride by permitting patients to spend more time
interacting with their medical doctors due to the fact docs aren't as taken
with the mundane and rote aspects of their career. The most considerable
advantage to IoT in healthcare is that it supports doctors in undertaking extra
significant clinical work in a profession that already is experiencing a
worldwide professional hard work shortage. This paper investigates the basis

quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on.
Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy
AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI
algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have
been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks,
with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust
between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond
algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause
AI's indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of
Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI
indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the
objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives.
We further discuss how to leverage this framework to improve societal
well-being through protection, information, and prevention/mitigation.

world as we knew at the start of the 3rd decade of the 21st century.
Particularly, COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected financial econometrics
and stock markets across the globe. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
Learning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN)
architectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the
adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial
markets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement
prediction (COVID19 PRIMO) dataset is introduced in this paper, which
incorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market
price movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is
proposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures.
Referred to as the COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep fusion framework
for Stock price Movement Prediction (COVID19-HPSMP), innovative fusion
strategies are used to combine scattered social media news related to COVID-19
with historical mark data. The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel
paths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with
Local/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long
Short term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a
multilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion centre that combines localized
features. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19
PRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework.

  Communication, 1(3), 1-23","10.47909/ijsmc.32",,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Objective: An understanding of when one or more external factors may
influence the evolution of innovation tracking indices (such as US patent and
trademark applications (PTA)) is an important aspect of examining economic
progress/regress. Using exploratory statistics, the analysis uses a novel tool
to leverage the long-range dependency (LRD) intrinsic to PTA to resolve when
such factor(s) may have caused significant disruptions in the evolution of the
indices, and thus give insight into substantive economic growth dynamics.
Approach: This paper explores the use of the Chronological Hurst Exponent (CHE)
to explore the LRD using overlapping time windows to quantify long-memory
dynamics in the monthly PTA time-series spanning 1977 to 2016.
Results/Discussion: The CHE is found to increase in a clear S-curve pattern,
achieving persistence (H~1) from non-persistence (H~0.5). For patents, the
inflection occurred over a span of 10 years (1980-1990), while it was much
sharper (3 years) for trademarks (1977-1980). Conclusions/Originality/Value:
This analysis suggests (in part) that the rapid augmentation in R&D expenditure
and the introduction of the various patent directed policy acts (e.g.,
Bayh-Dole, Stevenson-Wydler) are the key impetuses behind persistency, latent
in PTA. The post-1990s exogenic factors seem to be simply maintaining the high
degree and consistency of the persistency metric. These findings suggest
investigators should consider latent persistency when using these data and the
CHE may be an important tool to investigate the impact of substantive exogenous
variables on growth dynamics.

many research fields, such as computer vision. However, less work has been done
in the context of text, partially due to its discrete nature and the complexity
of natural languages. In this paper, we propose to improve the standard maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) paradigm by incorporating a self-imitation-learning
phase for automatic data augmentation. Unlike most existing sentence-level
augmentation strategies, which are only applied to specific models, our method
is more general and could be easily adapted to any MLE-based training
procedure. In addition, our framework allows task-specific evaluation metrics
to be designed to flexibly control the generated sentences, for example, in
terms of controlling vocabulary usage and avoiding nontrivial repetitions.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on two
synthetic and several standard real datasets, significantly improving related
baselines.

structures are mainly studied depending on the glide and mirror symmetries of

cells is carried out. Glide-symmetric holey waveguides provide a higher
propagation constant and a low dispersion over a wide frequency range regarding
hollow waveguides. This property is particularly useful for the design of
low-loss and low-dispersive phase shifters. We also demonstrate that
glide-symmetric holey waveguides are less dispersive than waveguides loaded
with glide-symmetric pins. Furthermore, we perform a Bloch analysis to compute
the attenuation constants in holey waveguides with mirror and broken glide
symmetries. Both configurations are demonstrated to be suitable for filter
design. Finally, the simulation results are validated with two prototypes in
gap-waveguide technology. The first one is a 180$^{o}$ phase shifter based on a
glide-symmetric holey configuration that achieves a flat phase shift response
over a wide frequency range (27.5\% frequency bandwidth). The second one is a

communications, put forth by Shannon and Weaver in their seminal work [2], by
considering multiple agents communicating over a noisy channel in order to
achieve better coordination and cooperation in a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition
to interacting with the environment can also communicate with each other over a
noisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered
explicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment and the message each
agent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the
agents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate
""effectively"" over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the
traditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message
reliably over a noisy channel, and the ""learning to communicate"" framework that
has received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying
communication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that
the joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where
the communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP. This
is a very powerful framework, which has many real world applications, from
autonomous vehicle planning to drone swarm control, and opens up the rich
toolbox of deep reinforcement learning for the design of multi-user
communication systems.
