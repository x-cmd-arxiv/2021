Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) which are difficult to model. Learning the parameters
of a kinematic model can be achieved by observing the position of the robot
links during prospective motions and minimising the prediction errors. This
work proposes a movement efficient approach for estimating online the
body-schema of a humanoid robot arm in the form of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH)
parameters. A cost-sensitive active learning approach based on the A-Optimality
criterion is used to select optimal joint configurations. The chosen joint
configurations simultaneously minimise the error in the estimation of the body
schema and minimise the movement between samples. This reduces energy
consumption, along with mechanical fatigue and wear, while not compromising the
learning accuracy. The work was implemented in a simulation environment, using
the 7DoF arm of the iCub robot simulator. The hand pose is measured with a
single camera via markers placed in the palm and back of the robot's hand. A
non-parametric occlusion model is proposed to avoid choosing joint
configurations where the markers are not visible, thus preventing worthless
attempts. The results show cost-sensitive active learning has similar accuracy
to the standard active learning approach, while reducing in about half the
executed movement.

sequentially to minimize the cost while satisfying certain constraints. One
modeling approach to study such problems is constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP). When solving the CMDP to derive good operational policies, there are
two key challenges: one is the prohibitively large state space and action
space; the other is the hard-to-compute transition kernel. In this work, we
develop a sampling-based primal-dual algorithm to solve CMDPs. Our approach
alternatively applies regularized policy iteration to improve the policy and
subgradient ascent to maintain the constraints. Under mild regularity
conditions, we show that the algorithm converges at rate $
O(\log(T)/\sqrt{T})$, where T is the number of iterations. When the CMDP has a
weakly coupled structure, our approach can substantially reduce the dimension
of the problem through an embedded decomposition. We apply the algorithm to two
important applications with weakly coupled structures: multi-product inventory
management and multi-class queue scheduling, and show that it generates
controls that outperform state-of-art heuristics.

financial statements of life insurers where some still do not have a systematic

explore data clustering to examine and understand how actual death claims
differ from expected, an early stage of developing a monitoring system crucial
for risk management. We extend the $k$-prototypes clustering algorithm to draw
inference from a life insurance dataset using only the insured's
characteristics and policy information without regard to known mortality. This
clustering has the feature to efficiently handle categorical, numerical, and
spatial attributes. Using gap statistics, the optimal clusters obtained from
the algorithm are then used to compare actual to expected death claims
experience of the life insurance portfolio. Our empirical data contains
observations, during 2014, of approximately 1.14 million policies with a total
insured amount of over 650 billion dollars. For this portfolio, the algorithm
produced three natural clusters, with each cluster having a lower actual to
expected death claims but with differing variability. The analytical results
provide management a process to identify policyholders' attributes that
dominate significant mortality deviations, and thereby enhance decision making
for taking necessary actions.

treatment. Isoniazid encapsulation in liposomal vesicles can improve drug
therapeutic index and minimize toxic and side effects. In this work, we
consider mixtures of hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol
(HSPC/DPPG) to get novel biocompatible liposomes for isoniazid pulmonary
delivery. Our goal is to understand if the entrapped drug affects bilayer
structure.
  Experiments. HSPC-DPPG unilamellar liposomes are prepared and characterized
by dynamic light scattering, $\zeta$-potential, fluorescence anisotropy and
Transmission Electron Microscopy. Isoniazid encapsulation is determined by UV
and Laser Transmission Spectroscopy. Calorimetry, light scattering and Surface
Pressure measurements are used to get insight on adsorption and thermodynamic
properties of lipid bilayers in the presence of the drug.
  Findings. We find that INH-lipid interaction can increase the entrapment
capability of the carrier due to isoniazid adsorption. The preferential
INH-HSPC dipole-dipole interaction promotes modification of lipid packing and
ordering and favors the condensation of a HSPC-richer phase in molar excess of
DPPG. Our findings highlight the importance of fundamental investigations of
drug-lipid interactions for the optimal design of liposomal nanocarriers.

computer science disciplines. Given a set of points $S$ and a radius parameter
$r>0$, the $r$-near neighbor ($r$-NN) problem asks for a data structure that,
given any query point $q$, returns a point $p$ within distance at most $r$ from
$q$. In this paper, we study the $r$-NN problem in the light of individual
fairness and providing equal opportunities: all points that are within distance
$r$ from the query should have the same probability to be returned. In the
low-dimensional case, this problem was first studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS
2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the theoretically strongest approach
to similarity search in high dimensions, does not provide such a fairness
guarantee. In this work, we show that LSH based algorithms can be made fair,
without a significant loss in efficiency. We propose several efficient data
structures for the exact and approximate variants of the fair NN problem. Our
approach works more generally for sampling uniformly from a sub-collection of
sets of a given collection and can be used in a few other applications. We also
develop a data structure for fair similarity search under inner product that
requires nearly-linear space and exploits locality sensitive filters. The paper
concludes with an experimental evaluation that highlights the inherent
unfairness of NN data structures and shows the performance of our algorithms on
real-world datasets.

Such DApps open a marketplace in which services are delivered to end-users by
contributors which are then incentivised by cryptocurrencies in an automated,
peer-to-peer, and trustless fashion. However, blockchain, consolidated by smart
contracts, only ensures on-chain data security, autonomy and integrity of the
business logic execution defined in smart contracts. It cannot guarantee the
quality of service of DApps, which entirely depends on the services'
performance. Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the
risk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These
reasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed
on top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace
to demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust
system works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback

of those from $\Delta\alpha_s(M_Z)$, the predicted
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^5)$-order terms predicted by using the Pad\'{e}

reflecting issues in ecology and population dynamics. In mathematical
modelling, the impact of environmental elements and the interaction between
species is read into the role of heterogeneity in equations and interactions in
coupled systems. In this direction, we investigate three separate problems,
each corresponding to a chapter of this thesis. The first problem addresses the
evolution of a single population living in a periodic medium with a fast
diffusion line; this corresponds to the study of a reaction-diffusion system
with equations in different dimensions. We derive results on asymptotic
behaviour through the study of some generalised principal eigenvalues. We find
that the road has no impact on the survival chances of the population, despite
the deleterious effect expected from fragmentation. The second investigation
regards a model describing the competition between two populations in a
situation of asymmetrically aggressive interactions; this consists of a system
of two ODEs. The evolution progresses through two possible scenarios, where
only one population survives. Then, the interpretation of one of the parameters
as the aggressiveness of the attacker population naturally raises questions of
controllability. We characterise the set of initial conditions leading to the
victory of the attacker through a suitable (possibly time-dependant) strategy.
The third and last part of this thesis analyses the time decay of some
evolution equations with classical and fractional time derivatives. Depending
on the type of derivative and some degree of non-degeneracy of the spatial
operator, quantitative polynomial or exponential estimates are entailed.

persist in non-equilibrium states for long enough that wave-particle

Determining which instabilities arise, and how significant a role they play in
governing the dynamics of the solar wind, has been a decades-long process
involving in situ observations at a variety of radial distances. With new
measurements from Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we can study what wave modes are
driven near the Sun, and calculate what instabilities are predicted for
different models of the underlying particle populations. We model two
hours-long intervals of PSP/SPAN-i measurements of the proton phase-space
density during PSP's fourth perihelion with the Sun using two commonly used
descriptions for the underlying velocity distribution. The linear stability and
growth rates associated with the two models are calculated and compared. We
find that both selected intervals are susceptible to resonant instabilities,
though the growth rates and kind of modes driven unstable vary depending on if
the protons are modeled using one or two components. In some cases, the
predicted growth rates are large enough to compete with other dynamic
processes, such as the nonlinear turbulent transfer of energy, in contrast with
relatively slower instabilities at larger radial distances from the Sun.

essential component of many emerging electronic structure methods. However,
evaluating nonorthogonal matrix elements is conceptually and computationally
harder then their orthogonal counterparts. While several different approaches
have been developed, these are predominantly derived from the first-quantised
generalised Slater-Condon rules and usually require biorthogonal occupied
orbitals to be computed for each matrix element. For coupling terms between
nonorthogonal excited configurations, a second-quantised approach such as the
nonorthogonal Wick's theorem is more desirable, but this fails when the two
reference determinants have a zero many-body overlap. In this contribution, we
derive an entirely generalised extension to the nonorthogonal Wick's theorem
that is applicable to all pairs of determinants with nonorthogonal orbitals.
Our approach creates a universal methodology for evaluating any nonorthogonal
matrix element and allows Wick's theorem and the generalised Slater-Condon
rules to be unified for the first time. Furthermore, we present a simple
well-defined protocol for deriving arbitrary coupling terms between
nonorthogonal excited configurations. In the case of overlap and one-body
operators, this protocol recovers efficient formulae with reduced scaling,
promising significant computational acceleration for methods that rely on such
terms.

Previous studies have shown that natural scene statistics and deep learning

either incapable or inefficient for predicting the quality of complex and

RAPIQUE combines and leverages the advantages of both quality-aware scene
statistics features and semantics-aware deep convolutional features, allowing
us to design the first general and efficient spatial and temporal (space-time)
bandpass statistics model for video quality modeling. Our experimental results
on recent large-scale UGC video quality databases show that RAPIQUE delivers
top performances on all the datasets at a considerably lower computational
expense. We hope this work promotes and inspires further efforts towards
practical modeling of video quality problems for potential real-time and

  Our first application are \emph{quantitative central limit theorems} for

with emission from cooling gas excited by photoelectric heating in
photo-dissociation regions. However, anomalously high [CII]/CO ratios are seen
at the two ends of the counter-arms. Both ends show shell-like structures,
possibly bubbles, in H-alpha emission. In addition, the southern end has [CII]
to infrared emission ratios inconsistent with normal star formation. Because
there is little HI emission at this location, the [CII] emission probably
originates in warm shocked molecular gas heated by the interaction of the radio
jet forming the counter-arms with the interstellar medium in the galaxy. At two
other locations, the high [CII]/CO ratios provide evidence for the existence of
patches of CO-dark molecular gas. The [CII] and CO observations also reveal
resolved velocity components along the bar. In particular, the CO emission can

masses with Wilson fermions and for instance the renormalisation of nucleon
matrix elements of scalar densities. Our calculation involves simulations of
finite-volume lattice QCD with the tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action,
$N_\mathrm{f} = 3$ mass-degenerate $\mathrm{O}(a)$ improved Wilson fermions and
Schr\""odinger functional boundary conditions. The slope of the current quark
mass, as a function of the subtracted Wilson quark mass is extracted both in a
unitary setup (where nearly chiral valence and sea quark masses are degenerate)
and in a non-unitary setup (where all valence flavours are chiral and the sea
quark masses are small). These slopes are then combined with $Z \equiv Z_{\rm
P}/(Z_{\rm S}Z_{\rm A})$ in order to obtain $r_\mathrm{m}$. A novel chiral Ward
identity is employed for the calculation of the normalisation factor $Z$. Our
results cover the range of gauge couplings corresponding to lattice spacings
below $0.1\,$fm, for which $N_\mathrm{f} = 2+1$ QCD simulations in large
volumes with the same lattice action are typically performed.

theoretically estimate specific surface area from particle size distribution

(ODMTS) that combine fixed bus/rail routes between transit hubs with on-demand
shuttles that serve the first/last miles to/from the hubs. The design problem
aims at finding a network design for the fixed routes to allow a set of riders
to travel from their origins to their destinations, while minimizing the sum of
the travel costs, the bus operating costs, and rider travel times. The paper
addresses two gaps in existing tools for designing ODMTS. First, it generalizes
prior work by including ridesharing in the shuttle rides. Second, it proposes
novel fleet-sizing algorithms for determining the number of shuttles needed to
meet the performance metrics of the ODMTS design. Both contributions are based
on Mixed-Integer Programs (MIP). For the ODMTS design, the MIP reasons about
pickup and dropoff routes in order to capture ridesharing, grouping riders who
travel to/from the same hub. The fleet-sizing optimization is modeled as a
minimum flow problem with covering constraints. The natural formulation leads
to a dense graph and computational issues, which is addressed by a
reformulation that works on a sparse graph. The methodological contributions
are evaluated on a real case study: the public transit system of the broader
Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The results demonstrate the
substantial potential of ridesharing for ODMTS, as costs are reduced by about
26% with respect to allowing only individual shuttle rides, at the expense of a
minimal increase in transit times. Compared to the existing system, the
designed ODMTS also cuts down costs by 35% and reduces transit times by 38%.

debate, mainly due to the apparent inconsistencies in the
experimentally-reported ETPA cross sections of organic molecules. In this work,
we provide a thorough experimental study of ETPA in the organic molecules
Rhodamine B (RhB) and Zinc Tetraphenylporphirin (ZnTPP). The goal of this
contribution is twofold: on one hand, it seeks to reproduce the results of
previous experimental reports and, on the other, it aims to determine the
effects of different temporal correlations -- introduced as a controllable
time-delay between the photons to be absorbed -- on the strength of the ETPA
signal. In our experiment, the samples are excited by entangled pairs produced
by type-I SPDC, with a spectral distribution centered at 810 nm. Surprisingly,
and contrary to what was expected, the time delay did not produce in our
experiments any systematic change in the cross-sections when monitoring the
ETPA signal using a transmission measurement scheme. As a plausible cause of
this unexpected result, we argue that the photon-pair flux, typically-used in
these experiments, is not sufficient to promote the two-photon absorption
process in these molecules. This suggests that the actual absorption
cross-section values are lower than those previously reported, and therefore do
not lead to a measurable ETPA effect for the transmission method.

release during magma ocean epochs that occur during assembly of the planet.
These establish the initial distribution of the major volatile elements between
different chemical reservoirs that subsequently evolve via geological cycles.
Current theoretical techniques are limited in exploring the anticipated range
of compositional and thermal scenarios of early planetary evolution, even
though these are of prime importance to aid astronomical inferences on the
environmental context and geological history of extrasolar planets. Here, we
present a coupled numerical framework that links an evolutionary,
vertically-resolved model of the planetary silicate mantle with a
radiative-convective model of the atmosphere. Using this method we investigate
the early evolution of idealized Earth-sized rocky planets with end-member,
clear-sky atmospheres dominated by either H$_2$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, CO,
O$_2$, or N$_2$. We find central metrics of early planetary evolution, such as
energy gradient, sequence of mantle solidification, surface pressure, or
vertical stratification of the atmosphere, to be intimately controlled by the
dominant volatile and outgassing history of the planet. Thermal sequences fall
into three general classes with increasing cooling timescale: CO, N$_2$, and
O$_2$ with minimal effect, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CH$_4$ with intermediate
influence, and H$_2$ with several orders of magnitude increase in
solidification time and atmosphere vertical stratification. Our numerical

team in a centralized process. We derive structural results that yield an
information state for the team which does not depend on the control strategy,
and thus it can lead to a dynamic programming decomposition where the
optimization problem is over the space of the team's decisions. We, then,
derive structural results for each team member that yield an information state
which does not depend on their control strategy, and thus it can lead to a
dynamic programming decomposition where the optimization problem for each team
member is over the space of their decisions. Finally, we show that the solution
of each team member is the same as the one derived by the manager. We present
an illustrative example of a dynamic team with a delayed sharing information

computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the

motivated the development of computationally inexpensive kinetic models, which
can be parametrized from MD simulations of complex chemistry of thousands of
species or other processes and accelerate the prediction of the chemical
evolution by up to four order of magnitude. Such models go beyond the commonly
employed potential energy surface fitting methods in that they are aimed purely
at describing kinetic effects. So far, such kinetic models utilize molecular
descriptions of reactions and have been constrained to only reproduce molecules
previously observed in MD simulations. Therefore, these descriptions fail to
predict the reactivity of unobserved molecules, for example in the case of
large molecules or solids. Here we propose a new approach for the extraction of
reaction mechanisms and reaction rates from MD simulations, namely the use of
atomic-level features. Using the complex chemical network of hydrocarbon
pyrolysis as example, it is demonstrated that kinetic models built using atomic
features are able to explore chemical reaction pathways never observed in the
MD simulations used to parametrize them. Atomic-level features are shown to
construct reaction mechanisms and estimate reaction rates of unknown molecular
species from elementary atomic events. Through comparisons of the model ability
to extrapolate to longer simulation timescales and different chemical
compositions than the ones used for parameterization, it is demonstrated that
kinetic models employing atomic features retain the same level of accuracy and
transferability as the use of features based on molecular species, while being
more compact and parametrized with less data. We also find that atomic features
can better describe the formation of large molecules enabling the simultaneous
description of small molecules and condensed phases.

significantly more challenging when multiple-drug dose-combinations (DC) are
involved, due to the inherent conflict between the exponentially increasing DC
candidates and the limited patient budget. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian
design, SDF-Bayes, for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of
safety constraints. Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or
de-escalating the current dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs),
SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the
basis of current information, is most likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject
to the constraint that it only chooses DCs that have a high probability of
being safe (caution). We also propose an extension, SDF-Bayes-AR, that accounts
for patient heterogeneity and enables heterogeneous patient recruitment.
Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the advantages of SDF-Bayes over state of the art DC trial designs
in terms of accuracy and safety.

results from the first 14 months of this program, with a focus on our custom RV

young Solar analogs, and modeling the underlying population-level distribution
of stellar jitter. We demonstrate on-sky stability at the sub-2 m s$^{-1}$
level for the K2 standard HD 3765 using a least-squares matching method to
extract precise RVs. Based on a subsample of 29 stars with at least three RV
measurements from our program, we find a median RMS level of 34 m s$^{-1}$.
This is nearly a factor of 2 lower than the median RMS level in the optical of
60 m s$^{-1}$ for a comparison sample with similar ages and spectral types as
our targets. The observed near-infrared jitter measurements for this subsample
are well reproduced with a log-normal parent distribution with $\mu=4.15$ and
$\sigma=1.02$. Finally, by compiling RMS values from previous planet search
programs, we show that near-infrared jitter for G and K dwarfs generally decays

higher than expected based on the far-infrared luminosity when compared to
nearby star-forming galaxies. Together with the strength of the OH+ emission
components, this may suggest that shock excitation of warm, dense molecular gas
is more prevalent in distant massive dusty starbursts than in nearby
star-forming galaxies on average, perhaps due to an impact of galactic winds on
the gas. OH+ absorption is found to be ubiquitous in massive high-redshift
starbursts, and is detected toward 89% of the sample. The majority of the
sample shows evidence for outflows or inflows based on the velocity shifts of
the OH+ absorption/emission, with a comparable occurrence rate of both at the
resolution of our observations. A small subsample appears to show outflow
velocities in excess of their escape velocities. Thus, starburst-driven
feedback appears to be important in the evolution of massive galaxies in their
most active phases. We find a correlation between the OH+ absorption optical
depth and the dust temperature, which may suggest that warmer starbursts are
more compact and have higher cosmic ray energy densities, leading to more
efficient OH+ ion production. This is in agreement with a picture in which
these high-redshift galaxies are ""scaled-up"" versions of the most intense

comes from the fast perturbative decays of resonantly produced daughter

their backreaction on the inflaton and keeping the resonant production
effective for a longer period. Thus we dub the scenario ""spillway preheating"".

dimensions. The canonical ensemble, characterized by a cavity of fixed radius
$r$ and fixed temperature $T$ at the boundary, allows for two possible
solutions in thermal equilibrium, a small and a large black hole. From the
Euclidean action and the path integral approach, we obtain the free energy, the
thermodynamic energy, the pressure, and the entropy, of the black hole plus
cavity system. The entropy is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. The
heat capacity shows that the smaller black hole is in unstable equilibrium and
the larger is stable. The photon sphere radius divides the stability criterion.
To study perturbations, a generalized free energy function is obtained that
allows to understand the possible phase transitions between classical hot flat
space and the black holes. The Buchdahl radius, that appears naturally in the
general relativistic study of star structure, also shows up in our context, the
free energy is zero when the cavity's radius has the Buchdahl radius value.
Then, if the cavity's radius is smaller than the Buchdahl radius classical hot
flat space can nucleate a black hole. It is also pointed out the link between
the canonical analysis performed and the direct perturbation of the path
integral. Since gravitational hot flat space is a quantum system made purely of
gravitons it is of interest to compare the free energies of quantum hot flat
space and the stable black hole to find for which ranges of $r$ and $T$ one
phase predominates over the other. Phase diagrams are displayed. The density of
states at a given energy is found. Further calculations and comments are

use the local star formation histories to estimate the age for each supernova
(SN). These star formation histories often show multiple bursts of star
formation; our model assumes that one burst is associated with the SN
progenitor and the others are random bursts of star formation. The primary
inference is the progenitor age distribution. Due to the limited number of
historic SNe and highly uncertain star formation at young ages, we restrict our
inference to the slope of the age distribution and the maximum age for CCSNe.
Using single-star evolutionary models, we transform the progenitor age
distribution into a progenitor mass distribution. Under these assumptions, the
minimum mass for CCSNe is ${M_\textrm{min}}~=~8.60^{+0.37}_{-0.41} \ M_\odot$
and the slope of the progenitor mass distribution is $\alpha =
-2.61^{+1.05}_{-1.18}$. The power-law slope for the progenitor mass
distribution is consistent with the standard Salpeter initial mass function
($\alpha = -2.35$). These values are consistent with previous estimates using
precursor imaging and the age-dating technique, further confirming that using
stellar populations around SN and supernova remnants is a reliable way to infer
the progenitor masses.

likely to be detected, and their gathering into giant complexes might be
missed. This leads to the non-detection of the giant clumps and therefore
introduces a bias in the detection of these structures. We show that the
simulated giant clumps can be gravitationally bound even when undetected in
mocks representative for ALMA observations and HST observations of lensed

this extra component does not contribute to the CMB dipole amplitude while it
does contribute to the dipole in large scale structures. Thus, within this

are consistent with observations. The model leads to several predictions which
can be tested in future surveys. In particular, it implies that the observed
dipole in large scale structure should be redshift dependent and should show an
increase in amplitude with redshift. We also find that the Hubble parameter
should show a dipole anisotropy whose amplitude must increase with redshift in

delays. Among these are reverberation mapping, and lensed quasars. In some
systems, the measurement of the time-delay is complicated by the fact that the
delayed components are unresolved and that the light curves are generated from
a red-noise process. We derive the likelihood function of the observations
given a model of either a combination of time-delayed light curves or a single
light curve. This likelihood function is different from the auto-correlation
function. We demonstrate that given a single-band light curve that is a
combination of two (or more) time-shifted copies of an original light curve,
generated from a red-noise probability distribution, we can test if the
total-flux light curve is a composition of time-delayed copies or,
alternatively, is consistent with being the original light curve. Furthermorew,
in some realistic cases, it is possible to measure the time delays and flux
ratios between these unresolved components even when the flux ratio is about
1/10. This method is useful for identifying lensed quasars and simultaneously
measuring their time delays, and for estimating the reverberation time scales
of active galactic nuclei. In a companion paper, we derive a method that uses
the center-of-light position (e.g., of a lensed quasar) along with the combined
flux. This allow us to identify lensed quasars and supernovae and measure their
time delays, with higher fidelity compared to the flux-only method. The
astrometry + flux method, however, is not suitable for quasar reverberation
mapping. We also comment on the commonly used method of fitting a power-law
model to a power spectrum, and present the proper likelihood function for such
a fit. We test the new method on simulations and provide Python and MATLAB
implementations.

integrators for smooth mechanical systems, their construction for the
discontinuous ones is nontrivial, and numerical convergence order can be
impaired too. Several rather-usable numerical methods are proposed, including:
a first-order symplectic integrator for general problems, a third-order
symplectic integrator for problems with only one linear interface, arbitrarily
high-order reversible integrators for general problems (no longer symplectic),
and an adaptive time-stepping version of the previous high-order method.
Interestingly, whether symplecticity leads to favorable long time performance
is no longer clear due to discontinuity, as traditional Hamiltonian backward
error analysis does not apply any more. Therefore, at this stage, our

hierarchy problem are either excluded or severely constrained by LHC and direct
detection null results. In particular, Higgs Portal Dark Matter (HPDM) features
a scalar coupling to the Higgs via a quartic interaction, and obtaining the
measured relic density via thermal freeze-out gives definite direct detection
predictions which are now almost entirely excluded. The Twin Higgs solves the
little hierarchy problem without coloured top partners by introducing a twin
sector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a discrete symmetry. We generalize
HPDM to arbitrary Twin Higgs models and introduce Twin Higgs Portal Dark Matter
(THPDM), which features a DM candidate with an $SU(4)$-invariant quartic
coupling to the Twin Higgs scalar sector. Given the size of quadratic
corrections to the DM mass, its most motivated scale is near the mass of the
radial mode. In that case, DM annihilation proceeds with the full Twin Higgs
portal coupling, while direct detection is suppressed by the pNGB nature of the
125 GeV Higgs. For a standard cosmological history, this results in a predicted
direct detection signal for THPDM that is orders of magnitude below that of
HPDM with very little dependence on the precise details of the twin sector,
evading current bounds but predicting possible signals at next generation
experiments. In many Twin Higgs models, twin radiation contributions to $\Delta
N_\mathrm{eff}$ are suppressed by an asymmetric reheating mechanism. We study
this by extending the $\nu$MTH and $X$MTH models to include THPDM and compute
the viable parameter space according to the latest CMB bounds. The injected
entropy dilutes the DM abundance as well, resulting in additional suppression
of direct detection below the neutrino floor.

computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. Kernel-based training
is then guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than

investigate the correlations between the residuals of the MZR and the residuals
of the relations between stellar mass and, respectively, specific inflow,
outflow and star formation rate as well as the gas fraction for central
galaxies. At low redshift, all these residuals are found to be anti-correlated
with the residuals of the MZR for $M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{10}$.
The correlations between the residuals of the MZR and the residuals of the

extracted the parameters of the oscillation modes of the star using the full

overshooting strongly worsen the agreement with the observations and are thus
firmly ruled out. We also found that having access to two g-dominated mixed
modes in young subgiants allows us to place stronger constraints on the

hadronic scenarios. Furthermore, hadronic models predict that these sources
should produce more emission at GeV-scale energies than is observed. In light
of these considerations, we conclude that HAWC's highest energy sources should
be interpreted as TeV halos or pulsar wind nebulae, which produce their
emission through inverse Compton scattering, and are powered by the rotational
kinetic energy of their host pulsar.

$\gamma$-ray flux from a list of 48 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs)
using state-of-the-art estimation of the DM density in these objects. Since we
do not find any significant signal from the dSphs, we put upper limits on the

that fits the GCE. However, we find that the GCE DM signal is excluded by the
AMS-02 $\bar{p}$ flux data for all hadronic and semi-hadronic annihilation
channels unless the vertical size of the diffusion halo is smaller than 2 kpc

Furthermore, AMS-02 $e^+$ data rule out pure or mixed channels with a component
of $e^+ e^-$. The only DM candidate that fits the GCE spectrum and is

powerful outflow, but where it originates from and how much mass and energy are
carried away to which directions? To answer to these questions, we newly
perform a large-box, two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulation, paying
special attention lest the results should depend on adopted initial and
boundary conditions. We could achieve a quasi-steady state in an
unprecedentedly large range, $r=2~r_{\rm S}$-$600~r_{\rm S}$ (with $r_{\rm S}$
being the Schwarzschild radius) from the black hole. The accretion rate onto
the central $10 ~M_{\odot}$ black hole is $\dot{M}_{\rm BH} \sim 180 ~L_{\rm
Edd}/c^{2}$, whereas the mass outflow rate is ${\dot M}_{\rm outflow} \sim 24
~L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$ (where $L_{\rm Edd}$ and $c$ are the Eddington luminosity and
the speed of light, respectively). The ratio (${\dot M}_{\rm outflow}/{\dot
M}_{\rm BH} \sim 0.14$) is much less than those reported previously. By careful
inspection we find that most of outflowing gas which reach the outer boundary
originates from the region at $R\lesssim140~r_{\rm S}$, while gas at
$140~r_{\rm S}$-$230 ~r_{\rm S}$ forms failed outflow. Therefore, significant
outflow occurs inside the trapping radius $\sim 450 ~r_{\rm S}$. The mechanical
energy flux (or mass flux) reaches its maximum in the direction of $\sim
15^\circ$ ($\sim 80^\circ$) from the rotation axis. The total mechanical
luminosity is $L_{\rm mec}\sim 0.16~L_{\rm Edd}$, while the isotropic X-ray
luminosity varies from $L_{\rm X}^{\rm ISO}\sim 2.9~L_{\rm Edd}$, (for a
face-on observer) to $\sim 2.1~L_{\rm Edd}$ (for a nearly edge-on observer).
The power ratio is $L_{\rm mec}/L_{\rm X}^{\rm ISO}\sim 0.05$-$0.08$, in good
agreement with the observations of Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources surrounded by

negativities, which contain the familiar logarithmic negativity as a special
case. We then study these quantities in the random tensor network model and
rigorously derive their large bond dimension asymptotics. Finally, we study
entanglement negativity in holographic theories with a gravity dual, where we
find that R\'enyi negativities are often dominated by bulk solutions that break
the replica symmetry. From these replica symmetry breaking solutions, we derive
general expressions for R\'enyi negativities and their special limits including
the logarithmic negativity. In fixed-area states, these general expressions
simplify dramatically and agree precisely with our results in the random tensor

formation in dense stellar clusters and three-body interactions. The
gravitational-wave searches by the ground-based interferometers, LIGO and
Virgo, rely on analytical waveform models for binaries on quasicircular orbits.
Eccentric merger waveform models are less developed, and only few numerical
simulations of eccentric mergers are publicly available, but several eccentric
inspiral models have been developed from the post-Newtonian expansion. Here we
present a novel method to convert the dominant quadrupolar mode of any circular
analytical binary-black-hole model into an eccentric model. First, using
numerical simulations, we examine the additional amplitude and frequency
modulations of eccentric signals that are not present in their circular
counterparts. Subsequently, we identify suitable analytical descriptions of
those modulations and interpolate key parameters from twelve numerical
simulations designated as our training dataset. This allows us to reconstruct
the modulated amplitude and phase of any waveform up to mass ratio 3 and
eccentricity 0.2. We find that the minimum overlap of the new model with
numerical simulations is around 0.98 over all of our test dataset that are
scaled to a 50M$_\odot$ black-hole binary starting at 35 Hz with aLIGO A+

detailed structure of the CMZ, we find that four of these galaxies are
consistent with CMZ observations at some point during this 22 Myr period. The
galaxies presented here are not homogeneous in their central structures,
roughly dividing into two morphological classes; (a) several of the galaxies
have very asymmetric gas and SFR distributions, with intense (compact)
starbursts occurring over a period of roughly 10 Myr, and structures on highly
eccentric orbits through the CMZ, whereas (b) others have smoother gas and SFR
distributions, with only slowly varying SFRs over the period analyzed. In class
(a) centers, the orbital motion of gas and star-forming complexes across small
apertures ($R \lesssim 150$pc, analogously $|l|<1^\circ$ in the CMZ
observations) contributes as much to tracers of star formation/dense gas
appearing in those apertures, as the internal evolution of those structures
does. These asymmetric/bursty galactic centers can simultaneously match CMZ gas
and SFR observations, demonstrating that time-varying star formation can
explain the CMZ's low star formation efficiency.

optimization, based on decoupling of the objective function into terms with
structurally different properties and allowing for more flexible algorithmic
design. We introduce a new algorithmic framework for complementary composite
minimization, where the objective function decouples into a (weakly) smooth and
a uniformly convex term. This particular form of decoupling is pervasive in
statistics and machine learning, due to its link to regularization. The main
contributions of our work are summarized as follows. First, we introduce the
problem of complementary composite minimization in general normed spaces;
second, we provide a unified accelerated algorithmic framework to address broad
classes of complementary composite minimization problems; and third, we prove
that the algorithms resulting from our framework are near-optimal in most of
the standard optimization settings. Additionally, we show that our algorithmic
framework can be used to address the problem of making the gradients small in
general normed spaces. As a concrete example, we obtain a nearly-optimal method
for the standard $\ell_1$ setup (small gradients in the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm),
essentially matching the bound of Nesterov (2012) that was previously known
only for the Euclidean setup. Finally, we show that our composite methods are
broadly applicable to a number of regression and other classes of optimization
problems, where regularization plays a key role. Our methods lead to complexity
bounds that are either new or match the best existing ones.

dielectric spectra on the same materials involve significant contributions

structural relaxation time, revealing non-Arrhenius behavior typical for glassy
freezing, are compared to the ionic dc conductivity and relaxation times

find essentially identical temperature dependences for all dynamic quantities.
These findings point to a close coupling of the ionic and molecular
translational and reorientational motions in these systems. However, for reline
the ionic charge transport appears decoupled from the structural and
reorientational dynamics, following a fractional Walden rule. Especially, at
low temperatures the ionic conductivity in this DES is enhanced by about one

the high-order grammatical feature of morphosyntactic alignment (how different

spaces of different languages. To understand if and how morphosyntactic
alignment affects contextual embedding spaces, we train classifiers to recover
the subjecthood of mBERT embeddings in transitive sentences (which do not

them zero-shot on intransitive sentences (where subjecthood classification
depends on alignment), within and across languages. We find that the resulting

influenced by high-level grammatical features that are not manifested in any

the characteristics that our classifiers rely on, we find that features such as
passive voice, animacy and case strongly correlate with classification
decisions, suggesting that mBERT does not encode subjecthood purely

the estimator applicable to the parameters of the prior in addition to those of

increases with age, starting near zero at 1 Gyr and flattening to $\sim 0.35$
by 4 Gyr. Fitting stellar evolutionary tracks to these BSS, we find that their
mass distribution peaks at a few tenths of a solar mass above the main-sequence
turnoff. BSS more than 0.5 $M_\odot$ above the turnoff make up only $\sim25$\%
of the sample, and BSS more than 1.0 $M_\odot$ above the turnoff are rare. We
compare this to population synthesis models of BSS formed via mass transfer
using the Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code (COSMIC).
We find that standard population synthesis assumptions dramatically
under-produce the number of BSS in old open clusters. We also find that these
models overproduce high mass BSS relative to lower mass BSS. Expected numbers
of BSS formed through dynamics do not fully account for this discrepancy. We
conclude that in order to explain the observed BSS populations from Roche lobe
overflow, mass-transfer from giant donors must be more stable than assumed in
canonical mass-transfer prescriptions, and including non-conservative mass
transfer is important in producing realistic BSS masses. Even with these
modifications, it is difficult to achieve the large number of BSS observed in
the oldest open clusters. We discuss some additional physics that may explain

the evolution of mesoscale plasticity in face-centered cubic materials. While
competition between these mechanisms is known to be related to the critical
features of the generalized planar fault energy landscape, a physical theory
that tracks competition over extended plasticity has yet to emerge. Here, we
report a methodology to predict the mesoscale evolution of this competition in
deformed crystals. Our approach implements kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to
examine fault structure evolution in face-centered cubic metals using intrinsic
material parameters as inputs. These results are leveraged to derive an
analytical model for the evolution of the fault fraction, fault densities, and
partitioning of plastic strains among deformation mechanisms. In addition, we
define a competition parameter that measures the tendencies for deformation
twinning and dislocation slip. In contrast to previous twinnability parameters,
our derivation considers deformation history when examining mechanism
competition. This contribution therefore extends the reach of deformation
twinning theory beyond incipient nucleation events. These products find direct
applications in work hardening and crystal plasticity models, which have
previously relied on phenomenological relations to predict the mesoscale

establish a new formalism called Poisson-Hopf algebra deformations of Lie
systems. The procedure can be naturally applied to Lie systems endowed with a
symplectic structure, the so-called Lie-Hamilton systems. This is quite a
general approach, as it can be applied to any quantum deformation and any
underlying manifold. One of its main features is that, Lie systems are extended
to generalized systems described by involutive distributions. In this way, we
obtain their new generalized (deformed) counterparts that cover, in particular,
a new oscillator system with a time-dependent frequency and a
position-dependent mass. Based on a recently developed procedure to construct
Poisson-Hopf deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems \cite{Ballesteros5}, a novel
unified approach to deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems on the real plane with
a Vessiot-Guldberg Lie algebra isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ is proposed. In
addition, we study the deformed systems obtained from Lie-Hamilton systems
associated to the oscillator algebra $\mathfrak{h}_4$, seen as a subalgebra of
the 2-photon algebra $\mathfrak{h}_6$. As a particular application, we propose
an epidemiological model of SISf type that uses the solvable Lie algebra

delocalizes in the superfluid phase, leading to a zero-frequency spectral peak.
We compare these findings to the results of the quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. We also relate them to general results on the localization of
bosonic excitations, and we discuss the limits and generality of our approach.

observed SXR emission. The traditional form of the Neupert effect refers to the
correlation between the time-integrated HXR or microwave light curve and the
SXR light curve. In this paper, instead, we use as the proxy for heating energy
the ultraviolet (UV) emission at the foot-points of flare loops, and modify the
model of the Neupert effect by taking into account the discrete nature of flare
heating as well as cooling. In the modified empirical model, spatially resolved
UV lightcurves from the transition region or upper chromosphere are each
convolved with a kernel function characterizing the decay of the flare loop
emission. Contributions by all loops are summed to compare with the observed
total SXR emission. The model has successfully reproduced the observed SXR
emission from its rise to decay. To estimate heating energies in flare loops,
we also employ the UV Foot-point Calorimeter (UFC) method that infers heating
rates in flare loops from these UV light curves and models evolution of flare
loops with a zero-dimensional hydrodynamic code. The experiments show that a
multitude of impulsive heating events do not well reproduce the observed flare
SXR light curve, but a two-phase heating model leads to better agreement with
observations. Comparison of the two models of the Neupert effect further allows
us to calibrate the UFC method, and improve the estimate of heating rates in
flare loops continuously formed by magnetic reconnection throughout the flare
evolution.

another set of people who can perform the subteam's role in the larger team.
The ability to simultaneously replace multiple team members is highly
appreciated in settings such as corporate management where team structure is
highly volatile and large-scale changes are commonplace. We conjecture that a
good candidate subteam should have high skill and structural similarity with
the replaced subteam while sharing a similar connection with the larger team as

approximate the labour room service at each PHC as an M/G/1 queueing system and
show how the accuracy of real-time delay predictors impacts the extent of the
change in operational outcomes at each PHC. We simulate patient diversion using
actual delays as well as the delay estimates generated by various delay
predictors based on the state of the system such as queue-length, elapsed

process also incorporates travel time between the PHCs. We also propose a new
delay predictor that incorporates information regarding the system state as

both PHCs without diversion and with diversion using the above delay

detection problem of weak signals in background noise. In so doing, we consider
a nonfluctuating target embedded in complex white Gaussian noise (CWGN), in
which the amplitude of the target echo and the noise power are assumed to be
unknown. Important works have analyzed the performance for the referred
scenario and proposed GLRT-based detectors. Such detectors are projected at an
early stage (i.e., prior to the formation of a post-beamforming scalar
waveform), thereby imposing high demands on hardware, processing, and data
storage. From a hardware perspective, most radar systems fail to meet these
strong requirements. In fact, due to hardware and computational constraints,
most radars use a combination of analog and digital beamformers (sums) before
any estimation or further pre-processing. The rationale behind this study is to
derive a GLRT detector that meets the hardware and system requirements. In this
work, we design and analyze a more practical and easy-to-implement GLRT
detector, which is projected after the analog beamforming. The performance of
the proposed detector is analyzed and the probabilities of detection (PD) and
false alarm (PFA) are derived in closed form. Moreover, we show that in the low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the post-beamforming GLRT detector performs
better than both the classic pre-beamforming GLRT detector and the square-law
detector. This finding suggests that if the signals are weak, instead of
processing the signals separately, we first must to reinforce the overall
signal and then assembling the system's detection statistic. At last, the SNR
losses are quantified, in which the superiority of the post-beamforming GLRT
detector was evidenced as the number of antennas and samples increase.

attacks, i.e. an attacks ability to attack a different CNN than the one it was
trained against, has important implications for designing CNNs that are
resistant to attacks. While attacks on object recognition CNNs are believed to
be transferrable, recent work by Barni et al. has shown that attacks on
forensic CNNs have difficulty transferring to other CNN architectures or CNNs
trained using different datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate that
adversarial attacks on forensic CNNs are even less transferrable than
previously thought even between virtually identical CNN architectures! We show
that several common adversarial attacks against CNNs trained to identify image
manipulation fail to transfer to CNNs whose only difference is in the class
definitions (i.e. the same CNN architectures trained using the same data). We
note that all formulations of class definitions contain the unaltered class.
This has important implications for the future design of forensic CNNs that are
robust to adversarial and anti-forensic attacks.

underlying sampling distribution of an i.i.d.\ sample based on fitting additive

the algorithm is a new notion of ""addition"" on probability distributions that
leads to a coherent notion of ""residualization"", i.e., subtracting a
probability distribution from an observation to remove the distributional
structure from the sampling distribution of the latter. We show that these
notions arise naturally for univariate distributions through cumulative
distribution function (CDF) transforms and compositions due to several
""group-like"" properties of univariate CDFs. While the traditional multivariate
CDF does not preserve these properties, a new definition of multivariate CDF
can restore these properties, thereby allowing the notions of ""addition"" and
""residualization"" to be formulated for multivariate settings as well. This then
gives rise to the unsupervised boosting algorithm based on forward-stagewise
fitting of an additive tree ensemble, which sequentially reduces the
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the truth. The algorithm allows analytic
evaluation of the fitted density and outputs a generative model that can be
readily sampled from. We enhance the algorithm with scale-dependent shrinkage

  Analysis, Featuring Prognostic Stratification Boosting","co-first authors: Hassan Muhammad and Chensu Xie",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Histopathology-based survival modelling has two major hurdles. Firstly, a
well-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not
contribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk
groups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting,
individuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather
predicted to lie within a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus,
It is imperative that a survival model produces well-stratified risk groups.
Secondly, until now, survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach
(encoding and aggregation). The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole
slide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to technological
constraints on data processing, forcing decoupled learning. EPIC-Survival
bridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling
approach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to
not only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In
this study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in
modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a historically difficult cancer to
model. Further, we show that stratification boosting improves further improves
model performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a held-out test
set. Finally, we were able to identify specific histologic differences, not
commonly sought out in ICC, between low and high risk groups.

  covariance testing",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Le Cam's third/contiguity lemma is a fundamental probabilistic tool to
compute the limiting distribution of a given statistic $T_n$ under a non-null
sequence of probability measures $\{Q_n\}$, provided its limiting distribution
under a null sequence $\{P_n\}$ is available, and the log likelihood ratio
$\{\log (dQ_n/dP_n)\}$ has a distributional limit. Despite its wide-spread
applications to low-dimensional statistical problems, the stringent requirement
of Le Cam's third/contiguity lemma on the distributional limit of the log
likelihood ratio makes it challenging, or even impossible to use in many modern
high-dimensional statistical problems.
  This paper provides a non-asymptotic analogue of Le Cam's third/contiguity
lemma under high dimensional normal populations. Our contiguity method is
particularly compatible with sufficiently regular statistics $T_n$: the
regularity of $T_n$ effectively reduces both the problems of (i) obtaining a
null (Gaussian) limit distribution and of (ii) verifying our new quantitative
contiguity condition, to those of derivative calculations and moment bounding
exercises. More important, our method bypasses the need to understand the
precise behavior of the log likelihood ratio, and therefore possibly works even
when it necessarily fails to stabilize -- a regime beyond the reach of
classical contiguity methods.
  As a demonstration of the scope of our new contiguity method, we obtain
asymptotically exact power formulae for a number of widely used
high-dimensional covariance tests, including the likelihood ratio tests and
trace tests, that hold uniformly over all possible alternative covariance under
mild growth conditions on the dimension-to-sample ratio. These new results go
much beyond the scope of previous available case-specific techniques, and
exhibit new phenomenon regarding the behavior of these important class of
covariance tests.

something stronger: there is a family of constant-sized correlations -- that
is, correlations for which the number of measurements and number of measurement
outcomes are fixed -- such that solving the quantum membership problem for this

understanding Bell experiments is not dependent on varying the number of

motivated semi-analytical model for reionization, a similar semi-analytical
model for computing the global 21~cm signal during the cosmic dawn and using an
appropriately modified version of the publicly available CAMB for computing the
CMB anisotropies. These calculations are then coupled to an MCMC ensemble
sampler \texttt{emcee} to compute the posterior distributions of the model

seven related to the stellar populations. We constrain the parameters by
matching the theoretical predictions with CMB data from Planck, observations
related to the quasar absorption spectra and, for the first time, the global
21~cm signal from EDGES. We find that incorporating the quasar spectra data in
the analysis tightens the bounds on the electron scattering optical depth
$\tau$ and consequently the normalization $A_s$ of the primordial matter power
spectrum (or equivalently $\sigma_8$). Furthermore, when we include the EDGES
data in the analysis, we find that an early population of metal-free stars with
efficient radio emission is necessary to match the absorption amplitude. The
CosmoReionMC package should have interesting future applications, e.g., probing
non-standard extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model.

arise from different factors such as: image acquisition methodology, excess of

In this work it is proposed that the numerical computations of fractal
dimension and entropy are tools that could be used to automatically segment and
distinguish malignant tumors and/or microcalcifications in digital mammograms.
The study consisted in segment the image in two areas: background and confirmed
malignant tumor and/or microcalcification, to which the fractal dimension and
entropy values are calculated and it was found the correlation between them.
The analysis was performed on a grayscale re-digitized images from images
provided locally by hospital for microcalcifications and from public databases
for malignant tumors. From these re-digitized images, it was able to give the
exact coordinates as the diagnosis provides. For any image, the highest
intensity value was located in the tumor and/or microcalcification area,
resulting that the fractal dimension had a higher value than the rest of the
image, while the entropy value was lower, due to the uniformity of intensities
in these areas. To complete this study, it was performed a data analysis with
the set of intensities in each area. This allowed to distinguish between the
areas of interest according to the value of the intensities, having a value
greater than 3 {\sigma}. Finally, it is shown a technique to visually highlight

estimation in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. The proposed
algorithms minimize a least-squares objective having a nonconvex regularizer.
This regularizer removes the penalties on a few large-magnitude elements from
the conventional l1-norm regularizer, and thus it only forces penalties on the
remaining elements that are expected to be zeros. Accurate and fast
reconstructions can be achieved by performing gradient projection updates
within the framework of difference of convex functions (DC) programming. A
double-loop algorithm and a single-loop algorithm are proposed via different DC
decompositions, and these two algorithms have distinct computation complexities
and convergence rates. Then, an extension algorithm is further proposed by
designing the step sizes of the single-loop algorithm. The extension algorithm
has a faster convergence rate and can achieve approximately the same level of
accuracy as the proposed double-loop algorithm. Numerical results show
significant advantages of the proposed algorithms over existing reconstruction
algorithms in terms of reconstruction accuracies and runtimes. Compared to the
benchmark channel estimation techniques, the proposed algorithms also achieve
smaller mean squared error and higher achievable spectral efficiency.

decision maker aims to maximize the total revenue subject to budget constraints
on multiple type of resources over a finite horizon. At each time, a new
order/customer/bid is revealed with a request of some resource(s) and a reward,
and the decision maker needs to either accept or reject the order. Upon the
acceptance of the order, the resource request must be satisfied and the
associated revenue (reward) can be collected. We consider a stochastic setting
where all the orders are i.i.d. sampled, i.e., the reward-request pair at each
time is drawn from an unknown distribution with finite support. The formulation
contains many classic applications such as the quantity-based network revenue
management problem and the Adwords problem. We focus on the classic LP-based
adaptive algorithm and consider regret as the performance measure defined by
the gap between the optimal objective value of the certainty-equivalent linear
program (LP) and the expected revenue obtained by the online algorithm. Our
contribution is two-fold: (i) when the underlying LP is nondegenerate, the
algorithm achieves a problem-dependent regret upper bound that is independent
of the horizon/number of time periods $T$; (ii) when the underlying LP is
degenerate, the algorithm achieves a regret upper bound that scales on the

Optimizing the trade-off between information gain and energy cost (e.g.,
control effort, distance travelled) is desirable but leads to a non-monotone
objective function in the set of robot trajectories. Therefore, common
multi-robot planning algorithms based on techniques such as coordinate descent
lose their performance guarantees. Methods based on local search provide
performance guarantees for optimizing a non-monotone submodular function, but
require access to all robots' trajectories, making it not suitable for
distributed execution. This work proposes a distributed planning approach based
on local search and shows how lazy/greedy methods can be adopted to reduce the
computation and communication of the approach. We demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method by coordinating robot teams composed of both ground and
aerial vehicles with different sensing/control profiles and evaluate the
algorithm's performance in two target tracking scenarios. Compared to the naive
distributed execution of local search, our approach saves up to 60%
communication and 80--92% computation on average when coordinating up to 10
robots, while outperforming the coordinate descent based algorithm in achieving
a desirable trade-off between sensing and energy cost.

lack of understanding of what makes one method to extract hierarchies perform
better or worse. To this effect, we analyze and compare some of the most
popular approaches to extracting hierarchies. We identify some common pitfalls
that may lead practitioners to make misleading conclusions about their methods.
In addition, to address some of these problems, we demonstrate that using
random hierarchies is an appropriate benchmark to assess how the hierarchy's
quality affects the classification performance. In particular, we show how the
hierarchy's quality can become irrelevant depending on the experimental setup:
when using powerful enough classifiers, the final performance is not affected
by the quality of the hierarchy. We also show how comparing the effect of the
hierarchies against non-hierarchical approaches might incorrectly indicate
their superiority. Our results confirm that datasets with a high number of
classes generally present complex structures in how these classes relate to
each other. In these datasets, the right hierarchy can dramatically improve

word balloons by analyzing the emotion of subtitles and audios. Our method is
able to vary balloon shapes and word sizes in balloons in response to different

how to decode the resulting noisy measurements? Published work has relied on

for decoding and to a lesser degree for code construction. Here we establish
that both of these assumptions are inappropriate in the context of mFISH
experiments and substantial decoding performance gains can be obtained by using
more appropriate, less classical, assumptions. We propose a more appropriate
asymmetric channel model that can be readily parameterized from data and use it
to develop a maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoders. We show that false discovery
rate for rare RNAs, which is the key experimental metric, is vastly improved

Particular attention is given to impact systems where the continuous dynamics
are Lagrangian and subject to nonholonomic constraints. A celebrated result for
volume-preserving dynamical systems is Poincar\'e recurrence. In order to be
recurrent, trajectories need to exist for long periods of time, which can be
controlled in continuous-time systems through e.g. compactness. For hybrid
systems, an additional mechanism can occur which breaks long-time existence:
Zeno (infinitely many discrete transitions in a finite amount of time). We
demonstrate that the existence of a smooth invariant volume severely inhibits
Zeno behavior; hybrid systems with the ""boundary identity property"" along with
an invariant volume-form have almost no Zeno trajectories (although Zeno
trajectories can still exist). This leads to the result that many billiards

observing planets both during and after formation. Giant planets are expected
to form either by core accretion, which is typically associated with low
initial entropy (cold-start models) or by gravitational instability, which
corresponds to a high initial entropy of the gas (hot-start models). Thus,
constraining the initial entropy provides insight into the planet formation
mechanism and determines the resultant brightness evolution. We find that, by
observing planets in nearby moving groups of known age both through direct
imaging and astrometry with Gaia, it will be possible to constrain the initial
entropy of giant planets. We simulate a set of planetary systems in stars in
nearby moving groups identified by BANYAN $\Sigma$ and assume a model for
planet distribution consistent with radial velocity detections. We find that
Gaia should be able to detect approximately 50% of planets in nearby moving
groups greater than ~0.3 M$_\text{J}$. Using 5$\sigma$ contrast limits of
current and future instruments, we calculate the flux uncertainty, and using
models for the evolution of the planet brightness, we convert this to an
initial entropy uncertainty. We find that, for future instruments such as
MICADO and METIS on E-ELT and VIKiNG with VLTI, the entropy uncertainty is less
than 0.5 $k_{B}$/baryon, showing that these instruments should be able to
distinguish between hot and cold-start models.

other incomplete traffic information. Next, we assume that the vehicles are
operating under a non-cooperative cruise control scenario. Accordingly, human
route choice segregates the traffic into multiple classes where each class
corresponds to a specific route between an origin-destination pair. Thereafter,
we derive a Mean Field Game (MFG) limit of this non-cooperative game to obtain
a macroscopic model which embeds the human route choice attribute. Finally, we
analyze the mathematical characteristics of the proposed model and present

across channels whose rate of erasure is unknown. In such a code, an infinite
stream of encoding symbols can be generated from the message and sent across
the erasure channel, and the decoder can decode the message after it has
successfully collected a certain number of encoding symbols. A rateless erasure
code is real-time oblivious if rather than collecting encoding symbols as they
are received, the receiver either immediately decodes or discards each symbol
it receives.
  Efficient real-time oblivious erasure correction uses a feedback channel in
order to maximize the probability that a received encoding symbol is decoded
rather than discarded. We construct codes which are real-time oblivious, but
require fewer feedback messages and have faster decoding compared to previous
work. Specifically, for a message of length $k'$, we improve the expected
complexity of the feedback channel from $O(\sqrt{k'})$ to $O(1)$, and the
expected decoding complexity from $O(k'\log(k'))$ to $O(k')$. Our method
involves using an appropriate block erasure code to first encode the $k'$
message symbols, and then using a truncated version of the real-time oblivious
erasure correction of Beimel et al (2007) to transmit the encoded message to
the receiver, which then uses the decoding algorithm for the outer code to
recover the message.

focus on the increasing phenomenon of ED overcrowding, which is afflicting
hospitals all over the world. Since Discrete Event Simulation models are often
adopted with the aim to assess solutions for reducing the impact of this
problem, proper nonstationary processes are taken into account to reproduce
time-dependent arrivals. Accordingly, an accurate estimation of the unknown
arrival rate is required to guarantee the reliability of the results. In this
work, an integer nonlinear black-box optimization problem is solved to
determine the best piecewise constant approximation of the time-varying arrival
rate function, by finding the optimal partition of the 24 hours into a suitable
number of non equally spaced intervals. The black-box constraints of the
optimization problem make the feasible solutions satisfy proper statistical
hypotheses; these ensure the validity of the nonhomogeneous Poisson assumption
about the arrival process, commonly adopted in the literature, and prevent
mixing overdispersed data for model estimation. The cost function includes a
fit error term for the solution accuracy and a penalty term to select an
adequate degree of regularity of the optimal solution. To show the
effectiveness of this methodology, real data from one of the largest Italian
hospital EDs are used.

to a slowly increasing internal pressure produces a spatially localized bulge
at a critical pressure. The subsequent fate of the bulge, under continued
inflation, is critically governed by the end-conditions, and the initial
tension in the tube. In a tube with one end fixed and a dead weight attached to
the other freely moving end, the bulge propagates axially at low initial
tension, growing in length and the tube relaxes by extension. Rupture occurs
when the tension is high. In contrast, the bulge formed in a tube, initially
stretched and held fixed at both its ends can buckle or rupture, depending on
the amount of initial tension. Experiments on inflated latex rubber tubes are
presented for different initial tensions and boundary conditions. Failure maps
in the stretch parameter space and in stretch-tension space are constructed, by
extending the theories for bulge formation and buckling analyses to the
experimentally relevant boundary conditions. The fate of the bulge according to
the failure maps deduced from the theory is verified; the underlying
assumptions are critically assessed. It is concluded that buckling provides an
alternate route to relieve the stress built up during inflation. Hence
buckling, when it occurs, is a protective fail safe mechanism against the
rupture of a bulge in an inflated elastic tube.

humans must update their beliefs as new observations are gathered. Studies
exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have
focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are

history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes
depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We
investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point
inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine
aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans
behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion, but, quantitatively, deviate away
from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that
their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this
variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To
elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a
broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of
suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with 'output
noise' that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates,
human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which
the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented
through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes
to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning

workflow is surprisingly unattested. We perform the first comprehensive
investigation of the promise and challenges of using such technology inside the
IDE, asking ""at the current state of technology does it improve developer
productivity or accuracy, how does it affect the developer experience, and what
are the remaining gaps and challenges?"" We first develop a plugin for the IDE
that implements a hybrid of code generation and code retrieval functionality,
and orchestrate virtual environments to enable collection of many user events.
We ask developers with various backgrounds to complete 14 Python programming
tasks ranging from basic file manipulation to machine learning or data
visualization, with or without the help of the plugin. While qualitative
surveys of developer experience are largely positive, quantitative results with
regards to increased productivity, code quality, or program correctness are
inconclusive. Analysis identifies several pain points that could improve the
effectiveness of future machine learning based code generation/retrieval
developer assistants, and demonstrates when developers prefer code generation
over code retrieval and vice versa. We release all data and software to pave
the road for future empirical studies and development of better models.

dimension of a subset $E\subseteq\R^n$ by the \textit{effective} (or
algorithmic) dimension of its individual points. This characterization has been
used to prove several results in classical, i.e., without any computability
requirements, analysis. Recent work has shown that algorithmic techniques can
be fruitfully applied to Marstrand's projection theorem, a fundamental result
in fractal geometry.
  In this paper, we introduce an extension of point-to-set principle - the
notion of \textit{optimal oracles} for subsets $E\subseteq\R^n$. One of the
primary motivations of this definition is that, if $E$ has optimal oracles,
then the conclusion of Marstrand's projection theorem holds for $E$. We show
that every analytic set has optimal oracles. We also prove that if the
Hausdorff and packing dimensions of $E$ agree, then $E$ has optimal oracles.
Moreover, we show that the existence of sufficiently nice outer measures on $E$
implies the existence of optimal Hausdorff oracles. In particular, the
existence of exact gauge functions for a set $E$ is sufficient for the
existence of optimal Hausdorff oracles, and is therefore sufficient for
Marstrand's theorem. Thus, the existence of optimal oracles extends the
currently known sufficient conditions for Marstrand's theorem to hold.
  Under certain assumptions, every set has optimal oracles. However, assuming
the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis, we construct sets which do
not have optimal oracles. This construction naturally leads to a generalization
of Davies theorem on projections.

which provides valuable insights into inter and intra-individual behavioural
heterogeneity. However, applications of mixed-logit models are limited by the
high computational and data requirements for model estimation. When estimating
on small samples, the Bayesian estimation approach becomes vulnerable to over
and under-fitting. This is problematic for investigating the behaviour of
specific population sub-groups or market segments with low data availability.
Similar challenges arise when transferring an existing model to a new location
or time period, e.g., when estimating post-pandemic travel behaviour. We
propose an Early Stopping Bayesian Data Assimilation (ESBDA) simulator for
estimation of mixed-logit which combines a Bayesian statistical approach with
Machine Learning methodologies. The aim is to improve the transferability of
mixed-logit models and to enable the estimation of robust choice models with
low data availability. This approach can provide new insights into choice
behaviour where the traditional estimation of mixed-logit models was not
possible due to low data availability, and open up new opportunities for
investment and planning decisions support. The ESBDA estimator is benchmarked
against the Direct Application approach, a basic Bayesian simulator with random
starting parameter values and a Bayesian Data Assimilation (BDA) simulator
without early stopping. The ESBDA approach is found to effectively overcome
under and over-fitting and non-convergence issues in simulation. Its resulting
models clearly outperform those of the reference simulators in predictive
accuracy. Furthermore, models estimated with ESBDA tend to be more robust, with
significant parameters with signs and values consistent with behavioural
theory, even when estimated on small samples.

Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ has attracted intensive attention in the field. An
immediate question is how to improve its superconducting properties. Guided by
the key characteristics of electronic structures of the cuprates and the
nickelates, we propose that nickel chalcogenides with a similar lattice
structure should be a promising family of materials. Using NdNiS$_2$ as an
example, through first-principle structural optimization and phonon
calculation, we find this particular crystal structure a stable one. We justify
our proposal by comparing with CaCuO$_2$ and NdNiO$_2$ with regard to strength
of the charge-transfer characteristics and the trend in their low-energy
many-body effective Hamiltonians of doped hole carriers. This analysis
indicates that nickel chalcogenides host low-energy physics closer to that of
the cuprates, with stronger magnetic interaction than the nickelates, and thus
they deserve further experimental exploration. Our proposal also opens up the
possibility of a wide range of parameter tuning through ligand substitution
among chalcogenides, to further improve superconducting properties.

reasonably well established, however, remote subsurface exploration is limited
by depth and penetration and ground resolution. Furthermore, the conservation
of archaeological sites requires constant monitoring capability, which is often
not feasible between annual field seasons, but may be provided by modern
satellite coverage. Here we develop an approach using Sentinel-1 C-band radar
backscatter, and Sentinel-2 multispectral data, to map and characterise the
site of Qubbet el-Hawa, Egypt. The multispectral bands analysed show similar
sensitivity to satellite imagery. However, the radar backscatter is sensitive
to exposed known structures, as well as disturbances to soil
textural/composition profile due to excavation/erosion. Sub-resolution features
such as causeways manifest as a 'radar-break' in the backscatter - a
discontinuity in otherwise continuous radar units. Furthermore, the finite
subsurface response in the backscatter under the arid conditions of the site
means we are able to delineate some shallow subsurface structures and map their
orientation beneath the surface in areas not yet excavated. The sensitivity of
Sentinel-1 backscatter to soil disturbance and human activity at Qubbet
el-Hawa, and the short (~12 day) recurrence time of the satellites, makes it an
important tool in heritage conservation.

first peak would be shock-cooling emission from massive extended material
around the progenitor, which is produced by mass eruption or rapid expansion of
the outermost layers of the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion.
We investigate the effects of such circumstellar matter (CSM) on the multi-band
optical light curves of SNe Ic using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA.
Two different SNe Ic progenitor masses at the pre-SN stage (3.93$M_\odot$ and
8.26$M_\odot$) are considered in the SN models. The adopted parameter space
consists of the CSM mass of $M_\mathrm{CSM} = 0.05 - 0.3 M_\odot$, the CSM
radius of $R_\mathrm{CSM} = 10^{13} - 10^{15}$cm and the explosion energy of
$E_\mathrm{burst} = (1.0 - 12.0)\times10^{51}$erg. We also investigate the
effects of the radioactive nickel distribution on the overall shape of the
light curve and the color evolution. Comparison of our SN models with the
double peaked SNe Ic LSQ14efd, iPTF15dtg and SN 2020bvc indicate that these
three SNe Ic had a similar CSM structure (i.e., $M_\mathrm{CSM} \approx 0.1 -
0.2 M_\odot$ and $R_\mathrm{CSM} = 10^{13} - 10^{14}~\mathrm{cm}$), which might
imply a common mechanism for the CSM formation. The implied mass loss rate of
$\dot{M} \gtrsim 1.0~M_\odot~\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ is too high to be explained by
the previously suggested scenarios for pre-SN eruption, which calls for a novel
mechanism.

with the original algorithm. In particular, accuracy at the level of single
precision arithmetic is readily achieved by choosing a least-misfit convolution
function of width W=7 and an image cropping parameter of x0=0.25. If the
accuracy required is only that attained by the original W-stacking method, the
computational cost for both the gridding and FFT steps can be substantially
reduced using the proposed method by making an appropriate choice of the width

semisolids to fluids. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide

Computational results supported the hypothesis experimentally proposed for the
stability of the mixed system being due to an increase in the flexibility,
hence an increase in the configurational entropy of the chain tip of the
alcohol with a longer hydrocarbon chain (with the highest flexibility observed
in the 50:50 C18:C16 system). This finding is in excellent agreement with
experimental conclusions. Additionally, simulation data show that in the mixed

problems and initial results are encouraging. However, there exists significant
friction in the lack of a simple, configurable, open-source framework for
cellular offload research. Prior research utilises a variety of network
simulators and system models, making it difficult to compare results. In this
paper we present GymD2D, a framework for experimentation with physical layer
resource allocation problems in device-to-device communication. GymD2D allows
users to simulate a variety of cellular offload scenarios and to extend its
behaviour to meet their research needs. GymD2D provides researchers an
evaluation platform to compare, share and build upon previous research. We
evaluated GymD2D with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning and
demonstrate these algorithms provide significant efficiency improvements.

applications and has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However,
existing arbitrary-oriented ship detection methods are generally developed on a
set of predefined rotated anchor boxes. These predefined boxes not only lead to
inaccurate angle predictions but also introduce extra hyper-parameters and high
computational cost. Moreover, the prior knowledge of ship size has not been
fully exploited by existing methods, which hinders the improvement of their
detection accuracy. Aiming at solving the above issues, in this paper, we
propose a center-head point extraction based detector (named CHPDet) to achieve
arbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images. Our CHPDet
formulates arbitrary-oriented ships as rotated boxes with head points which are
used to determine the direction. And rotated Gaussian kernel is used to map the
annotations into target heatmaps. Keypoint estimation is performed to find the
center of ships. Then, the size and head point of the ships are regressed. The
orientation-invariant model (OIM) is also used to produce orientation-invariant
feature maps. Finally, we use the target size as prior to finetune the results.
Moreover, we introduce a new dataset for multi-class arbitrary-oriented ship
detection in remote sensing images at a fixed ground sample distance (GSD)
which is named FGSD2021. Experimental results on FGSD2021 and two other widely
used data sets, i.e., HRSC2016, and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our CHPDet
achieves state-of-the-art performance and can well distinguish between bow and
stern. Code and FGSD2021 dataset are available at

that involve sequentially growing an ensemble of simple regression trees (i.e.,

spatially correlated data. This paper proposes a new gradient Boosted Trees
algorithm for Spatial Data (Boost-S) with covariate information. Boost-S
integrates the spatial correlation structure into the classical framework of
gradient boosted trees. Each tree is grown by solving a regularized
optimization problem, where the objective function involves two penalty terms
on tree complexity and takes into account the underlying spatial correlation. A
computationally-efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the ensemble trees.
The proposed Boost-S is applied to the spatially-correlated FDG-PET

the advantages of the proposed Boost-S over existing approaches for this

functional on the tangent bundle $T \mathcal{H} (X, L)$ of the space
$\mathcal{H} (X, L)$ of K""ahler metrics in a given K""ahler class $L$. The
critical points of $\check{W}^\lambda$ turn out to be $\mu^\lambda$-cscK

$\mu^\lambda$-cscK metrics are also characterized as critical points of this
functional, similarly as extremal metric is characterized as the critical
points of Calabi functional.
  We also prove the W-entropy is monotonic along geodesics, following
Berman--Berndtsson's subharmonicity argument. Studying the limit of the
W-entropy, we obtain a lower bound of the mu-entropy. This bound is not just

multi-band image stack is an unknown 3D piecewise constant function including
Poisson noise. It also assumes that all image stacks between any two adjacent
change points (in time domain) share the same unknown piecewise constant
function. The proposed method is designed to estimate the number and the
locations of all the change points (in time domain), as well as all the unknown
piecewise constant functions between any pairs of the change points. The method
applies the minimum description length (MDL) principle to perform this task. A
practical algorithm is also developed to solve the corresponding complicated
optimization problem. Simulation experiments and applications to real datasets

leverages a large number of workers to jointly learn a model with decentralized

privacy protection, communication efficiency and a linear speedup for
convergence in training (i.e., convergence performance increases linearly with
respect to the number of workers). However, existing studies on linear speedup
for convergence are only limited to the assumptions of i.i.d. datasets across
workers and/or full worker participation, both of which rarely hold in
practice. So far, it remains an open question whether or not the linear speedup
for convergence is achievable under non-i.i.d. datasets with partial worker
participation in FL. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative.
Specifically, we show that the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm (with
two-sided learning rates) on non-i.i.d. datasets in non-convex settings
achieves a convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mKT}} + \frac{1}{T})$

$\mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{K}}{\sqrt{nT}} + \frac{1}{T})$ for partial worker
participation, where $K$ is the number of local steps, $T$ is the number of
total communication rounds, $m$ is the total worker number and $n$ is the
worker number in one communication round if for partial worker participation.
Our results also reveal that the local steps in FL could help the convergence
and show that the maximum number of local steps can be improved to $T/m$ in
full worker participation. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR-10 to verify our theoretical results.

economy, and public safety has increased the demand for fake news detection.
Fake news on social media does not exist independently in the form of an
article. Many other entities, such as news creators, news subjects, and so on,
exist on social media and have relationships with news articles. Different
entities and relationships can be modeled as a heterogeneous information
network (HIN). In this paper, we attempt to solve the fake news detection
problem with the support of a news-oriented HIN. We propose a novel fake news
detection framework, namely Adversarial Active Learning-based Heterogeneous
Graph Neural Network (AA-HGNN) which employs a novel hierarchical attention
mechanism to perform node representation learning in the HIN. AA-HGNN utilizes
an active learning framework to enhance learning performance, especially when
facing the paucity of labeled data. An adversarial selector will be trained to
query high-value candidates for the active learning framework. When the
adversarial active learning is completed, AA-HGNN detects fake news by
classifying news article nodes. Experiments with two real-world fake news
datasets show that our model can outperform text-based models and other
graph-based models when using less labeled data benefiting from the adversarial
active learning. As a model with generalizability, AA-HGNN also has the ability
to be widely used in other node classification-related applications on
heterogeneous graphs.

Monitoring (SHM) has evolved through multiple eras of development during the
past decades. Nevertheless, there still exists a number of challenges facing
the current state-of-the-art approaches, both in the industry as well as in
research and development, including low damage sensitivity, lack of robustness
to uncertainties, need for user-defined thresholds, and non-uniform response
across a sensor network. In this work, a novel statistical framework is
proposed for active-sensing SHM based on the use of ultrasonic guided waves.
This framework is based on stochastic non-parametric time series models and
their corresponding statistical properties in order to readily provide healthy
confidence bounds and enable accurate and robust damage detection via the use
of appropriate statistical decision making tests. Three such methods and
corresponding statistical quantities (test statistics) along with decision
making schemes are formulated and experimentally assessed via the use of three
coupons with different levels of complexity: an Al plate with a growing notch,
a Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) plate with added weights to simulate
local damages, and the CFRP panel used in the Open Guided Waves project [1],
all fitted with piezoelectric transducers and a pitch-catch configuration. The
performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of state-of-the-art
time-domain damage indices (DIs). The results demonstrate the increased
sensitivity and robustness of the proposed methods, with better tracking
capability of damage evolution compared to conventional approaches, even for
damage-non-intersecting actuator-sensor paths. Overall, the proposed
statistical methods exhibit greater damage sensitivity across different
components, with enhanced robustness to uncertainty, as well as user-friendly
application.

one-dimensional (1D) double-well (DW) potential can exhibit chaotic dynamics
due to the presence of a single impurity. The non-equilibrium dynamics is
triggered by a quench of the impurity-Bose interaction and is illustrated via
the evolution of the population imbalance for the bosons between the two wells.
While the increase of the post-quench interaction strength always facilitates
the irregular motion for the bosonic population imbalance, it becomes regular
again when the impurity is initially populated in the highly excited states.
Such an integrability to chaos (ITC) transition is fully captured by the
transient dynamics of the corresponding linear entanglement entropy, whose
infinite-time averaged value additionally characterizes the edge of the chaos
and implies the existence of an effective Bose-Bose attraction induced by the
impurity. In order to elucidate the physical origin for the observed ITC
transition, we perform a detailed spectral analysis for the mixture with
respect to both the energy spectrum as well as the eigenstates. Specifically,
two distinguished spectral behaviors upon a variation of the interspecies
interaction strength are observed. While the avoided level-crossings take place
in the low-energy spectrum, the energy levels in the high-energy spectrum
possess a band-like structure and are equidistant within each band. This leads
to a significant delocalization of the low-lying eigenvectors which, in turn,
accounts for the chaotic nature of the bosonic dynamics. By contrast, those
highly excited states bear a high resemblance to the non-interacting integrable
basis, which explains for the recovery of the integrability for the bosonic
species. Finally, we discuss the induced Bose-Bose attraction as well as its
impact on the bosonic dynamics.

wireless sensor nodes. To increase spatial reuse and thereby decrease latency,
Harvest performs concurrent, pipelined exfiltration from multiple nodes to a
base station. To this end, it uses a distance-k coloring of the nodes, notably
with a constant number of colors, which yields a TDMA schedule whereby nodes
can communicate concurrently with low packet losses due to collision. This
coloring is based on a randomized CSMA approach which does not exploit location
knowledge. Given a bounded degree of the network, each node waits only O$(1)$
time to obtain a unique color among its distance-k neighbors, in contrast to
the traditional deterministic distributed distance-k vertex coloring wherein
each node waits O$(\Delta^{2})$ time to obtain a color.
  Harvest offers the option of limiting memory use to only a small constant
number of bytes or of improving latency with increased memory use; it can be
used with or without additional mechanisms for reliability of message
forwarding. We experimentally evaluate the performance of Harvest using 51
motes in the Kansei testbed. We also provide theoretical as well as
TOSSIM-based comparison of Harvest with Straw, an extant data collection

mentions into a wide range of entity types (usually hundreds) depending upon
the context. While distant supervision is the most common way to acquire
supervised training data, it brings in label noise, as it assigns type labels
to the entity mentions irrespective of mentions context. In attempts to deal
with the label noise, leading research on the FG-NET assumes that the
fine-grained entity typing data possesses a euclidean nature, which restraints
the ability of the existing models in combating the label noise. Given the fact
that the fine-grained type hierarchy exhibits a hierarchical structure, it
makes hyperbolic space a natural choice to model the FG-NET data. In this
research, we propose FGNET-RH, a novel framework that benefits from the
hyperbolic geometry in combination with the graph structures to perform entity
typing in a performance-enhanced fashion. FGNET-RH initially uses LSTM networks
to encode the mention in relation with its context, later it forms a graph to
distill/refine the mention encodings in the hyperbolic space. Finally, the
refined mention encoding is used for entity typing. Experimentation using
different benchmark datasets shows that FGNET-RH improves the performance on
FG-NET by up to 3.5-% in terms of strict accuracy.

applications in industry and engineering. However, such a wetting transition on
a patterned surface is still not fully understood, e.g., the effects of
electro-wetting number, geometry of the patterned surfaces, and droplet volume
on the transition have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we
propose a theoretical model for the Cassie-Baxter- Wenzel wetting transition
triggered by applying an external voltage on a droplet placed on a
mircopillared surface or a porous substrate. It is found that the transition is
realized by lowering the energy barrier created by the intermediate composite
state considerably, which enables the droplet to cross the energy barrier and
complete the transition process. Our calculations also indicate that for fixed
droplet volume, the critical electrowetting number (voltage) will increase
(decrease) along with the surface roughness for a micro-pillar patterned
(porous) surface, and if the surface roughness is fixed, a small droplet tends
to ease the critical electrowetting condition for the transition. Besides,
three dimensional phase diagrams in terms of electrowetting number, surface
roughness, and droplet volume are constructed to illustrate the
Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition. Our theoretical model can be used to
explain the previous experimental results about the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel

assistance of an x-ray thin-film planar cavity. The emission rate is
accelerated by a factor linearly proportional to the cavity field amplitude,
that can be directly controlled by choosing different cavity modes or changing
the angle offset in experiment. This experimental observation is in good

individual walking patterns from a long distance. At present, most gait
recognition methods use silhouette images to represent a person in each frame.
However, silhouette images can lose fine-grained spatial information, and most
papers do not regard how to obtain these silhouettes in complex scenes.
Furthermore, silhouette images contain not only gait features but also other
visual clues that can be recognized. Hence these approaches can not be
considered as strict gait recognition.
  We leverage recent advances in human pose estimation to estimate robust
skeleton poses directly from RGB images to bring back model-based gait
recognition with a cleaner representation of gait. Thus, we propose GaitGraph
that combines skeleton poses with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to obtain a
modern model-based approach for gait recognition. The main advantages are a
cleaner, more elegant extraction of the gait features and the ability to
incorporate powerful spatio-temporal modeling using GCN. Experiments on the

For a specially chosen (""sweet-spot"") detuning of the off-resonant dressing

dissipation strength increases, the short-time dynamics becomes faster and the
long-time dynamics becomes slower. We also interpret the quantum Zeno effect as
specific initial states that only occupy the Lindblad spectrum around zero, for
which only the broadening energy scale of the Lindblad spectrum matters and
gives rise to suppressed dynamics with stronger dissipation. We illustrate our

and accidents because of its chaotic nature. With the development of connected
and automated vehicle (CAV) technology, cooperative ramp merging has become one
of the popular solutions to this problem. In a mixed traffic situation, CAVs
will not only interact with each other, but also handle complicated situations
with human-driven vehicles involved. In this paper, a game theory-based ramp
merging strategy has been developed for the optimal merging coordination of
CAVs in the mixed traffic, which determines dynamic merging sequence and
corresponding longitudinal/lateral control. This strategy improves the safety
and efficiency of the merging process by ensuring a safe inter-vehicle distance
among the involved vehicles and harmonizing the speed of CAVs in the traffic
stream. To verify the proposed strategy, mixed traffic simulations under
different penetration rates and different congestion levels have been carried
out on an innovative Unity-SUMO integrated platform, which connects a game
engine-based driving simulator with a traffic simulator. This platform allows
the human driver to participate in the simulation, and also equip CAVs with
more realistic sensing systems. In the traffic flow level simulation test,
Unity takes over the sensing and control of all CAVs in the simulation, while
SUMO handles the behavior of all legacy vehicles. The results show that the
average speed of traffic flow can be increased up to 110%, and the fuel
consumption can be reduced up to 77%, respectively.

address the issue of entropy dynamics when an interacting quantum system is
coupled to a non-Markovian environment. We find that at the initial stage, the
entropy always increases linearly matching the Markovian result. When the
system thermalizes with the environment at a sufficiently long time, if the
environment temperature is low and the coupling between system and environment
is weak, then the total thermal entropy is low and the entanglement between
system and environment is also weak, which yields a small system entropy in the
long-time steady state. This manifestation of non-Markovian effects of the
environment forces the entropy to decrease in the later stage, which yields the
Page curve for the entropy dynamics. We argue that this physical scenario
revealed by the exact solution of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model is universally
applicable for general chaotic quantum many-body systems and can be verified

equation with potentials and some nonlinear heat equations with power
nonlinearity of order $p$. The potentials include all the nonnegative ones. For
the first two equations, we prove if $u$ satisfies some growth conditions in
$(x,t)\in \mathrm{M}\times [0,1]$, then $u$ is analytic in time $(0,1]$. Here
$\mathrm{M}$ is $R^d$ or a complete noncompact manifold with Ricci curvature
bounded from below by a constant. Then we obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition such that $u(x,t)$ is analytic in time at $t=0$. Applying this
method, we also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability
of the backward equations, which is ill-posed in general.
  For the nonlinear heat equation with power nonlinearity of order $p$, we
prove that a solution is analytic in time $t\in (0,1]$ if it is bounded in
$\mathrm{M}\times[0,1]$ and $p$ is a positive integer. In addition, we
investigate the case when $p$ is a rational number with a stronger assumption
$0<C_3 \leq |u(x,t)| \leq C_4$. It is also shown that a solution may not be
analytic in time if it is allowed to be $0$. As a lemma, we obtain an estimate
of $\partial_t^k \Gamma(x,t;y)$ where $\Gamma(x,t;y)$ is the heat kernel on a
manifold, with an explicit estimation of the coefficients.
  An interesting point is that a solution may be analytic in time even if it is
not smooth in the space variable $x$, implying that the analyticity of space
and time can be independent. Besides, for general manifolds, space analyticity

contributing towards information and communication technology (ICT)

carefully analyse the different power consumption models and energy efficiency
metrics, which have helped to make progress on the understanding of green

theoretical and a practical viewpoint -- the main energy efficiency enabling
technologies that 3GPP NR provides, together with their main benefits and

massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), lean carrier design, and
advanced idle modes, together with the role of artificial intelligence
capabilities. We dive into their implementation and operational details, and
thoroughly discuss their optimal operation points and theoretical-trade-offs

fundamentals of -- and the status on -- green networking. Finally, the areas of
research where more effort is needed to make future networks greener are also

nuclear mass number A, the same as the energy loss effect. By global fit, the

measured from 3D ultrasound (US) carotid images are sensitive to
anti-atherosclerotic effects of medical/dietary treatments. VWV and VWT
measurements require the lumen-intima (LIB) and media-adventitia boundaries
(MAB) at the common and internal carotid arteries (CCA and ICA). However, most
existing segmentation techniques were capable of automating only CCA
segmentation. An approach capable of segmenting the MAB and LIB from the CCA
and ICA was required to accelerate VWV and VWT quantification. Methods:
Segmentation for CCA and ICA were performed independently using the proposed
two-channel U-Net, which was driven by a novel loss function known as the
adaptive triple Dice loss (ADTL). A test-time augmentation (TTA) approach is
used, in which segmentation was performed three times based on axial images and
its flipped versions; the final segmentation was generated by pixel-wise
majority voting. Results: Experiments involving 224 3DUS volumes produce a
Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 95.1%$\pm$4.1% and 91.6%$\pm$6.6% for the
MAB and LIB, in the CCA, respectively, and 94.2%$\pm$3.3% and 89.0%$\pm$8.1%
for the MAB and LIB, in the ICA, respectively. TTA and ATDL independently
contributed to a statistically significant improvement to all boundaries except
the LIB in ICA. The total time required to segment the entire 3DUS volume
(CCA+ICA) is 1.4s. Conclusion: The proposed two-channel U-Net with ADTL and TTA
can segment the CCA and ICA accurately and efficiently from the 3DUS volume.
Significance: Our approach has the potential to accelerate the transition of
3DUS measurements of carotid atherosclerosis to clinical research.

Delineation of Gross Target Volume (GTV) from medical images such as CT and MRI
images is a prerequisite for radiotherapy. As manual delineation is
time-consuming and laborious, automatic segmentation of GTV has a potential to
improve this process. Currently, most of the deep learning-based automatic
delineation methods of GTV are mainly performed on medical images like CT
images. However, it is challenged by the low contrast between the pathology
regions and surrounding soft tissues, small target region, and anisotropic
resolution of clinical CT images. To deal with these problems, we propose a
2.5D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to handle the difference of inplane and
through-plane resolution. Furthermore, we propose a spatial attention module to
enable the network to focus on small target, and use channel attention to
further improve the segmentation performance. Moreover, we use multi-scale
sampling method for training so that the networks can learn features at
different scales, which are combined with a multi-model ensemble method to
improve the robustness of segmentation results. We also estimate the
uncertainty of segmentation results based on our model ensemble, which is of
great importance for indicating the reliability of automatic segmentation

of non smooth functions. There are many studies presenting optimality
conditions for unconstrained and constrained cases. One can observe that
optimality conditions in terms of both proper and adjoint exhausters are
related to all elements of the exhausters.
  Moreover, in the constrained case the conditions that must be provided for a
particular cone determined by constraint set and the point (to be checked
whether it is optimal) are rather challenging to check. Thus it is advantageous
to reduce the number of sets in the exhauster for constrained case.
  In this work, we first consider constrained optimization problems and deal
with the problem of reducing generalized exhausters of the directional
derivative of the objective function. We present some results to reduce
generalized lower (upper) exhausters by using set order relations
$\preceq^{m_1}$ and $\preceq^{m_2}$, respectively. Furthermore, we show that a
generalized exhauster $E$ can be reduced to the set of minimal elements of $E$
with respect to $\preceq^{m_1}$ or $\preceq^{m_2}$.
  Then considering unconstrained optimization problems, lower exhausters are
reduced by using cones.

role in machine intelligence. The taxonomy expansion task aims to find a
position for a new term in an existing taxonomy to capture the emerging
knowledge in the world and keep the taxonomy dynamically updated. Previous
taxonomy expansion solutions neglect valuable information brought by the
hierarchical structure and evaluate the correctness of merely an added edge,
which downgrade the problem to node-pair scoring or mini-path classification.
In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy Expansion Framework (HEF), which fully
exploits the hierarchical structure's properties to maximize the coherence of
expanded taxonomy. HEF makes use of taxonomy's hierarchical structure in
multiple aspects: i) HEF utilizes subtrees containing most relevant nodes as
self-supervision data for a complete comparison of parental and sibling
relations; ii) HEF adopts a coherence modeling module to evaluate the coherence
of a taxonomy's subtree by integrating hypernymy relation detection and several
tree-exclusive features; iii) HEF introduces the Fitting Score for position
selection, which explicitly evaluates both path and level selections and takes
full advantage of parental relations to interchange information for
disambiguation and self-correction. Extensive experiments show that by better
exploiting the hierarchical structure and optimizing taxonomy's coherence, HEF
vastly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets by an
average improvement of 46.7% in accuracy and 32.3% in mean reciprocal rank.

the eventual outcome of a given participant is linear in its weight. Previous
work used sampling with replacement to construct a fair voting scheme. However,
it was shown that using greedy sampling, i.e., sampling with replacement until
a given number of distinct elements is chosen, turns out to be more robust and

especially in the light of the interpretation of Bardarson's theorem: ""in the
presence of time reversal symmetry and for half-integral spin the transmission
eigenvalues of the two terminal scattering matrix come in (Kramers) degenerate
pairs"". The authors of the comment first propose an ansatz for the wave
function in the spin active region and go on to show that the resulting
transmission does not show spin dependence, reasoning that spin dependence
would violate Bardarson's assertion. Here we clearly show that the ansatz
presented assumes spin-momentum independence from the outset and thus just
addresses the spinless particle problem. We then find the appropriate
eigenfunction contemplating spin-momentum coupling and show that the resulting
spectrum obeys Bardarson's theorem. Finally we show that the allowed
wavevectors are the ones assumed in the original paper and thus the original
conclusions follow. We recognize that the Hamiltonian in our paper written in
local coordinates on a helix was deceptively simple and offer the expressions
of how it should be written to more overtly convey the physics involved. The
relation between spin polarization and torque becomes clear, as described in
our paper. This response is a very important clarification in relation to the
implications of Bardarson's theorem concerning the possibility of spin
polarization in one dimensional systems in the linear regime.

decoupled. We compare, for a sigmoid benefit function, the conditions for

propose a complete and undetected eavesdropping attack, named passive frequency
shift attack, on sending or not-sending (SNS) TF-QKD protocol given any
difference between signal and decoy states in frequency domain which can be
extended to other imperfections with distinguishable decoy states. We analyze
this attack by giving the formula of upper bound of real secure key rate and
comparing it with lower bound of secret key rate under Alice and Bob's
estimation with the consideration of actively odd-parity pairing (AOPP) method

provides tools for assessing the size and connectivity of the legal system as

tracking the evolution of individual legal documents over time. Implementing
the framework for our dataset, we find that at the federal level, the United

German legal system remains governed by statutes. This holds regardless of
whether we measure the systems at the macro, the meso, or the micro level.

the development of a suitable steady-state mathematical model of FACTS devices
is a key issue. The Fast and Flexible Holomorphic Embedding (FFHE) method
converges faster and provides the flexibility to use any state as an initial
guess. But to investigate the effect and ability of FACTS devices using FFHE
technique, it is necessary to develop an embedded system for these devices.
Therefore, this paper presents an FFHE-based embedded system for VSC-based
FACTS controllers, such as SSSC and IPFC. The embedded system is also proposed
for their controlling modes.
  The introduced embedded system is flexible which allows to take any state as
an initial guess instead of fixed state, which leads towards the reduced
runtime and decreases the required number of terms, as compared to standard
HELM. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability, the proposed
FFHE-based models of FACTS devices have been tested for several cases. Further,
the developed recursive formulas for power balance equations, devices' physical
constraints, and their controlling modes are thoroughly investigated and
examined. From several tests, it is found that the proposed FFHE-based FACTS
models require less execution time and reduce the error at higher rate.

The bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels, and M users aim to access
the spectrum. Each user chooses a single channel for transmission at each time
slot. The state of each channel is modeled by a restless unknown Markovian
process. Previous studies have analyzed a special case of this setting, in
which each channel yields the same expected rate for all users. By contrast, we
consider a more general and practical model, where each channel yields a
different expected rate for each user. This model adds a significant challenge
of how to efficiently learn a channel allocation in a distributed manner to
yield a global system-wide objective. We adopt the stable matching utility as
the system objective, which is known to yield strong performance in
multichannel wireless networks, and develop a novel Distributed Stable Strategy
Learning (DSSL) algorithm to achieve the objective. We prove theoretically that
DSSL converges to the stable matching allocation, and the regret, defined as
the loss in total rate with respect to the stable matching solution, has a
logarithmic order with time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the strong
performance of the DSSL algorithm.

called positives, in a large population of items via tests. A test is an action
on a subset of items which returns positive if the subset contains at least one
positive and negative otherwise. In non-adaptive group testing, all tests are
fixed in advance and can be performed in parallel. In this work, we consider
non-adaptive group testing with consecutive positives in which the items are
linearly ordered and the positives are consecutive in that order.
  We present two contributions here. The first is the direct use of a binary
code to construct measurement matrices compared to the use of Gray code in the
state-of-the-art work, which is a rearrangement of the binary code, when the
maximum number of consecutive positives is known. This leads to a reduction in
decoding time in practice. The second one is efficient designs to identify
positives when the number of consecutive positives is known. To the best of our
knowledge, this setting has not been surveyed yet. Our simulations verify the
efficiency of our proposed designs. In particular, it only requires up to $300$
tests to identify up to $100$ positives in a set of $2^{32} \approx
4.3\mathrm{B}$ items in less than $300$ nanoseconds. When the maximum number of
consecutive positives is known, the simulations validate the superiority of our
proposed design in decoding compared to the state-of-the-art work. Moreover,

decoding time are almost reduced half.

problems with discounted stage cost are of great interest. In contrast to
non-discounted optimal control problems, it is more likely that several
asymptotically stable optimal equilibria coexist. Due to the discounting and
transition cost from a local to the global equilibrium, it may be more
favourable staying in a local equilibrium than moving to the global - cheaper -
equilibrium. In the literature, strict dissipativity was shown to provide
criteria for global asymptotic stability of optimal equilibria and turnpike
behavior. In this paper, we propose a local notion of discounted strict
dissipativity and a local turnpike property, both depending on the discount
factor. Using these concepts, we investigate the local behaviour of
(near-)optimal trajectories and develop conditions on the discount factor to
ensure convergence to a local asymptotically stable optimal equilibrium.

penny-shaped fracture. The behaviour of the slurry flow is investigated in two
phases: pressurised injection and elastic closure. During injection the slurry
is modelled using a frictional rheology that takes into account the
shear-induced migration and jamming of the proppants. Making pragmatic
assumptions of negligible toughness and cross-fracture fluid slip, we find
self-similar solutions supporting a range of proppant concentration profiles.
In particular, we define an effective viscosity, which equates the fracture
evolution of a slurry flow with a given proppant volume fraction, to a
Newtonian flow with a particular viscosity. Using this framework, we are able
to make predictions about the geometry of the growing fracture and the
significance of tip screen-out. In the closure phase, proppants are modelled as
incompressible and radially immobile within the narrowing fracture. The effects
of proppant concentration on the geometry of the residual propped fracture are
explored in full. The results have important applications to industrial
fracking and geological dike formation by hot, intruding magma.

  System Design",,,,,"cs.SE cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Formal methods and supporting tools have a long record of success in the
development of safety-critical systems. However, no single tool has emerged as
the dominant solution for system design. Each tool differs from the others in
terms of the modeling language used, its verification capabilities and other
complementary features, and each development context has peculiar needs that
require different tools. This is particularly problematic for the railway
industry, in which formal methods are highly recommended by the norms, but no
actual guidance is provided for the selection of tools. To guide companies in
the selection of the most appropriate formal tools to adopt in their contexts,
a clear assessment of the features of the currently available tools is
required.
  To address this goal, this paper considers a set of 13 formal tools that have
been used for railway system design, and it presents a systematic evaluation of
such tools and a preliminary usability analysis of a subset of 7 tools,
involving railway practitioners. The results are discussed considering the most
desired aspects by industry and earlier related studies. While the focus is on
the railway domain, the overall methodology can be applied to similar contexts.
Our study thus contributes with a systematic evaluation of formal tools and it
shows that despite the poor graphical interfaces, usability and maturity of the
tools are not major problems, as claimed by contributions from the literature.
Instead, support for process integration is the most relevant obstacle for the
adoption of most of the tools.

With a generalized lifting scheme as coupling layers, a factor-out layer

different levels, thus extending traditional linear wavelet transformations to
learnable non-linear deep learning models. In this paper, a way of building

up to 42 the number of disks of the region with measured CO and dust sizes
($R_{\mathrm{CO}}$, $R_{\mathrm{dust}}$) from observations with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The sizes are obtained from
modeling the ${^{12}}$CO $J = 2-1$ line emission and continuum emission at
$\sim 0.89$ mm with an empirical function (Nuker profile or Gaussian function).
The CO emission is more extended than the dust continuum, with a
$R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{CO}}$/$R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{dust}}$ median value of 2.5, for
the entire population and for a sub-sample with high completeness. 6 disks,
around $15\%$ of the Lupus disk population have a size ratio above 4. Based on
thermo-chemical modeling, this value can only be explained if the disk has
undergone grain growth and radial drift. These disks do not have unusual
properties in terms of stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), disk mass
($M_{\mathrm{disk}}$), CO and dust sizes ($R_{\mathrm{CO}}$,
$R_{\mathrm{dust}}$), and mass accretion. We search for correlations between
the size ratio and $M_{\star}$, $M_{\mathrm{disk}}$, $R_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and
$R_{\mathrm{dust}}$: only a weak monotonic anti-correlation with the
$R_{\mathrm{dust}}$ is found. The lack of strong correlations is remarkable and
suggests that the bulk of the population may be in a similar evolutionary
stage, independent of the stellar and disk properties. These results should be
further investigated, since the optical depth difference between CO and dust
continuum may play a role in the inferred size ratios. Lastly, the CO emission
for the majority of the disks is consistent with optically thick emission and
an average CO temperature of around 30 K.

common method to resolve Doppler ambiguities caused by fast-moving targets.
Another issue concerning high-velocity targets is related to the loss in the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after performing range compression. In particular,
this loss can be partially mitigated by the use of subpulse processing (SP).
Modern radars combine these techniques in order to reliably unfold the target
velocity. However, the presence of background noise may compromise the Doppler
estimates. Hence, a rigorous statistical analysis is imperative. In this work,
we provide a comprehensive analysis on Doppler estimation. In particular, we
derive novel closed-form expressions for the probability of detection (PD) and
probability of false alarm (PFA). To this end, we consider the newly introduce
SP along with the CCRT. A comparison analysis between SP and the classic pulse
processing (PP) technique is also carried out. Numerical results and
Monte-Carlo simulations corroborate the validity of our expressions and show
that the SP-plus-CCRT technique helps to greatly reduce the PFA compared to
previous studies, thereby improving radar detection.

magnetic reconnection in the deep solar atmosphere in active regions and quiet
Sun. They are often found in regions where opposite magnetic polarities are in
close proximity. Recent high resolution observations suggest that Ellerman
bombs are more prevalent than thought before. We aim to determine the
occurrence of Ellerman bombs in the penumbra of sunspots. We analyze high
spatial resolution observations of sunspots in the Balmer H-alpha and H-beta
lines as well as auxiliary continuum channels obtained with the Swedish 1-m
Solar Telescope and apply the k-means clustering technique to systematically
detect and characterize Ellerman Bombs. Features with all the defining
characteristics of Ellerman bombs are found in large numbers over the entire
penumbra. The true prevalence of these events is only fully appreciated in the
H-beta line due to highest spatial resolution and lower chromospheric opacity.
We find that the penumbra hosts some of the highest Ellerman bomb densities,
only surpassed by the moat in the immediate surroundings of the sunspot. Some
penumbral Ellerman bombs show flame morphology and rapid dynamical evolution.
Many penumbral Ellerman bombs are fast moving with typical speed of 3.7 km/s
and sometimes more than 10 km/s. Many penumbral Ellerman bombs migrate from the
inner to the outer penumbra over hundreds of km and some continue moving beyond
the outer penumbral boundary into the moat. Many penumbral Ellerman bombs are
found in the vicinity of regions with opposite magnetic polarity. We conclude
that reconnection is a near continuous process in the low atmosphere of the
penumbra of sunspots as manifest in the form of penumbral Ellerman bombs. These
are so prevalent that they may be a major sink of sunspot magnetic energy.

what is commonly studied in the literature on null controllability (where one
drives a generic state $x$ into the equilibrium state $\bar x=0$).
Consequently, the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) associated to this problem
is non-standard since the sign of the linear part is opposite to the usual one
and since it is intrinsically unbounded. Hence the standard theory of AREs does
not apply. The analogous finite horizon problem has been studied in the

the original code into two shorter RM codes with different rates. In contrast
to the standard approach which decodes the lower-rate code first, the method in
this paper decodes the higher-rate code first. This modification enables an
efficient permutation-based decoding technique, with permutations being
selected on the fly from the automorphism group of the code using soft
information from a channel. Simulation results show that the error-rate
performance of the proposed algorithms, enhanced by a permutation selection
technique, is close to that of the automorphism-based recursive decoding
algorithm with similar complexity for short RM codes, while our decoders
perform better for longer RM codes. In particular, it is demonstrated that the
proposed algorithms achieve near-ML performance for short RM codes and for RM

in time through an exceptional point, defects are produced in much the same way
as approaching a Hermitian critical point. A generalized Kibble--Zurek scaling
accounted for the ensuing scaling of the defect density in terms of the speed
of the drive and the corresponding critical exponents. Here we extend this
setting by adding the recycling term and considering the full Lindbladian time
evolution of the problem with quantum jumps. We find that by linearly ramping
up the environmental coupling in time, and going beyond the steady-state
solution of the Liouvillian, the defect density scales linearly with the speed
of the drive for all cases. This scaling is unaffected by the presence of
exceptional points of the Liouvillian, which can show up in the transient

the defect density is determined exactly from a set of algebraic equations. Our
study indicates the distinct sensitivity of the Lindbladian time evolution to

pitfalls: 1) instead of tracking each skill through time, DKT is more likely to
learn an `ability' model; 2) the recurrent nature of DKT reinforces irrelevant
information that it uses during the tracking task; 3) an untrained recurrent
network can achieve similar results to a trained DKT model, supporting a
conclusion that recurrence relations are not properly learned and, instead,
improvements are simply a benefit of projection into a high dimensional, sparse

  This paper proposes two new indices for analysing message propagation in

the message, dividing the nodes into launchers and non-launchers. The second
index addresses the potential of each member as a receiver (target) of the
message, dividing the nodes into targets and non-targets. Launcher individuals
should indicate strong influencers and target individuals should identify the
best target consumers. These indices can assist other known metrics when used
to select efficient influencers in a social network. For instance, instead of
choosing a strong and probably expensive member according to its degree in the
network (number of followers), we may previously select those belonging to the
launchers group and look for the lowest degree members, which are probably
cheaper but still guarantying almost the same influence effectiveness as the
largest degree members.
  On a different direction, using the second index, the strong target members
should characterize relevant consumers of information in the network, which may

extended the Bloch Theory which was restrict until now to crystals (periodic

Results in the literature suggest this point-like source is likely a massive
progenitor of 60-80 M$_{\odot}$, depending on if the source is a binary, a
single star, or a compact cluster. Using new photometric and spectral data
collected for 200 days, including several nebular spectra, we generate a
consistent model covering the photospheric and nebular phase using a Monte
Carlo radiation transport code. Photospheric phase modelling finds an ejected
mass 1.2-2.0 M$_{\odot}$ with an $E_\mathrm{k}$ of $\sim(0.9 \pm0.2)\times
10^{51}$ erg, with approximately 1 M$_{\odot}$ of material below 5000 km

modelling suggests a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.08-0.1 M$_{\odot}$. Modelling the
[\OI] emission feature in the nebular spectra suggests the innermost ejecta is
asymmetric. The modelling results favour a low mass progenitor of to 16-20
M$_{\odot}$, which is in disagreement with the pre-supernova derived high mass

enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture

consecutive time slots, it is challenging to unveil the connection between the
activity pattern estimated previously, which is imperfect but the only
available side information (SI), and the true activity pattern at the current

this challenge under the framework of approximate message passing (AMP).
Specifically, thanks to the state evolution, the correlation between the

Based on the well-defined temporal correlation, we further manage to embed this
useful SI into the design of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoisers

attractive for its simplicity, but applications are limited due to a lack of
robust methods for its control. A central challenge is to arrest phase
separation at the desired length scale. Here, we show that solid-state

softened with a second monomer. During its polymerization, the two polymers
become immiscible and phase separate. As free monomer is depleted, the host

the fluid forces acting on the two bodies. We show that these forces are linear
combinations of the {\textcolor{black}{cylinder accelerations}} and velocities,
through viscous fluid added coefficients. {\textcolor{black}{To assess the
validity of this theory, we consider the case of two equal size cylinders, one
of them being stationary while the other one is forced sinusoidally}}. The
self-added mass and damping coefficients are shown to decrease with both the
Stokes number and the separation distance. The cross-added mass and damping
coefficients tend to increase with the Stokes number and the separation
distance. Compared to the inviscid results, the effect of viscosity is to add a
correction term which scales as $Sk^{-1/2}$. When the separation distance is
sufficiently large, the two cylinders behave as if they were independent and
the Stokes predictions for an isolated cylinder are recovered. Compared to
previous works, the present theory offers a simple and flexible alternative for
an easy determination of the fluid forces and related added coefficients. To
our knowledge, this is also the first time that a numerical approach based on a
penalization method is presented in the context of fluid-structure interactions

network parameters or features based on the pre-defined importance during

nets are neural networks whose architectures can be adjusted instantly during
testing time, e.g., based on computational constraints. The nested dropout
implicitly ranks the network parameters, generating a set of sub-networks such
that any smaller sub-network forms the basis of a larger one. II. Learning
ordered representation: the nested dropout applied to the latent representation
of a generative model (e.g., auto-encoder) ranks the features, enforcing
explicit order of the dense representation over dimensions.
  However, the dropout rate is fixed as a hyper-parameter during the whole
training process. For nested nets, when network parameters are removed, the
performance decays in a human-specified trajectory rather than in a trajectory
learned from data. For generative models, the importance of features is
specified as a constant vector, restraining the flexibility of representation
learning. To address the problem, we focus on the probabilistic counterpart of
the nested dropout. We propose a variational nested dropout (VND) operation
that draws samples of multi-dimensional ordered masks at a low cost, providing
useful gradients to the parameters of nested dropout. Based on this approach,
we design a Bayesian nested neural network that learns the order knowledge of
the parameter distributions. We further exploit the VND under different

show that the proposed approach outperforms the nested network in terms of

often suffers from data shift, i.e., samples in different tasks, even in the

few-shot learning approaches are not designed with the consideration of data
shift, and thus show downgraded performance when data distribution shifts.
However, it is non-trivial to address the data shift problem in few-shot

the Reynolds number. The appearance of an entropy structure consisting of a
well-mixed uniform interior, bounded by thin layers with entropy jumps across
them, makes it possible to derive explicit forms for these scaling laws. These
are given in terms of the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, and the bottom
to top temperature ratio, which measures how stratified the layer is. The top
and bottom boundary layers are examined and they are found to be very
different, unlike in the Boussinesq case. Elucidating the structure of these
boundary layers plays a crucial part in determining the scaling laws. Physical
arguments governing these boundary layers are presented, concentrating on the
case in which the boundary layers are thin even when the stratification is
large, the incompressible boundary layer case. Different scaling laws are
found, depending on whether the viscous dissipation is primarily in the
boundary layers or in the bulk. The cases of both high and low Prandtl number
are considered. Numerical simulations of no-slip anelastic convection up to a
Rayleigh number of $10^7$ have been performed and our theoretical predictions
are compared with the numerical results.

Nowadays, the majority of automatic decision making systems are based on data.

method of data annotation based on Bayesian statistical inference that aims to
warn about the risk of discriminatory results of a given data set. In
particular, our method aims to deepen knowledge and promote awareness about the
sampling practices employed to create the training set, highlighting that the

by the structure of the data available. We empirically test our system on three

control the contribution of photometric error and emission lines to total flux,
we develop a PCA-based stochastic mock catalogue generation technique that
allows for generating infinite signal-to-noise ratio model spectra with
realistic emission lines on top of theoretical stellar continua. Instead of
running the computationally expensive stellar population synthesis and nebular
emission codes, our algorithm generates realistic spectra with a statistical
approach, and - as an alternative to attempting to constrain the priors on

Hence, it can be used to match the luminosity, colour, emission line and
photometric error distribution of any photometric sample with sufficient
flux-calibrated spectroscopic follow-up. We test three simple empirical
photometric estimation methods and compare the results with and without
photometric noise and strong emission lines. While photometric noise clearly
dominates the uncertainty of photometric redshift estimates, the key findings
are that emission lines play a significant role in resolving colour space
degeneracies and good spectroscopic coverage of the entire colour space is
necessary to achieve good results with empirical photo-z methods. Template
fitting methods, on the other hand, must use a template set with sufficient
variation in emission line strengths and ratios, or even better, first estimate
the redshift empirically and fit the colours with templates at the best-fit
redshift to calculate the K-correction and various physical parameters.

NaI(Tl) crystals in the COSINE-100 experiment that is located in the Yangyang
underground laboratory. The model includes background contributions from both
internal and external sources, including cosmogenic radionuclides and surface
$^{210}$Pb contamination. To build the model in the low energy region, with a
threshold of 1 keV, we used a depth profile of $^{210}$Pb contamination in the
surface of the NaI(Tl) crystals determined in a comparison between measured and
simulated spectra. We also considered the effect of the energy scale errors
propagated from the statistical uncertainties and the nonlinear detector
response at low energies. The 1.7 years COSINE-100 data taken between October
21, 2016 and July 18, 2018 were used for this analysis. Our Monte Carlo
simulation provides a non-Gaussian peak around 50 keV originating from beta
decays of bulk $^{210}$Pb in a good agreement with the measured background.
This model estimates that the activities of bulk $^{210}$Pb and $^{3}$H are
dominating the background rate that amounts to an average level of
2.85$\pm$0.15 counts/day/keV/kg in the energy region of (1-6) keV, using
COSINE-100 data with a total exposure of 97.7 kg$\cdot$years.

alongside a guiding wave. For this, the Bohmian model makes use of a unique
quantum potential which governs the trajectory of the particle. In this work we
show that this interpretation of quantum theory naturally leads to the
derivation of interesting new phenomena. Specifically, we demonstrate how the
fundamental Casimir-Polder force, by which atoms are attracted to a surface,
may be temporarily suppressed by utilizing a specially designed quantum
potential. We show that when harnessing the quantum potential via a suitable
atomic wavepacket engineering, the absorption by the surface can be
dramatically reduced. This is proven both analytically and numerically.
Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed for achieving the required shape
for the atomic wavepacket. All these may enable new insights into Bohmian

  Surprisingly, very high fidelity of reconstruction is obtained using random

2019 presidential election in Argentina which has led to a major market
collapse in that country. Analysis of the raw and re-weighted data from
longitudinal surveys performed before and after the elections reveals clear
biases (beyond well-known low-response rates) related to mis-representation of
the population and, most importantly, to social-desirability biases, i.e., the
tendency of respondents to hide their intention to vote for controversial
candidates. We then propose a longitudinal opinion tracking method based on
big-data analytics from social media, machine learning, and network theory that
overcomes the limits of traditional polls. The model achieves accurate results
in the 2019 Argentina elections predicting the overwhelming victory of the
candidate Alberto Fern\'andez over the president Mauricio Macri; a result that
none of the traditional pollsters in the country was able to predict. Beyond
predicting political elections, the framework we propose is more general and

accurately extracting system parameters from a detected EMRI waveform will
require self-force calculations at second order in perturbation theory, which
are still in a nascent stage. One major obstacle in these calculations is the
strong divergences that are encountered on the worldline of the small object.
Previously, it was shown by one of us [Phys. Rev. D 95, 104056 (2017)] that a
class of ""highly regular"" gauges exist in which the singularities have a
qualitatively milder form, promising to enable more efficient numerical
calculations. Here we derive expressions for the metric perturbation in this
class of gauges, in a local expansion in powers of distance $r$ from the
worldline, to sufficient order in $r$ for numerical implementation in a
puncture scheme. Additionally, we use the highly regular class to rigorously
derive a distributional source for the second-order field and a pointlike
second-order stress-energy tensor (the Detweiler stress-energy) for the small
object. This makes it possible to calculate the second-order self-force using
mode-sum regularisation rather than the more cumbersome puncture schemes that
have been necessary previously. Although motivated by EMRIs, our calculations
are valid in an arbitrary vacuum background, and they may help clarify the
interpretation of point masses and skeleton sources in general relativity more
broadly.

on interacting network to characterize the opinion formation process among
participating social actors, such as information flow, cooperative and
antagonistic influence, etc. Nevertheless, interacting networks are generally
public for social groups, as well as other individuals who may be interested
in. This blocks a more precise interpretation of the opinion formation process
since social actors always have complex feeling, motivation and behavior, even
beliefs that are personally private. In this paper, we formulate a general
configuration on describing how individual's opinion evolves in a distinct
fashion. It consists of two functional networks: interacting network and
appraisal network. Interacting network inherits the operational properties as
DeGroot iterative opinion pooling scheme while appraisal network, forming a
belief system, quantifies certain cognitive orientation to interested
individuals' beliefs, over which the adhered attitudes may have the potential
to be antagonistic. We explicitly show that cooperative appraisal network
always leads to consensus in opinions. Antagonistic appraisal network, however,
causes opinion cluster. It is verified that antagonistic appraisal network
affords to guarantee consensus by imposing some extra restrictions. They hence
bridge a gap between the consensus and the clusters in opinion dynamics. We
further attain a gauge on the appraisal network by means of the random convex
optimization approach. Moreover, we extend our results to the case of mutually
interdependent issues.

correlations. The calculated phonon spectrum shows that the system is
thermodynamically stable unlike other Co halides. We apply two well-known
methods for the estimation of the Curie temperature. First, we do DFT+U
calculations to calculate exchange couplings, which are subsequently used in a
classical Monte Carlo simulation of the resulting Ising spin model. The
transition temperature calculated in this way is in the order of 100 K, but
shows a strong dependence on the choice of interaction parameters. Second, we
apply dynamical mean-field theory to calculate the correlated electronic
structure and estimate the transition temperature.This results in a similar
estimate for a noticeable transition temperature of approximately 100
K,however, without the strong dependence on the interaction parameters. The
effect of electron-electron interactions are strongly orbital selective, with
only moderate correlations in the three low-lying orbitals (one doublet plus
one singlet), and strong correlations in the doublet at higher energy. This can
be traced back to the electronic occupation in DMFT, with five electrons in the
three low-lying orbitals and two electrons in the high-energy doublet, making
the latter one half-filled. Nevertheless, the overall spectral gap is governed
by the small gap originating from the low-lying doublet+singlet orbitals, which
changes very weakly with interaction U. In that sense,the system is close to a
Mott metal-to-insulator transition, which has been shown previously to be a
hot-spot for strong magnetism.

rapid development of new generation mobile network technologies that are

example, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by
exploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication
services are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated
areas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial
Communication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN
aims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating
broadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As
terrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between
3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to
8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and
challenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial
networks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more
congestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum
management techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique
to improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing
of ISTCN. In essence, NOMA technology improves spectrum efficiency by allowing
different users to transmit on the same carrier and distinguishing users by
user power levels while CR technology improves spectrum efficiency through
dynamic spectrum sharing. Furthermore, some open researches and challenges in
ISTCN will be discussed.

promoted the detection of tens of thousands of stellar rotation periods.
However, these periods are not found to an equal extent among different
spectral types. Interestingly, early G-type stars with near-solar rotation
periods are strongly underrepresented among those stars with known rotation
periods. In this study we investigate whether the small number of such stars
can be explained by difficulties in the period determination from photometric
time series. For that purpose, we generate model light curves of early G-type
stars with solar rotation periods for different inclination angles,
metallicities and (magnitude-dependent) noise levels. We find that the
detectability is determined by the predominant type of activity (i.e. spot or
faculae domination) on the surface, which defines the degree of irregularity of
the light curve, and further depends on the level of photometric noise. These
two effects significantly complicate the period detection and explain the lack
of solar-like stars with known near-solar rotation periods. We conclude that
the rotation periods of the majority of solar-like stars with near-solar
rotation periods remain undetected to date. Finally, we promote the use of new
techniques to recover more periods of near-solar rotators.

overlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the
specific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in
various business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result
in domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model
to work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to
handle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive
Recommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of
the shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared
parameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the
domain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined
prediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its
parameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result
from production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.
Since 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of

solving robust optimization and adversarial training using online learning
methods. While one of the classical setups in online learning deals with the

causing confusion in applying results and insights from online learning.
Specifically, there are two fundamentally different types of adversaries,
depending on whether the ""adversary"" is able to anticipate the exogenous
randomness of the online learning algorithms. This is particularly relevant to
robust optimization and adversarial training because the adversarial sequences
are often anticipative, and many online learning algorithms do not achieve
diminishing regret in such a case.
  We then apply this to solving robust optimization problems or (equivalently)
adversarial training problems via online learning and establish a general

players play against each other, the primal player playing the decisions and
the dual player playing realizations of uncertain data. When the game
terminates, the primal player has obtained an approximately robust solution.

spectro-polarimeters, such as Hinode/SP or DKIST/ViSP. The procedure is based
on artificial neural networks trained with profiles generated from random
atmospheric stratifications for a high generalization capability. When applied
to Hinode data we find a hot fine-scale network structure whose morphology
changes with height. In the middle layers this network resembles what is
observed in G-band filtergrams but it is not identical. Surprisingly, the
temperature enhancements in the middle and upper photosphere have a reversed
pattern. Hot pixels in the middle photosphere, possibly associated to
small-scale magnetic elements, appear cool at the log(tau_500)=-3 and -4 level,
and viceversa. Finally, we find hot arcs on the limb side of magnetic pores,
which we interpret as the first direct observational evidence of the ""hot wall""
effect in temperature.

associated with the Grushin operator defined by the canonical almost-Riemannian
structure on the 2-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^2$. This is the natural
generalization of the Grushin operator $\mathcal G = \partial_x^2 +
x^2\partial_y^2$ on $\mathbb R^2$ to this curved setting, and presents a
degeneracy at the equator of $\mathbb S^2$.
  We prove that the null controllability is verified in large time when the
control acts as a source term distributed on a subset $\bar{\omega} = \{
(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb S^2\mid \alpha<|x_3|<\beta \}$ for some
$0\le\alpha<\beta\le 1$. More precisely, we show the existence of a positive
time $T^{*}>0$ such that the system is null controllable from $\bar{\omega}$ in
any time $T\ge T^{*}$, and that the minimal time of control from $\bar{\omega}$
satisfies $T_{min}\ge\log(1/\sqrt{1-\alpha^2})$. Here, the lower bound
corresponds to the Agmon distance of $\bar{\omega}$ from the equator.
  These results are obtained by proving a suitable Carleman estimate by using
unitary transformations and Hardy-Poincar\'e type inequalities to show the
positive null-controllability result. The negative statement is proved by
exploiting an appropriate family of spherical harmonics, which concentrates at
the equator, to falsify the uniform observability inequality.

collimating jets/outflows. It was found that advection of external field by a
geometrically thin disk is rather inefficient, while the external weak field
may be dragged inwards by fast radially moving tenuous or/and hot gas above the
thin disk. We investigate the field advection in a thin (cold) accretion disk
covered with hot corona, in which turbulence is responsible for the angular
momentum transfer of the gas in the disk and corona. The radial velocity of the
gas in the corona is significantly higher than that in the thin disk. Our
calculations show that the external magnetic flux is efficiently transported
inwards by the corona, and the field line is strongly inclined towards the disk
surface, which help launching outflows. The field configurations are consistent
with those observed in the numerical simulations. The strength of the field is
substantially enhanced in the inner region of the disk (usually several orders
of magnitude higher than the external field strength), which is able to drive a
fraction of gas in the corona into outflows. This mechanism may be useful in
explaining the observational features in X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. Our results may help understanding the physics of the
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.

of the disease is caused by the movements of birds and mosquitoes. While the

developed here in this work. This work enables the controlling of robotic arms
motion only with visual inputs, that is, controlling by showing the videos of
correct movements. This work can broadly be sub-divided into two segments. The
first part of this work is to develop an unsupervised vision-based method to
control robotic arm in 2-D plane, and the second one is with deep CNN in the
same task in 3-D plane. The first method is unsupervised, where our aim is to
perform mimicking of human arm motion in real-time by a manipulator. We
developed a network, namely the vision-to-motion optical network (DON), where
the input should be a video stream containing hand movements of human, the the
output would be out the velocity and torque information of the hand movements
shown in the videos. The output information of the DON is then fed to the
robotic arm by enabling it to generate motion according to the real hand
videos. The method has been tested with both live-stream video feed as well as
on recorded video obtained from a monocular camera even by intelligently
predicting the trajectory of human hand hand when it gets occluded. This is why
the mimicry of the arm incorporates some intelligence to it and becomes
intelligent mimic (i-mimic). Alongside the unsupervised method another method
has also been developed deploying the deep neural network technique with CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the mimicking, where labelled
datasets are used for training. The same dataset, as used in the unsupervised
DON-based method, is used in the deep CNN method, after manual annotations.
Both the proposed methods are validated with off-line as well as with on-line
video datasets in real-time. The entire methodology is validated with real-time
1-link and simulated n-link manipulators alongwith suitable comparisons.

adversarial artifacts in the physical world that indirectly cause the addition

image-dependent adversarial attacks. However, tailoring adversarial training to
universal patches is computationally expensive since the optimal universal
patch depends on the model weights which change during training. We propose
meta adversarial training (MAT), a novel combination of adversarial training
with meta-learning, which overcomes this challenge by meta-learning universal
patches along with model training. MAT requires little extra computation while
continuously adapting a large set of patches to the current model. MAT
considerably increases robustness against universal patch attacks on image
classification and traffic-light detection.

fundamental groups by using Hurewicz fibrations with the unique path-lifting
property (lifting spaces for short) as a replacement for covering spaces. In
particular, we consider the inverse limit of a sequence of covering spaces of
$X$. It is known that the path-connectivity of the inverse limit can be
expressed by means of the derived inverse limit functor $\varprojlim^1$, which
is, however, notoriously difficult to compute when the $\pi_1(X)$ is
uncountable.To circumvent this difficulty, we express the set of
path-components of the inverse limit, $\widehat X$, in terms of the functors
$\varprojlim$ and $\varprojlim^1$ applied to sequences of countable groups
arising from polyhedral approximations of $X$.
  A consequence of our computation is that path-connectedness of lifting space
implies that $\pi_1(\tilde X)$ supplements $\pi_1(X)$ in $\check\pi_1(X)$ where
$\check\pi_1(X)$ is the inverse limit of fundamental groups of polyhedral
approximations of $X$. As an application we show that $\mathcal G\cdot

inverse of the energy curvature as a function of electron number, and as such
there appears a conflict with the fundamental principle of piecewise linearity
in DFT that requires the energy curvature to be zero at fractional electron

the local density of states, and the Fukui potential. We find that the

issues arise. This article focuses on the responsibility of agents who decide
on our behalf. We investigate the empirically accessible question of whether
the production of moral outcomes by an agent is systematically judged
differently when the agent is artificial and not human. The results of a
laboratory experiment suggest that decision-makers can actually rid themselves
of guilt more easily by delegating to machines than by delegating to other
people. Our results imply that the availability of artificial agents could
provide stronger incentives for decision makers to delegate morally sensitive
decisions.

reach super-human performance in visual recognition tasks. However, CNNs can
easily be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., maliciously-crafted images that
force the networks to predict an incorrect output while being extremely similar
to those for which a correct output is predicted. Regular adversarial examples
are not robust to input image transformations, which can then be used to detect
whether an adversarial example is presented to the network. Nevertheless, it is
still possible to generate adversarial examples that are robust to such
transformations.
  This paper extensively explores the detection of adversarial examples via
image transformations and proposes a novel methodology, called \textit{defense
perturbation}, to detect robust adversarial examples with the same input
transformations the adversarial examples are robust to. Such a \textit{defense
perturbation} is shown to be an effective counter-measure to robust adversarial
examples.
  Furthermore, multi-network adversarial examples are introduced. This kind of
adversarial examples can be used to simultaneously fool multiple networks,
which is critical in systems that use network redundancy, such as those based
on architectures with majority voting over multiple CNNs. An extensive set of
experiments based on state-of-the-art CNNs trained on the Imagenet dataset is
finally reported.

spacetime distortion, called warp bubble, where a massive particle inside it

solutions of the Einstein equations for the Alcubierre metric having fluid
matter as gravity source. The energy-momentum tensor considered two fluid
contents, the perfect fluid and the parametrized perfect fluid (PPF), a
tentative more flexible model whose aim is to explore the possibilities of warp
drive solutions with positive matter density content. Santos-Pereira et al.
(2020; arXiv:2008.06560) have already showed that the Alcubierre metric having
dust as source connects this geometry to the Burgers equation, which describes
shock waves moving through an inviscid fluid, but led the solutions back to
vacuum. The same happened for two out of four solutions subcases for the
perfect fluid. Other solutions for the perfect fluid indicate the possibility
of warp drive with positive matter density, but at the cost of a complex
solution for the warp drive regulating function. Regarding the PPF, solutions
were also obtained indicating that warp speeds could be created with positive
matter density. Weak, dominant, strong and null energy conditions were
calculated for all studied subcases, being satisfied for the perfect fluid and
creating constraints in the PPF quantities such that positive matter density is
also possible for creating a warp bubble. Summing up all
results,energy-momentum tensors describing more complex forms of matter, or
field, distributions generate solutions for the Einstein equations with the
warp drive metric where negative matter density might not be a strict
precondition for attaining warp speeds.

  Fever (CCHF)-key factors for transmission",,,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic disease
caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Ticks belonging to
the genus \textit{Hyalomma} are the main vectors and reservoir for the virus.
It is maintained in nature in an endemic vertebrate-tick-vertebrate cycle.
CCHFV is prevalent in wide geographical areas including Asia, Africa,
South-Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Over the last decade, several
outbreaks of CCHFV have been observed in Europe, mainly in Mediterranean
countries. Due to the high case/fatality ratio of CCHFV in human sometimes, it
is of great importance for public health. Climate change and the invasion of
CCHFV vectors in Central Europe suggest that the establishment of the
transmission in Central Europe may be possible in future. We developed a
compartment-based nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system to
model the disease transmission cycle including blood sucking ticks, livestock
and human. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ shows
that decreasing in the tick survival time is an efficient method to eradicate
the disease. The model supports us in understanding the influence of different
model parameters on the spread of CCHFV. Tick to tick transmission through
co-feeding and the CCHFV circulation through trasstadial and transovarial
stages are important factors to sustain the disease cycle. The proposed model
dynamics are calibrated through an empirical multi-country analysis and
multidimensional scaling reveals the disease-parameter sets of different
countries burdened with CCHF are different. This necessary information may help
us to select most efficient control strategies.

in traditional picker-to-parts warehousing systems, different solutions are
proposed in the literature and in practice. For example, in a mixed-shelves

shelves in a warehouse; or automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are used to
transport the picked items from the storage area to packing stations instead of

we call AGV-assisted mixed-shelves picking systems. We model the new integrated
order batching and routing problem in such systems as an extended multi-depot
vehicle routing problem with both three-index and two-commodity network flow
formulations. Due to the complexity of the integrated problem, we develop a
novel variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the integrated problem
more efficiently. We test our methods with different sizes of instances, and
conclude that the mixed-shelves storage policy is more suitable than the usual

determine its two-proton halo character. A fully exclusive measurement of the
17Ne(p,2p)16F->15O+p quasi-free one-proton knockout reaction has been performed
at GSI at around 500 MeV/nucleon beam energy. All particles resulting from the
scattering process have been detected. The relevant reconstructed quantities
are the angles of the two protons scattered in quasi-elastic kinematics, the
decay of 16F into 15O (including gamma decays from excited states) and a
proton, as well as the 15O+p relative-energy spectrum and the 16F momentum
distributions. The latter two quantities allow an independent and consistent
determination of the ratio of l=0 and l=2 motion of the valence protons in
17Ne. With a resulting relatively small l=0 component of only around 35(3)%, it
is concluded that 17Ne exhibits a rather modest halo character only. The
quantitative agreement of the two values deduced from the energy spectrum and
the momentum distributions supports the theoretical treatment of the
calculation of momentum distributions after quasi-free knockout reactions at
high energies by taking into account distortions based on the Glauber theory.
Moreover, the experimental data allow the separation of valence-proton knockout
and knockout from the 15O core. The latter process contributes with 11.8(3.1)
mb around 40% to the total proton-knockout cross section of 30.3(2.3) mb, which
explains previously reported contradicting conclusions derived from inclusive
cross sections.

unstructured simplex-element (triangular/tetrahedral) grids generated by
anisotropic grid adaptation. Simplex-element grids are considered as efficient
and suitable for automatic grid generation and adaptation, but present a
challenge to accurately predict wall-normal derivatives. For example,
wall-normal derivatives computed by a simple finite-difference approximation,
as typically done in practical fluid-dynamics simulation codes, are often
contaminated with numerical noise. To address this issue, we propose an
improved method based on a common step-length for the finite-difference
approximation, which is otherwise random due to grid irregularity and thus
expected to smooth the wall-normal derivative distribution over a boundary.
Also, we consider using least-squares gradients to compute the wall-normal
derivatives and discuss their possible improvements. Numerical results show
that the improved methods greatly reduce the noise in the wall-normal
derivatives for irregular simplex-element grids.

training samples as well as at inference for future application. Recent work
circumvents this problem using a modality attention approach to be effective
across any possible marker combination. However, for combinations that do not
exist in a labeled training dataset, one cannot have any estimation of
potential segmentation quality if that combination is encountered during
inference. Without this, not only one lacks quality assurance but one also does
not know where to put any additional imaging and labeling effort. We herein
propose a method to estimate segmentation quality on unlabeled images by (i)
estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of convolutional neural
networks for image segmentation, and (ii) training a Random Forest model for
the interpretation of uncertainty features via regression to their
corresponding segmentation metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate that including
these uncertainty measures during training can provide an improvement on

  compartmental approach","31 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables",,,,"eess.SP cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main motivation of this work is to assess the validity of a LWR traffic
flow model to model measurements obtained from trajectory data, and propose
extensions of this model to improve it. A formulation for a discrete dynamical
system is proposed aiming at reproducing the evolution in time of the density
of vehicles along a road, as observed in the measurements. This system is
formulated as a chemical reaction network where road cells are interpreted as
compartments, the transfer of vehicles from one cell to the other is seen as a
chemical reaction between adjacent compartment and the density of vehicles is
seen as a concentration of reactant. Several degrees of flexibility on the
parameters of this system, which basically consist of the reaction rates
between the compartments, can be considered: a constant value or a function
depending on time and/or space. Density measurements coming from trajectory
data are then interpreted as observations of the states of this system at
consecutive times. Optimal reaction rates for the system are then obtained by
minimizing the discrepancy between the output of the system and the state
measurements. This approach was tested both on simulated and real data, proved
successful in recreating the complexity of traffic flows despite the
assumptions on the flux-density relation.

$p$-Poincar\'e inequality, we prove sharp growth and integrability results for
$p$-harmonic Green functions and their minimal $p$-weak upper gradients. We
show that these properties are determined by the growth of the underlying

general $p$-harmonic functions with poles, as well as for singular solutions of
elliptic differential equations in divergence form on weighted $\mathbf{R}^n$
and on manifolds.
  The proofs are based on a new general capacity estimate for annuli, which
implies precise pointwise estimates for $p$-harmonic Green functions. The
capacity estimate is valid under considerably milder assumptions than above. We
also use it, under these milder assumptions, to characterize singletons of zero
capacity and the $p$-parabolicity of the space. This generalizes and improves
earlier results that have been important especially in the context of
Riemannian manifolds.

the neutrino mass with a sensitivity of \SI{0.2}{\electronvolt}

endpoint region of the $\upbeta$-electron spectrum of tritium decay. The
$\upbeta$-electrons are produced in the \textit{Windowless Gaseous Tritium
Source} (WGTS) and guided magnetically through the beamline. In order to
accurately extract the neutrino mass the source activity is required to be
stable and known to a high precision. The WGTS therefore undergoes constant
extensive monitoring from several measurement systems. The \textit{Forward Beam
Monitor} (FBM) is one such monitoring system. The FBM system comprises a
complex mechanical setup capable of inserting a detector board into the KATRIN
beamline with a positioning precision of better than \SI{0.3}{\milli\metre}.
The electron flux density at that position is on the order of
\SI{e6}{\per\second\per\milli\metre\squared}. The detector board contains two
silicon detector chips of \pin diode type which can measure the
$\upbeta$-electron flux from the source with a precision of \SI{0.1}{\percent}

from its designated operating environment inside the Cryogenic Pumping Section
which is a potentially tritium contaminated ultra-high vacuum chamber at
cryogenic temperatures in the presence of a \SI{1}{\tesla} strong magnetic
field. Each of theses parameters do strongly limit the choice of possible
materials which e.g. caused difficulties in detector noise reduction, heat
dissipation and lubrication. In order to completely remove the FBM from the

However, development of a highly tunable semiconductor multiple QD system still
remains as a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate realization of a highly
tunable linear quadruple QD (QQD) in a narrow bandgap semiconductor InAs
nanowire with fine finger gate technique. The QQD is studied by electron
transport measurements in the linear response regime. Characteristic
two-dimensional charge stability diagrams containing four groups of resonant
current lines of different slopes are found for the QQD. It is shown that these
current lines can be individually assigned as arising from resonant electron
transport through the energy levels of different QDs. Benefited from the
excellent gate tunability, we also demonstrate tuning of the QQD to regimes
where the energy levels of two QDs, three QDs and all the four QDs are
energetically on resonance, respectively, with the fermi level of source and
drain contacts. A capacitance network model is developed for the linear QQD and
the simulated charge stability diagrams based on the model show good agreements

narrow bandgap semiconductor nanowires multiple QDs could be used as a
versatile platform to achieve integrated qubits for quantum computing and to

feedback forms. However, few data collectors give upfront privacy guarantees.
Additionally, when privacy guarantees are given upfront, they are often vague
claims about 'anonymity'. Instead, we propose giving quantifiable privacy
guarantees through the statistical notion of differential privacy.
Nevertheless, privacy does not come for free. At the heart of differential
privacy lies an inherent trade-off between accuracy and privacy that needs to
be balanced. Thus, it is vital to properly adjust the accuracy-privacy
trade-off before setting out to collect data. Altogether, getting started with
differentially private data collection can be challenging. Ideally, a data
analyst should not have to be concerned about all the details of differential
privacy, but rather get differential privacy by design. Still, to the best of
our knowledge, no tools for gathering poll data under differential privacy
exists.
  Motivated by the lack of tools to gather poll data under differential
privacy, we set out to engineer our own tool. Specifically, to make local
differential privacy accessible for all, in this systems paper we present
Randori, a set of novel open source tools for differentially private poll data
collection. Randori is intended to help data analysts keep their focus on what
data their poll is collecting, as opposed to how they should collect it. Our
tools also allow the data analysts to analytically predict the accuracy of
their poll. Furthermore, we show that differential privacy alone is not enough
to achieve end-to-end privacy in a server-client setting. Consequently, we also
investigate and mitigate implicit data leaks in Randori.

effects. Entanglement distillation is a means of restoring the quality of such
diluted entanglement by concentrating it into a pair of qubits. Conventionally,
this would be done by distributing multiple photon pairs and distilling the
entanglement into a single pair. Here, we turn around this paradigm by
utilising pairs of single photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom.
Specifically, we make use of the polarisation and the energy-time domain of
photons, both of which are extensively field-tested. We experimentally chart
the domain of distillable states and achieve relative fidelity gains up to 13.8
%. Compared to the two-copy scheme, the distillation rate of our single-copy

high-capacity and noise-resilient quantum networks.

number of terms, as compared to the standard Holomorphic Embedded Load-Flow
method (HELM). To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability, the
proposed models of STATCOM and UPFC have been tested for several cases.
Further, the developed recursive formulas for power balance equations, devices'
physical constraints, and their controlling modes are thoroughly investigated
and examined. From several tests, it is found that the proposed embedded system
requires less execution time and reduces the error at higher rate.

the features that a system used to make prediction while uncertainty awareness
is the ability of a system to highlight when it is not sure about the decision.
This is one of the first studies using uncertainty and explanations for
informed clinical decision making. We perform uncertainty analysis of a deep
learning model for diagnosis of four retinal diseases - age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), central serous retinopathy (CSR), diabetic retinopathy
(DR), and macular hole (MH) using images from a publicly available (OCTID)
dataset. Monte Carlo (MC) dropout is used at the test time to generate a
distribution of parameters and the predictions approximate the predictive
posterior of a Bayesian model. A threshold is computed using the distribution
and uncertain cases can be referred to the ophthalmologist thus avoiding an
erroneous diagnosis. The features learned by the model are visualized using a
proven attribution method from a previous study. The effects of uncertainty on
model performance and the relationship between uncertainty and explainability
are discussed in terms of clinical significance. The uncertainty information

straight flight despite its simple geometry. The main aim of the present study
is to investigate the flight behavior of the X-Zylo and to build a reliable
groundwork for further quantitative parameter studies on ring wing
configurations. To achieve this goal, a six degree of freedom model to predict
the flight trajectory was developed. The trajectory computation uses
interpolated high-fidelity CFD simulation data to calculate the acting moments
and forces on the object during flight. A launch contraption was built to be
able to validate the theory systematically and reproducible in experiments
without human factors involved in the launch. Despite the complexity of the
flight, the theoretical simulations match the real world data qualitatively,
however quantitative differences still prevail. The investigation shows that
the deviation between theory and experiment mostly stems from uncertainties in
the CFD data as well as the optical recording of the experimental data. Despite
the methods outperforming those of prior studies, advancements still have to be
made in those areas in order to obtain better quantitative accordance between

content for the University of Houston (UH) Research Team to outline a strategy
for building an extensive repository of online videos to support research into
automated multimodal approaches to detect objectionable content. The workshop
focused on defining what harmful content is, to whom it is harmful, and why it
is harmful.

  Gravitational Effect","17 pages","Symmetry 2021, 13, 193",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on quantum origin of the universe, in this article we find that the
universal wave function can be far richer than the superposition of many
classical worlds studied by Everett. By analyzing the more general universal
wave function and its unitary evolutions, we find that on small scale we can
obtain Newton's law of universal gravity, while on the scale of galaxies we
naturally derive gravitational effects corresponding to dark matter, without
modifying any physical principles or hypothesizing the existence of new
elementary particles. We find that an auxiliary function having formal symmetry
is very useful to predict the evolution of the classical information in the
universal wave function.

vacuum state. The Universe results from the spontaneous breaking of the
electroweak symmetry, wherein the vacuum with positive expectation energy
produces the dark and visible matter and launches the expansion. Our model
Universe is twice as old as the standard value but the Hubble constant,
cosmological constant and ratio of matter to dark energy are comparable to
concordance values. The development of structure may have occurred earlier.
Finally, we speculate regarding the origin of each component of the Universe
due to a coincidence between the sine of the Weinberg angle and the ratio of
matter to dark energy.
