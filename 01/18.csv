fronts in heterogeneous shifting habitats, with any number of shifting speeds,
by further developing the method based on the theory of viscosity solutions of
Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Our framework addresses both reaction-diffusion
equation and integro-differential equations with a distributed time-delay. The
latter leads to a class of limiting equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-type depending
on the variable $x/t$ and in which the time and space derivatives are coupled
together. We will first establish uniqueness results for these Hamilton-Jacobi
equations using elementary arguments, and then characterize the spreading speed
in terms of a reduced equation on a one-dimensional domain in the variable
$s=x/t$. In terms of the standard Fisher-KPP equation, our results leads to a
new class of ""asymptotically homogeneous"" environments which share the same
spreading speed with the corresponding homogeneous environments.

speech recognition (ASR). For low-resource ASR tasks, however, labeled data can
hardly satisfy the demand of end-to-end models. Self-supervised acoustic
pre-training has already shown its amazing ASR performance, while the
transcription is still inadequate for language modeling in end-to-end models.
In this work, we fuse a pre-trained acoustic encoder (wav2vec2.0) and a
pre-trained linguistic encoder (BERT) into an end-to-end ASR model. The fused
model only needs to learn the transfer from speech to language during
fine-tuning on limited labeled data. The length of the two modalities is
matched by a monotonic attention mechanism without additional parameters.
Besides, a fully connected layer is introduced for the hidden mapping between
modalities. We further propose a scheduled fine-tuning strategy to preserve and
utilize the text context modeling ability of the pre-trained linguistic
encoder. Experiments show our effective utilizing of pre-trained modules. Our
model achieves better recognition performance on CALLHOME corpus (15 hours)
than other end-to-end models.

engine for point tracking in adjacent frames. The proposed approach can be
executed on an edge computer in a real-time manner (i.e. over 30 frames per
second). We demonstrate our approach for a railway application, where the
lateral displacement of the wheel on the rail is measured during operation. We
also implement an algorithm using template matching and line detection as the

construct their time-resolved current-voltage characteristics. The switching
action is based upon the nearly-commensurate to incommensurate
charge-density-wave phase transition in this material, which has a
characteristic temperature of 350 K at thermal equilibrium. For sufficiently
short pulses, with rise times in the nanosecond range, self-heating of the
devices is suppressed, and their current-voltage characteristics are weakly
non-linear and free of hysteresis. This changes as the pulse duration is
increased to 200 ns, where the current develops pronounced hysteresis that
evolves non-monotonically with the pulse duration. By combining the results of
our experiments with a numerical analysis of transient heat diffusion in these

models for the planetary mass distribution over the range $0.1M_J < M_{\rm p} <
10M_J$. If the circumstellar disk lifetime is solely responsible for the end of
planetary mass accretion, the observed (nearly) exponential distribution of
disk lifetime would imprint an exponential fall-off in the planetary mass
function. This result is in apparent conflict with observations, which suggest
that the mass distribution has a (nearly) power-law form $dF/dM_{\rm p}\sim
M_{\rm p}^{-p}$, with index $p\approx1.3$, over the relevant planetary mass
range (and for stellar masses $\sim0.5-2M_\odot$). The mass accretion rate onto
the planet depends on the fraction of the (circumstellar) disk accretion flow
that enters the Hill sphere, and on the efficiency with which the planet
captures the incoming material. Models for the planetary mass function that
include distributions for these efficiencies, with uninformed priors, can
produce nearly power-law behavior, consistent with current observations. The
disk lifetimes, accretion rates, and other input parameters depend on the mass
of the host star. We show how these variations lead to different forms for the
planetary mass function for different stellar masses. Compared to stars with
masses $M_\ast$ = $0.5-2M_\odot$, stars with smaller masses are predicted to
have a steeper planetary mass function (fewer large planets).

probabilistic energy forecasting is of critical importance for incorporating

information from numerical weather prediction models with statistical methods.
Even though the physical models can provide useful information at intra-day and
day-ahead forecast horizons, ensemble weather forecasts from multiple model
runs are often not calibrated and show systematic biases. We propose a
post-processing model for ensemble weather predictions of solar irradiance at
temporal resolutions between 30 minutes and 6 hours. The proposed models
provide probabilistic forecasts in the form of a censored logistic probability
distribution for lead times up to 5 days and are evaluated in two case studies

Another construction in the paper provides a code with $n=2^{s+1}-2$ servers

their interaction with strahl electrons observed between 0.17 and 0.26 au
during the first encounter of Parker Solar Probe. We observe that occurrence of
whistler waves is low, nearly 1.5% and less than 0.5% in the analyzed peak and
average BPF data respectively. Whistlers occur highly intermittently and 80% of
the whistlers appear continuously for less than 3 s. Occurrence rate of
whistler waves was found to be anti-correlated with the solar wind bulk
velocity. The study of the duration of the whistler intervals revealed an
anti-correlation between the duration and the solar wind velocity, as well as
between the duration and the normalized amplitude of magnetic field variations.
The pitch-angle widths (PAWs) of the field-aligned electron population referred
to as the strahl are broader by at least 12 degrees during the presence of
large amplitude narrow band whistler waves. This observation points towards a
EM wave electron interaction, resulting in pitch-angle scattering. PAW of
strahl electrons corresponding to the short duration whistlers are higher
compared to the long duration whistlers. Parallel cuts through the strahl
electron velocity distribution function (VDF) observed during the whistler
intervals appear to depart from the Maxwellian shape typically found in the
near-Sun strahl VDFs (Bercic et al. 2020). The relative decrease of parallel
electron temperature and the increase of PAW for the electrons in strahl energy
range suggests that the interaction with whistler waves results in a transfer
of electron momentum from the parallel to the perpendicular direction.

ideal test-beds for fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Sophisticated
experiments and targeted research activities have also unveiled their potential
for several technological applications. Inelastic neutron scattering is a
powerful and widely used technique to investigate the properties of these
systems. The new generation of spectrometers, equipped with arrays of
position-sensitive detectors, enable to efficiently measure the neutron
cross-sections as a function of energy and of the three component of the
momentum transfer vector Q, in vast portions of the reciprocal space.
Exploiting these capabilities together with the availability of sufficiently
large single-crystal samples of MNMs, it is now possible to obtain an
unprecedented insight into the coherent spin dynamics of these molecular
clusters. This is witnessed by several recent results, that we present in this
review. By using the benchmark system Cr$_8$, it has been demonstrated that the
richness of the four-dimensional inelastic neutrons scattering technique
enables to extract dynamical correlation functions directly from the data. This
technique has been also applied to the archetypical single-molecule magnet
Mn$_{12}$ to unambiguously characterise its Spin Hamiltonian as well as to
portray the entanglement between molecular qubits in (Cr$_7$Ni)$_2$.

putamen, and globus pallidus (GP) have potential as biomarkers for measuring
the severity of Parkinson disease. Reliable quantification of this uptake
requires accurate segmentation of the considered regions. However, segmentation
of these regions from DaT-SPECT images is challenging, a major reason being
partial-volume effects (PVEs), which arise from the limited system resolution
and reconstruction of images over finite-sized voxel grids. The latter leads to
tissue-fraction effects (TFEs). Thus, there is an important need for methods
that can account for the PVEs, including the TFEs, and accurately segment
DaT-SPECT images. The purpose of this study is to design and objectively
evaluate a fully automated tissue-fraction estimation-based segmentation method
that segments the caudate, putamen, and GP from DaT-SPECT images. The proposed
method estimates the posterior mean of the fractional volumes occupied by the
caudate, putamen, and GP within each voxel of a 3-D DaT-SPECT image. The
estimate is obtained by minimizing a cost function based on the binary
cross-entropy loss between the true and estimated fractional volumes over a
population of SPECT images. Evaluations using clinically guided highly
realistic simulation studies show that the proposed method accurately segmented
the caudate, putamen, and GP with high mean Dice similarity coefficients ~ 0.80
and significantly outperformed (p < 0.01) all other considered segmentation
methods. Further, objective evaluation of the proposed method on the task of
quantifying regional uptake shows that the method yielded reliable
quantification with low ensemble normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) <
20% for all the considered regions. The results motivate further evaluation of
the method with physical-phantom and patient studies.

liquid water within 30 km as well as characterizing the subsurface ocean. In
order to satisfy this objective, water within the ice shell must also be
identified. Inductive electromagnetic (EM) methods are optimal for water
detection on Europa because even a small fraction of dissolved salts will make
water orders of magnitude more electrically conductive than the ice shell.
Compared to induction studies by the Galileo spacecraft, measurements of
higher-frequency ambient EM fields are necessary to resolve the shallower
depths of intrashell water. Although these fields have been mostly
characterized by prior missions, their unknown source structures and plasma
properties do not allow EM sounding using a single surface magnetometer or the
orbit-to-surface magnetic transfer function, respectively. Instead, broadband
EM sounding can be accomplished from a single surface station using the
magnetotelluric (MT) method, which measures horizontal electric fields as well
as the three-component magnetic field. We have developed a prototype Europa
Magnetotelluric Sounder (EMS) to meet the measurement requirements in the
relevant thermal, vacuum, and radiation environment. EMS comprises central
electronics, a fluxgate magnetometer on a mast, and three ballistically
deployed electrodes to measure differences in surface electric potential. In
this paper, we describe EMS development and testing as well as providing
supporting information on the concept of operations and calculations on water
detectability. EMS can uniquely determine the occurrence of intrashell water on
Europa, providing important constraints on habitability.

spectrum (APS) of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is uncorrelated
between different multipoles. We propose a novel technique to analyse any
possible correlations of the foreground cleaned CMB temperature angular power
spectrum (APS) measures ($C_{\ell}$ and
$\mathcal{D}_\ell=\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2\pi}C_\ell$). This is motivated by the
behaviour of level spacings between random matrix eigenvalues. The method helps
distinguish uncorrelated statistically isotropic CMB APS from correlated APS,
where the latter can arise due to breakdown of isotropy or presence of some
residual systematics in the foreground cleaned CMB maps. Spacings of
statistically isotropic CMB $C_\ell$'s and $\mathcal{D}_\ell$'s are seen to
closely obey Poisson statistics and introduction of correlations changes the
distribution to appropriate Wigner-Dyson statistics. For foreground cleaned
CMB, we employ the average spacing of consecutive multipole APS for multipoles
$\in [2,31]$. This estimator is sensitive to departures from the null
hypothesis of zero correlations between the APS measures of statistically
isotropic CMB. We study full sky WMAP 9 year ILC and 2018 Planck foreground
cleaned maps (Commander, NILC and SMICA). Sans parity distinctions, average
spacings are in good agreement with theoretical expectation. With parity
distinctions, even multipoles indicate unusually low average spacings for both
$C_\ell$'s (at $\geq 98.86\%$ C.L.) and $\mathcal{D}_\ell$'s (at $\geq 95.07\%$
C.L.). We use an inpainting method based on constrained Gaussian realisations
and show that for the Planck $U73$ and WMAP $KQ75$ masks, all the foreground
cleaned inpainted CMB maps robustly confirm the existence of such unusually low
average spacings of even multipole APS. In addition, this signal is independent
of the non-Gaussian cold spot.

their skills, experience, development environment and behaviors, may influence
a detailed analysis and the delivery of coherent interpretations.
  Objective: We aim at profiling software developers by mining their software
development process. To do so, we performed a controlled experiment where, in
the realm of a Python programming contest, a group of developers had the same
well-defined set of requirements specifications and a well-defined sprint
schedule. Events were collected from the PyCharm IDE, and from the Mooshak
automatic jury where subjects checked-in their code.
  Method: We used n-gram language models and text mining to characterize
developers' profiles, and process mining algorithms to discover their overall
workflows and extract the correspondent metrics for further evaluation.
  Results: Findings show that we can clearly characterize with a coherent
rationale most developers, and distinguish the top performers from the ones
with more challenging behaviors. This approach may lead ultimately to the
creation of a catalog of software development process smells.
  Conclusions: The profile of a developer provides a software project manager a
clue for the selection of appropriate tasks he/she should be assigned. With the
increasing usage of low and no-code platforms, where coding is automatically
generated from an upper abstraction layer, mining developer's actions in the
development platforms is a promising approach to early detect not only
behaviors but also assess project complexity and model effort.

60 edge-sharing triangles. It has 20 six- and 12 five-fold coordinated
vertices, with the former forming a dodecahedron, and each of the latter
connected to the vertices of one of the 12 pentagons of the dodecahedron. When
spins mounted on the vertices of the pentakis dodecahedron interact according
to the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the two different
vertex types necessitate the introduction of two exchange constants. As the
relative strength of the two constants is varied the molecule interpolates
between the dodecahedron and a molecule consisting only of quadrangles. The
competition between the two exchange constants, frustration, and an external
magnetic field results in a multitude of ground-state magnetization and
susceptibility discontinuities. At the classical level the maximum is ten
magnetization and one susceptibility discontinuities when the 12 five-fold
vertices interact with the dodecahedron spins with approximately one-half the
strength of their interaction. When the two interactions are approximately
equal in strength the number of discontinuities is also maximized, with three
of the magnetization and eight of the susceptibility. At the full quantum
limit, where the magnitude of the spins equals 1/2, there can be up to three
ground-state magnetization jumps that have the total z spin component changing
by \Delta S^z=2, even though quantum fluctuations rarely allow discontinuities
of the magnetization. The full quantum case also supports a \Delta S^z=3
discontinuity. Frustration also results in nonmagnetic states inside the
singlet-triplet gap. These results make the pentakis dodecahedron the molecule
with the most discontinuous magnetic response from the quantum to the classical
level.

well-known Dropout, which tackles the problem by randomly shutting down a set
of neurons and their connections according to a certain probability. Therefore,
this approach does not consider any additional knowledge to decide which units
should be disconnected. In this paper, we propose an energy-based Dropout
(E-Dropout) that makes conscious decisions whether a neuron should be dropped

neurons and the model's energy as an importance level for further applying it
to energy-based models, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). The
experimental results over several benchmark datasets revealed the proposed

system \[(*)~\begin{cases}u_t=\Delta u-\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)\\0=\Delta
v-kv+u\end{cases}\] is investigated in a finite domain
$\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq2$, with $k\geq0$. While a comprehensive
literature is available for cases with $(*)$ describing chemotaxis systems and
hence being accompanied by homogeneous Neumann-type boundary conditions, the
presently considered modeling context, besides yet requiring the flux
$\partial_\nu u-u\partial_\nu v$ to vanish on $\partial\Omega$, inherently
involves homogeneous Dirichlet conditions for the attractant $v$, which in the
current setting corresponds to the cell's cytoskeleton being free of pressure
at the boundary.
  This modification in the boundary setting is shown to go along with a
substantial change with respect to the potential to support the emergence of
singular structures: It is, inter alia, revealed that in contexts of radial
solutions in balls there exist two critical mass levels, distinct from each
other whenever $k>0$ or $n\geq3$, that separate ranges within which (i) all
solutions are global in time and remain bounded, (ii) both global bounded and
exploding solutions exist, or (iii) all nontrivial solutions blow up in finite
time. While critical mass phenomena distinguishing between regimes of type (i)
and (ii) belong to the well-understood characteristics of $(*)$ when posed
under classical no-flux boundary conditions in planar domains, the discovery of
a distinct secondary critical mass level related to the occurrence of (iii)
seems to have no nearby precedent.
  In the planar case with the domain being a disk, the analytical results are
supplemented with some numerical illustrations, and it is discussed how the
findings can be interpreted biophysically for the situation of a cell on a flat
substrate.

ultimately causing learning to stagnate. Such an issue was overcome in the
context of convolution neural networks by creating ""shortcut connections""

very popular deep learning technique called Deep Belief Network still suffers
from gradient vanishing when dealing with discriminative tasks. Therefore, this
paper proposes the Residual Deep Belief Network, which considers the

LLJs and wind farms. In the presence of an LLJ, there are positive and negative
shear regions in the velocity profile. The positive shear regions of LLJs are
continuously turbulent, while the negative shear regions have limited
turbulence. We present large-eddy simulations of wind farms in which the LLJ is
above, below, or in the middle of the turbine rotor swept area. We find that
the wakes recover relatively fast when the LLJ is above the turbines. This is
due to the high turbulence below the LLJ and the downward vertical entrainment
created by the momentum deficit due to the wind farm power production. This
harvests the jet's energy and aids wake recovery. However, when the LLJ is
below the turbine rotor swept area, the wake recovery is very slow due to the
low atmospheric turbulence above the LLJ. The energy budget analysis reveals
that the entrainment fluxes are maximum and minimum when the LLJ is above and
in the middle of the turbine rotor swept area, respectively. Surprisingly, we
find that the negative shear creates a significant entrainment flux upward when
the LLJ is below the turbine rotor swept area. This facilitates energy
extraction from the jet, which is beneficial for the performance of downwind
turbines.

semantics for differentiable programming, based on diffeological spaces. We
show that it interprets our language, and we phrase what it means for the AD
method to be correct with respect to this semantics. We show that our
characterisation of AD gives rise to an elegant semantic proof of its
correctness based on a gluing construction on diffeological spaces. We explain
how this is, in essence, a logical relations argument. Throughout, we show how
the analysis extends to AD methods for computing higher order derivatives using

streams, derived from the DDSKETCH algorithm. UDDSKETCH provides accuracy
guarantees covering the full range of quantiles independently of the input
distribution and greatly improves the accuracy with regard to DDSKETCH. In this
paper we show how to compress and fuse data streams (or datasets) by using
UDDSKETCH data summaries that are fused into a new summary related to the union
of the streams (or datasets) processed by the input summaries whilst preserving
both the error and size guarantees provided by UDDSKETCH. This property of
sketches, known as mergeability, enables parallel and distributed processing.
We prove that UDDSKETCH is fully mergeable and introduce a parallel version of
UDDSKETCH suitable for message-passing based architectures. We formally prove
its correctness and compare it to a parallel version of DDSKETCH, showing
through extensive experimental results that our parallel algorithm almost
always outperforms the parallel DDSKETCH algorithm with regard to the overall
accuracy in determining the quantiles.

solutions that features a fast and scalable training. It is motivated by the
two critical considerations: (1) the fact that topology optimization and the
stochasticity induced by renewable energy sources may lead to fundamentally
different AC-OPF instances; and (2) the significant training time needed by
existing machine-learning approaches for predicting AC-OPF. The proposed
approach is a 2-stage methodology that exploits a spatial decomposition of the
power network that is viewed as a set of regions. The first stage learns to
predict the flows and voltages on the buses and lines coupling the regions, and
the second stage trains, in parallel, the machine-learning models for each
region. Experimental results on the French transmission system (up to 6,700
buses and 9,000 lines) demonstrate the potential of the approach. Within a
short training time, the approach predicts AC-OPF solutions with very high
fidelity and minor constraint violations, producing significant improvements
over the state-of-the-art. The results also show that the predictions can seed
a load flow optimization to return a feasible solution within 0.03% of the
AC-OPF objective, while reducing running times significantly.

algorithm that can be used for higher Reynolds/Weber numbers. The algorithm is
validated through a variety of test-cases, starting with the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability both in 2-D and 3-D, followed by the impact of a droplet on a
liquid sheet. In all simulations, the solver is shown to correctly capture the
dynamics of the flow and match reference results very well. As the final
test-case, the solver is used to model droplet splashing on a thin liquid sheet
in 3-D with a density ratio of 1000 and kinematic viscosity ratio of 15 --
matching the water/air system -- at We=8000 and Re=1000. The results show that

including monitoring disease outbreaks. An obvious caveat is that several
reasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are
blind to people's motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is
particularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the
ongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead
individuals to search for health-related information, masking the
disease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity
to disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior. Here,
we focus on the two pandemics of the 21st century (2009-H1N1 flu and Covid-19)
and propose a methodology to discriminate between search patterns linked to
general information seeking (media driven) and search patterns possibly more
associated with actual infection (disease driven). We show that by learning
from such pandemic periods, with high anxiety and media hype, it is possible to
select online searches and improve model performance both in pandemic and
seasonal settings. Moreover, and despite the common claim that more data is
always better, our results indicate that lower volume of the right data can be
better than including large volumes of apparently similar data, especially in
the long run. Our work provides a general framework that can be applied beyond
specific events and diseases, and argues that algorithms can be improved simply
by using less (better) data. This has important consequences, for example, to
solve the accuracy-explainability trade-off in machine-learning.

brain tumors and healthy subjects has been an important tool to specify tumor
geometry through location alignment and facilitate pathological analysis. Since
tumor region does not match with any ordinary brain tissue, it has been
difficult to deformably register a patients brain to a normal one. Many patient
images are associated with irregularly distributed lesions, resulting in
further distortion of normal tissue structures and complicating registration's
similarity measure. In this work, we follow a multi-step context-aware image
inpainting framework to generate synthetic tissue intensities in the tumor
region. The coarse image-to-image translation is applied to make a rough
inference of the missing parts. Then, a feature-level patch-match refinement
module is applied to refine the details by modeling the semantic relevance
between patch-wise features. A symmetry constraint reflecting a large degree of
anatomical symmetry in the brain is further proposed to achieve better
structure understanding. Deformable registration is applied between inpainted
patient images and normal brains, and the resulting deformation field is
eventually used to deform original patient data for the final alignment. The
method was applied to the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018
challenge database and compared against three existing inpainting methods. The
proposed method yielded results with increased peak signal-to-noise ratio,
structural similarity index, inception score, and reduced L1 error, leading to

alone has proven insufficient in elucidating its nature. Time-resolved linear
polarization has the potential to distinguish between popular emission
mechanisms, e.g., synchrotron radiation from electrons with a power-law energy
distribution or inverse Compton scattering of soft seed thermal photons, which
can yield the typical GRB spectrum but produce different levels of
polarization. Furthermore, it can be used to learn about the outflow's
composition (i.e. whether it is kinetic-energy-dominated or
Poynting-flux-dominated) and angular structure. For synchrotron emission it is
a powerful probe of the magnetic field geometry. Here we consider synchrotron
emission from a thin ultrarelativistic outflow, with bulk Lorentz factor
$\Gamma(R)=\Gamma_0(R/R_0)^{-m/2}\gg1$, that radiates a Band-function spectrum
in a single (multiple) pulse(s) over a range of radii, $R_0\leq R\leq
R_0+\Delta R$. Pulse profiles and polarization evolution at a given energy are
presented for a coasting ($m=0$) and accelerating ($m=-2/3$) thin spherical
shell and for an off-axis top-hat jet with sharp as well as smooth edges in
emissivity. Four different magnetic field configurations are considered, such
as a locally ordered field coherent over angular scales
$\theta_B\gtrsim1/\Gamma$, a tangled field ($B_\perp$) in the plane transverse
to the radial direction, an ordered field ($B_\parallel$) aligned in the radial
direction, and a globally ordered toroidal field ($B_{\rm tor}$). All field
configurations produce distinct polarization evolution with single (for
$B_\perp$ and $B_\parallel$) and double (for $B_{\rm tor}$) $90^\circ$ changes
in the polarization position angle.

  based on Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous vehicles need to handle various traffic conditions and make safe
and efficient decisions and maneuvers. However, on the one hand, a single
optimization/sampling-based motion planner cannot efficiently generate safe
trajectories in real time, particularly when there are many interactive
vehicles near by. On the other hand, end-to-end learning methods cannot assure
the safety of the outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose a
hierarchical behavior planning framework with a set of low-level safe
controllers and a high-level reinforcement learning algorithm (H-CtRL) as a
coordinator for the low-level controllers. Safety is guaranteed by the
low-level optimization/sampling-based controllers, while the high-level
reinforcement learning algorithm makes H-CtRL an adaptive and efficient
behavior planner. To train and test our proposed algorithm, we built a
simulator that can reproduce traffic scenes using real-world datasets. The
proposed H-CtRL is proved to be effective in various realistic simulation
scenarios, with satisfying performance in terms of both safety and efficiency.

processing complementary inputs such as LiDAR with images. In isolation, 2D
images have been found to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Yet,
there have been limited studies on the adversarial robustness of multi-modal
models that fuse LiDAR features with image features. Furthermore, existing
works do not consider physically realizable perturbations that are consistent
across the input modalities. In this paper, we showcase practical
susceptibilities of multi-sensor detection by placing an adversarial object on
top of a host vehicle. We focus on physically realizable and input-agnostic
attacks as they are feasible to execute in practice, and show that a single
universal adversary can hide different host vehicles from state-of-the-art
multi-modal detectors. Our experiments demonstrate that successful attacks are
primarily caused by easily corrupted image features. Furthermore, we find that
in modern sensor fusion methods which project image features into 3D,
adversarial attacks can exploit the projection process to generate false
positives across distant regions in 3D. Towards more robust multi-modal
perception systems, we show that adversarial training with feature denoising
can boost robustness to such attacks significantly. However, we find that
standard adversarial defenses still struggle to prevent false positives which
are also caused by inaccurate associations between 3D LiDAR points and 2D
pixels.

is obtained for a mixing that is even larger, close to maximal, but the
statistical significance of the short-baseline neutrino oscillation signal is

theorem. We show that the large Neutrino-4 mixing is in strong tension with the
KATRIN, PROSPECT, STEREO, and solar $\nu_{e}$ bounds. Using a more reliable
Monte Carlo simulation of a large set of Neutrino-4-like data, we found that
the statistical significance of the Neutrino-4 short-baseline neutrino

unlikely to find a best-fit point that has a large mixing, even maximal, in the
absence of oscillations. Therefore, we conclude that the claimed Neutrino-4

raise public awareness. We used the Google search engine to retrieve relevant
information from reputable sources such as PubMed and Google Scholar. We
identified 14 classified MODY genes as well as three new and unclassified genes
linked with MODY. These genes are fundamentally embedded in the beta cells, the
most common of which are HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, and GCK genes. Mutations in these
genes cause beta-cell dysfunction, resulting in decreased insulin production
and hyperglycemia. MODY genes have distinct mechanisms of action and phenotypic
presentations compared with type 1 and type 2 DM and other forms of DM.
Healthcare professionals are therefore advised to formulate drugs and treatment
based on the causal genes rather than the current generalized treatment for all
types of DM. This will increase the effectiveness of diabetes drugs and
treatment and reduce the burden of the disease.

modifying a small fraction of their bonds. This procedure has been used to
design and build mechanical metamaterials with a variety of responses. A
long-range 'allosteric' response, where a localized input strain at one site
gives rise to a localized output strain at a distant site, has been of
particular interest. This work presents a novel approach to incorporating
allosteric responses in experimental systems by pruning disordered networks
$\textit{in-situ}$. Previous work has relied on computer simulations to design
and predict the response of such systems using a cost function where the
response of the entire network to each bond removal is used at each step to
determine which bond to prune. It is not feasible to follow such a design
protocol in experiments where one has access only to local response at each
site. This paper presents design algorithms that allow determination of what
bonds to prune based purely on the local stresses in the network without
employing a cost function; using only local information, allosteric networks
are designed in simulations and then built out of real materials. The results
show that some pruning strategies work better than others when translated into
an experimental system. A method is presented to measure local stresses
experimentally in disordered networks. This approach is then used to implement
pruning methods to design desired responses $\textit{in-situ}$. Results from
these experiments confirm that the pruning methods are robust and work in a

maximum intensity of the $M_4$ edges shows increased broadening for

from $4f$ orbital half-filling and is explained through the relationship
between electron transition probability and transition lifetime as expressed

scattering cluster. To this end, scatterers and traveling paths of multipath
components are classified to build a new channel model. Unlike the conventional
modeling, where the channels between system units are modeled independently,
the new model considers the channel as a whole and decomposes it based on the
traveling paths. The model shows clearly how IRS, in the beam-space context,
converts the channel from a problem into a design element. After investigating
IRS as a scattering cluster, based on a proposed segmentation scheme, the
beamforming problem is considered with a focus on first-order reflections.
Passive beamforming at IRS is shown to have two tiers; at the scatterer and
antenna levels. A segment-activation scheme is proposed to maximize the
received signal power, where the number of transmitting antenna elements to be
used is given as a function of IRS positioning and beamforming at the receiver.
The results show that while using more transmitting antenna elements to get
narrower beams is possible, using fewer elements can give better performance,
especially for larger IRS at close distances. The developed model also proves
useful in addressing emerging issues in massive MIMO communication, namely,
stationarity and spherical wavefronts.

an equivalent rank-constrained semidefinite programming (SDP) and is solved by
SDP relaxation and exploiting sequential fractional programming. Furthermore,
to strike a balance between complexity and performance, a low complex approach
based on alternative optimization is adopted. Numerical results unveil that the

recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment large-scale neural

to a test sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the
in-context examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative
inputs to unleash GPT-$3$'s extensive knowledge. We evaluate the proposed
approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks,
where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms

fine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results.

However, the flow behaviour changes significantly as the stratification
increases and suppresses the scale of vertical displacements of fluid parcels.
Computations for a range of Froude numbers $Fr\in [0.1,\infty]$ show that as
Froude number decreases, the flow patterns for both Reynolds numbers become
similar. The representative simulations of the lee-wave instability at
$Fr=0.625$ and the two-dimensional vortex shedding at $Fr=0.25$ regimes are

the reported study examines the relative influence of viscosity and
stratification on the dividing streamline elevation, wake structure and flow
separation. The solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the incompressible
Boussinesq limit are obtained on unstructured meshes suitable for simulations
involving multiple bodies. Computations are accomplished using the finite

show that the SR technique produces results similar to those of the bilinear

  arXiv:1909.03446",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Engineering Thermodynamics has been the core course of many science and
engineering majors around the world, including energy and power, mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, aerospace, cryogenic refrigeration, food
engineering, chemical engineering, and environmental engineering, among which
gas power cycle is one of the important contents. However, many Engineering
Thermodynamics textbooks focus only on evaluating the thermal efficiency of gas
power cycle, while the important concept of specific cycle work is ignored.
Based on the generalized temperature-entropy diagram for the gas power cycles
proposed by the authors, an ideal Otto cycle and an ideal Miller-Diesel cycle
are taking as examples for the thermodynamic analyses of gas power cycles. The
optimum compression ratio (or the pressure ratio) for the maximum specific
cycle work or the maximum mean effective pressure is analyzed and determined.
The ideal Otto and the ideal Miller-Diesel cycles, and also other gas power
cycles for movable applications, are concluded that the operation under the
maximum specific cycle work or the maximum mean effective pressure, instead of
under the higher efficiency, is more economic and more reasonable. We concluded
that the very important concept, i.e., the optimum compression (or pressure)
ratio for the gas power cycles, should be emphasized in the Engineering
Thermodynamics teaching process and in the latter revised or the newly edited
textbooks, in order to better guide the engineering applications.

building noise drops off above 120 Hz, it is advantageous to raise the flexural
resonance frequencies of the inertia block and instrument far above 120 Hz.
However, it can be challenging to obtain a high fundamental frequency of the

that a cylindrical design can achieve higher fundamental resonance frequency

been employed in diverse application areas, particularly for enhanced parameter
estimation and receiver performance. The sparse array design criteria are
generally categorized into environment-independent and environment-dependent
performance metrics. The former are largely benign to the underlying
environment and, in principle, seek to maximize the spatial degrees of freedom
by extending the coarray aperture. Environment-dependent objectives, on the
other hand, consider the operating conditions characterized by emitters and
targets in the array field of view, in addition to receiver noise. In this
regard, applying such objectives renders the array configuration as well as the
array weights time-varying in response to dynamic and changing environment.
  This work is geared towards designing environment-dependent sparse array
beamformer to improve the output signal-to-interference and noise ratio using
both narrowband and wideband signal platforms. One key challenge in
implementing the data-dependent approaches is the lack of knowledge of exact or
estimated values of the data autocorrelation function across the full sparse
array aperture. At the core of this work is to address the aforementioned
issues by devising innovative solutions using convex optimization and machine
learning tools, structured sparsity concepts, low rank matrix completion
schemes and fusing the environment-dependent and environment-independent deigns

such prediction, Huang et al. performed elongational measurements on star
polymer melts, indeed revealing that, in fast flows, the elongational viscosity
is insensitive to the molecular structure, provided the molecular weight of the
backbone is the same. Inspired by these studies, we here report on results
obtained with multi-chain slip-link simulations for symmetric and asymmetric
star polymer melts, as well as calculations of the Rouse time of the examined
branched structures. The simulations semi-quantitatively reproduce the
experimental data if the Kuhn-segment orientation-induced reduction of friction
(SORF) is accounted for. The observed insensitivity of the nonlinear
elongational viscosity to the molecular structure for the same span molar mass
may be due to several factors. In the symmetric case, the calculated Rouse time
of the star marginally differs from that of the linear molecule, so that
possible differences in the observed stress fall within the experimental
uncertainty. Secondly, it is possible that the flow-induced formation of hooked
star pairs makes the effective Rouse time of the aggregate even closer to that
of the linear polymer because the friction center moves towards the branchpoint
of the star molecule. In the asymmetric case, it is shown that the stress
contributed by the short arms is negligible with respect to that of the long
ones. However, such stress-reduction is balanced by a dilution effect whereby
the unstretched arms reduce SORF as they decrease the Kuhn-segment order
parameter of the system. As a result of that dilution, the stress contributed
by the backbone is larger. The two effects compensate one another so that the
overall stress is virtually the same as the other architectures.

system prior to a Hopf bifurcation is exposed to a sufficient level of noise,
its noise-induced dynamics can provide valuable information about the impending
bifurcation. In this thesis, we present a system identification (SI) framework
that exploits the noise-induced dynamics prior to a Hopf bifurcation. The
framework is novel in that it is capable of predicting the bifurcation point
and the post-bifurcation dynamics using only pre-bifurcation data.
Specifically, we present two different versions of the framework: input-output
and output-only. For the input-output version, the system is forced with
additive noise generated by an external actuator, and its response is measured.
For the output-only version, the intrinsic noise of the system acts as the
noise source and only the output signal is measured. In both versions, the
Fokker-Planck equations, which describe the probability density function of the
fluctuation amplitude, are derived from self-excited oscillator models. Then,
the coefficients of these models are extracted from the experimental
probability density functions characterizing the noise-induced response in the
fixed-point regime. The SI framework is tested on three different experimental
systems: a low-density jet, a flame-driven Rijke tube, and a gas-turbine
combustor. For these systems, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can
identify the nature of the Hopf bifurcation and the system's order of
nonlinearity. Moreover, by extrapolating the identified model coefficients, we
are able to forecast the locations of the bifurcation points and the
limit-cycle features after those points. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that SI has been performed using data from only the
pre-bifurcation regime, without the need for knowledge of the location of the
bifurcation point.

reactive planning objective which allows a self-driving vehicle to jointly
reason about its own plans as well as how other actors will react to them. We
formulate the problem as an energy-based deep structured model that is learned
from observational data and encodes both the planning and prediction problems.
Through simulations based on both real-world driving and synthetically
generated dense traffic, we demonstrate that our reactive model outperforms a
non-reactive variant in successfully completing highly complex maneuvers (lane
merges/turns in traffic) faster, without trading off collision rate.

radial distribution of gas-phase and stellar metallicity for star-forming
galaxies. By means of the model, the gas-phase and stellar metallicity can be
obtained from the stellar-to-gas mass ratio. Both the gas inflow and outflow
processes play an important role in building the final gas-phase metallicity,
and there exists degeneracy effect between the gas inflow and outflow rates for
star-forming galaxies. On the other hand, stellar metallicity is more sensitive
to the gas outflow rate than to the gas inflow rate, and this helps to break
the parameter degeneracy for star-forming galaxies. We apply this analysis
method to the nearby disc galaxy M\,101 and adopting the classical $\chi^{2}$
methodology to explore the influence of model parameters on the resulted
metallicity. It can be found that the combination of gas-phase and stellar
metallicity is indeed more effective for constraining the gas inflow and
outflow rates. Our results also show that the model with relatively strong gas
outflows but weak gas inflow describes the evolution of M\,101 reasonably well.

variations of only $\pm$ 4 K, as achieved previously. Our atypical Ca II
analysis models the indices in terms of S/N and includes covariance
significantly in their errors. The H $\alpha$ indices have a quasi-periodic

difficult to be further improved. In this paper, we discuss the role of
discriminative features in object detection, and then propose a Critical
Feature Capturing Network (CFC-Net) to improve detection accuracy from three
aspects: building powerful feature representation, refining preset anchors, and
optimizing label assignment. Specifically, we first decouple the classification
and regression features, and then construct robust critical features adapted to
the respective tasks through the Polarization Attention Module (PAM). With the
extracted discriminative regression features, the Rotation Anchor Refinement
Module (R-ARM) performs localization refinement on preset horizontal anchors to
obtain superior rotation anchors. Next, the Dynamic Anchor Learning (DAL)
strategy is given to adaptively select high-quality anchors based on their
ability to capture critical features. The proposed framework creates more
powerful semantic representations for objects in remote sensing images and
achieves high-performance real-time object detection. Experimental results on
three remote sensing datasets including HRSC2016, DOTA, and UCAS-AOD show that

monitoring (CGM) readings are susceptible to sensor errors. As a result,
inaccurate CGM readings would affect BG prediction and make it unreliable, even
if the most optimal machine learning model is used. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to predicting blood glucose level with a stacked Long short-term
memory (LSTM) based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model considering
sensor fault. We use the Kalman smoothing technique for the correction of the
inaccurate CGM readings due to sensor error. For the OhioT1DM dataset,
containing eight weeks' data from six different patients, we achieve an average
RMSE of 6.45 and 17.24 mg/dl for 30 minutes and 60 minutes of prediction
horizon (PH), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the leading
average prediction accuracy for the ohioT1DM dataset. Different physiological
information, e.g., Kalman smoothed CGM data, carbohydrates from the meal, bolus
insulin, and cumulative step counts in a fixed time interval, are crafted to
represent meaningful features used as input to the model. The goal of our
approach is to lower the difference between the predicted CGM values and the
fingerstick blood glucose readings - the ground truth. Our results indicate

decoupled, stable, and practically second-order time-stepping algorithm for
computing MHD ensemble flow averages under uncertainties in the initial
conditions and forcing. For each viscosity and magnetic diffusivity pair, the
algorithm picks the largest possible parameter $\theta\in[0,1]$ to avoid the
instability that arises due to the presence of some explicit viscous terms. At
each time step, the algorithm shares the same system matrix with all $J$
realizations but with different right-hand-side vectors. That saves assembling
time and computer memory, allows the reuse of the same preconditioner, and can
take the advantage of block linear solvers. For the proposed algorithm, we
prove stability and convergence rigorously. To illustrate the predicted
convergence rates of our analysis, numerical experiments with manufactured
solutions are given on a unit square domain. Finally, we test the scheme on a
benchmark channel flow over a step problem and it performs well.

  Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown their promising
performance in the cross-modality medical image segmentation tasks. These
typical methods usually utilize a translation network to transform images from
the source domain to target domain or train the pixel-level classifier merely
using translated source images and original target images. However, when there
exists a large domain shift between source and target domains, we argue that
this asymmetric structure could not fully eliminate the domain gap. In this
paper, we present a novel deep symmetric architecture of UDA for medical image
segmentation, which consists of a segmentation sub-network, and two symmetric
source and target domain translation sub-networks. To be specific, based on two
translation sub-networks, we introduce a bidirectional alignment scheme via a
shared encoder and private decoders to simultaneously align features 1) from
source to target domain and 2) from target to source domain, which helps
effectively mitigate the discrepancy between domains. Furthermore, for the
segmentation sub-network, we train a pixel-level classifier using not only
original target images and translated source images, but also original source
images and translated target images, which helps sufficiently leverage the
semantic information from the images with different styles. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method has remarkable advantages compared to
the state-of-the-art methods in both cross-modality Cardiac and BraTS
segmentation tasks.

Furthermore, we introduce a novel similarity modification rate SMR to conduct a
stealthier attack considering the change of node similarity distribution.
Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphAttacker can
achieve state-of-the-art attack performance on graph analysis tasks of node
classification, graph classification, and link prediction, no matter the

the dual space of $H^s_0(\Omega)$, $0<s<1$. The nonlocal operator
$\mathcal{L}_a:H^s_0(\Omega)\to H^{-s}(\Omega)$ is defined with a measurable,
bounded, strictly positive singular kernel $a(x,y)$, possibly not symmetric, by
\[\langle\mathcal{L}_au,v\rangle=P.V.\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}v(x)(u(x)-u(y))a(x,y)dydx=\mathcal{E}_a(u,v),\]

the Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities. This provides regularity of the solutions,
including a global estimate in $L^\infty(\Omega)$, local H\""older regularity
when $a$ is symmetric, and local regularity in $W^{2s,p}_{loc}(\Omega)$ and
$C^1(\Omega)$ for fractional $s$-Laplacian obstacle-type problems. These novel

To achieve this result, we consider the LGI of the cavity mode weakly coupled
to a zero-temperature environment as a practical instance of the physical
system. We assume that the bosonic mode undergoes dissipation because of an
interaction with the environment but is not affected by dephasing. Solving the
master equation exactly, we derive an explicit form of the violation of the
inequality for both systems prepared initially in the coherent state
$|\alpha\rangle$ and the cat state $(|\alpha\rangle+|-\alpha\rangle)$. For the
evaluation of the inequality, we choose the displaced parity operators
characterized by a complex number $\beta$. We look for the optimum parameter
$\beta$ that lets the upper bound of the inequality be maximum numerically.
Contrary to our expectations, the coherent state occasionally exhibits quantum
quality more strongly than the cat state for the upper bound of the violation
of the LGI in a specific range of three equally spaced measurement times
(spacing $\tau$). Moreover, as we let $\tau$ approach zero, the optimized

the generalized entropy that allows the contributions from the island, we find
that the island extends to the outside the horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om

that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation at late times for a given

pretrained models developed for ImageNet. This paradigm assumes that better
ImageNet architectures perform better on chest X-ray tasks and that
ImageNet-pretrained weights provide a performance boost over random
initialization. In this work, we compare the transfer performance and parameter
efficiency of 16 popular convolutional architectures on a large chest X-ray
dataset (CheXpert) to investigate these assumptions. First, we find no
relationship between ImageNet performance and CheXpert performance for both
models without pretraining and models with pretraining. Second, we find that,
for models without pretraining, the choice of model family influences
performance more than size within a family for medical imaging tasks. Third, we
observe that ImageNet pretraining yields a statistically significant boost in
performance across architectures, with a higher boost for smaller
architectures. Fourth, we examine whether ImageNet architectures are
unnecessarily large for CheXpert by truncating final blocks from pretrained
models, and find that we can make models 3.25x more parameter-efficient on
average without a statistically significant drop in performance. Our work
contributes new experimental evidence about the relation of ImageNet to chest
x-ray interpretation performance.

non-Gaussian normal diffusion (NGND), whereby their displacements grow with
mean square proportional to the observation time and non-Gaussian statistics.
Their distributions appear to decay almost exponentially according to
""universal"" laws largely insensitive to the observation time. This effect is
generically attributed to slow environmental fluctuations, which perturb the
local configuration of the suspension medium. To investigate the microscopic
mechanisms responsible for the NGND phenomenon, we study Brownian diffusion in
low dimensional systems, like the free diffusion of ellipsoidal and active
particles, the diffusion of colloidal particles in fluctuating corrugated
channels and Brownian motion in arrays of planar convective rolls. NGND appears
to be a transient effect related to the time modulation of the instantaneous
particle's diffusivity, which can occur even under equilibrium conditions.
Consequently, we propose to generalize the definition of NGND to include
transient displacement distributions which vary continuously with the
observation time. To this purpose, we provide a heuristic one-parameter
function, which fits all time-dependent transient displacement distributions
corresponding to the same diffusion constant. Moreover, we reveal the existence
of low dimensional systems where the NGND distributions are not leptokurtic
(fat exponential tails), as often reported in the literature, but platykurtic
(thin sub-Gaussian tails), i.e., with negative excess kurtosis. The actual
nature of the NGND transients is related to the specific microscopic dynamics
of the diffusing particle.

e-commerce platform that reflect characteristics of reviews of an item. To
assist consumers to quickly grasp a large number of reviews about an item,
opinion tags are increasingly being applied by e-commerce platforms. Current
mechanisms for generating opinion tags rely on either manual labelling or
heuristic methods, which is time-consuming and ineffective. In this paper, we
propose the abstractive opinion tagging task, where systems have to
automatically generate a ranked list of opinion tags that are based on, but
need not occur in, a given set of user-generated reviews.
  The abstractive opinion tagging task comes with three main challenges: (1)
the noisy nature of reviews; (2) the formal nature of opinion tags vs. the
colloquial language usage in reviews; and (3) the need to distinguish between
different items with very similar aspects. To address these challenges, we
propose an abstractive opinion tagging framework, named AOT-Net, to generate a
ranked list of opinion tags given a large number of reviews. First, a
sentence-level salience estimation component estimates each review's salience
score. Next, a review clustering and ranking component ranks reviews in two
steps: first, reviews are grouped into clusters and ranked by cluster size;
then, reviews within each cluster are ranked by their distance to the cluster
center. Finally, given the ranked reviews, a rank-aware opinion tagging
component incorporates an alignment feature and alignment loss to generate a
ranked list of opinion tags. To facilitate the study of this task, we create
and release a large-scale dataset, called eComTag, crawled from real-world
e-commerce websites. Extensive experiments conducted on the eComTag dataset
verify the effectiveness of the proposed AOT-Net in terms of various evaluation
metrics.

Cross-Attention Fusion based Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (CaEGCN),
which contains four main modules: the cross-attention fusion module which
innovatively concatenates the Content Auto-encoder module (CAE) relating to the
individual data and Graph Convolutional Auto-encoder module (GAE) relating to
the relationship between the data in a layer-by-layer manner, and the
self-supervised model that highlights the discriminative information for
clustering tasks. While the cross-attention fusion module fuses two kinds of
heterogeneous representation, the CAE module supplements the content
information for the GAE module, which avoids the over-smoothing problem of GCN.
In the GAE module, two novel loss functions are proposed that reconstruct the

self-supervised module constrains the distributions of the middle layer

conditioning a target probability distribution on a transferred source
distribution. The target globally models the interaction between the source and
target, and conditions on a probabilistic data predictor made available by an
independent local source modeller. Fully probabilistic design is adopted to
solve this optimal decision-making problem in the target. By successfully
transferring higher moments of the source, the target can reject unreliable
source knowledge (i.e. it achieves robust transfer). This dual-modeller
framework means that the source's local processing of raw data into a
transferred predictive distribution -- with compressive possibilities -- is
enriched by (the possible expertise of) the local source model. In addition,
the introduction of the global target modeller allows correlation between the
source and target tasks -- if known to the target -- to be accounted for.
Important consequences emerge. Firstly, the new scheme attains the performance
of fully modelled (i.e. conventional) multitask learning schemes in (those
rare) cases where target model misspecification is avoided. Secondly, and more
importantly, the new dual-modeller framework is robust to the model
misspecification that undermines conventional multitask learning. We thoroughly
explore these issues in the key context of interacting Gaussian process
regression tasks. Experimental evidence from both synthetic and real data
settings validates our technical findings: that the proposed BTL framework

We simulate two progenitor models with initial masses of
$85\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $100\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with the LS220, SFHo, and
SFHx equations of state. The $85\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor experiences a
pair instability pulse coincident with core collapse, whereas the
$100\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor has already gone through a sequence of
four pulses $1\mathord,500$ years before collapse in which it ejected its H and
He envelope. The $85\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ models experience shock revival and
then delayed collapse to a black hole (BH) due to ongoing accretion within
hundreds of milliseconds. The diagnostic energy of the incipient explosion
reaches up to $2.7\times10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$ in the SFHx model. Due to the
high binding energy of the metal core, BH collapse by fallback is eventually
unavoidable, but partial mass ejection may be possible. The
$100\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ models have not achieved shock revival or undergone BH
collapse by the end of the simulation. All models exhibit relatively strong
gravitational-wave emission both in the high-frequency g-mode emission band and
at low frequencies. The SFHx and SFHo models show clear emission from the
standing accretion shock instability. For our models, we estimate maximum
detection distances of up to $\mathord{\sim}46\,\mathrm{kpc}$ with LIGO and
$\mathord{\sim} 850\,\mathrm{kpc}$ with Cosmic Explorer.

  Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS-21), Virtual Conference",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is more
challenging than training a single-agent reinforcement learning algorithm,
because the result of a multi-agent task strongly depends on the complex
interactions among agents and their interactions with a stochastic and dynamic
environment. We propose an algorithm that boosts MARL training using the biased
action information of other agents based on a friend-or-foe concept. For a
cooperative and competitive environment, there are generally two groups of
agents: cooperative-agents and competitive-agents. In the proposed algorithm,
each agent updates its value function using its own action and the biased
action information of other agents in the two groups. The biased joint action
of cooperative agents is computed as the sum of their actual joint action and
the imaginary cooperative joint action, by assuming all the cooperative agents
jointly maximize the target agent's value function. The biased joint action of
competitive agents can be computed similarly. Each agent then updates its own
value function using the biased action information, resulting in a biased value
function and corresponding biased policy. Subsequently, the biased policy of
each agent is inevitably subjected to recommend an action to cooperate and
compete with other agents, thereby introducing more active interactions among
agents and enhancing the MARL policy learning. We empirically demonstrate that
our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in various mixed
cooperative-competitive environments. Furthermore, the introduced biases
gradually decrease as the training proceeds and the correction based on the
imaginary assumption vanishes.

mistake-bound model to online multiclass classification. In both models the
learner guesses a classification in each round, but in the standard model the
learner recieves the correct classification after each guess, while in the
bandit model the learner is only told whether or not their guess is correct in
each round. For any set $F$ of multiclass classifiers, define $opt_{std}(F)$
and $opt_{bandit}(F)$ to be the optimal worst-case number of prediction
mistakes in the standard and bandit models respectively.
  Long (Theoretical Computer Science, 2020) claimed that for all $M > 2$ and
infinitely many $k$, there exists a set $F$ of functions from a set $X$ to a
set $Y$ of size $k$ such that $opt_{std}(F) = M$ and $opt_{bandit}(F) \ge (1 -
o(1))(|Y|\ln{|Y|})opt_{std}(F)$. The proof of this result depended on the
following lemma, which is false e.g. for all prime $p \ge 5$, $s = \mathbf{1}$
(the all $1$ vector), $t = \mathbf{2}$ (the all $2$ vector), and all $z$.
  Lemma: Fix $n \ge 2$ and prime $p$, and let $u$ be chosen uniformly at random
from $\left\{0, \dots, p-1\right\}^n$. For any $s, t \in \left\{1, \dots,

z \mod p) = \frac{1}{p}$.
  We show that this lemma is false precisely when $s$ and $t$ are multiples of
each other mod $p$. Then using a new lemma, we fix Long's proof.

This paper attempts to reduce the gap between robot and human perception by
introducing a novel representation, a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph(DSG), that
seamlessly captures metric and semantic aspects of a dynamic environment. A DSG
is a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at different levels
of abstraction, and edges represent spatio-temporal relations among nodes. Our

method searches for a single predictive pattern in the pixel space to represent
the knowledge learned by the model for each class. Based on the proposed
method, we show that DNNs trained on natural (clean) data learn abstract shapes
along with some texture, and backdoored models learn a suspicious pattern for
the backdoored class. Interestingly, the phenomenon that DNNs can learn a
single predictive pattern for each class indicates that DNNs can learn a
backdoor even from clean data, and the pattern itself is a backdoor trigger. In
the adversarial setting, we show that adversarially trained models tend to
learn more simplified shape patterns. Our method can serve as a useful tool to
better understand the knowledge learned by DNNs on different datasets under

personal privacy by local data processing at each client. However, relying on a
centralized server for model aggregation, standard FL is vulnerable to server
malfunctions, untrustworthy server, and external attacks. To address this
issue, we propose a decentralized FL framework by integrating blockchain into
FL, namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL). In
a round of the proposed BLADE-FL, each client broadcasts the trained model to
other clients, aggregates its own model with received ones, and then competes
to generate a block before its local training of the next round. We evaluate
the learning performance of BLADE-FL, and develop an upper bound on the global
loss function. Then we verify that this bound is convex with respect to the
number of overall aggregation rounds K, and optimize the computing resource
allocation for minimizing the upper bound. We also note that there is a
critical problem of training deficiency, caused by lazy clients who plagiarize
others' trained models and add artificial noises to disguise their cheating
behaviors. Focusing on this problem, we explore the impact of lazy clients on
the learning performance of BLADE-FL, and characterize the relationship among
the optimal K, the learning parameters, and the proportion of lazy clients.
Based on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we show that the experimental
results are consistent with the analytical ones. To be specific, the gap
between the developed upper bound and experimental results is lower than 5%,

function.

obtained via actual hardware sensors may include noise, misinterpretation, or
failed observations. The learning instability caused by these unstable signals
is a problem that remains to be solved in DRL. In this work, we propose an
approach that extends existing DRL models by adding a subtask to directly
estimate the variance contained in the reward signal. The model then takes the
feature map learned by the subtask in a critic network and sends it to the
actor network. This enables stable learning that is robust to the effects of
potential noise. The results of experiments in the Atari game domain with
unstable reward signals show that our method stabilizes training convergence.
We also discuss the extensibility of the model by visualizing feature maps.
This approach has the potential to make DRL more practical for use in noisy,

  One-way Relay Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we study a classic robust design problem in two-hop one-way
relay system. We are particularly interested in the scenario where channel
uncertainty exists in both the transmitter-to-relay and relay-to-receiver
links. By considering the problem design that minimizes the average
amplify-and-forward power budget at the relay side while satisfying SNR outage
requirements, an outage-constrained robust design problem involving quartic
perturbations is formulated to guarantee the robustness during transmission.
This problem is in general difficult as it involves constraints on the tail
probability of a high-order polynomial. Herein, we resort to moment inequality
and Bernstein-type inequality to tackle this problem, which provide convex
restrictions, or safe approximations, of the original design. We also analyze
the relative tightness of the two safe approximations for a quadratic
perturbation-based outage constrained problem. Our analysis shows that the
Bernstein-type inequality approach is less conservative than the moment
inequality approach when the outage rate is within some prescribed regime. To
our best knowledge, this is the first provable tightness result for these two
safe approximations. Our numerical simulations verify the superiority of the
robust design and corroborate the tightness results.

be powered by the birth, and hydrodynamic evolution, of magnetars from compact
binary coalescence events. If the rotation and magnetic axes of the system are
not orthogonal to each other, the star will undergo free precession, leading to
fluctuations in the luminosity of the source. In some cases, precession-induced
modulations in the spin-down power may be discernible in the X-ray flux of the
plateau. In this work, 25 X-ray light curves associated with bursts exhibiting
a plateau are fitted to luminosity profiles appropriate for precessing, oblique
rotators. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion, 16 (64 per cent) of the
magnetars within the sample display either moderate or strong evidence for
precession. Additionally, since the precession period of the star is directly
tied to its quadrupolar ellipticity, the fits allow for an independent measure
of the extent to which the star is deformed by internal stresses. Assuming
these deformations arise due to a mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic field, we
find that the distribution of magnetic-energy ratios is bimodal, with data
points clustering around energetically equal and toroidally dominated
partitions. Implications of this result for gravitational-wave emission and
dynamo activity in newborn magnetars are discussed.

proposed methodology involves decomposition of interconnected systems into
smaller subsystems and leverages the notion of control sub-barrier certificates
of subsystems, enabling one to construct control barrier certificates of
interconnected systems by employing some max-type small-gain conditions. The
main goal is to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing complex logic
properties including the ones represented by the accepting language of
deterministic finite automata, while providing probabilistic guarantees on the
satisfaction of given specifications in bounded-time horizons. To do so, we
propose a systematic approach to first decompose high-level specifications into
simple reachability tasks by utilizing automata corresponding to the complement
of specifications. We then construct control sub-barrier certificates and
synthesize local controllers for those simpler tasks and combine them to obtain
a hybrid controller that ensures satisfaction of the complex specification with
some lower bound on the probability of satisfaction. To compute control
sub-barrier certificates and corresponding local controllers, we provide two
systematic approaches based on sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program and
counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) framework. We finally apply
our proposed techniques to two physical case studies.

also plays an important role in the evolution of social networks, has not been

network greatly contributes to the network analysis that uncovers more latent
relations between nodes. In this work, we assume that there are two kinds of
relations between nodes, namely long-term relation and short-term relation, and
we propose an effective algorithm called LULS for temporal link prediction and
unlink prediction based on such relations. Specifically, for each snapshot of a
dynamic network, LULS first collects higher-order structure as two topological
matrices by applying short random walks. Then, LULS initializes and optimizes a
global matrix and a sequence of temporary matrices for all the snapshots by
using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based on the topological
matrices, where the global matrix denotes long-term relation and the temporary
matrices represent short-term relations of snapshots. Finally, LULS calculates
the similarity matrix of the future snapshot and predicts the links and unlinks
for the future network. Additionally, we further improve the prediction results
by using graph regularization constraints to enhance the global matrix,
resulting that the global matrix contains a wealth of topological information
and temporal information. The conducted experiments on real-world networks
illustrate that LULS outperforms other baselines for both link prediction and

a reflection-angle-based cascaded channel model by adopting the generalized
Snell's law, in which the dimension of the variable space involved in
optimization is significantly reduced, resulting in a simplified hierarchical
passive beamforming (HPB) design. We develop an efficient two-stage HPB
algorithm, which exploits the angular domain property of the channel, to
maximize the achievable rate of the target user. Simulation results demonstrate
the appealing performance and low complexity of the proposed HPB design.

Unlike the traditional spectral stacking technique, which stacks
one-dimensional spectra extracted from data cubes, we examine a method based on
image domain stacks which makes deconvolution possible. To test the validity of
this assumption, we mock a sample of 3622 equatorial galaxies extracted from
the GAMA survey, recently imaged as part of a DINGO-VLA project. We first
examine the accuracy of the method using a noise-free simulation and note that
the stacked image and flux estimation are dramatically improved compared to
traditional stacking. The extracted H\,\textsc{i} mass from the deconvolved
image agrees with the average input mass to within 3\%. However, with
traditional spectral stacking, the derived H\,\textsc{i} is incorrect by
greater than a factor of 2. For a more realistic case of a stack with finite
S/N, we also produced 20 different noise realisations to closely mimic the
properties of the DINGO-VLA interferometric survey. We recovered the predicted
average H\,\textsc{i} mass to within $\sim$4\%. Compared with traditional
spectral stacking, this technique extends the range of science applications
where stacking can be used, and is especially useful for characterizing the
emission from extended sources with interferometers.

become a critical concern, since explainable decisions are preferred in
high-stake scenarios. Current interpretation techniques mainly focus on the
feature attribution perspective, which are limited in indicating why and how
particular explanations are related to the prediction. To this end, an
intriguing class of explanations, named counterfactuals, has been developed to
further explore the ""what-if"" circumstances for interpretation, and enables the
reasoning capability on black-box models. However, generating counterfactuals
for raw data instances (i.e., text and image) is still in the early stage due
to its challenges on high data dimensionality and unsemantic raw features. In
this paper, we design a framework to generate counterfactuals specifically for
raw data instances with the proposed Attribute-Informed Perturbation (AIP). By
utilizing generative models conditioned with different attributes,
counterfactuals with desired labels can be obtained effectively and
efficiently. Instead of directly modifying instances in the data space, we
iteratively optimize the constructed attribute-informed latent space, where
features are more robust and semantic. Experimental results on real-world texts
and images demonstrate the effectiveness, sample quality as well as efficiency
of our designed framework, and show the superiority over other alternatives.
Besides, we also introduce some practical applications based on our framework,
indicating its potential beyond the model interpretability aspect.

detectable within 5~\AA~of the lateral distance from the U atom center, which
is much smaller than the distances observed in Co atoms on different surfaces,
indicating the more localized 5$f$ states than 3$d$ orbitals. By comparing with

neuronal signals and most neurological disorders are related to perturbation of
these processes. Neurostimulation by Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is a promising
technology with potential to rival other clinically-used techniques for the
investigation of brain function and treatment of numerous neurological
diseases. The purpose of this study was to characterize spatial and temporal
aspects of causal electrophysiological signals directly stimulated by short,
single pulses of focused ultrasound (FUS) on ex vivo mouse hippocampal brain
slices. Approach: MicroElectrode Arrays (MEA) are used to study the
spatio-temporal dynamics of extracellular neuronal activities both at the
single neuron and neural networks scales. Hence, MEAs provide an excellent
platform for characterization of electrical activity generated, modulated and
transmitted in response to FUS exposure. In this study, a novel mixed FUS/MEA
platform was designed for the spatio-temporal description of the causal
responses generated by single 1.78 MHz FUS pulses in ex vivo mouse hippocampal
brain slices. Main results: Our results show that FUS pulses can generate local
field potentials (LFPs), sustained by synchronized neuronal post-synaptic
potentials, and reproducing network activities. LFPs induced by FUS stimulation
were found to be repeatable to consecutive FUS pulses though exhibiting a wide
range of amplitudes (50-600 $\mu$V), durations (20-200 ms), and response delays
(10-60 ms). Moreover, LFPs were spread across the hippocampal slice following
single FUS pulses thus demonstrating that FUS may be capable of stimulating
different neural structures within the hippocampus. Significance: Current
knowledge on neurostimulation by ultrasound describes neuronal activity
generated by trains of repetitive ultrasound pulses. This novel study details
the causal neural responses produced by single-pulse FUS neurostimulation while
illustrating the distribution and propagation properties of this neural
activity along major neural pathways of the hippocampus.

TSR has already yielded general formulas for the cohomology of the tetrahedral

the physical layer security (PLS) for a RIS-aided NOMA 6G networks is
investigated, in which a RIS is deployed to assist the two ""dead zone"" NOMA
users and both internal and external eavesdropping are considered. For the
scenario with only internal eavesdropping, we consider the worst case that the
near-end user is untrusted and may try to intercept the information of far-end
user. A joint beamforming and power allocation sub-optimal scheme is proposed
to improve the system PLS. Then we extend our work to a scenario with both
internal and external eavesdropping. Two sub-scenarios are considered in this
scenario: one is the sub-scenario without channel state information (CSI) of
eavesdroppers, and another is the sub-scenario where the eavesdroppers' CSI are
available. For the both sub-scenarios, a noise beamforming scheme is introduced
to be against the external eavesdroppers. An optimal power allocation scheme is
proposed to further improve the system physical security for the second
sub-scenario. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed
schemes. Moreover, it has also been shown that increasing the number of
reflecting elements can bring more gain in secrecy performance than that of the
transmit antennas.

Numerical results show that the proposed ADEN outperforms the traditional fully
connected one, and the antenna selection scheme learned by ASN is much better

fundamental task for urban planners and administrators. Intuitively, the
potential crowd flow of the new coming site can be implied by exploring the
nearby sites. However, the transportation modes of nearby sites (e.g. bus
stations, bicycle stations) might be different from the target site (e.g.
subway station), which results in severe data scarcity issues. To this end, we
propose a data driven approach, named MOHER, to predict the potential crowd
flow in a certain mode for a new planned site. Specifically, we first identify
the neighbor regions of the target site by examining the geographical proximity
as well as the urban function similarity. Then, to aggregate these
heterogeneous relations, we devise a cross-mode relational GCN, a novel
relation-specific transformation model, which can learn not only the
correlations but also the differences between different transportation modes.
Afterward, we design an aggregator for inductive potential flow representation.
Finally, an LTSM module is used for sequential flow prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the MOHER
framework compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

difference between social cohesion and task cohesion in promoting the evolution
of cooperation in group interactions. Players engage in public goods games and
are allowed to leave their groups if too many defections occur. Both social
cohesion and task cohesion may prevent players from leaving. While a higher
level of social cohesion increases a player's tolerance towards defections,
task cohesion is associated with her group performance in the past. With a
higher level of task cohesion, it is more likely that a dissatisfied player
will refer to the history and remains in her group if she was satisfied in the
past. Our results reveal that social cohesion is detrimental to the evolution
of cooperation while task cohesion facilitates it. This is because social
cohesion hinders the conditional dissociation mechanism but task cohesion
improves the robustness of cooperative groups which are usually vulnerable to
mistakes. We also discuss other potential aspects of cohesion and how they can
be investigated through our modelling. Overall, our analysis provides novel
insights into the relationship between group cohesion and group performance
through studying the group dynamics and suggests further application of

investigate different large-scale magnetic fields with their effects on the
standing shocks and on the stratified jet morphology. Secondly, we study the
interaction of a moving shock wave with the standing shocks. We calculate the
synthetic synchrotron maps and radio light curves and analyse the variability
at two frequencies 1 and 15.3 GHz and for several observation angles. Finally,
we compare the characteristics of our simulated light curves with radio flares
observed from the blazar 3C 273 with OVRO and VLBA in the MOJAVE survey between
2008 and 2019. We find that, in a structured, over-pressured relativistic jet,
the presence of the large-scale magnetic field structure changes the properties
of the standing shock waves and leads to an opening of the jet. When crossing
such standing shocks, moving shock waves accompanying overdensities injected in
the base of the jet are causing very luminous radio flares. The observation of
the temporal structure of these flares under different viewing angles probes
the jet at different optical depths. At 1 GHz and for small angles, the
self-absorption caused by the moving shock wave becomes more important and
leads to a drop in the observed flux after it interacts with the brightest
standing knot. A weak asymmetry is seen in the shape of the simulated flares,
resulting from the remnant emission of the shocked standing shocks. The
characteristics of the simulated flares and the correlation of peaks in the
light curve with the crossing of moving and standing shocks favor this scenario
as an explanation of the observed radio flares of 3C 273.

disease, and metabolic conditions. In this work, six measurements of body
composition and adipose tissues were automatically estimated by image-based,
deep regression with ResNet50 neural networks from neck-to-knee body MRI.
Despite the potential for high speed and accuracy, these networks produce no
output segmentations that could indicate the reliability of individual
measurements. The presented experiments therefore examine uncertainty
quantification with mean-variance regression and ensembling to estimate
individual measurement errors and thereby identify potential outliers,
anomalies, and other failure cases automatically. In 10-fold cross-validation
on data of about 8,500 subjects, mean-variance regression and ensembling showed
complementary benefits, reducing the mean absolute error across all predictions
by 12%. Both improved the calibration of uncertainties and their ability to
identify high prediction errors. With intra-class correlation coefficients
(ICC) above 0.97, all targets except the liver fat content yielded relative
measurement errors below 5%. Testing on another 1,000 subjects showed
consistent performance, and the method was finally deployed for inference to
30,000 subjects with missing reference values. The results indicate that deep
regression ensembles could ultimately provide automated, uncertainty-aware
measurements of body composition for more than 120,000 UK Biobank neck-to-knee
body MRI that are to be acquired within the coming years.

TIP4P/2005. Bulk diffusion, diffusion permeability and osmotic permeability are
computed and compared among all models. The results show that there are
significant differences between TIP3P (a particularly widespread model for
simulations of biological systems), and the more recently developed TIP4P/2005
and OPC models. We demonstrate that OPC and TIP4P/2005 reproduce protein-water
interactions and dynamics in excellent agreement with experimental data. From
this study, we find that the choice of the water model has a significant effect
on the computed water dynamics as well as its molecular behaviour within a
biological nanopore.

ElectroEncephaloGraphy is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because
of its non-invasive nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic,
the performance of existing systems is still far from ideal, due to the
difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals. BCI systems
are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal pre-processing,
feature extraction and decision making. In this paper, we define a BCI
Framework, named Enhanced Fusion Framework, where we propose three different
ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks. Firstly, we include aan
additional pre-processing step of the signal: a differentiation of the EEG
signal that makes it time-invariant. Secondly, we add an additional frequency
band as feature for the system and we show its effect on the performance of the
system. Finally, we make a profound study of how to make the final decision in
the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of different
classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical
aggregations, Choquet and Sugeno integrals and their extensions and overlap
functions) to fuse the information given by the considered classifiers. We have
tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers performing motor
imagery-based brain-computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new

where fine-tuned PTMs can be easily controlled by backdoor attacks in arbitrary
downstream tasks. Specifically, attackers can add a simple pre-training task,
which restricts the output representations of trigger instances to pre-defined
vectors, namely neuron-level backdoor attack (NeuBA). If the backdoor
functionality is not eliminated during fine-tuning, the triggers can make the
fine-tuned model predict fixed labels by pre-defined vectors. In the
experiments of both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV),
we show that NeuBA absolutely controls the predictions for trigger instances

calibrating motion-related features of individual pedestrian and clustering
them into groups. We analyze two clustering approaches. The calibration and
evaluation of our model are performed on three different shared space data
sets. The results indicate that our model can realistically simulate a wide

account for both $H \parallel c$ axis and $H \parallel ab$ plane. A crossover
from the low-$H$ quadratic to the high-$H$ quasi-linear behavior is observed in

learning on recognition of OAM modes through atmospheric turbulence. However,
there are several limitations in previous deep learning recognition methods.
They all require a constant distance between the laser and receiver, which
makes them clumsy and not practical. As far as we know, previous deep learning
methods cannot sort vortex beams with positive and negative topological
charges, which can reduce information capacity. A Multidimensional Information
Assisted Deep Learning Flexible Recognition (MIADLFR) method is proposed in
this letter. In MIADLR we utilize not only the intensity profile, also spectrum
information to recognize OAM modes unlimited by distance and sign of
topological charge (TC). As far as we know, we first make use of
multidimensional information to recognize OAM modes and we first utilize
spectrum information to recognize OAM modes. Recognition of OAM modes unlimited
by distance and sign of TC achieved by MIADLFR method can make optical
communication and detection by OAM light much more attractive.

exceptionally small in the Solar System, or if it could grow in the future and
reach values comparable to those of the other giant planets.
  Methods: The spin axis of Jupiter is subject to the gravitational torques
from its regular satellites and from the Sun. These torques evolve over time
due to the long-term variations of its orbit and to the migration of its
satellites. With numerical simulations, we explore the future evolution of
Jupiter's spin axis for different values of its moment of inertia and for
different migration rates of its satellites. Analytical formulas show the
location and properties of all relevant resonances.
  Results: Because of the migration of the Galilean satellites, Jupiter's
obliquity is currently increasing, as it adiabatically follows the drift of a
secular spin-orbit resonance with the nodal precession mode of Uranus. Using
the current estimates of the migration rate of the satellites, the obliquity of
Jupiter can reach values ranging from 6{\deg} to 37{\deg} after 5 Gyrs from
now, according to the precise value of its polar moment of inertia. A faster
migration for the satellites would produce a larger increase in obliquity, as
long as the drift remains adiabatic.
  Conclusions: Despite its peculiarly small current value, the obliquity of
Jupiter is no different from other obliquities in the Solar System: It is
equally sensitive to secular spin-orbit resonances and it will probably reach
comparable values in the future.

performed a Principal Component Analysis, where 81.2% of the variance can be
explained by the first three principal components drawn from the FWHMs,
luminosity, and equivalent widths. The first principal component (PC1) is
primarily driven by the combination of black hole mass and luminosity with a
significance over 99.9%, which in turn is reflected in the strong correlation
of the PC1 with the Eddington ratio. The observational correlations are better
represented by the Eddington ratio, thus it could be the primary mechanism
behind the strong correlations observed in the CaII-FeII sample. Since calcium
belongs to the $\alpha$-elements, the FeII/CaII flux ratio can be used as a
chemical clock for determining the metal content in AGN and trace the evolution
of the host galaxies. We confirm the de-enhancement of the ratio FeII/CaII by
the Eddington ratio, suggesting a metal enrichment of the BLR in

of time-dependent numerical PDEs, allowing for the efficient use of additional
MPI processes when spatial parallelism saturates. Most methods treat the
solution and parallelism in space and time separately. In contrast, all-at-once
methods solve the full space-time system directly, largely treating time as
simply another spatial dimension. All-at-once methods offer a number of
benefits over separate treatment of space and time, most notably significantly
increased parallelism and faster time-to-solution (when applicable). However,
the development of fast, scalable all-at-once methods has largely been limited
to time-dependent (advection-)diffusion problems. This paper introduces the
concept of space-time block preconditioning for the all-at-once solution of
incompressible flow. By extending well-known concepts of spatial block
preconditioning to the space-time setting, we develop a block preconditioner
whose application requires the solution of a space-time (advection-)diffusion
equation in the velocity block, coupled with a pressure Schur complement
approximation consisting of independent spatial solves at each time-step, and a
space-time matrix-vector multiplication. The new method is tested on four
classical models in incompressible flow. Results indicate perfect scalability
in refinement of spatial and temporal mesh spacing, perfect scalability in
nonlinear Picard iterations count when applied to a nonlinear Navier-Stokes
problem, and minimal overhead in terms of number of preconditioner applications

systems in which a BS serves multiple users via a shared wireless medium. In
order to fully exploit the spatial diversity while minimizing the passive
energy consumed by radio frequency (RF) components, the BS is equipped with M
RF chains and N antennas, where M < N. Upon receiving pilot sequences to obtain
the channel state information, the BS determines the best subset of M antennas
for serving the users. We propose a joint antenna selection and precoding
design (JASPD) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate subject to a transmit
power constraint and QoS requirements. The JASPD overcomes the non-convexity of
the formulated problem via a doubly iterative algorithm, in which an inner loop
successively optimizes the precoding vectors, followed by an outer loop that
tries all valid antenna subsets. Although approaching the (near) global
optimality, the JASPD suffers from a combinatorial complexity, which may limit
its application in real-time network operations. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a learning-based antenna selection and precoding design algorithm
(L-ASPA), which employs a DNN to establish underlaying relations between the
key system parameters and the selected antennas. The proposed L-ASPD is robust
against the number of users and their locations, BS's transmit power, as well
as the small-scale channel fading. With a well-trained learning model, it is
shown that the L-ASPD significantly outperforms baseline schemes based on the
block diagonalization and a learning-assisted solution for broadcasting systems
and achieves higher effective sum rate than that of the JASPA under limited
processing time. In addition, we observed that the proposed L-ASPD can reduce
the computation complexity by 95% while retaining more than 95% of the optimal

119 local ($z < 0.3$) active galactic nuclei (AGN). This atlas includes AGN of
5 subtypes: 22 are Seyfert 1; 5 are intermediate Seyferts; 46 are Seyfert 2; 26
are LINERs; and 20 are composites/starbursts. Each AGN was observed with VLT
ISAAC in the $L$- and/or $M$-bands between 2000 and 2013. We detect at
3$\sigma$ confidence 92 sources in the $L$-band and 83 sources in the $M$-band.
We separate the flux into unresolved nuclear flux and resolved flux through
two-Gaussian fitting. We report the nuclear flux, extended flux, apparent size,
and position angle of each source, giving $3\sigma$ upper-limits for sources
which are undetected. Using WISE W1- and W2-band photometry we derive relations
predicting the nuclear $L$ and $M$ fluxes for Sy1 and Sy2 AGN based on their
W1-W2 color and WISE fluxes. Lastly, we compare the measured mid-infrared
colors to those predicted by dusty torus models SKIRTOR, CLUMPY, CAT3D, and
CAT3D-WIND, finding best agreement with the latter. We find that models
including polar winds best reproduce the 3-5$\mu$m colors, indicating that
winds are an important component of dusty torus models. We find that several
AGN are bluer than models predict. We discuss several explanations for this and
find that it is most plausibly stellar light contamination within the ISAAC
$L$-band nuclear fluxes.

common problems faced by people with dementia. One of the key challenges in the
management of these conditions is early detection and timely intervention in
order to reduce distress and avoid unplanned hospital admissions. Using in-home
sensing technologies and machine learning models for sensor data integration
and analysis provides opportunities to detect and predict clinically
significant events and changes in health status. We have developed an
integrated platform to collect in-home sensor data and performed an
observational study to apply machine learning models for agitation and UTI risk
analysis. We collected a large dataset from 88 participants with a mean age of
82 and a standard deviation of 6.5 (47 females and 41 males) to evaluate a new
deep learning model that utilises attention and rational mechanism. The
proposed solution can process a large volume of data over a period of time and
extract significant patterns in a time-series data (i.e. attention) and use the
extracted features and patterns to train risk analysis models (i.e. rational).
The proposed model can explain the predictions by indicating which time-steps
and features are used in a long series of time-series data. The model provides
a recall of 91\% and precision of 83\% in detecting the risk of agitation and
UTIs. This model can be used for early detection of conditions such as UTIs and
managing of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation in association with
initial treatment and early intervention approaches. In our study we have
developed a set of clinical pathways for early interventions using the alerts
generated by the proposed model and a clinical monitoring team has been set up
to use the platform and respond to the alerts according to the created
intervention plans.

commonly used heuristic to ensure that the learned policy explores the

primary motivation for using entropy is for exploration and disambiguating
optimal policies; however, the theoretical effects are not entirely understood.
In this work, we study the more general regularized RL objective and using
Fenchel duality; we derive the dual problem which takes the form of an

found by a regularized objective is precisely an optimal policy of a
reinforcement learning problem under a worst-case adversarial reward. Our
result allows us to reinterpret the popular entropic regularization scheme as a

behavior in a magnetic field is unique. A magnetic field applied in the basal
plane of the tetragonal crystal structure induces two additional phase
transitions. When the magnetic field is applied along, or close to, the $c$
axis, a new phase characterized by a pronounced in-plane electronic anisotropy
emerges at $B^* \approx$ 30 T, well below the critical field, $B_c \simeq$ 50
T, to suppress the antiferromagnetic order. The exact origin of this new phase,
originally suggested to be an electronic-nematic state, remains elusive. Here
we report low-temperature specific-heat measurements in CeRhIn$_5$ in high
static magnetic fields up to 36 T applied along both the $a$ and $c$ axes. For
fields applied along the $a$ axis, we confirmed the previously suggested phase
diagram, and extended it to higher fields. This allowed us to observe a triple
point at $\sim$ 30 T, where the first-order transition from an incommensurate
to commensurate magnetic structure merges into the onset of the second-order
antiferromagnetic transition. For fields applied along the $c$ axis, we
observed a small but distinct anomaly at $B^*$, which we discuss in terms of a
possible field-induced transition, probably weakly first-order. We further
suggest that the transition corresponds to a change of magnetic structure. We
revise magnetic phase diagrams of CeRhIn$_5$ for both principal orientations of
the magnetic field based entirely on thermodynamic anomalies.

vision tasks due to inevitable noise corruption during image acquisition.
Traditionally, many researchers have investigated image priors for the
denoising, within the Bayesian perspective based on image properties and
statistics. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown
great success in image denoising by incorporating large-scale synthetic
datasets. However, they both have pros and cons. While the deep CNNs are
powerful for removing the noise with known statistics, they tend to lack
flexibility and practicality for the blind and real-world noise. Moreover, they
cannot easily employ explicit priors. On the other hand, traditional
non-learning methods can involve explicit image priors, but they require
considerable computation time and cannot exploit large-scale external datasets.
In this paper, we present a CNN-based method that leverages the advantages of
both methods based on the Bayesian perspective. Concretely, we divide the blind
image denoising problem into sub-problems and conquer each inference problem
separately. As the CNN is a powerful tool for inference, our method is rooted
in CNNs and propose a novel design of network for efficient inference. With our
proposed method, we can successfully remove blind and real-world noise, with a
moderate number of parameters of universal CNN.

long times (up to $t = 10^5$). We find that, in the $t \to \infty$ limit, the
many-body localization (MBL) is always destroyed within the TDHF approximation.
At the same time, this approximation provides important information on the
long-time character of dynamics in the ergodic side of the MBL transition.
Specifically, for one-dimensional (1D) disordered chains, we find slow
power-law transport up to the longest times, supporting the rare-region
(Griffiths) picture. The information on this subdiffusive dynamics is obtained
by the analysis of three different observables - temporal decay $\sim
t^{-\beta}$ of real-space and energy-space imbalances as well as domain wall
melting - which all yield consistent results. For two-dimensional (2D) systems,
the decay is faster than a power law, in consistency with theoretical
predictions that $\beta$ grows as $\log t$ for the decay governed by rare
regions. At longest times and moderately strong disorder, $\beta$ approaches
the limiting value $\beta=1$ corresponding to 2D diffusion. In quasi-periodic
(Aubry-Andr\'e) 1D systems, where rare regions are absent, we find considerably
faster decay that reaches the ballistic value $\beta=1$, which provides further

the utilization of elastic computational resources, such as the cloud. It
enables the provisioning and de-provisioning of resources to match dynamic
resource availability and demands. In the case of distributed graph processing,
changing the number of the graph partitions while maintaining high partitioning
quality imposes serious computational overheads as typically a time-consuming
graph partitioning algorithm needs to execute each time repartitioning is
required. In this paper, we propose a dynamic scaling method that can
efficiently change the number of graph partitions while keeping its quality
high. Our idea is based on two techniques: preprocessing and very fast edge
partitioning, called graph edge ordering and chunk-based edge partitioning,
respectively. The former converts the graph data into an ordered edge list in
such a way that edges with high locality are closer to each other. The latter
immediately divides the ordered edge list into an arbitrary number of
high-quality partitions. The evaluation with the real-world billion-scale
graphs demonstrates that our proposed approach significantly reduces the
repartitioning time, while the partitioning quality it achieves is on par with
that of the best existing static method.

states confined at the AB/BA and BA/AB type domain walls exhibit different

result, distinct refraction behaviors, especially through an armchair cut edge,
are observed. On the other hand, the decay depth of these localized topological
modes, which is found to be solely determined by the relative resonant strength
between the scatterers, significantly affects the refraction patterns. More
interestingly, the outgoing traveling wave through a zigzag interface becomes
evanescent when operating at deep sub-wavelength scale. This is realized by
tuning the average resonant strength. We show that the evanescent modes only
exist along a particular type of outlet edge, and that they can couple with
both topological interface states. We also present two designs of topological

drawn much attention recently. Previous methods have shown their success in
face parsing, which however overlook the correlation among facial components.
As a matter of fact, the component-wise relationship is a critical clue in
discriminating ambiguous pixels in facial area. To address this issue, we
propose adaptive graph representation learning and reasoning over facial
components, aiming to learn representative vertices that describe each
component, exploit the component-wise relationship and thereby produce accurate
parsing results against ambiguity. In particular, we devise an adaptive and
differentiable graph abstraction method to represent the components on a graph
via pixel-to-vertex projection under the initial condition of a predicted
parsing map, where pixel features within a certain facial region are aggregated
onto a vertex. Further, we explicitly incorporate the image edge as a prior in
the model, which helps to discriminate edge and non-edge pixels during the
projection, thus leading to refined parsing results along the edges. Then, our
model learns and reasons over the relations among components by propagating
information across vertices on the graph. Finally, the refined vertex features
are projected back to pixel grids for the prediction of the final parsing map.
To train our model, we propose a discriminative loss to penalize small
distances between vertices in the feature space, which leads to distinct
vertices with strong semantics. Experimental results show the superior
performance of the proposed model on multiple face parsing datasets, along with
the validation on the human parsing task to demonstrate the generalizability of
our model.

  Computing and Applications Journal",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Facial image inpainting is a challenging problem as it requires generating
new pixels that include semantic information for masked key components in a
face, e.g., eyes and nose. Recently, remarkable methods have been proposed in
this field. Most of these approaches use encoder-decoder architectures and have
different limitations such as allowing unique results for a given image and a
particular mask. Alternatively, some optimization-based approaches generate
promising results using different masks with generator networks. However, these
approaches are computationally more expensive. In this paper, we propose an
efficient solution to the facial image inpainting problem using the Cyclic
Reverse Generator (CRG) architecture, which provides an encoder-generator
model. We use the encoder to embed a given image to the generator space and
incrementally inpaint the masked regions until a plausible image is generated;
we trained a discriminator model to assess the quality of the generated images
during the iterations and determine the convergence. After the generation
process, for the post-processing, we utilize a Unet model that we trained
specifically for this task to remedy the artifacts close to the mask
boundaries. We empirically observed that only a few iterations are sufficient
to generate realistic images with the proposed model. Since the models are not
trained for particular mask types, our method allows applying sketch-based
inpaintings, using a variety of mask types, and producing multiple and diverse
results. We compared our method with the state-of-the-art models both
quantitatively and qualitatively, and observed that our method can compete with
the other models in all mask types; it is particularly better in images where
larger masks are utilized. Our code, dataset and models are available at:

functions of infinite words over an infinite alphabet (data $\omega$-words).
The notion of computability is defined through Turing machines with infinite
inputs which can produce the corresponding infinite outputs in the limit. We
use non-deterministic transducers equipped with registers, an extension of
register automata with outputs, to describe specifications. Being
non-deterministic, such transducers may not define functions but more generally
relations of data $\omega$-words. In order to increase the expressive power of
these machines, we even allow guessing of arbitrary data values when updating
their registers.
  For functions over data $\omega$-words, we identify a sufficient condition
(the possibility of determining the next letter to be outputted, which we call
next letter problem) under which computability (resp. uniform computability)
and continuity (resp. uniform continuity) coincide.
  We focus on two kinds of data domains: first, the general setting of
oligomorphic data, which encompasses any data domain with equality, as well as
the setting of rational numbers with linear order; and second, the set of
natural numbers equipped with linear order. For both settings, we prove that
functionality, i.e. determining whether the relation recognized by the
transducer is actually a function, is decidable. We also show that the
so-called next letter problem is decidable, yielding equivalence between
(uniform) continuity and (uniform) computability. Last, we provide
characterizations of (uniform) continuity, which allow us to prove that these
notions, and thus also (uniform) computability, are decidable. We even show
that all these decision problems are PSpace-complete for $(\mathbb{N},<)$ and
for a large class of oligomorphic data domains, including for instance
$(\mathbb{Q},<)$.

theoretically, numerically and experimentally, patterns constructed from
regions of radial and circular director, which, in isolation, would form cones

cross-sections, associated with the boundaries between regions in the patterns.
Such ridges may be created in positively and negatively curved variants and,
since they bear Gauss curvature (quantified here via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem),
they cannot be flattened without energetically prohibitive stretch. Our
experiments and numerics highlight that, although such ridges cannot be
flattened isometrically, they can deform isometrically by trading the
(singular) curvature of the V angle against the (finite) curvature of the ridge
line. Furthermore, in finite thickness sheets, the sharp ridges are inevitably
non-isometrically blunted to relieve bend, resulting in a modest smearing out
of the encoded singular Gauss curvature. We close by discussing the use of such

cache-hits and the switching cost due to the file fetches. The main
contribution of this paper is the switching regret analysis of a Follow the
Perturbed Leader-based anytime caching policy, which is shown to have an order
optimal switching regret. In this pursuit, we improve the best-known switching
regret bound for this problem by a factor of $\Theta(\sqrt{C}).$ We conclude
the paper by comparing the performance of different popular caching policies

atoms including the Heisenberg spins harmonically vibrates perpendicularly to
the chain axis, while the nodal atoms involving the Ising spins are placed at
rigid positions when ignoring their lattice vibrations. An effect of the
magnetoelastic coupling on a ground state and finite-temperature properties is
particularly investigated close to a triple coexistence point depending on a
spring-stiffness constant ascribed to the Heisenberg interaction. The
magnetoelastic nature of the Heisenberg dimers is reflected through a non-null
plateau of the entropy emergent in a low-temperature region, whereas the
specific heat displays an anomalous peak slightly below the temperature region
corresponding to the entropy plateau. The magnetization also exhibits a plateau
in the same temperature region at almost saturated value before it gradually
tends to zero upon increasing of temperature. The magnetic susceptibility
displays within the plateau region an inverse temperature dependence, which
slightly drops above this plateau, whereas an inverse temperature dependence is
repeatedly recovered at high enough temperatures.

finite Teff the convergence of the energy to the thermodynamic limit is indeed
shown to be possible in the Hubbard model already for relatively small square
lattices with linear dimension L ~10, thanks to appropriate averages over
several twisted boundary conditions. Within the estimated energy accuracy of
the proposed variational ansatz, two clear phases are identified, as the energy
is lowered by spontaneously breaking some symmetries satisfied by the Hubbard
Hamiltonian: a) a stripe phase where both spin and translation symmetries are
broken, and b) a strong coupling d-wave superconducting phase when the particle
number is not conserved and global U(1) symmetry is broken. On the other hand
the symmetric phase is stable in a wide region at large doping and small

because pattern shape correlates with water availability, they have been
suggested as important indicators of ecosystem health. However, the mechanisms
underlying pattern emergence remain unclear. Some theories hypothesize that
patterns could result from a water-mediated scale-dependent feedback (SDF)
whereby interactions favoring plant growth dominate at short distances and
growth-inhibitory interactions dominate in the long range. However, we know
little about how the presence of a focal plant affects the fitness of its
neighbors as a function of the inter-individual distance, which is expected to
be highly ecosystem-dependent. This lack of empirical knowledge and system
dependency challenge the relevance of SDF as a unifying theory for vegetation
pattern formation. Assuming that plant interactions are always inhibitory and
only their intensity is scale-dependent, alternative theories also recover the
typical vegetation patterns observed in nature. Importantly, although these
alternative hypotheses lead to visually indistinguishable patterns, they
predict contrasting desertification dynamics, which questions the potential use
of vegetation patterns as ecosystem-state indicators. To help resolve this
issue, we first review existing theories for vegetation self-organization and
their conflicting predictions about desertification dynamics. Second, we
discuss potential empirical tests via manipulative experiments to identify
pattern-forming mechanisms and link them to specific desertification dynamics.
A comprehensive view of models, the mechanisms they intend to capture, and
experiments to test them in the field will help to better understand both how
patterns emerge and improve predictions on the fate of the ecosystems where
they form.

precise, tool independent, and at a high level of abstraction, and can model

a new technique for synthesizing hybrid automaton from the input-output traces

behaviors is the main challenge for extracting such models. We address this
problem by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping technique. Our approach is
passive, meaning that it does not need interaction with the system during
automata synthesis from the logged traces; and online, which means that each
input/output trace is used only once in the procedure. In other words, each new
trace can be used to improve the already synthesized automaton. We evaluated
our algorithm in two industrial and simulated case studies. The accuracy of the
derived automata show promising results.

optimization method such as the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) or the
latest continuation method such as Ptctr \cite{LLS2020}, which needs to solve a
quadratic programming subproblem (SQP) or a linear system of equations (Ptctr).
Thus, Eptctr can save much more computational time than SQP or Ptctr. Numerical
results also show that the consumed time of EPtctr is about one tenth of that
of Ptctr or one fifteenth to 0.4 percent of that of SQP. Furthermore, Eptctr
can save the storage space of an $(n+m) \times (n+m)$ large-scale matrix, in
comparison to SQP. The required memory of Eptctr is about one fifth of that of
SQP. Finally, we also give the global convergence analysis of the new method

one-dimensional system in dynamical equilibrium and directly fit the number
density in the $z-v_z$ plane to what we call the Rational Linear DF (RLDF)
model. This model can be regarded as a continuous sum of isothermal DFs though
it has only one more parameter than the isothermal model. We apply our method
to a sample of giant stars from Gaia Data Release 2 and show that the RLDF
provides an excellent fit to the data. The well-known phase space spiral
emerges in the residual map of the $z-v_z$ plane. We use the best-fit potential
to plot the residuals in terms of the frequency and angle of vertical
oscillations and show that the spiral maps into a straight line. From its
slope, we estimate that the phase spirals were generated by a perturbation
$\sim540$ Myr years ago. We also determine the differential surface density as
a function of vertical velocity dispersion, a.k.a. the vertical temperature
distribution. The result is qualitatively similar to what was previously found
for SDSS/SEGUE G dwarfs. Finally, we address parameter degeneracies and the
validity of the 1D approximation. Particularly, the mid-plane density derived
from a cold subsample, where the 1D approximation is more secure, is closer to
literature values than that derived from the sample as a whole.

appear counterintuitive. Within the standard Tilman model for a single consumer
and a single resource, when a very efficient consumer rapidly eats all
available food, the resource density becomes zero, but if there is no food, how
can the consumer survive? The paradox can be lifted by realising that on the
short term indeed rapid consumption may lead to starvation and a decline in the
consumer population, but in the long term a finite resource and consumer
density remain. A single consumer living on two essential nutrients leaves the
density of the non-limiting nutrient above its critical level, so what is done
with the extra food? We explain that this does not imply extra food is
consumed, just for fun, but that in fact the food is left untouched because
there is no use for it. For a model with two consumers competing for a single
nutrient one of the consumers will eventually disappear, even if the food
economics of the surviving one is worse and there is still much food wasted.
Both are inherent aspects of the model, and the paradox can be avoided if the
difference between the consumers is small, in which case it will take very long
to reach equilibrium. We argue that in general an extended stability analysis,
in which not only the asymptotically stable state is considered, but also the
unstable steady states and all time scales involved in the transient dynamics,
can help in avoiding apparent contradictions in ecological models, or accepting
them.

By means of examples we demonstrate how the inclusion of additional processes

Striking is also the construction of a relative arbitrage opportunity which is

simulations is to introduce a potential that increases the fluctuations of
selected collective variables. For this strategy to be successful, it is
critical to choose appropriate variables. Here we review some recent
developments in the data-driven design of collective variables, with a focus on
the combination of Fisher's discriminant analysis and neural networks. This
approach allows to compress the fluctuations of metastable states into a
low-dimensional representation. We illustrate through several examples the
effectiveness of this method in accelerating the sampling, while also
identifying the physical descriptors that undergo the most significant changes
in the process.

systems are often dependent on a substantial increase in the number of model
parameters. This has led to various attempts of compressing such models, but
existing methods have not considered the differences in the predictive power of
various model components or in the generalizability of the compressed models.
To understand the connection between model compression and out-of-distribution
generalization, we define the task of compressing language representation
models such that they perform best in a domain adaptation setting. We choose to
address this problem from a causal perspective, attempting to estimate the
average treatment effect (ATE) of a model component, such as a single layer, on
the model's predictions. Our proposed ATE-guided Model Compression scheme
(AMoC), generates many model candidates, differing by the model components that
were removed. Then, we select the best candidate through a stepwise regression
model that utilizes the ATE to predict the expected performance on the target
domain. AMoC outperforms strong baselines on dozens of domain pairs across
three text classification and sequence tagging tasks.

accuracy by using Ewald splitting to replace the original Poisson equation for
nearly-singular sources with a smooth far-field Poisson equation, combined with
a localized near-field correction. Unlike existing spectral Ewald methods,
which make use of the Fourier transform in the aperiodic direction, we recast
the problem as a two-point boundary value problem in the aperiodic direction
for each transverse Fourier mode, for which exact analytic boundary conditions
are available. We solve each of these boundary value problems using a fast,
well-conditioned Chebyshev method. In the presence of dielectric jumps,
combining Ewald splitting with the classical method of images results in
smoothed charge distributions which overlap the dielectric boundaries
themselves. We show how to preserve spectral accuracy in this case through the
use of a harmonic correction which involves solving a simple Laplace equation
with smooth boundary data. We implement our method on Graphical Processing
Units, and combine our doubly-periodic Poisson solver with Brownian Dynamics to
study the equilibrium structure of double layers in binary electrolytes
confined by dielectric boundaries. Consistent with prior studies, we find
strong charge depletion near the interfaces due to repulsive interactions with
image charges, which points to the need for incorporating polarization effects
in understanding confined electrolytes, both theoretically and computationally.

had a head-on collision about 20 Myr ago. New sensitive, high-resolution
CO(1-0) observations of the Taffy system with the IRAM PdBI are presented.
About 25% of the total interferometric CO luminosity stems from the bridge
region. Assuming a Galactic N(H2)/ICO conversion factor for the galactic disks
and a third of this value for the bridge gas, about 10% of the molecular gas
mass is located in the bridge region. The giant HII region close to UGC 12915
is located at the northern edge of the high-surface brightness giant molecular
cloud association (GMA), which has the highest velocity dispersion among the
bridge GMAs. The bridge GMAs are clearly not virialized because of their high
velocity dispersion. Three dynamical models are presented and while no single
model reproduces all of the observed features, they are all present in at least
one of the models. Most of the bridge gas detected in CO does not form stars.
We suggest that turbulent adiabatic compression is responsible for the
exceptionally high velocity dispersion of the molecular ISM and the suppression
of star formation in the Taffy bridge. In this scenario the turbulent velocity
dispersion of the largest eddies and turbulent substructures/clouds increase
such that giant molecular clouds are no longer in global virial equilibrium.
The increase of the virial parameter leads to a decrease of the star formation
efficiency. Most of the low-surface density, CO-emitting gas will disperse
without forming stars but some of the high-density gas will probably collapse
and form dense star clusters, such as the luminous HII region close to UGC
12915. We suggest that globular clusters and super star clusters formed and
still form through the gravitational collapse of gas previously compressed by
turbulent adiabatic compression during galaxy interactions.

spasing regime when only chirally-matched plasmon mode is generated, while at

In one regime, only the chirally-matched plasmon mode is generated, while in

participants are known to each other from the start of the protocol execution.
In the parlance of the 'blockchain' literature, this is referred to as the
permissioned setting. What differentiates Bitcoin from these previously studied
protocols is that it operates in a permissionless setting, i.e. it is a
protocol for establishing consensus over an unknown network of participants
that anybody can join, with as many identities as they like in any role. The
arrival of this new form of protocol brings with it many questions. Beyond
Bitcoin, what can we prove about permissionless protocols in a general sense?
How does recent work on permissionless protocols in the blockchain literature
relate to the well-developed history of research on permissioned protocols in
distributed computing?
  To answer these questions, we describe a formal framework for the analysis of
both permissioned and permissionless systems. Our framework allows for
""apples-to-apples"" comparisons between different categories of protocols and,
in turn, the development of theory to formally discuss their relative merits. A
major benefit of the framework is that it facilitates the application of a rich
history of proofs and techniques in distributed computing to problems in
blockchain and the study of permissionless systems. Within our framework, we
then address the questions above. We consider the Byzantine Generals Problem as
a formalisation of the problem of reaching consensus, and address a programme
of research that asks, ""Under what adversarial conditions, and for what types
of permissionless protocol, is consensus possible?"" We prove a number of
results for this programme, our main result being that deterministic consensus
is not possible for decentralised permissionless protocols. To close, we give a
list of eight open questions.

for refining the orbital parameters of planets and illuminating their dynamical
histories. Furthermore, GRAVITY will measure non-Keplerian perturbations due to
planet-planet interactions in multi-planet systems and measure dynamical
masses. Over time, repetitive observations of the exoplanets at medium
resolution ($R=500$) will provide a catalogue of K-band spectra of
unprecedented quality, for a number of exoplanets. The K-band has the unique
properties that it contains many molecular signatures (CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$,
CO$_2$). This allows constraining precisely surface gravity, metallicity, and
temperature, if used in conjunction with self-consistent models like Exo-REM.
Further, we will use the parameter-retrieval algorithm petitRADTRANS to

devices that span distributed infrastructure. Devices used in modern data
centers (such as controllers, links, SSD- and HDD-disks) can fail due to
hardware as well as software problems. Such failures or anomalies can be
detected by monitoring the activity of components using machine learning
techniques. In order to use these techniques, researchers need plenty of
historical data of devices in normal and failure mode for training algorithms.
In this work, we challenge two problems: 1) lack of storage data in the methods
above by creating a simulator and 2) applying existing online algorithms that
can faster detect a failure occurred in one of the components.
  We created a Go-based (golang) package for simulating the behavior of modern
storage infrastructure. The software is based on the discrete-event modeling
paradigm and captures the structure and dynamics of high-level storage system
building blocks. The package's flexible structure allows us to create a model
of a real-world storage system with a configurable number of components. The
primary area of interest is exploring the storage machine's behavior under
stress testing or exploitation in the medium- or long-term for observing
failures of its components.

nuclei (SHN) reveals that the diffuseness parameter is a great bottleneck for
achieving accurate results and predictions. In particular, when universal
proximity function is adopted for nuclear potential, half-life is found to vary
significantly and nonlinearly as a function of diffuseness parameter. To
overcome this limiting hurdle, a new semiempirical formula for diffuseness that
is dependent on charge and neutron numbers is proposed in this work. With the
model at hand, half-lives of 218 SHN are computed, for 68 of which there exists
available experimental data and 150 of which are predicted. The calculations of
half-lives for 68 SHN are compared against experimental data and the calculated
data obtained by using deformed Woods-Saxon, deformed Coulomb potentials model,
and six semiempirical formulas. The predictions of 150 SHN are compared against
the predictions of seven of the current best semiempirical formulas.
Calculations of the present study are in good agreement with the experimental
half-lives outperforming all but ImSahu semiempirical formula. Moreover, the
predictions of our model are consistent with predictions of the semiempirical
formulas. We strongly conclude that more attention should be directed toward
obtaining accurate diffuseness parameter values for using it in nuclear
calculations.

provide robust and efficient approximation to a range of kinetic equations.
This is true especially if the solution is close to some asymptotic limit where
it is known that the solution is low-rank. A particularly interesting case is
the fluid dynamic limit that is commonly obtained in the limit of small Knudsen
number. However, in this case the Maxwellian which describes the corresponding
equilibrium distribution is not necessarily low-rank; because of this, the
methods known in the literature are only applicable to the weakly compressible
case. In this paper, we propose an efficient dynamical low-rank integrator that
can capture the fluid limit -- the Navier-Stokes equations -- of the
Boltzmann-BGK model even in the compressible regime. This is accomplished by
writing the solution as $f=Mg$, where $M$ is the Maxwellian and the low-rank
approximation is only applied to $g$. To efficiently implement this
decomposition within a low-rank framework requires, in the isothermal case,
that certain coefficients are evaluated using convolutions, for which fast
algorithms are known. Using the proposed decomposition also has the advantage
that the rank required to obtain accurate results is significantly reduced
compared to the previous state of the art. We demonstrate this by performing a
number of numerical experiments and also show that our method is able to
capture sharp gradients/shock waves.

  Viewpoint",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reinforcement learning, temporal difference-based algorithms can be
sample-inefficient: for instance, with sparse rewards, no learning occurs until
a reward is observed. This can be remedied by learning richer objects, such as
a model of the environment, or successor states. Successor states model the
expected future state occupancy from any given state for a given policy and are
related to goal-dependent value functions, which learn how to reach arbitrary
states. We formally derive the temporal difference algorithm for successor
state and goal-dependent value function learning, either for discrete or for
continuous environments with function approximation. Especially, we provide
finite-variance estimators even in continuous environments, where the reward
for exactly reaching a goal state becomes infinitely sparse. Successor states
satisfy more than just the Bellman equation: a backward Bellman operator and a
Bellman-Newton (BN) operator encode path compositionality in the environment.
The BN operator is akin to second-order gradient descent methods and provides
the true update of the value function when acquiring more observations, with
explicit tabular bounds. In the tabular case and with infinitesimal learning
rates, mixing the usual and backward Bellman operators provably improves
eigenvalues for asymptotic convergence, and the asymptotic convergence of the
BN operator is provably better than TD, with a rate independent from the
environment. However, the BN method is more complex and less robust to sampling
noise. Finally, a forward-backward (FB) finite-rank parameterization of
successor states enjoys reduced variance and improved samplability, provides a
direct model of the value function, has fully understood fixed points
corresponding to long-range dependencies, approximates the BN method, and
provides two canonical representations of states as a byproduct.

express their information needs during TOT states in the movie domain.
Specifically, what information do searchers remember about the item being

searchers use a combination of information about: (1) the content of the item

combinators unambiguous sum (deterministic choice), Hadamard product, and
unambiguous versions of the Cauchy product and the k-chained Kleene-star, where

captured by SD-regular expressions which are unambiguous and stabilising; (ii)
by structural induction on the unambiguous, stabilising SD-regular expressions

cells due to their broadband spectrum absorption and the requirement of current
matching of each subcell. A new design for multijunction solar cell
antireflection coatings is presented in this work in which alternative high and
low index materials are used to minimize the reflection in a broadband
(300nm-1800nm). We compared the short circuit current density of high-low
refractive index stacks designs with optimum double-layer antireflection
coatings by considering two optical materials combinations (MgF2/ZnS and
Al2O3/TiO2) for the AM0 and AM1.5D spectra. The calculations demonstrate that
for lattice-matched triple-junction solar cells and inverted metamorphic
quadruple-junction solar cells, high-low refractive index stacks outperform the
optimum double-layer antireflection coatings. The new design philosophy
requires no new optical materials because only two materials are used and
exhibits excellent performance in broadband spectra. The angle performance of
these antireflection coatings is slightly better than classical double-layers
whereas the analysis for thickness sensitivity shows that small deviations from
deposition targets only slightly impact the performance of antireflection
coatings. Finally, some technical solutions for depositing these high-low
refractive index multilayers are discussed.

effectively used to optimize neural network models. However, with the rapid
growth of big data and deep learning, SGD is no longer the most suitable choice
due to its natural behavior of sequential optimization of the error function.
This has led to the development of parallel SGD algorithms, such as
asynchronous SGD (ASGD) and synchronous SGD (SSGD) to train deep neural
networks. However, it introduces a high variance due to the delay in parameter
(weight) update. We address this delay in our proposed algorithm and try to
minimize its impact. We employed guided SGD (gSGD) that encourages consistent
examples to steer the convergence by compensating the unpredictable deviation
caused by the delay. Its convergence rate is also similar to A/SSGD, however,
some additional (parallel) processing is required to compensate for the delay.
The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach has been able

beamsplitter formed by two counterpropagating pulsed Gaussian laser beams. Even
for ultracold atomic ensembles, the transfer efficiency depends significantly
on the residual velocity of the particles as well as on losses into higher
diffraction orders. Additional aberrations are caused by the spatial intensity
variation and wavefront curvature of the Gaussian beam envelope, studied with
(3+1)D numerical simulations. The temporal pulse shape also affects the
transfer efficiency significantly. Thus, we consider the practically important
rectangular-, Gaussian-, Blackman- and hyperbolic secant pulses. For the
latter, we can describe the time-dependent response analytically with the
Demkov-Kunike method. The experimentally observed stretching of the $\pi$-pulse
time is explained from a renormalization of the simple Pendell\""osung
frequency. Finally, we compare the analytical predictions for the
velocity-dependent transfer function with effective (1+1)D numerical
simulations for pulsed Gaussian beams, as well as experimental data and find
very good agreement, considering a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensate and
thermal cloud.

Most of the embedding models exclusively concentrate on a specific
magnification level. However, a useful task in histopathology embedding is to
train an embedding space regardless of the magnification level. Two main
approaches for tackling this goal are domain adaptation and domain
generalization, where the target magnification levels may or may not be
introduced to the model in training, respectively. Although magnification
adaptation is a well-studied topic in the literature, this paper, to the best
of our knowledge, is the first work on magnification generalization for
histopathology image embedding. We use an episodic trainable domain
generalization technique for magnification generalization, namely Model
Agnostic Learning of Semantic Features (MASF), which works based on the Model
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) concept. Our experimental results on a breast
cancer histopathology dataset with four different magnification levels show the
proposed method's effectiveness for magnification generalization.

from a lack of scale in the first and both a lack of scale as well as the wave
function not being well defined at the support of the generalized function SPP;
the obstruction in 3d Euclidean space for the Schrodinger equation with the
Dirac delta as a SPP only comes from the wave function (the $L^2$ bound sate
solution) being singular at the compact point support of the Dirac delta
function (measure). The problem is solved here in a completely mathematically
rigorous manner with no recourse to renormalization nor regularization. The
method involves a distributionally generalized version of the Schrodinger
theory as developed by the author, which regards the formal symbol ""$H\psi$"" as
an element of the space of distributions, the topological dual vector space to
the space of smooth functions with compact support. Two main facts come to
light. The first is the bound state energy of such a system can be calculated
in a well-posed context, the value of which agrees with both the mathematical
and theoretical physics literature. The second is that there is then a rigorous
distributional version of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem.

  series data",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Time series similarity measures are highly relevant in a wide range of
emerging applications including training machine learning models,
classification, and predictive modeling. Standard similarity measures for time
series most often involve point-to-point distance measures including Euclidean
distance and Dynamic Time Warping. Such similarity measures fundamentally
require the fluctuation of values in the time series being compared to follow a
corresponding order or cadence for similarity to be established. This paper is
spurred by the exploration of a broader definition of similarity, namely one
that takes into account the sheer numerical resemblance between sets of
statistical properties for time series segments irrespectively of value
labeling. Further, the presence of common pattern components between time
series segments was examined even if they occur in a permuted order, which
would not necessarily satisfy the criteria of more conventional point-to-point
distance measures. Results were compared with those of Dynamic Time Warping on
the same data for context. Surprisingly, the test for the numerical resemblance
between sets of statistical properties established a stronger resemblance for
pairings of decline years with greater statistical significance than Dynamic
Time Warping on the particular data and sample size used.

We call this the SEPAR$_d$-model. A delay differential equation version of the
model is added; it allows a better comparison to other models. We carry this
out by a comparison with the classical SIR model and indicate why we believe
that the SEPAR$_d$ model may work better for Covid-19 than other approaches. In
the second part of the paper we explain how to deal with the data provided by
the JHU, in particular we explain how to derive central model parameters from
the data. Other parameters, like the size of the dark sector, are less
accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at best by results of
representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a
few countries. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data
are available. Then we apply the model to a collection of other countries,
three European ones (Germany, France, Sweden), the three most stricken
countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India). Finally we show
that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach. At
the end of the paper we discuss the use of the model. Perhaps the most striking
application is that it allows a quantitative analysis of the influence of the
time until people are sent to quarantine or hospital. This suggests that
imposing means to shorten this time is a powerful tool to flatten the curves
