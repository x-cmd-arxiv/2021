lamellar eutectic solidification fronts, in the limit that the lamellar spacing
varies slowly along the envelope of the front. In the isotropic case, it is
known that the spacing obeys a diffusion equation, which can be obtained
theoretically by making two assumptions: (i) the lamellae always grow normal to
the large-scale envelope of the front, and (ii) the Jackson-Hunt law that links
lamellar spacing and front temperature remains locally valid. For anisotropic
boundaries, we replace hypothesis (i) by the symmetric pattern approximation,
which has recently been found to yield good predictions for lamellar growth
direction in presence of interphase anisotropy. We obtain a generalized
Jackson-Hunt law for tilted lamellae, and an evolution equation for the
envelope of the front. The latter contains a propagative term if the initial
lamellar array is tilted with respect to the direction of the temperature
gradient. However, the propagation velocity of the propagative wave modes are
found to be small, so that the dynamics of the front can be reasonably
described by a diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient that is modified
with respect to the isotropic case.

establish both global convergence and sample complexity results in the

finite-horizon linear exponential quadratic Gaussian, and the finite-horizon
linear-quadratic disturbance attenuation problems. As a by-product, our results
also provide the first sample complexity for the global convergence of PG
methods on solving zero-sum linear-quadratic dynamic games, a
nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem that serves as a baseline
setting in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with continuous spaces.
One feature of our algorithms is that during the learning phase, a certain
level of robustness/risk-sensitivity of the controller is preserved, which we
termed as the implicit regularization property, and is an essential requirement

millimeter-wave frequencies) by using narrow beam based directional
transmissions to compensate high propagation losses at such frequencies. Due to
the limited spatial coverage with each beam, the broadcast transmission of
paging in NR is performed using beam sweeping, which takes multiple time slots.
Thus, the paging procedure used in NR would substantially increase the downlink
resource overhead of the network with directional transmissions. Such overhead
would further increase as we move higher in the frequency bands, such as
terahertz bands, which is being viewed as one of the potential candidates for
future generation networks. Therefore, the NR based paging solution is
infeasible for supporting highly directional systems. In this paper, we propose
a novel minimal feedback enabled paging mechanism, which instead of using all
the beams for paging transmissions, only activates sub-set of beams having one
or more UEs under the coverage. UE presence indications are implemented to
identify the correct set of beams to be activated. Our analytical analysis and
simulations show that the proposed solution significantly reduces the downlink
paging overhead compared to the NR based solution (e.g., more than 80% gain for
a system supporting 64 number of beams at a UE density of 200 UEs per paging
occasion) while incurring minimal energy cost at the UE side.

On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS). It is motivated by a common worry
in transit agencies that an ODMTS may be poorly designed if the latent demand,
i.e., new riders adopting the system, is not captured. The paper proposes a
bilevel optimization model to address this challenge, in which the leader
problem determines the ODMTS design, and the follower problems identify the
most cost efficient and convenient route for riders under the chosen design.
The leader model contains a choice model for every potential rider that
determines whether the rider adopts the ODMTS given her proposed route. To
solve the bilevel optimization model, the paper proposes an exact decomposition
method that includes Benders optimal cuts and nogood cuts to ensure the
consistency of the rider choices in the leader and follower problems. Moreover,
to improve computational efficiency, the paper proposes upper bounds on trip
durations for the follower problems and valid inequalities that strenghten the
nogood cuts.
  The proposed method is validated using an extensive computational study on a
real data set from AAATA, the transit agency for the broader Ann Arbor and
Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The study considers the impact of a number of
factors, including the price of on-demand shuttles, the number of hubs, and
accessibility criteria. The designed ODMTS feature high adoption rates and
significantly shorter trip durations compared to the existing transit system
and highlight the benefits in accessibility for low-income riders. Finally, the
computational study demonstrates the efficiency of the decomposition method for
the case study and the benefits of computational enhancements that improve the
baseline method by several orders of magnitude.

diffractive scattering. Both low-angle Si-Si twist boundaries and the Si-Ge

strain fields doubles the thermal boundary resistance of Si-Ge heterointerfaces
compared to scattering due to acoustic mismatch alone. Scattering from grain
boundary dislocation strain fields is predicted to dominate the thermal
boundary resistance of Si-Si twist boundaries. This physical treatment can
guide the thermal design of devices by quantifying the relative importance of
interfacial strain fields, which can be engineered via fabrication and

more complete assessment of Neptune's limb darkening. In addition, our previous

incorporates the effects of limb-darkening based upon the Minnaert
approximation, which provides a much stronger constraint on the cloud structure
and methane mole fraction, makes better use of the available data and is more
computationally efficient. We find that away from discrete cloud features, the
observed reflectivity spectrum from 800-900 nm is very well approximated by a
background cloud model that is latitudinally varying, but zonally symmetric,
consisting of a H$_2$S cloud layer, based at 3.6-4.7 bar with variable opacity
and scale height, and a stratospheric haze. The background cloud model matches
the observed limb darkening seen at all wavelengths and latitudes and we find
that the mole fraction of methane at 2-4 bar, above the H$_2$S cloud, but below
the methane condensation level, varies from 4-6\% at the equator to 2-4\% at
near the south pole, consistent with previous analyses, with a equator/pole

platforms dedicated to serving commuting needs. It considers the Commute Trip
Sharing Problem with Autonomous Vehicles (CTSPAV), the optimization problem
faced by a reservation-based platform that receives daily commute-trip requests
and serves them with a fleet of autonomous vehicles. The CTSPAV can be viewed
as a special case of the Dial- A-Ride Problem (DARP). However, this paper
recognizes that commuting trips exhibit special spatial and temporal properties
that can be exploited in a branch and cut algorithm that leverages a redundant
modeling approach. In particular, the branch and cut algorithm relies on a MIP
formulation that schedules mini routes representing inbound or outbound trips.
This formulation is effective in finding high-quality solutions quickly but its
relaxation is relatively weak. To remedy this limitation, the mini-route MIP is
complemented by a DARP formulation which is not as effective in obtaining
primal solutions but has a stronger relaxation. The benefits of the proposed
approach are demonstrated by comparing it with another, more traditional, exact
branch and cut procedure and a heuristic method based on mini routes.
  The methodological contribution is complemented by a comprehensive analysis
of a CTSPAV platform for reducing vehicle counts, travel distances, and
congestion. In particular, the case study for a medium-sized city reveals that
a CTSPAV platform can reduce daily vehicle counts by a staggering 92% and
decrease vehicles miles by 30%. The platform also significantly reduces
congestion, measured as the number of vehicles on the road per unit time, by
60% during peak times. These benefits, however, come at the expense of
introducing empty miles. Hence the paper also highlights the tradeoffs between
future ride-sharing and car-pooling platforms.

Flush+Reload from an attacker perspective. We developed an attack on an

connected by multi-choice edges, has exhibited its power in neural architecture
search (NAS) by searching for better architectures for computer vision (CV) and
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we discover that the
design of such discrete architectures also appears in many other important
learning tasks, e.g., logical chain inference in knowledge graphs (KGs) and
meta-path discovery in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). Thus, we are
motivated to generalize the supernet search problem on a broader horizon.
However, none of the existing works are effective since the supernet topology
is highly task-dependent and diverse. To address this issue, we propose to
tensorize the supernet, i.e., unify the subgraph search problems by a tensor
formulation and encode the topology inside the supernet by a tensor network. We
further propose an efficient algorithm that admits both stochastic and
deterministic objectives to solve the search problem. Finally, we perform
extensive experiments on diverse learning tasks, i.e., architecture design for
CV, logic inference for KG, and meta-path discovery for HIN. Empirical results
demonstrate that our method leads to better performance and architectures.

by oscillatory drive have foundsurprising behavior - for small strain
amplitudes the dynamics can be reversible, which is contrary to the usual
notion of plasticity as an irreversible form of deformation. This reversibility
allows the system to reach limit-cycles in which plastic events repeat
indefinitely under the oscillatory drive. Reaching reversible limit-cycles, can
take a large number of driving cycles and it was surmised that the plastic
events encountered during the transient period are not encountered again and
are thus irreversible. Using a graph representation of the stable
configurations of the system and the plastic events connecting them, we show
that the notion of reversibility is more subtle. We find that reversible
plastic events are abundant, and that a large portion of the plastic events
encountered during the transient period are actually reversible, in the sense
that they can be part of a reversible deformation path. We observe that the
transition graph can be decomposed into clusters of configurations that are
connected by reversible transitions. These clusters are the strongly connected
components of the graph and their sizes turn out to be power-law distributed.
The largest of these are grouped in regions of reversibility, which in turn are
confined by regions of irreversibility whose number proliferates at larger
strains. Our results provide an explanation for the irreversibility transition
- the divergence of the transient period at a critical forcing amplitude. Long
transients result from transition between clusters of reversibility in a search
for a cluster large enough to contain a limit-cycle of a specific amplitude.
For large enough amplitudes, the search time becomes very large, since sizes of
the limit cycles become incompatible with the sizes of the regions of
reversibility.

framework that combines i) real-time degradation models used for predicting
remaining life distribution of each component, with ii) mixed integer
optimization models and solution algorithms used for identifying optimal wind

optimal times to repair every component, which in turn, determine the failure
risk of the turbines. More specifically, optimization models that characterize
a turbine's failure time as the first time that one of its constituent
components fail - a systems reliability concept called competing risk is
developed. The resulting turbine failures impact the optimization of wind farm
operations and revenue. Extensive experiments conducted for multiple wind farms
with 300 wind turbines - 1200 components - showcases the performance of the

that carelessly takes the locally optimal choice at each round, disregarding
any advantages of exploring and/or information gathering. Theoretically, it is

(with respect to the time horizon) in the standard multi-armed bandit problem.
On the other hand, this heuristic performs reasonably well in practice and it
even has sublinear, and even near-optimal, regret bounds in some very specific
linear contextual and Bayesian bandit models. We build on a recent line of work
and investigate bandit settings where the number of arms is relatively large
and where simple greedy algorithms enjoy highly competitive performance, both
in theory and in practice. We first provide a generic worst-case bound on the
regret of the Greedy algorithm. When combined with some arms subsampling, we
prove that it verifies near-optimal worst-case regret bounds in continuous,
infinite and many-armed bandit problems. Moreover, for shorter time spans, the
theoretical relative suboptimality of Greedy is even reduced. As a consequence,
we subversively claim that for many interesting problems and associated
horizons, the best compromise between theoretical guarantees, practical
performances and computational burden is definitely to follow the greedy
heuristic. We support our claim by many numerical experiments that show

and effectively applied in different fields where discontinuities in the field
variables arise from an initially continuous body. An important component of
the constitutive model in peridynamics is the influence function which weights
the contribution of all the interactions over a nonlocal region surrounding a
point of interest. Recent work has shown that in solid mechanics the influence
function has a strong relationship with the heterogeneity of a material's
micro-structure. However, determining an accurate influence function
analytically from a given micro-structure typically requires lengthy
derivations and complex mathematical models. To avoid these complexities, the
goal of this paper is to develop a data-driven regression algorithm to find the
optimal bond-based peridynamic model to describe the macro-scale deformation of
linear elastic medium with periodic heterogeneity. We generate macro-scale
deformation training data by averaging over periodic micro-structure unit cells
and add a physical energy constraint representing the homogenized elastic
modulus of the micro-structure to the regression algorithm. We demonstrate this
scheme for examples of one- and two-dimensional linear elastodynamics and show
that the energy constraint improves the accuracy of the resulting peridynamic
model.

distant donor and acceptor chromophores. Eventually, we demonstrate that the
RET between donors and acceptors is enhanced by the insertion of passive

experiments performed in inhomogeneous media and which plays a decisive role in
fastening RET in photosynthetic systems, is reported at the level of individual

galaxies comes from measurements which are path integrals, such as Faraday
rotation and the polarization of synchrotron radiation of cosmic ray electrons.
The measurement made at the radio telescope results from the contributions of
volume elements along a long line of sight. The inferred magnetic field is
therefore some sort of average over a long line segment. A magnetic field
measurement at a given spatial location is of much more physical significance.
In this paper, we point out that HII regions fortuitously offer such a
``point'' measurement, albeit of one component of the magnetic field, and
averaged over the sightline through the HII region. However, the line of sight
(LOS) through an HII region is much smaller (e.g. 30 - 50 pc) than one through
the entire Galactic disk, and thus constitutes a ``pseudo-local'' measurement.
We use published HII region Faraday rotation measurements to provide a new
constraint on the magnitude of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the
Galaxy, as well as to raise intriguing speculations about the modification of
the Galactic field during the star formation process.

propagation of light, and are of intense current interest. In the quantum
domain, time-dependent media can be used to convert vacuum fluctuations
(virtual photons) into pairs of real photons. We refer to these processes
broadly as ``dynamical vacuum effects'' (DVEs). Despite interest for their
potential applications as sources of quantum light, DVEs are generally very
weak, providing many opportunities for enhancement through modern techniques in
nanophotonics, such as using media which support excitations such as plasmon
and phonon polaritons. Here, we present a theory of DVEs in arbitrary
nanostructured, dispersive, and dissipative systems. A key element of our
framework is the simultaneous incorporation of time-modulation and
``dispersion'' through time-translation-breaking linear response theory. We
propose a highly efficient scheme for generating entangled surface polaritons
based on time-modulation of the optical phonon frequency of a polar insulator.
We show that the high density of states, especially in hyperbolic polaritonic
media, may enable high-efficiency generation of entangled phonon-polariton
pairs. More broadly, our theoretical framework enables the study of quantum

introduces extra computational cost required to store the additional Finite

is demonstrated using the compliance minimization problem on two-dimensional

heterogeneity can be inclusions in metal foams, layered structure in
composites, or even cracks and porous parts in rocks. Furthermore, the next
candidate, the so-called Guyer-Krumhansl equation, is tested on these
experiments with success. However, these recent evaluations required a
computationally intensive fitting procedure using countless numerical
solutions, even when a good initial guess for the parameters is found by hand.
This paper presents a Galerkin-type discretization for the Guyer-Krumhansl
equation, which helped us find a reasonably simple analytical solution for
time-dependent boundary conditions. Utilizing this analytical solution, we
developed a new evaluation technique to immediately estimate all the necessary
thermal parameters using the measured temperature history.

  In finite systems a transformation to represent the electromagnetic radiation
by the electric field instead is possible, albeit subtleties arise in periodic
systems. The resulting dipole gauge is a multi-orbital generalization of
Peierl's substitution. In this work, we investigate accuracy of both pathways,
with particular emphasis on gauge invariance, for TB models constructed from
maximally localized Wannier functions. Focusing on paradigmatic two-dimensional
materials, we construct first-principle models and calculate the response to
electromagnetic fields in linear response and for strong excitations.
Benchmarks against fully converged first-principle calculations allow for
ascertaining the accuracy of the TB models. We find that the dipole gauge
provides a more accurate description than the velocity gauge in all cases. The
main deficiency of the velocity gauge is an imperfect cancellation of
paramagnetic and diamagnetic current. Formulating a corresponding sum rule
however provides a way to explicitly enforce this cancellation. This procedure
corrects the TB models in the velocity gauge, yielding excellent agreement with
dipole gauge and thus gauge invariance.

clan embedding analogs of the stochastic embedding. We use these embeddings to
construct the first (bicriteria quasi-polynomial time) approximation scheme for
the metric $\rho$-dominating set and metric $\rho$-independent set problems in

enhancing the caching efficiency by taking advantage of the legibility and
massive volume of Twitter data. For the purpose of promoting the caching
efficiency, three machine learning models are proposed to predict latent events
and events popularity, utilizing collect Twitter data with geo-tags and
geographic information of the adjacent base stations (BSs). Firstly, we propose
a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model for latent events forecasting taking
advantage of the superiority of the LDA model in natural language processing
(NLP). Then, we conceive long short-term memory (LSTM) with skip-gram embedding
approach and LSTM with continuous skip-gram-Geo-aware embedding approach for
the events popularity forecasting. Lastly, we associate the predicted latent
events and the popularity of the events with the caching strategy. Extensive
practical experiments demonstrate that: (1) The proposed TAC framework
outperforms the conventional caching framework and is capable of being employed
in practical applications thanks to the associating ability with public
interests. (2) The proposed LDA approach conserves superiority for natural
language processing (NLP) in Twitter data. (3) The perplexity of the proposed
skip-gram-based LSTM is lower compared with the conventional LDA approach. (4)
Evaluation of the model demonstrates that the hit rates of tweets of the model
vary from 50% to 65% and the hit rate of the caching contents is up to
approximately 75\% with smaller caching space compared to conventional
algorithms.

restricted cases of bounded width. In this paper, we characterize the hitting
sets for read-once branching programs of width 3 by a so-called richness
condition. Namely, we show that such sets hit the class of read-once

any rich set extended with all strings within Hamming distance of 3 is a
hitting set for read-once branching programs of width 3. Then, we show that any

investigation of metapopulation dynamics arising from a collection of spatially
distributed, interacting biological populations. To make progress on this goal,
we embed it in a more general problem: inference for a collection of
interacting partially observed nonlinear non-Gaussian stochastic processes.
Each process in the collection is called a unit; in the case of spatiotemporal
models, the units correspond to distinct spatial locations. The dynamic state
for each unit may be discrete or continuous, scalar or vector valued. In
metapopulation applications, the state can represent a structured population or
the abundances of a collection of species at a single location. We consider
models where the collection of states has a Markov property. A sequence of
noisy measurements is made on each unit, resulting in a collection of time
series. A model of this form is called a spatiotemporal partially observed
Markov process (SpatPOMP). The R package spatPomp provides an environment for
implementing SpatPOMP models, analyzing data using existing methods, and
developing new inference approaches. Our presentation of spatPomp reviews
various methodologies in a unifying notational framework. We demonstrate the
package on a simple Gaussian system and on a nontrivial epidemiological model
for measles transmission within and between cities. We show how to construct
user-specified SpatPOMP models within spatPomp.

It carries out weight enhancement of the front end feature extractor of the

trajectory predictions from independently trained models are amalgamated to
refine the location detail. Thus, the integration of the aforesaid early and
late fusion techniques under a hybrid learning framework minimizes the

well-known deep learning (DL) architectures, including ResNet18, ResNet34,

extensive experimental analysis proves that hybrid learner (HL) achieves
significantly better results than the unimodal approaches and multimodal
approaches with early or late fusion strategies. Hence, it is found that the
Apolloscape dataset taken in this work has never been used in the literature
under SLAM with fusion techniques, which makes this work unique and insightful.

deploy DNN on resource-constrained devices, calling for minimizing the weight
and data movements to improve the energy efficiency. We present SmartDeal (SD),
an algorithm framework to trade higher-cost memory storage/access for
lower-cost computation, in order to aggressively boost the storage and energy
efficiency, for both inference and training. The core of SD is a novel weight
decomposition with structural constraints, carefully crafted to unleash the
hardware efficiency potential. Specifically, we decompose each weight tensor as
the product of a small basis matrix and a large structurally sparse coefficient
matrix whose non-zeros are quantized to power-of-2. The resulting sparse and
quantized DNNs enjoy greatly reduced energy for data movement and weight
storage, incurring minimal overhead to recover the original weights thanks to
the sparse bit-operations and cost-favorable computations. Beyond inference, we
take another leap to embrace energy-efficient training, introducing innovative
techniques to address the unique roadblocks arising in training while
preserving the SD structures. We also design a dedicated hardware accelerator
to fully utilize the SD structure to improve the real energy efficiency and
latency. We conduct experiments on both multiple tasks, models and datasets in
different settings. Results show that: 1) applied to inference, SD achieves up
to 2.44x energy efficiency as evaluated via real hardware implementations; 2)
applied to training, SD leads to 10.56x and 4.48x reduction in the storage and

intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision

dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of
sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM).
Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive
biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore,
the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple
modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing
blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks
and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of
vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision
discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the
success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and
bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in
vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object
detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling,
multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and
visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video
forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image
enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud
classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and
limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and
their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research
directions and possible future works.

between photoevaporation (PE) and giant planet formation. Massive planets
reduce the inflow of material from the outer to the inner disc, therefore
triggering an earlier onset of disc dispersal due to PE through a process known
as Planet-Induced PhotoEvaporation (PIPE). In this case, a cavity is formed as
material inside the planetary orbit is removed by PE, leaving only the outer
disc to drive the migration of the giant planet. We investigate the impact of
PE on giant planet migration and focus specifically on the case of transition
discs with an evacuated cavity inside the planet location. This is important
for determining under what circumstances PE is efficient at halting the
migration of giant planets, thus affecting the final orbital distribution of a
population of planets. For this purpose, we use 2D FARGO simulations to model
the migration of giant planets in a range of primordial and transition discs
subject to PE. The results are then compared to the standard prescriptions used
to calculate the migration tracks of planets in 1D planet population synthesis
models. The FARGO simulations show that once the disc inside the planet
location is depleted of gas, planet migration ceases. This contradicts the
results obtained by the impulse approximation, which predicts the accelerated
inward migration of planets in discs that have been cleared inside the
planetary orbit. These results suggest that the impulse approximation may not
be suitable for planets embedded in transition discs. A better approximation
that could be used in 1D models would involve halting planet migration once the
material inside the planetary orbit is depleted of gas and the surface density
at the 3:2 mean motion resonance location in the outer disc reaches a threshold

to the state preparation and stabilization of a qubit subjected to homodyne
detection. To this end, we formulate the control task as an optimization
problem where the loss function quantifies the distance from the target state,
and we employ neural networks (NNs) as controllers. The system's time evolution
is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To implement efficient
training, we backpropagate the gradient information from the loss function
through the SDE solver using adjoint sensitivity methods. As a first example,
we feed the quantum state to the controller and focus on different methods of
obtaining gradients. As a second example, we directly feed the homodyne

positivity bounds are commonly derived from the elastic scattering of two

more low-energy modes, this approach only gives incomplete bounds. We then
identify the allowed parameter space as the dual to a spectrahedron,
constructed from crossing symmetries of the amplitude, and show that finding
the optimal bounds for a given number of modes is equivalent to a geometric
problem: finding the extremal rays of a spectrahedron. We show how this is done
analytically for simple cases, and numerically formulated as semidefinite
programming (SDP) problems for more complicated cases. We demonstrate this
approach with a number of well-motivated examples in particle physics and
cosmology, including EFTs of scalars, vectors, fermions and gravitons. In all
these cases, we find that the SDP approach leads to results that either improve
the previous ones or are completely new. We also find that the SDP approach is

influence the growth of HII regions via metal line cooling and UV absorption.
We model these effects in star-forming regions containing massive stars. We
compute stellar feedback from photoionization and radiation pressure (RP) using
Monte Carlo radiative transfer coupled with hydrodynamics, including stellar
and diffuse radiation fields. We follow a $10^5$ M$_\odot$ turbulent cloud with
$Z/$Z$_\odot$ = 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1 and $f_\textrm{d} = 0.01 Z/$Z$_\odot$ with a
cluster-sink particle method for star formation. The models evolve for at least
1.5 Myr under feedback. Lower $Z$ results in higher temperatures and therefore
larger HII regions. For $Z \ge$Z$_\odot$, radiation pressure $P_\textrm{rad}$
can dominate locally over the gas pressure $P_\textrm{gas}$ in the inner
half-parsec around sink particles. Globally, the ratio of
$P_\textrm{rad}/P_\textrm{gas}$ is around 1 (2 Z$_\odot$), 0.3 (Z$_\odot$), 0.1
(0.5 Z$_\odot$), and 0.03 (0.1 Z$_\odot$). In the solar model, excluding RP
results in an ionized volume several times smaller than the fiducial model with
both mechanisms. Excluding RP and UV attenuation by dust results in a larger
ionized volume than the fiducial case. That is, UV absorption hinders growth
more than RP helps it. The radial expansion velocity of ionized gas reaches
$+$15 km/s outwards, while neutral gas has inward velocities for most of the
runtime, except for 0.1 Z$_\odot$ which exceeds $+$4 km/s. $Z$ and
$f_\textrm{d}$ do not significantly alter the star formation efficiency, rate,

AGN-dominated sources bright-ward of $M_{\rm UV} \simeq -23.2$. The effect is
observed in the rest-frame UV morphology and size-luminosity relation, where
extended clumpy systems become point-source dominated, and also in the
available spectra for the sample. These results allow us to derive the
rest-frame UV luminosity function for the SF and AGN-dominated sub-samples. We
find the SF-dominated LF is best fit with a double-power law, with a lensed
Schechter function being unable to explain the existence of extremely luminous
SF galaxies at $M_{\rm UV} \simeq -23.5$. If we identify AGN-dominated sources
according to a point-source morphology criterion we recover the relatively flat

separate the LF according to the current spectroscopic AGN fraction, we find a
steeper faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.83 \pm 0.11$. Using a simple model to

observational estimates of this so-called quasar lifetime are highly uncertain
(t_Q~10^4-10^9 yr), because most methods are indirect and involve many
model-dependent assumptions. Direct evidence of earlier activity is gained from
the higher ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the quasar
environs, observable as enhanced Ly$\alpha$ transmission in the so-called
proximity zone. Due to the ~30 Myr equilibration time-scale of HeII in the z~3
IGM, the size of the HeII proximity zone depends on the time the quasar had
been active before our observation t_on<t_Q, enabling up to $\pm$0.2 dex
precise measurements of individual quasar on-times that are comparable to the

point to episodic quasar activity over a long duty cycle, but do not rule out
substantial SMBH growth during phases of radiative inefficiency or obscuration.

Until now, all stellar evolution tracks are computed at solar, scaled-solar, or
alpha-element enhanced abundances, and none of these models correctly represent
the Galactic Concordance abundances at different metallicities. This paper is
the first implementation of Galactic Concordance abundances to the stellar
evolution models. The Stromlo tracks cover massive stars ($10\leq M/M_\odot
\leq 300$) with varying rotations ($v/v_{\rm crit} = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4$) and a
finely sampled grid of metallicities ($-2.0 \leq {\rm [Z/H]} \leq +0.5$;
$\Delta {\rm [Z/H]} = 0.1$) evolved from the pre-main sequence to the end of
$^{12}$Carbon burning. We find that the implementation of Galactic Concordance
abundances is critical for the evolution of main-sequence, massive hot stars in
order to estimate accurate stellar outputs (L, T$_{\rm eff}$, $g$), which, in
turn, have a significant impact on determining the ionizing photon luminosity
budgets. We additionally support prior findings of the importance that rotation
plays on the evolution of massive stars and their ionizing budget. The
evolutionary tracks for our Galactic Concordance abundance scaling provide a
more empirically motivated approach than simple uniform abundance scaling with
metallicity for the analysis of HII regions and have considerable implications
in determining nebular emission lines and metallicity. Therefore, it is
important to refine the existing stellar evolutionary models for comprehensive
high-redshift extragalactic studies. The Stromlo tracks are publicly available
to the astronomical community online.

$\delta$ and tidal anisotropy $\alpha$, as well as large-scale halo bias $b_1$.
Our analysis, while reproducing known trends for environment-dependent
accretion in CDM, as well as the comparison between accretion in CDM and WDM,
reveals several interesting new features. As expected from excursion set
models, WDM haloes have higher specific accretion rates, dominated by the
accretion of diffuse mass, as compared to CDM haloes. For low-mass WDM haloes,
we find that the environment-dependence of both diffuse mass accretion as well
as accretion by mergers is almost fully explained by $\alpha$. For the other
cases, $\delta$ plays at least a comparable role. We detect, for the first
time, a significant and evolving assembly bias due to diffuse mass accretion
for low-mass CDM and WDM haloes (after excluding splashback objects), with a
$z=0$ strength higher than with almost all known secondary variables and

kits to learn about the uncertain states of the world (active learning); then,
use the new information to construct beliefs about the states and decide where
to allocate resources. We propose a general model coupled with a tunable
lookahead policy for making vaccine allocation decisions without perfect
knowledge about the state of the world. The lookahead policy is compared to a
population-based myopic policy which is more likely to be similar to the
present strategies in practice. Each vaccine allocation policy works in
conjunction with a testing kit allocation policy to perform active learning.
Our simulation results demonstrate that an optimization-based lookahead
decision making strategy will outperform the presented myopic policy.

but can be constrained by observations of Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission
from distant sources. Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM)
attenuates Ly$\alpha$~photons emitted by galaxies. As reionization progressed
the IGM opacity decreased, increasing Ly$\alpha$~visibility. The galaxy
Ly$\alpha$~luminosity function (LF) is thus a useful tool to constrain the
timeline of reionization. In this work, we model the Ly$\alpha$~LF as a
function of redshift, $z=5-10$, and average IGM neutral hydrogen fraction,
$\overline{x}_\textsc{hi}$. We combine the Ly$\alpha$~luminosity probability
distribution obtained from inhomogeneous reionization simulations with a model
for the UV LF to model the Ly$\alpha$~LF. As the neutral fraction increases,
the average number density of Ly$\alpha$~emitting galaxies decreases, and are
less luminous, though for $\overline{x}_\textsc{hi} \lesssim 0.4$ there is only
a small decrease of the Ly$\alpha$~LF. We use our model to infer the IGM
neutral fraction at $z=6.6, 7.0, 7.3$ from observed Ly$\alpha$~LFs. We conclude
that there is a significant increase in the neutral fraction with increasing
redshift: $\overline{x}_\textsc{hi}(z=6.6)=0.08^{+ 0.08}_{- 0.05}, \,
\overline{x}_\textsc{hi}(z=7.0)=0.28 \pm 0.05$ and
$\overline{x}_\textsc{hi}(z=7.3)=0.83^{+ 0.06}_{- 0.07}$. We predict trends in
the Ly$\alpha$~luminosity density and Schechter parameters as a function of
redshift and the neutral fraction. We find that the Ly$\alpha$~luminosity
density decreases as the universe becomes more neutral. Furthermore, as the
neutral fraction increases, the faint-end slope of the Ly$\alpha$~LF steepens,
and the characteristic Ly$\alpha$~luminosity shifts to lower values, concluding
that the evolving shape of the Ly$\alpha$~LF -- not just its integral -- is an
important tool to study reionization.

In this work, we directly observe the dynamics of DNA rings in semidilute

investigate ring polymer relaxation dynamics from high extension and transient
and steady-state stretching dynamics in planar extensional flow for a series of
ring-linear blends with varying ring fraction. Our results show multiple
molecular sub-populations for ring relaxation in ring-linear blends, as well as
large conformational fluctuations for rings in steady extensional flow, even
long after the initial transient stretching process has subsided. We further
quantify the magnitude and characteristic timescales of ring conformational
fluctuations as a function of blend composition. Interestingly, we find that
the magnitude of ring conformational fluctuations follows a non-monotonic
response with increasing ring fraction, first increasing at low ring fraction
and then substantially decreasing at large ring fraction in ring-linear blends.
A unique set of ring polymer conformations are observed during the transient
stretching process, which highlights the prevalence of molecular individualism
and supports the notion of complex intermolecular interactions in ring-linear
polymer blends. Together with results from molecular simulations, our results
suggest that ring conformational fluctuations arise due to ring-linear
threading and intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions (HI). Taken together,
our results provide a new molecular understanding of ring polymer dynamics in

the opportunity to measure the bulk composition of the building blocks, or
fragments, of exoplanets. This technique has established a diversity in
compositions comparable to what is observed in the solar system, suggesting
that the formation of rocky planets is a generic process. Whereas the relative
abundances of lithophile and siderophile elements within the planetary debris
can be used to investigate whether exoplanets undergo differentiation, the
composition studies carried out so far lack unambiguous tracers of planetary
crusts. Here we report the detection of lithium in the atmospheres of four cool
(<5,000 K) and old (cooling ages 5-10 Gyr) metal-polluted white dwarfs, where
one also displays photospheric potassium. The relative abundances of these two
elements with respect to sodium and calcium strongly suggest that all four
white dwarfs have accreted fragments of planetary crusts. We detect an infrared
excess in one of the systems, indicating that accretion from a circumstellar
debris disk is on-going. The main-sequence progenitor mass of this star was
$4.8\pm0.2 M_\odot$, demonstrating that rocky, differentiated planets may form
around short-lived B-type stars.

neutrinos have such high densities that they affect each other and exhibit
collective flavor oscillations. A crucial ingredient for fast collective flavor
oscillations is that the electron lepton number (ELN) distribution changes its
sign as a function of direction, i.e., has a zero crossing. We present a study
in two dimensions and show how fast flavor oscillations depend on the ELN and
its crossings. We show that a large number of crossings can inhibit flavor
oscillations. This may be a natural self-limiting mechanism that stabilizes the
flavor content of the dense neutrino gas in a vast majority of scenarios,
especially the early Universe, where the angular distributions for all flavors
are very similar and crossings occur mainly due to fluctuations.

feature evolution, and diffusion. Therefore, several methods for embedding
dynamic graphs have been proposed to learn network representations over time,
facing novel challenges, such as time-domain modeling, temporal features to be
captured, and the temporal granularity to be embedded. In this survey, we
overview dynamic graph embedding, discussing its fundamentals and the recent
advances developed so far. We introduce the formal definition of dynamic graph
embedding, focusing on the problem setting and introducing a novel taxonomy for
dynamic graph embedding input and output. We further explore different dynamic
behaviors that may be encompassed by embeddings, classifying by topological
evolution, feature evolution, and processes on networks. Afterward, we describe
existing techniques and propose a taxonomy for dynamic graph embedding
techniques based on algorithmic approaches, from matrix and tensor
factorization to deep learning, random walks, and temporal point processes. We
also elucidate main applications, including dynamic link prediction, anomaly
detection, and diffusion prediction, and we further state some promising

microwave absorption occurs in a broad range of frequencies due to the
distribution of Imry-Ma domains on sizes and effective anisotropy. That
distribution is also responsible for the weak dependence of the absorption on
the damping. At a fixed frequency of the ac-field the spatial pattern of the
amplitude of spin oscillations exhibits maxima corresponding to the
oscillations of resonant magnetic domains. The dependence of the peak
absorption frequency on the ratio of the magnitude of per-spin random
anisotropy to the strength of the ferromagnetic exchange agrees with the
scaling derived from the Imry-Ma argument. The effect noticeably increases in
low-dimensional systems, suggesting that materials comprised of microscopic
amorphous leaves and wires can be promising candidates for enhanced microwave
absorption.

conditions under which the dependence of a quantitative trait on the genome
might be predictable, based on measurement of a limited subset of genotypes. It
uses the theory of real-valued Boolean functions in a systematic way to
translate trait data into the Fourier domain. Important trait features, such as
the roughness of the trait landscape or the modularity of a trait have a simple
Fourier interpretation. Ruggedness at a gene location corresponds to high
sensitivity to mutation, while a modular organization of gene activity reduces
such sensitivity.
  Traits where rugged loci are rare will naturally compress gene data in the
Fourier domain, leading to a sparse representation of trait data, concentrated
in identifiable, low-level coefficients. This Fourier representation of a trait
organizes epistasis in a form which is isometric to the trait data. As Fourier
matrices are known to be maximally incoherent with the standard basis, this
permits employing compressive sensing techniques to work from data sets that
are relatively small -- sometimes even of polynomial size -- compared to the
exponentially large sets of possible genomes.
  This theory provides a theoretical underpinning for systematic use of Boolean
function machinery to dissect the dependency of a trait on the genome and
environment.

a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal abundance model that integrates
indirect county-level data on opioid-related outcomes with state-level survey
estimates on prevalence of opioid misuse to estimate the latent county-level

that our integrated model accurately recovers the latent counts and prevalence.
We apply our model to county-level surveillance data on opioid overdose deaths

space but highly inclined sources are heavily obscured and are not seen as
quasars with broad emission lines. The obscuring torus geometry determines the
average viewing angle, and if the torus geometry changes with the redshift,
this average viewing angle will also change. Thus the ratio between the
isotropic luminosity and observed luminosity may change systematically with
redshift. Therefore, if we use quasars to measure the luminosity distance by
evaluating the isotropic absolute luminosity and measuring the observed flux,
we can have a redshift-dependent bias which can propagate to cosmological
parameters. We propose a toy model for testing the effect of viewing angle
uncertainty on measurement of the luminosity distance. The model is based on
analytical description of the obscuring torus applied to one-parameter
observational data. It illustrates the possible change of the torus covering
factor between the two chosen redshift ranges. We have estimated the possible
error on specific cosmological parameters (H0,Omega_m) for the flat Lambda-CDM
cosmology if a method is calibrated at low redshift and applied to the higher
redshift. The errors on cosmological parameters due to potential dependence of
viewing angle on redshift are found to be potentially significant, and the
effect will have to be accommodated in the future in all quasar-based
cosmological methods. A careful systematic study of AGN mean viewing angle
across redshift is necessary, with the use of appropriate samples and models
which uniquely determine the inclination of each source.

multiple cutoffs and heterogeneous treatments. A common practice is to
normalize all the cutoffs to zero and estimate one effect. This procedure
identifies the average treatment effect (ATE) on the observed distribution of
individuals local to existing cutoffs. However, researchers often want to make
inferences on more meaningful ATEs, computed over general counterfactual
distributions of individuals, rather than simply the observed distribution of
individuals local to existing cutoffs. This paper proposes a consistent and
asymptotically normal estimator for such ATEs when heterogeneity follows a
non-parametric function of cutoff characteristics in the sharp case. The
proposed estimator converges at the minimax optimal rate of root-n for a
specific choice of tuning parameters. Identification in the fuzzy case, with
multiple cutoffs, is impossible unless heterogeneity follows a
finite-dimensional function of cutoff characteristics. Under parametric
heterogeneity, this paper proposes an ATE estimator for the fuzzy case that
optimally combines observations to maximize its precision.

first hitting time of the origin. Such a process can be defined even in the
non-standard case where the reflection matrix is not completely-$\mathcal{S}$.
We show that in this case the process has two possible behaviors: either it
tends to infinity or it hits the corner (origin) in a finite time. Given an
arbitrary starting point $(u,v)$ in the quadrant, we consider the escape (resp.
absorption) probabilities $\mathbb{P}_{(u,v)}[T=\infty]$ (resp.
$\mathbb{P}_{(u,v)}[T<\infty]$). We establish the partial differential
equations and the oblique Neumann boundary conditions which characterize the
escape probability and provide a functional equation satisfied by the Laplace
transform of the escape probability. We then give asymptotics for the
absorption probability in the simpler case where the starting point in the
quadrant is $(u,0)$. We exhibit a remarkable geometric condition on the
parameters which characterizes the case where the absorption probability has a
product form and is exponential. We call this new criterion the dual skew

presenting exact asymptotics for the escape probability at the origin.

concepts by utilizing sensors imbedded in a large number of mobile smart
devices. However, the openness and distributed nature of MCS leads to various
vulnerabilities and consequent challenges to address. A malicious user
submitting fake sensing tasks to an MCS platform may be attempting to consume
resources from any number of participants' devices; as well as attempting to
clog the MCS server. In this paper, a novel approach that is based on
horizontal federated learning is proposed to identify fake tasks that contain a
number of independent detection devices and an aggregation entity. Detection
devices are deployed to operate in parallel with each device equipped with a
machine learning (ML) module, and an associated training dataset. Furthermore,
the aggregation module collects the prediction results from individual devices
and determines the final decision with the objective of minimizing the
prediction loss. Loss measurement considers the lost task values with respect
to misclassification, where the final decision utilizes a risk-aware approach
where the risk is formulated as a function of the utility loss. Experimental
results demonstrate that using federated learning-driven illegitimate task
detection with a risk aware aggregation function improves the detection
performance of the traditional centralized framework. Furthermore, the higher
performance of detection and lower loss of utility can be achieved by the
proposed framework. This scheme can even achieve 100%detection accuracy using
small training datasets distributed across devices, while achieving slightly
over an 8% increase in detection improvement over traditional approaches.

viruses guided by DNA segments called spacers acquired from invading phage.
However, the patchy incidence and limited memory breadth of CRISPR-Cas systems
suggest that their fitness benefits are offset by costs. Here, we propose that
cross-reactive CRISPR targeting can lead to heterologous autoimmunity, whereby
foreign spacers guide self-targeting in a spacer-length dependent fashion.
Balancing antiviral defense against autoimmunity predicts a scaling relation
between spacer length and CRISPR repertoire size. We find evidence for this
scaling through comparative analysis of sequenced prokaryotic genomes, and show
that this association also holds at the level of CRISPR types. In contrast, the
scaling is absent in strains with nonfunctional CRISPR loci. Finally, we
demonstrate that stochastic spacer loss can explain variations around the
scaling relation, even between strains of the same species. Our results suggest
that heterologous autoimmunity is a selective factor shaping the evolution of
CRISPR-Cas systems.

advancement (e.g., material science and machine learning), many people are not
aware that they also threaten the widely deployed cryptographic algorithms that
are the foundation of today's digital security and privacy. From mobile
communications to online banking to personal data privacy, literally billions
of Internet users rely on cryptography every day to ensure that private
communications and data stay private. Indeed, the emergence and growth of the
public Internet and electronic commerce was arguably enabled by the invention
of public-key cryptography. The key advantage offered by public-key
cryptography is that it allows two parties who have never communicated
previously to nevertheless establish a secure, private, communication channel
over a non-private network (e.g., the Internet).
  Recent advances in quantum computing signal that we are on the cusp of our
next cryptographic algorithm transition, and this transition to post-quantum
cryptography will be more complicated and impact many more systems and
stakeholders, than any of the prior migrations. This transition represents a
major disruption within the IT industry and will broadly impact nearly every
domain of our digital lives, from global commerce to social media to government
and more. Cryptographic algorithm transitions take time and involve an
extensive coordination effort across many stakeholders who are involved in
building and operating the world's compute infrastructure. By preparing now for
the upcoming transition to these new algorithms, we can ensure a more orderly,
less costly, and minimally disruptive changeover.

higher performance and exhibit lower turnover or absenteeism. While a large
body of research has investigated the consequences of passion, we know only
little about its antecedents. Integrating trait interaction theory with trait
activation theory, this paper examines how personality traits, i.e.
conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism impact passion at work across
different job situations. Passion has been conceptualized as a two-dimensional
construct, consisting of harmonious work passion (HWP) and obsessive work
passion (OWP). Our study is based on a sample of N = 824 participants from the
myPersonality project. We find a positive relationship between neuroticism and
OWP in enterprising environments. Further, we find a three-way interaction
between conscientiousness, agreeableness, and enterprising environment in
predicting OWP. Our findings imply that the impact of personality
configurations on different forms of passion is contingent on the job
environment. Moreover, in line with self-regulation theory, the results reveal
agreeableness as a ""cool influencer"" and neuroticism as a ""hot influencer"" of
the relationship between conscientiousness and work passion. We derive
practical implications for organisations on how to foster work passion,
particularly HWP, in organisations.

directly encoded, while the unsupervised learning, by definition cannot know
exactly what is useful for a certain task. This serves as the motivation to
retrain the latent space representations to learn some clues that unsupervised

concept. The driving objective of the concept is to determine whether
Earth-like exoplanets exist in the habitable zones of the nearest sunlike stars
and have biosignature gases in their atmospheres. With the sensitivity provided
by this telescope, it is possible to measure the brightness of zodiacal dust
disks around the nearest sunlike stars and establish how their population
compares to our own. In addition, known gas-giant exoplanets can be targeted to
measure their atmospheric metallicity and thereby determine if the correlation
with planet mass follows the trend observed in the Solar System and hinted at
by exoplanet transit spectroscopy data. In this paper we provide the details of
the calculations used to estimate the sensitivity of Roman with a starshade and
describe the publicly available Python-based source code used to make these

this proposed mission consists of the 16 nearby stars best suited for direct

exclusion angles, resulting in four observing windows during a two-year
mission. We find that for habitable-zone planetary orbits that are detected at
least three times during the four viewing opportunities, their semi-major axes
are measured with a median precision of 7 mas, or a median fractional precision
of 3\%. Habitable-zone planets can be correctly identified as such 96.7\% of
the time, with a false positive rate of 2.8\%. If a more conservative criteria
is used for habitable-zone classification (95\% probability), the false
positive rate drops close to zero, but with only 81\% of the truly Earth-like

fault tolerance in safety-critical control systems. In this paper, we introduce
a new model-based fault injection method implemented as a highlycustomizable
Simulink block called FIBlock. It supports the injection of typical faults of
essential heterogeneous components of Cyber-Physical Systems, such as sensors,
computing hardware, and network. The FIBlock GUI allows the user to select a
fault type and configure multiple parameters to tune error magnitude, fault
activation time, and fault exposure duration. Additional trigger inputs and
outputs of the block enable the modeling of conditional faults. Furthermore,
two or more FIBlocks connected with these trigger signals can model chained
errors. The proposed fault injection method is demonstrated with a lower-limb
EXO-LEGS exoskeleton, an assistive device for the elderly in everyday life. The
EXO-LEGS model-based dynamic control is realized in the Simulink environment
and allows easy integration of the aforementioned FIBlocks. Exoskeletons, in
general, being a complex CPS with multiple sensors and actuators, are prone to
hardware and software faults. In the case study, three types of faults were
investigated: 1) sensor freeze, 2) stuck-at-0, 3) bit-flip. The fault injection
experiments helped to determine faults that have the most significant effects
on the overall system reliability and identify the fine line for the critical
fault duration after that the controller could no longer mitigate faults.

  This whitepaper argues for a multipronged effort to develop new computing
approaches beyond Moore's Law to advance the foundation that computing provides
to US industry, education, medicine, science, and government. This impact
extends far beyond the IT industry itself, as IT is now central for providing

integrity of software controlling a computer. One of the major challenges that
make them hard to be applied in practice is the issue with software updates.
Specifically, an operating system update causes the integrity violation because
it changes the well-known initial state trusted by remote verifiers, such as
integrity monitoring systems. Consequently, the integrity monitoring of remote
computers becomes unreliable due to the high amount of false positives. We
address this problem by adding an extra level of indirection between the
operating system and software repositories. We propose a trusted software
repository (TSR), a secure proxy that overcomes the shortcomings of previous
approaches by sanitizing software packages. Sanitization consists of modifying
unsafe installation scripts and adding digital signatures in a way software
packages can be installed in the operating system without violating its
integrity. TSR leverages shielded execution, i.e., Intel SGX, to achieve
confidentiality and integrity guarantees of the sanitization process. TSR is
transparent to package managers, and requires no changes in the software
packages building and distributing processes. Our evaluation shows that running
TSR inside SGX is practical; since it induces only ~1.18X performance overhead
during package sanitization compared to the native execution without SGX. TSR
supports 99.76% of packages available in the main and community repositories of
Alpine Linux while increasing the total repository size by 3.6%.

introduce two novel optimizations: $\Delta$-representation of candidate
counterfactuals, and partial evaluation of the classifier. We compare
empirically GeCo against five other systems described in the literature, and

characterize the durability of vaccine induced protection. If efficacy is
demonstrated, the treatment of placebo volunteers becomes an issue. For
COVID-19 vaccine trials, there is broad consensus that placebo volunteers
should be offered a vaccine once efficacy has been established. This will
likely lead to most placebo volunteers crossing over to the vaccine arm, thus
complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze
durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the vaccine
efficacy profile that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is
recoverable in a trial with placebo crossover. This result holds no matter when
the crossover occurs and with no assumptions about the form of the efficacy
profile. We only require that the vaccine efficacy profile applies to the newly
vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop different
methods to estimate efficacy within the context of a proportional hazards
regression model and explore via simulation the implications of placebo
crossover for estimation of vaccine efficacy under different efficacy dynamics
and study designs. We apply our methods to simulated COVID-19 vaccine trials
with durable and waning vaccine efficacy and a total follow-up of two years.

emerging need to implement software systems that enhance the protection of
personal data processing. However, existing data protection and privacy
regulations provide key principles in high-level, making it difficult for
software engineers to design and implement privacy-aware systems. Objective: In
this paper, we develop a taxonomy that provides a comprehensive set of privacy
requirements based on four well-established personal data protection
regulations and privacy frameworks, the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), ISO/IEC 29100, Thailand Personal Data Protection Act (Thailand PDPA)
and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) privacy framework. Methods: These
requirements are extracted, refined and classified (using the goal-based
requirements analysis method) into a level that can be used to map with issue

projects (Google Chrome and Moodle) address the privacy requirements in our
taxonomy through mining their issue reports. Results: The paper discusses how
the collected issues were classified, and presents the findings and insights
generated from our study. Conclusion: Mining and classifying privacy
requirements in issue reports can help organisations be aware of their state of
compliance by identifying privacy requirements that have not been addressed in
their software projects. The taxonomy can also trace back to regulations,
standards and frameworks that the software projects have not complied with
based on the identified privacy requirements.

secure transmission in a cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, a neural
network (NN)-based approach is proposed to maximize the secrecy rate of the
secondary receiver under the constraints of total transmit power of secondary
transmitter, and the interference leakage to the primary receiver, within which
three different regularization schemes are developed. The key advantage of the
proposed algorithm over conventional approaches is the capability to solve the
power allocation problem with both perfect and imperfect channel state
information. In a conventional setting, two completely different optimization
frameworks have to be designed, namely the robust and non-robust designs.
Furthermore, conventional algorithms are often based on iterative techniques,
and hence, they require a considerable number of iterations, rendering them
less suitable in future wireless networks where there are very stringent delay
constraints. To meet the unprecedented requirements of future ultra-reliable
low-latency networks, we propose an NN-based approach that can determine the
power allocation in a CR network with significantly reduced computational time
and complexity. As this trained NN only requires a small number of linear
operations to yield the required power allocations, the approach can also be
extended to different delay sensitive applications and services in future
wireless networks. When evaluate the proposed method versus conventional
approaches, using a suitable test set, the proposed approach can achieve more
than 94% of the secrecy rate performance with less than 1% computation time and
more than 93% satisfaction of interference leakage constraints. These results
are obtained with significant reduction in computational time, which we believe
that it is suitable for future real-time wireless applications.

variety of genetic engineering applications: the Cas9 protein recognises a
2-5nt DNA motif, known as the PAM, and a programmable crRNA binds a target DNA
sequence that is then cleaved. While off-target activity is undesirable, it
occurs because cross-reactivity was beneficial in the immune system on which
the machinery is based. Here, a stochastic model of the target recognition
reaction was derived to study the specificity of the innate immune mechanism in
bacteria. CRISPR systems with Cas9 proteins that recognised PAMs of varying
lengths were tested on self and phage DNA. The model showed that the energy
associated with PAM binding impacted mismatch tolerance, cleavage probability,
and cleavage time. Small PAMs allowed the CRISPR to balance catching mutant
phages, avoiding self-targeting, and quickly dissociating from critically
non-matching sequences. Additionally, the results revealed a lower tolerance to
mismatches in the PAM and a PAM-proximal region known as the seed, as seen in
experiments. This work illustrates the role that the Cas9 protein has in
dictating the specificity of DNA cleavage that can aid in preventing off-target

SG-PBFT: a secure and highly efficient PBFT consensus algorithm for Internet of

invoking an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the original

field, the rapid increase in the number of financial tickets dramatically

pressure on accounting is necessary. At present, a few works have applied deep
learning methods to financial ticket recognition. However, first, their
approaches only cover a few types of tickets. In addition, the precision and
speed of their recognition models cannot meet the requirements of practical
financial accounting systems. Moreover, none of the methods provides a detailed
analysis of both the types and content of tickets. Therefore, this paper first
analyzes the different features of 482 kinds of financial tickets, divides all
kinds of financial tickets into three categories and proposes different
recognition patterns for each category. These recognition patterns can meet
almost all types of financial ticket recognition needs. Second, regarding the
fixed format types of financial tickets (accounting for 68.27\% of the total
types of tickets), we propose a simple yet efficient network named the
Financial Ticket Faster Detection network (FTFDNet) based on a Faster RCNN.
Furthermore, according to the characteristics of the financial ticket text, in

focus more on text. Finally, we perform a comparison with the best ticket

policies such as Known Joins or Transitive Joins. However, the promise, a
popular synchronization primitive for parallel tasks, does not enjoy
deadlock-freedom guarantees. Promises can exhibit deadlock-like bugs; however,
the concept of a deadlock is not currently well-defined for promises.
  To address these challenges, we propose an ownership semantics in which each
promise is associated to the task which currently intends to fulfill it.
Ownership immediately enables the identification of bugs in which a task fails
to fulfill a promise for which it is responsible. Ownership further enables the
discussion of deadlock cycles among tasks and promises and allows us to
introduce a robust definition of deadlock-like bugs for promises.
  Cycle detection in this context is non-trivial because it is concurrent with
changes in promise ownership. We provide a lock-free algorithm for precise
runtime deadlock detection. We show how to obtain the memory consistency
criteria required for the correctness of our algorithm under TSO and the Java
and C++ memory models. An evaluation compares the execution time and memory
usage overheads of our detection algorithm on benchmark programs relative to an
unverified baseline. Our detector exhibits a 12% (1.12$\times$) geometric mean

Superconductivity was evidenced by a sharp drop of the electrical resistance to
zero, and by the decrease of the critical temperature in deuterated samples and

decrease on further compression due to decrease of the electron-phonon coupling

coupled with the environment is studied. The quantum field corresponds to two
entangled coherent states whose amplitude we vary up to the mesoscopic regime.
We show that under the onset of decoherence, correlations in the quantum field
are not lost but transferred to the environment. We also found that sudden
transitions in the decoherence regimes appear along with the dynamics depending
on the coherent states' amplitude. Increasing the amplitude of the entangled
coherence state results in the apparition of a metastable decoherence-free

instability, can produce massive gas giant planets on wide-orbits, such as

magnetic pressure stifles local inflow of matter. The outcome is a population

orientation-dependent. For the transport along the linear dispersion direction,
the differential conductance exhibits a clear crossover from retro Andreev

the differential conductance oscillates without a decaying profile when the

  multi-source on multiplex networks","13 pages,8 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the early stage of epidemics, individuals' determination on adopting
protective measures, which can reduce their risk of infection and suppress
disease spreading, is likely to depend on multiple information sources and
their mutual confirmation due to inadequate exact information. Here we
introduce the inter-layer mutual confirmation mechanism into the
information-disease interacting dynamics on multiplex networks. In our model,
an individual increases the information transmission rate and willingness to
adopt protective measures once he confirms the authenticity of news and
severity of disease from neighbors status in multiple layers. By using the
microscopic Markov chain approach, we analytically calculate the epidemic
threshold and the awareness and infected density in the stationary state, which
agree well with simulation results. We find that the increment of epidemic
threshold when confirming the aware neighbors on communication layer is larger
than that of the contact layer. On the contrary, the confirmation of neighbors'
awareness and infection from the contact layer leads to a lower final infection
density and a higher awareness density than that of the communication layer.
The results imply that individuals' explicit exposure of their infection and
awareness status to neighbors, especially those with real contacts, is helpful
in suppressing epidemic spreading.

given data samples have been used to train a target learning model, e.g., a
deep neural network. There are two types of MI attacks in the literature, i.e.,
these with and without shadow models. The success of the former heavily depends
on the quality of the shadow model, i.e., the transferability between the
shadow and the target; the latter, given only blackbox probing access to the
target model, cannot make an effective inference of unknowns, compared with MI
attacks using shadow models, due to the insufficient number of qualified
samples labeled with ground truth membership information.
  In this paper, we propose an MI attack, called BlindMI, which probes the
target model and extracts membership semantics via a novel approach, called
differential comparison. The high-level idea is that BlindMI first generates a
dataset with nonmembers via transforming existing samples into new samples, and
then differentially moves samples from a target dataset to the generated,
non-member set in an iterative manner. If the differential move of a sample
increases the set distance, BlindMI considers the sample as non-member and vice
versa.
  BlindMI was evaluated by comparing it with state-of-the-art MI attack
algorithms. Our evaluation shows that BlindMI improves F1-score by nearly 20%
when compared to state-of-the-art on some datasets, such as Purchase-50 and
Birds-200, in the blind setting where the adversary does not know the target
model's architecture and the target dataset's ground truth labels. We also show
that BlindMI can defeat state-of-the-art defenses.

density based on a halo-model approach so that the model can be applied to real
samples of galaxies and clusters. We examine our model by using an actual
sample of massive clusters with known weak-lensing masses and spectroscopic
observations of galaxies around the clusters. A likelihood analysis with our
model enables us to infer the spherical-symmetric velocity dispersion of
observed galaxies in massive clusters. We find the velocity dispersion of
galaxies surrounding clusters with their lensing masses of $1.1\times10^{15}\,
h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ to be $1180^{+83}_{-70}\, \mathrm{km/s}$ at the 68\%
confidence level. Our constraint confirms that the relation between the galaxy
velocity dispersion and the host cluster mass in our sample is consistent with
the prediction in dark-matter-only N-body simulations under General Relativity.
Assuming that the Poisson equation in clusters can be altered by an effective
gravitational constant of $G_\mathrm{eff}$, our measurement of the velocity
dispersion can place a tight constraint of $0.88 < G_\mathrm{eff}/G_\mathrm{N}

properties and emissions from pulsar wind nebulae and their pulsars, we studied
the power-law component of the X-ray emissions from 35 pulsar wind nebulae
which have a detected pulsar in X-rays. Our major results are in the following:
(1) The power-law component of the X-ray luminosities, in the energy range from
0.5 keV to 8 keV, of the nebulae and of the pulsar both show a strong
correlation with the pulsar spin-down power ($\dot{E}$), consistent with
earlier studies. However, equally significant correlations with the magnetic
field strength at the light cylinder ($B_{\rm lc}$) are also found. The similar
significance level of the correlations with $\dot{E}$ and with $B_{\rm lc}$
suggests that not only $\dot{E}$ but also $B_{\rm lc}$ plays an important role
in understanding these power-law emissions. (2) Thermal X-ray emissions are
detected in 12 pulsars among the 35 samples. With derived temperature as one
additional variable, we found that the photon indices of pulsar's non-thermal
X-ray power-law spectra can be well described by a linear function of $\log P$,
$\log\dot{P}$ and temperature logarithm $\log T$. It indicates that the surface
temperature of neutron stars plays an important role in determining the energy
distribution of the radiating pair plasma in pulsar's magnetospheres.

For entities to be aligned, existing EA solutions treat them separately and
generate alignment results as ranked lists of entities on the other side.
Nevertheless, this decision-making paradigm fails to take into account the
interdependence among entities. Although some recent efforts mitigate this
issue by imposing the 1-to-1 constraint on the alignment process, they still
cannot adequately model the underlying interdependence and the results tend to
be sub-optimal. To fill in this gap, in this work, we delve into the dynamics
of the decision-making process, and offer a reinforcement learning (RL) based
model to align entities collectively. Under the RL framework, we devise the
coherence and exclusiveness constraints to characterize the interdependence and
restrict collective alignment. Additionally, to generate more precise inputs to
the RL framework, we employ representative features to capture different
aspects of the similarity between entities in heterogeneous KGs, which are
integrated by an adaptive feature fusion strategy. Our proposal is evaluated on

non-meaningful alignments. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed

performance of SDSD, a splitting-detection joint-decision (SDJD) receiver is

that can be separately processed by CD and ED, and then summed up as joint
decision variables to achieve diversity combining. The theoretical channel
capacity and BER of the SDSD and SDJD are derived for M-ary pulse position
modulation (M-PPM) and PPM with spreading codes. The derivation takes into
account the channel noise, intra-body channel fading, and channel estimation
error. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show that both
SDSD and SDJD can achieve higher channel capacity and lower BER than the CD and
ED receivers with perfect channel estimation, while SDJD can achieve the lowest
BER with imperfect channel estimation.

these phenomena is challenging. To address this problem, computational
simulations are a powerful tool, which have been employed by many previous
works. In this chapter, we describe simulation methods for studying the
vibrational properties of glasses (and any solid-state materials). We first
present a method for studying vibrational eigenmodes. Since vibrational motions
of particles are excited along eigenmodes, the eigenmodes are fundamental to
descriptions of vibrational properties. The eigenmodes in glasses are
non-phonon modes in general, and some of them are even localized in space. We
next present a method of analysing phonon transport, which is also crucial for
understanding vibrational properties. Since phonons are not eigenmodes in
glasses, they are decomposed into several different, non-phonon eigenmodes. As
a result, phonons in glasses are strongly scattered. In addition, we describe
how to analyse the elastic response. The elastic response of glasses is also
anomalous with respect to that of crystals. Finally, we briefly introduce
recent advances that have been achieved by means of large-scale computational
simulations.

developed a computer vision system to automatically detect the violation of
face mask wearing and physical distancing among construction workers to assure
their safety on infrastructure projects during the pandemic. For the face mask
detection, the paper collected and annotated 1,000 images, including different
types of face mask wearing, and added them to a pre-existing face mask dataset
to develop a dataset of 1,853 images. Then trained and tested multiple
Tensorflow state-of-the-art object detection models on the face mask dataset
and chose the Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 network that yielded the
accuracy of 99.8%. For physical distance detection, the paper employed the
Faster R-CNN Inception V2 to detect people. A transformation matrix was used to
eliminate the camera angle's effect on the object distances on the image. The
Euclidian distance used the pixels of the transformed image to compute the
actual distance between people. A threshold of six feet was considered to
capture physical distance violation. The paper also used transfer learning for
training the model. The final model was applied on four videos of road
maintenance projects in Houston, TX, that effectively detected the face mask

system to enhance construction workers' safety in the pandemic situation.

secure along with the intermediate node states; the public network is connected
and may be dense, over which communications are allowed to be public. In this
setting, we propose a multi-gossip PPSC mechanism over the private network,
where at each step, randomly selected node pairs update their states in such a
way that they are shuffled with random noise while maintaining summation
consistency. We show that this mechanism can achieve any desired differential
privacy level with any prescribed probability. Next, we embed this mechanism in
distributed computing processes, and propose privacy-guarantee protocols for
three basic computation tasks, where an adaptive mechanism adjusts the amount
of noise injected in PPSC steps for privacy protection, and the number of
regular computation steps for accuracy guarantee. For average consensus, we
develop a PPSC-Gossip averaging consensus algorithm by utilizing the
multi-gossip PPSC mechanism for privacy encryption before an averaging
consensus algorithm over the public network for local computations. For network
linear equations and distributed convex optimization, we develop two respective
distributed computing protocols by following the PPSC-Gossip averaging
consensus algorithm with an additional projection or gradient descent step
within each step of computation. Given any privacy and accuracy requirements,
it is shown that all three proposed protocols can compute their corresponding
problems with the desired computation accuracy, while achieving the desired

report that the spectral width of the resonance-induced DW can be largely
broadened due to plasma-driven blueshifting soliton. In the experiment, we
observed that in a short length of Ar-filled single-ring HC-PCF the soliton
self-compression and photoionization effects caused a strong spectral blueshift
of the pump pulse, changing the phase-matching condition of the DW emission
process. Therefore, broadening of DW spectrum to the longer-wavelength side was
obtained with several spectral peaks, which correspond to the generation of DW
at different positions along the fiber. In the simulation, we used super-Gauss
windows with different central wavelengths to filter out these DW spectral
peaks, and studied the time-domain characteristics of these peaks respectively
using Fourier transform method. The simulation results verified that these
multiple-peaks on the DW spectrum have different delays in the time domain,
agreeing well with our theoretical prediction. Remarkably, we found that the
whole time-domain DW trace can be compressed to ~29 fs using proper chirp
compensation. The experimental and numerical results reported here provide some

diseases. According to W.H.O., a considerable population suffers from these
disease whereas poor nutrition plays an important role in this context.
Traditional food activity monitoring systems like Food Diaries allow manual
record keeping of eating activities over time, and conduct nutrition analysis.
However, these systems are prone to the problems of manual record keeping and
biased-reporting. Therefore, recently, the research community has focused on
designing automatic food monitoring systems since the last decade which consist
of one or multiple wearable sensors. These systems aim at providing different
macro and micro activity detections like chewing, swallowing, eating episodes,
and food types as well as estimations like food mass and eating duration.
Researchers have emphasized on high detection accuracy, low estimation errors,
un-intrusive nature, low cost and real life implementation while designing
these systems, however a comprehensive automatic food monitoring system has yet
not been developed. Moreover, according to the best of our knowledge, there is
no comprehensive survey in this field that delineates the automatic food
monitoring paradigm, covers a handful number of research studies, analyses
these studies against food intake monitoring tasks using various parameters,
enlists the limitations and sets up future directions. In this research work,
we delineate the automatic food intake monitoring paradigm and present a survey
of research studies. With special focus on studies with wearable sensors, we
analyze these studies against food activity monitoring tasks. We provide brief
comparison of these studies along with shortcomings based upon experimentation
results conducted under these studies. We setup future directions at the end to
facilitate the researchers working in this domain.

an analytic continuation of the Plemelj identity to the complex plane with the

driven to extinction has long been examined using mathematical models. In this
work we study population survival or extinction using a stochastic, discrete
lattice-based random walk model where individuals undergo movement, birth and
death events. The discrete model is defined on a two-dimensional hexagonal
lattice with periodic boundary conditions. A key feature of the discrete model
is that crowding effects are introduced by specifying two different crowding
functions that govern how local agent density influences movement events and
birth/death events. The continuum limit description of the discrete model is a
nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, and we focus on crowding functions that
lead to linear diffusion and a bistable source term that is often associated
with the strong Allee effect. Using both the discrete and continuum modelling
tools we explore the complicated relationship between the long-term survival or
extinction of the population and the initial spatial arrangement of the
population. In particular, we study different spatial arrangements of initial
distributions: (i) a well-mixed initial distribution where the initial density
is independent of position in the domain; (ii) a vertical strip initial
distribution where the initial density is independent of vertical position in
the domain; and, (iii) several forms of two-dimensional initial distributions
where the initial population is distributed in regions with different shapes.

evaluate our framework by comparing the depolarized output of our model in two

Based on feedback from 161 human testers, our framework successfully
depolarized 90.1% of paragraphs in semi-automatic mode and 78.3% of paragraphs

significantly depends on the SAM coverage and ordering, and the formation of
high-quality SAM promoted the TBC to 73 MW/m^2-K from 27 MW/m^2-K, the value

enhancement was identified to be determined by the number of SAM bridges and
the overlap of vibrational density of states. The diamond particles of 210

representations. We further show, with the use of representation theory, and
infinite-dimensional analysis, that our pairwise inequivalent probability
spaces (for the Gaussian processes) correspond in an explicit manner to
pairwise disjoint CCR representations.

partially labeled target domain with the assistance of the fully labeled source
domain, attracts increasing attention in recent years. To explicitly leverage
the labeled data in both domains, we naturally introduce a conditional GAN
framework to transfer images without changing the semantics in SSDA. However,
we identify a label-domination problem in such an approach. In fact, the
generator tends to overlook the input source image and only memorizes
prototypes of each class, which results in unsatisfactory adaptation
performance. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Relaxed conditional
GAN (Relaxed cGAN) framework. Specifically, we feed the image without its label
to our generator. In this way, the generator has to infer the semantic
information of input data. We formally prove that its equilibrium is desirable
and empirically validate its practical convergence and effectiveness in image
transfer. Additionally, we propose several techniques to make use of unlabeled
data in the target domain, enhancing the model in SSDA settings. We validate
our method on the well-adopted datasets: Digits, DomainNet, and Office-Home. We
achieve state-of-the-art performance on DomainNet, Office-Home and most digit
benchmarks in low-resource and high-resource settings.

business processes to predict the effect of a treatment on a categorical
business outcome of interest depending on the process instance characteristics.
This allows optimizing operational decision-making and selecting the optimal
treatment to apply in each specific instance, with the aim of maximizing the
positive outcome rate. While various powerful approaches have been presented in
the literature for learning causal classification models, no formal framework
has been elaborated for optimal decision-making based on the estimated
individual treatment effects, given the cost of the various treatments and the
benefit of the potential outcomes.
  In this article, we therefore extend upon the expected value framework and
formally introduce a cost-sensitive decision boundary for double binary causal
classification, which is a linear function of the estimated individual
treatment effect, the positive outcome probability and the cost and benefit
parameters of the problem setting. The boundary allows causally classifying
instances in the positive and negative treatment class to maximize the expected
causal profit, which is introduced as the objective at hand in cost-sensitive
causal classification. We introduce the expected causal profit ranker which
ranks instances for maximizing the expected causal profit at each possible
threshold for causally classifying instances and differs from the conventional
ranking approach based on the individual treatment effect. The proposed ranking
approach is experimentally evaluated on synthetic and marketing campaign data
sets. The results indicate that the presented ranking method effectively
outperforms the cost-insensitive ranking approach and allows boosting
profitability.

insulators -- are rich source of exotic quantum phases. The nature of these
states is reflected in the gapless edge modes, which in turn can be classified
as integer - carrying electrons, fractional - carrying fractional charges; and
neutral - carrying excitations with zero net charge but a well-defined amount
of heat. The latter two may obey anyonic statistics, which can be abelian or
non-abelian. The most-studied putative non-abelian state is the spin-polarized
filling factor {\nu}=5/2, whose charge e/4 quasiparticles are accompanied by
neutral modes. This filling, however, permits different possible topological
orders, which can be abelian or non-abelian. While numerical calculations favor
the non-abelian anti-Pfaffian (A-Pf) order to have the lowest energy, recent
thermal conductance measurements suggested the experimentally realized order to
be the particle-hole Pfaffian (PH-Pf) order. It has been suggested that lack of
thermal equilibration among the different edge modes of the A-Pf order can
account for this discrepancy. The identification of the topological order is
crucial for the interpretation of braiding (interference) operations, better
understanding of the thermal equilibration process, and the reliability of the
numerical studies. We developed a new method that helps identifying the
topological order of the {\nu}=5/2 state. By creating an interface between the
two 2D half-planes, one hosting the {\nu}=5/2 state and the other an integer
{\nu}=3 state, the interface supported a fractional {\nu}=1/2 charge mode with
1/2 quantum conductance and a neutral Majorana mode. The presence of the
Majorana mode, probed by measuring noise, propagating in the opposite direction
to the charge mode, asserted the presence of the PH-Pf order but not that of
the A-Pf order.

Smart meters typically collect and provide energy time series that are vital
for various applications, such as grid simulations, fault-detection, load
forecasting, load analysis, and load management. Unfortunately, these time
series are often characterized by missing values that must be handled before
the data can be used. A common approach to handle missing values in time series
is imputation. However, existing imputation methods are designed for power time
series and do not take into account the total energy of gaps, resulting in
jumps or constant shifts when imputing energy time series. In order to overcome
these issues, the present paper introduces the new Copy-Paste Imputation (CPI)
method for energy time series. The CPI method copies data blocks with similar
properties and pastes them into gaps of the time series while preserving the
total energy of each gap. The new method is evaluated on a real-world dataset
that contains six shares of artificially inserted missing values between 1 and
30%. It outperforms by far the three benchmark imputation methods selected for
comparison. The comparison furthermore shows that the CPI method uses matching
patterns and preserves the total energy of each gap while requiring only a
moderate run-time.

entropic regularized Wasserstein distances in the Hilbert space setting. Our
first main result is that for Gaussian measures on an infinite-dimensional
Hilbert space, convergence in the 2-Sinkhorn divergence is {\it strictly
weaker} than convergence in the exact 2-Wasserstein distance. Specifically, a
sequence of centered Gaussian measures converges in the 2-Sinkhorn divergence
if the corresponding covariance operators converge in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm.
This is in contrast to the previous known result that a sequence of centered
Gaussian measures converges in the exact 2-Wasserstein distance if and only if
the covariance operators converge in the trace class norm. In the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) setting, the {\it kernel Gaussian-Sinkhorn
divergence}, which is the Sinkhorn divergence between Gaussian measures defined
on an RKHS, defines a semi-metric on the set of Borel probability measures on a
Polish space, given a characteristic kernel on that space. With the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm convergence, we obtain {\it dimension-independent}
convergence rates for finite sample approximations of the kernel
Gaussian-Sinkhorn divergence, with the same order as the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy. These convergence rates apply in particular to Sinkhorn divergence
between Gaussian measures on Euclidean and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
The sample complexity for the 2-Wasserstein distance between Gaussian measures
on Euclidean space, while dimension-dependent and larger than that of the
Sinkhorn divergence, is exponentially faster than the worst case scenario in
the literature.

to their ability to naturally describe fracture of general materials. However,
two factors conspire to prevent meshfree discretizations of state-based
peridynamics from converging to corresponding local solutions as resolution is
increased: quadrature error prevents an accurate prediction of bulk mechanics,
and the lack of an explicit boundary representation presents challenges when
applying traction loads. In this paper, we develop a reformulation of the
linear peridynamic solid (LPS) model to address these shortcomings, using
improved meshfree quadrature, a reformulation of the nonlocal dilitation, and a
consistent handling of the nonlocal traction condition to construct a model
with rigorous accuracy guarantees. In particular, these improvements are
designed to enforce discrete consistency in the presence of evolving fractures,
whose {\it a priori} unknown location render consistent treatment difficult. In
the absence of fracture, when a corresponding classical continuum mechanics
model exists, our improvements provide asymptotically compatible convergence to
corresponding local solutions, eliminating surface effects and issues with
traction loading which have historically plagued peridynamic discretizations.
When fracture occurs, our formulation automatically provides a sharp
representation of the fracture surface by breaking bonds, avoiding the loss of
mass. We provide rigorous error analysis and demonstrate convergence for a
number of benchmarks, including manufactured solutions, free-surface,
nonhomogeneous traction loading, and composite material problems. Finally, we
validate simulations of brittle fracture against a recent experiment of dynamic
crack branching in soda-lime glass, providing evidence that the scheme yields
accurate predictions for practical engineering problems.

measured by HAWC. Our results show that the chi-square statistic monotonously
increases as $\alpha$ decreases from 2 to 1, where $\alpha$ is the
characteristic index of superdiffusion describing the degree of fractality of
the ISM and $\alpha=2$ corresponds to the normal diffusion model. We find that
model with $\alpha<1.32$ (or $<1.4$, depending on the data used in fit) is
disfavored at 95\% confidence level. Superdiffusion model with $\alpha$ close
to 2 can well explain the morphology of the Geminga halo, while it predicts
much higher positron flux on the Earth than the normal diffusion model. This

novel holistic approach based on phase-resolved transient absorption
spectroscopy with few-cycle optical pulses. After excitation by a sub-5 fs
light pulse, strong electron-phonon coupling leads to an ultrafast momentum
relaxation with time constant of 10 fs. The thermalization of the hot carriers
occurs on a time constant of 150 fs, visible in the temporal evolution of the
collision time as extracted from the Drude model. We find an increase of the
collision time from 3 fs for the shortest timescales with a saturation at
approximately 18 fs. Moreover, the optical effective mass of the hot carrier
ensemble evolves on ultrafast timescales as well, with a bi-exponential
decrease from 0.7 $m_e$ to about 0.125 $m_e$ and time constants of 4 fs and 58
fs. The presented information on the electron mass dynamics as well as the
momentum-, energy-, and collision-scattering times with unprecedented time
resolution is important for all hot carrier optoelectronic devices.

areas, such as object and speech recognition on mobile systems. Since a
critical key to machine learning success is the availability of large training
data, many datasets are being disclosed and published online. From a data
consumer or manager point of view, measuring data quality is an important first
step in the learning process. We need to determine which datasets to use,
update, and maintain. However, not many practical ways to measure data quality
are available today, especially when it comes to large-scale high-dimensional
data, such as images and videos. This paper proposes two data quality measures
that can compute class separability and in-class variability, the two important
aspects of data quality, for a given dataset. Classical data quality measures
tend to focus only on class separability; however, we suggest that in-class
variability is another important data quality factor. We provide efficient
algorithms to compute our quality measures based on random projections and
bootstrapping with statistical benefits on large-scale high-dimensional data.
In experiments, we show that our measures are compatible with classical
measures on small-scale data and can be computed much more efficiently on
large-scale high-dimensional datasets.

BHPE, blind quantum channel identification/estimation, blind phase estimation),
system inversion and state estimation (blind quantum source separation or BQSS,

in minimally invasive procedures, reducing radiation in the OR. However, in
this hybrid setting, EMT is disturbed by metallic distortion caused by the
X-ray device. We plan to make hybrid navigation clinical reality to reduce
radiation exposure for patients and surgeons, by compensating EMT error.
  Methods: Our online compensation strategy exploits cycle-consistent
generative adversarial neural networks (CycleGAN). 3D positions are translated
from various bedside environments to their bench equivalents. Domain-translated
points are fine-tuned to reduce error in the bench domain. We evaluate our
compensation approach in a phantom experiment.
  Results: Since the domain-translation approach maps distorted points to their
lab equivalents, predictions are consistent among different C-arm environments.
Error is successfully reduced in all evaluation environments. Our qualitative
phantom experiment demonstrates that our approach generalizes well to an unseen

  Conclusion: Adversarial, cycle-consistent training is an explicable,
consistent and thus interpretable approach for online error compensation.
Qualitative assessment of EMT error compensation gives a glimpse to the

individual privacy while preserving data utility. Community structure, which is
an important global pattern of nodes, is a crucial data utility as it serves as
fundamental operations for many graph analysis tasks. Yet, most existing
methods with differential privacy (DP) commonly fall in edge-DP to sacrifice
security in exchange for utility. Moreover, they reconstruct graphs from the
local feature-extraction of nodes, resulting in poor community preservation.
Motivated by this, we propose PrivCom, a strict node-DP graph publishing
algorithm to maximize the utility on the community structure while maintaining
a higher level of privacy. Specifically, to reduce the huge sensitivity, we
devise a Katz index-based private graph feature extraction method, which can
capture global graph structure features while greatly reducing the global
sensitivity via a sensitivity regulation strategy. Yet, with a fixed
sensitivity, the feature captured by Katz index, which is presented in matrix
form, requires privacy budget splits. As a result, plenty of noise is injected,
thereby mitigating global structural utility. To this end, we design a private
Oja algorithm approximating eigen-decomposition, which yields the noisy Katz
matrix via privately estimating eigenvectors and eigenvalues from extracted
low-dimensional vectors. Experimental results confirm our theoretical findings
and the efficacy of PrivCom.

the structure of the cosmic web, in particular the filaments that join the

Patch halo catalogues by using the initial strain tensor of spherical
proto-halo regions to orient the haloes. To go beyond the spherically averaged
two-point correlation function of haloes we use oriented stacks to compute
oriented two-point correlations: we explicitly break isotropy by imposing a
local frame set by the strain tensor of the reference halo before stacking
neighbouring haloes. Beyond the exclusion zone of the reference halo,
clustering is found to be strongly enhanced along the major direction of the
strain tensor as expected. This anisotropic clustering of haloes along
filaments is further quantified by using a spherical harmonics decomposition.
Furthermore, we compute the evolution of cluster-scale halo principal
directions relative to those of their neighbours and show that there are strong
correlations extending up to very large scales. In order to provide
calculations more suitable to observational confrontations, we also utilize 2D
projected versions of some equivalent correlation functions. Finally, we show
that the multipole structure of the mass-peak patch halo's anisotropic
clustering can be qualitatively captured in an analytic treatment based on peak
theory. Though highly informative, analytic evaluation involves extensive use

into account as they do the adaptive nature of the mass-peak patch mass
hierarchy and all non-local complexities associated with the exclusion of

focus on the multilayer network structure, while neglecting how the structural
and dynamical coupling of multiple layers influence the dynamical importance of
nodes in the network. Here we investigate on this question in an
information-disease coupled spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. Firstly,
we explicitly reveal that three interlayer coupling factors, which are the
two-layer relative spreading speed, the interlayer coupling strength and the
two-layer degree correlation, significantly impact the spreading influence of a
node on the contact layer. The suppression effect from the information layer
makes the structural centrality on the contact layer fail to predict the
spreading influence of nodes in the multiplex network. Then by mapping the
coevolving spreading dynamics into percolation process and using the
message-passing approach, we propose a method to calculate the size of the
disease outbreaks from a single seed node, which can be used to estimate the
nodes' spreading influence in the coevolving dynamics. Our work provides
insights on the importance of nodes in the multiplex network and gives a

Firstly, we would like the well known embedding of bicategories into pseudo
double categories to be monoidal, which it is not if one uses the usual notion
of a monoidal pseudo double category. Secondly, in \cite{Gabi} the question was
raised: which would be an alternative notion to intercategories of Grandis and
Par\'e, so that monoids in B\""ohm's monoidal category $(Dbl,\ot)$ of strict
double categories and strict double functors with a Gray type monoidal product
be an example of it? We obtain and prove that precisely the monoidal structure
of $(Dbl,\ot)$ resolves the first question. On the other hand, resolving the
second question, we upgrade the category $Dbl$ to a tricategory $\DblPs$ and
propose %an alternative definition of intercategories as to consider internal
categories in this tricategory. %, enabling monoids in $(Dbl,\ot)$ to be
examples of this gadget. Apart from monoids in $(Dbl,\ot)$ - more importanlty,
weak pseudomonoids in a tricategory containing $(Dbl,\ot)$ as a sub 1-category
- most of the examples of intercategories are also examples of this gadget, the
ones that escape are those that rely on laxness of the product on the pullback,
as duoidal categories. For the latter purpose we define categories internal to
tricategories (of the type of $\DblPs$), which simultaneously serves our third
motive. Namely, inspired by the tricategory and $(1\times 2)$-category of
tensor categories, we prove under mild conditions that categories enriched over
certain type of tricategories may be made into categories internal in them. We
illustrate this occurrence for tensor categories with respect to the ambient
tricategory $2\x\Cat_{wk}$ of 2-categories, pseudofunctors, pseudonatural
transformations and modifications.

randomly select all replacing points while the other one is to select k nearest

significantly improve the performance of various models on point cloud

successfully electrospun from FDA-approved polyesters, either
poly(epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) or poly[(rac-lactide)-co-glycolide] (PLGA) with
encapsulated PS (either methylene blue (MB) or erythrosin B (ER)). The
electrospun fibres achieved an ~100 wt.% loading efficiency of PS, which
significantly increased their tensile modulus and reduced their average fibre
diameter and pore size with respect to PS-free controls. In vitro, PS release
varied between a burst release profile to limited release within 100 hours

optimal linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control inputs, and a cumulative sum
(CUSUM) test is carried out using the joint distribution of the innovation
signal and the watermarking signal for quickest attack detection. We derive the
expressions of the supremum of the average detection delay (SADD) for a

CUSUM tests. The SADD is asymptotically inversely proportional to the expected
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) under certain conditions. The expressions for
the MIMO case are simplified for multi-input and single-output systems and
explored further to distil design insights. We provide insights into the design
of an optimal watermarking signal to maximize KLD for a given fixed increase in
LQG control cost when there is no attack. Furthermore, we investigate how the
attacker and the control system designer can accomplish their respective
objectives by changing the relative power of the attack signal and the
watermarking signal. Simulations and numerical studies are carried out to
validate the theoretical results.

parts of the accretion flow, including the accretion boundary layer (BL) on the
surface of the neutron star. All the existing models of kHz QPOs explain only
part of their rich phenomenology. Here, we show that some of their properties
may be explained by a very simple model of the BL that is spun up by accreting
rapidly rotating matter from the disk and spun down by the interaction with the
neutron star. In particular, if the characteristic time scales for the mass and
the angular momentum transfer from the BL to the star are of the same order of
magnitude, our model naturally reproduces the so-called parallel tracks effect,
when the QPO frequency is correlated with luminosity at time scales of hours
but becomes uncorrelated at time scales of days. The closeness of the two time
scales responsible for mass and angular momentum exchange between the BL and
the star is an expected outcome of the radial structure of the BL.

patterns of material organization that characterize living organisms today are
contingent on events that occurred billions of years ago. This contingency is a
necessary component of Darwinian evolution: patterns in the present inherit
some of their features from those in the past. Despite its central role in
biology, heritable information is difficult to recognize in prebiotic systems
described in the language of chemistry or physics. Here, we consider one such
description based on continuous-time Markov processes and investigate the
persistence of heritable information within large sets of dynamical systems.
While the microscopic state of each system fluctuates incessantly, there exist
few systems that relax slowly to their stationary distribution over much longer
times. These systems, selected for their persistence, are further distinguished
by their mesoscopic organization, which allows for accurate course grained
descriptions of their dynamics at long times. The slow relaxation of these
stable patterns is made possible by dissipative currents fueled by
thermodynamic gradients present in the surrounding reservoirs. We show how the
rate of entropy production within a system sets an upper bound on the lifetime
of its persistent patterns. We also consider the probability of finding
persistence within large sets of dynamical systems. We show that physical
constraints based on continuity and locality can strongly influence the
probability of persistence and its dependence on system size. Finally, we
describe how heritable information can be quantified in practice using
universal compression algorithms. We demonstrate this approach on an
experimental system of magnetically-driven, colloidal rollers and discuss the
application of these methods to origins of life research.

exchange bias. Here we develop an atomistic spin model of the athermal training
effect, a well known phenomenon in exchange biased systems where the bias is
significantly reduced after the first hysteresis cycle. We find that the
setting process in granular thin films relies on the presence of interfacial
mixing between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers. We
systematically investigate the effect of the intermixing and find that the
exchange bias, switching field and coercivity all increase with increased
intermixing. The interfacial spin state is highly frustrated leading to a
systematic decrease in interfacial ordering of the ferromagnet. This metastable
spin structure of initially irreversible spins leads to a large effective
exchange coupling and thus large increase in the switching field. After the
first hysteresis cycle these metastable spins drop into a reversible ground
state that is repeatable for all subsequent hysteresis cycles, demonstrating
that the effect is truly athermal. Our simulations provide new insights into
the role of interface mixing and the importance of metastable spin structures

expected to host d-wave superconductivity, but its low temperature phases have
not been reached. In a recent work, we proposed an approach of incommensurate
quantum adiabatic doping, using quantum adiabatic evolution of an
incommensurate lattice for preparation of the highly correlated many-body
ground state of the doped Fermi-Hubbard model starting from a unit-filling band
insulator. Its feasibility has been demonstrated with numerical simulations of
the adiabatic preparation for certain incommensurate particle-doping fractions,
where the major problem to circumvent is the atomic localization in the
incommensurate lattice. Here we carry out a systematic study of the quantum
adiabatic doping for a wide range of doping fractions from particle-doping to
hole-doping, including both commensurate and incommensurate cases. We find that
there is still a localization-like slowing-down problem at commensurate
fillings, and that it becomes less harmful in the hole-doped regime. With
interactions, the adiabatic preparation is found to be more efficient for that
interaction effect destabilizes localization. For both free and interacting

Solar Probe (PSP) observed numerous local reversals, or inversions, in the
heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), which were accompanied by large spikes in
solar wind speed. Both solar and in situ mechanisms have been suggested to
explain the existence of HMF inversions in general. Previous work using Helios
1, covering 0.3-1AU, observed inverted HMF to become more common with
increasing r, suggesting that some heliospheric driving process creates or
amplifies inversions. This study expands upon these findings, by analysing
inversion-associated changes in plasma properties for the same large data set,
facilitated by observations of 'strahl' electrons to identify the unperturbed
magnetic polarity. We find that many inversions exhibit anti-correlated field
and velocity perturbations, and are thus characteristically Alfv\'enic, but
many also depart strongly from this relationship over an apparent continuum of
properties. Inversions depart further from the 'ideal' Alfv\'enic case with
increasing r, as more energy is partitioned in the field, rather than the
plasma, component of the perturbation. This departure is greatest for
inversions with larger density and magnetic field strength changes, and
characteristic slow solar wind properties. We find no evidence that inversions
which stray further from 'ideal' Alfv\'enicity have different generation
processes from those which are more Alfv\'enic. Instead, different inversion
properties could be imprinted based on transport or formation within different
solar wind streams.

by transductive inference, jointly on a number of queries. In this work, we
bring these two ideas together, introducing \emph{local propagation}. We treat
local image features as independent examples, we build a graph on them and we
use it to propagate both the features themselves and the labels, known and

single query gives rise to transductive inference. As a result, we provide a
universally safe choice for few-shot inference under both non-transductive and

validity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification paradigm (UP). In
particular, we focus on the AGN host galaxies, which according to the UP should
show no systematic differences depending on the AGN classification. Methods.For
the purpose of this study, we used (a) the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Data Release (DR) 14 catalogue, in order to select and classify
AGNs using emission line diagnostics, up to a redshift of z=0.2, and (b) the
Galaxy Zoo Project catalogue, which classifies SDSS galaxies in two broad
Hubble types: spirals and ellipticals. Results.We find that the fraction of
type 1 Seyfert nuclei (Sy1) hosted in elliptical galaxies is significantly
larger than the corresponding fraction of any other AGN type, while there is a
gradient of increasing spiral-hosts from Sy1 to LINER, type 2 Seyferts (Sy2)
and composite nuclei. These findings cannot be interpreted within the simple
unified model, but possibly by a co-evolution scheme for supermassive black
holes (SMBH) and galactic bulges. Furthermore, for the case of spiral host
galaxies we find the Sy1 population to be strongly skewed towards face-on
configurations, while the corresponding Sy2 population range in all host galaxy
orientation configurations has a similar, but not identical, orientation
distribution to star-forming (SF) galaxies. These results also cannot be
interpreted by the standard unification paradigm, but point towards a
significant contribution of the galactic disc to the obscuration of the nuclear
region. This is also consistent with the observed preference of Sy1 nuclei to
be hosted by ellipticals, that is, the dusty disc of spiral hosts contributes
to the obscuration of the broad-line region (BLR), and thus relatively more
ellipticals are expected to appear hosting Sy1 nuclei.

In this feasibility study, we focused our attention on the distribution of
acceleration and angular velocity fluctuations as a function of the forcing

show that our proposed EC-VE can greatly improve user QoE within security
constraints, and the proposed Greedy EC-VE can obtain the tradeoff between QoE

spaces arise in various real-world applications such as engineering, economics,
geophysics, biology, machine learning, optimal control, etc. Among stochastic
approaches to global optimisation, biology-inspired methods are currently
popular in the literature, imitating natural ecological and evolutionary
processes and reported to be efficient in many practical study cases. However,
many of bio-inspired methods have some vital drawbacks. Due to their
semi-empirical nature, convergence to the globally optimal solution cannot
always be guaranteed and struggles with the high dimensionality of space,
showing a slow convergence. Here, we present a bio-inspired global stochastic
optimisation method, applicable in Hilbert function spaces, inspired by
Darwin's' famous idea of the survival of the fittest, therefore, referred to as
the `Survival of the Fittest Algorithm' (SoFA). Mathematically, the convergence
of SoFA is a consequence of a fundamental property of localisation of
probabilistic measure in a Hilbert space, we rigorously prove the convergence
of the introduced algorithm for a generic class of functionals. As an
insightful real-world problem, we apply SoFA to find globally optimal
trajectories for daily vertical migrations of zooplankton in ocean and lakes,
considered to be the largest synchronised movement of biomass on Earth. We
maximise fitness in a function space derived from a von-Foerster
stage-structured population model with biologically realistic parameters. We
show that for problems of fitness maximisation in high-dimensional spaces, SoFA
performs better than some other stochastic global optimisation algorithms. We
highlight the links between the new optimisation algorithm and natural
selection process in ecosystems occurring within a population via gradual
exclusion of competitive con-specific strains.

transition and boundary layers form in such type of accretion, when viscosity
is significant, and one or more layers are absent when the viscosity is

or medical decision making, classification models for assigning instances to a
predefined set of classes are required to be both precise as well as
interpretable. Linear modeling methods such as logistic regression are often
adopted, since they offer an acceptable balance between precision and
interpretability. Linear methods, however, are not well equipped to handle
categorical predictors with high-cardinality or to exploit non-linear relations
in the data. As a solution, data preprocessing methods such as
weight-of-evidence are typically used for transforming the predictors. The
binning procedure that underlies the weight-of-evidence approach, however, has
been little researched and typically relies on ad-hoc or expert driven
procedures. The objective in this paper, therefore, is to propose a formalized,
data-driven and powerful method.
  To this end, we explore the discretization of continuous variables through
the binning of spline functions, which allows for capturing non-linear effects
in the predictor variables and yields highly interpretable predictors taking
only a small number of discrete values. Moreover, we extend upon the
weight-of-evidence approach and propose to estimate the proportions using
shrinkage estimators. Together, this offers an improved ability to exploit both
non-linear and categorical predictors for achieving increased classification
precision, while maintaining interpretability of the resulting model and
decreasing the risk of overfitting.
  We present the results of a series of experiments in a fraud detection
setting, which illustrate the effectiveness of the presented approach. We
facilitate reproduction of the presented results and adoption of the proposed
approaches by providing both the dataset and the code for implementing the

features is a challenging issue in the field of image denoising. In recent
years, fractional PDE based methods have attracted more and more research
efforts due to the ability to balance the noise removal and the preservation of
image edges and textures. Among the existing fractional PDE algorithms, there
are only a few using spatial fractional order derivatives, and all the
fractional derivatives involved are one-sided derivatives. In this paper, an
efficient feature-preserving fractional PDE algorithm is proposed for image
denoising based on a nonlinear spatial-fractional anisotropic diffusion
equation. Two-sided Grumwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives were used in the
PDE model which are suitable to depict the local self-similarity of images. The
Short Memory Principle is employed to simplify the approximation scheme.
Experimental results show that the proposed method is of a satisfactory
performance, i.e. it keeps a remarkable balance between noise removal and
feature preserving, and has an extremely high structural retention property.

detected in several AGNs but different patterns have been reported. Here we
report new detections of $E_{\rm cut}$ variations in two Seyfert galaxies with
multiple NuSTAR exposures. While in NGC 3227 $E_{\rm cut}$ monotonically
increases with $\Gamma$, the $E_{\rm cut}$-$\Gamma$ relation exhibits a
$\Lambda$ shape in SWIFT J2127.4+5654 ($E_{\rm cut}$ increasing with $\Gamma$
at $\Gamma$ $\lesssim$ 2.05, but reversely decreasing at $\Gamma$ $\gtrsim$
2.05), indicating more than a single underlying mechanism is involved.
Meanwhile both galaxies show softer spectra while they brighten in X-ray, a
common phenomenon in Seyfert galaxies. Plotting all 7 AGNs with $E_{\rm cut}$
variations ever reported with NuSTAR observations in the $E_{\rm cut}$-$\Gamma$

pollution evolution at observatory sites, by subtracting it from the overall
sky brightness determined by direct measurements. It is also instrumental for
assessing the expected darkness of the pristine night skies. The natural
brightness of the night sky is determined by the sum of the spectral radiances
coming from astrophysical sources, including zodiacal light, and the
atmospheric airglow. The resulting radiance is modified by absorption and
scattering before it reaches the observer. Therefore, the natural night sky
brightness is a function of the location, time and atmospheric conditions. We
present in this work GAMBONS (GAia Map of the Brightness Of the Natural Sky), a
model to map the natural night brightness of the sky in cloudless and moonless
nights. Unlike previous maps, GAMBONS is based on the extra-atmospheric star
radiance obtained from the Gaia catalogue. The Gaia-DR2 archive compiles
astrometric and photometric information for more than 1.6 billion stars up to G
= 21 magnitude. For the brightest stars, not included in Gaia-DR2, we have used
the Hipparcos catalogue instead. After adding up to the star radiance the
contributions of the diffuse galactic and extragalactic light, zodiacal light
and airglow, and taking into account the effects of atmospheric attenuation and
scattering, the radiance detected by ground-based observers can be estimated.
This methodology can be applied to any photometric band, if appropriate
transformations from the Gaia bands are available. In particular, we present
the expected sky brightness for V (Johnson), and visual photopic and scotopic
passbands.

gradient-based methods for LCPs call a projection after each (stochastic)
gradient descent, resulting in that the required number of projections equals
that of gradient descents (or total iterations). Motivated by the recent
progress in distributed optimization, we propose the delayed projection
technique that calls a projection once for a while, lowering the projection
frequency and improving the projection efficiency. Accordingly, we devise a
series of stochastic methods for LCPs using the technique, including a variance
reduced method and an accelerated one. We theoretically show that it is
feasible to improve projection efficiency in both strongly convex and generally
convex cases. Our analysis is simple and unified and can be easily extended to
other methods using delayed projections. When applying our new algorithms to
federated optimization, a newfangled and privacy-preserving subfield in

accelerated method able to handle data heterogeneity inherent in federated

these offers an advantage over low-frequency methods from their ability to
detect damage on a smaller scale. However, in order to assess damage in a

guided wave throughout the material/structure is important (especially when
designing sensor placement for SHM systems). Determining this behaviour is
extremely diffcult in complex materials, such as fibre-matrix composites, where
unique phenomena such as continuous mode conversion takes place. This paper
introduces a novel method for modelling the feature-space of guided waves in a
composite material. This technique is based on a data-driven model, where prior
physical knowledge can be used to create structured machine learning tools;
where constraints are applied to provide said structure. The method shown makes
use of Gaussian processes, a full Bayesian analysis tool, and in this paper it
is shown how physical knowledge of the guided waves can be utilised in
modelling using an ML tool. This paper shows that through careful consideration
when applying machine learning techniques, more robust models can be generated

Things applications (e.g., smart city, smart farming), current Low-Power
Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are not designed to effectively support mobile
nodes. In this paper, we propose to handle mobility in SNOW (Sensor Network
Over White spaces), an LPWAN that operates in the TV white spaces. SNOW
supports massive concurrent communication between a base station (BS) and
numerous low-power nodes through a distributed implementation of OFDM. In SNOW,
inter-carrier interference (ICI) is more pronounced under mobility due to its
OFDM based design. Geospatial variation of white spaces also raises challenges
in both intra- and inter-network mobility as the low-power nodes are not
equipped to determine white spaces. To handle mobility impacts on ICI, we
propose a dynamic carrier frequency offset estimation and compensation
technique which takes into account Doppler shifts without requiring to know the
speed of the nodes. We also propose to circumvent the mobility impacts on
geospatial variation of white space through a mobility-aware spectrum
assignment to nodes. To enable mobility of the nodes across different SNOWs, we
propose an efficient handoff management through a fast and energy-efficient BS
discovery and quick association with the BS by combining time and frequency
domain energy-sensing. Experiments through SNOW deployments in a large
metropolitan city and indoors show that our proposed approaches enable mobility
across multiple different SNOWs and provide robustness in terms of reliability,
latency, and energy consumption under mobility.

modular convex optimization framework, relying on second-order cone (SOC)
tightening, to encode hard affine SDP constraints on function derivatives, for
models belonging to vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vRKHSs).
The modular nature of the proposed approach allows to simultaneously handle
multiple shape constraints, and to tighten an infinite number of constraints
into finitely many. We prove the convergence of the proposed scheme and that of
its adaptive variant, leveraging geometric properties of vRKHSs. Due to the
covering-based construction of the tightening, the method is particularly
well-suited to tasks with small to moderate input dimensions. The efficiency of
the approach is illustrated in the context of shape optimization,
safety-critical control, robotics and econometrics.

formulate a risk-based decision framework for structural health monitoring that
combines elements of PRA with the existing SHM paradigm. As an apt tool for
reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty, probabilistic graphical models
serve as the foundation of the framework. The framework involves modelling
failure modes of structures as Bayesian network representations of fault trees
and then assigning costs or utilities to the failure events. The fault trees
allow for information to pass from probabilistic classifiers to influence
diagram representations of decision processes whilst also providing nodes
within the graphical model that may be queried to obtain marginal probability
distributions over local damage states within a structure. Optimal courses of
action for structures are selected by determining the strategies that maximise
expected utility. The risk-based framework is demonstrated on a realistic
truss-like structure and supported by experimental data. Finally, a discussion
of the risk-based approach is made and further challenges pertaining to
decision-making processes in the context of SHM are identified.

important cosmological constraints. It has long been assumed that the oldest
stars of the Galaxy display the primordial Li abundance in their outer layers,
although studies of stellar physics have proven that this abundance must have
decreased with time. The primordial Li abundance deduced from the observations
of the cosmic background is larger than the maximum observed in these stars.
Recent observations have given evidence of a large Li abundance dispersion in
very metal-poor stars. Many of these stars are carbon-rich, the carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars. We address the general question of the observed
abundances in metal-poor stars and we focus our study on the case of CEMP-s
stars. We study how the accretion of the wind of stellar companions, especially
asymptotic giant branch stars, modifies the element abundances of metal-poor
stars and, in particular Li, taking into account the stellar structure and the
hydrodynamic processes that take place after accretion. We compare the results
with the observations of Li and heavier elements in these old stars on the main
sequence. We use the Montr\'eal/Montpellier stellar evolution code, which
includes atomic diffusion and thermohaline convection, to compute the internal
structure of the proto-CEMP-s stars and their evolution, from [Fe/H]=-2.31 down
to [Fe/H]=-5.45. We study a number of cases that vary according to the masses
of the stars, their ages, metallicities, and the distances to their respective
companions. We show that the observations of Li dispersion that is associated
(or not) with carbon enrichment are well accounted for in terms of accretion on

masses smaller than those considered in previous studies. The derived
primordial value is in accordance with the cosmological results.

prescribed time scales of scattering. It was found that the obtained VDFs
contain strip-like and loss-cone features with positive gradient, and both
features are capable of driving electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), which
is a viable radiation mechanism for some solar radio bursts, in particular,
solar radio spikes. The strip-like feature is important in driving the harmonic

smooth curve over QQ, and p is a closed point of Z, the Chabauty-Kim method
leads to the construction of locally analytic functions on X(ZZ_p) which vanish
on X(Z); we call such functions ""Kim functions"". At least in broad outline, the
method generalizes readily to higher dimensions. In fact, in some sense, the
surface M_{0,5} should be easier than the previously studied curve M_{0,4}
since its points are closely related to those of M_{0,4}, yet they face a
further condition to integrality. This is mirrored by a certain ""weight

not coming from M_{0,4}. Here we focus on the case ""ZZ[1/6] in half-weight 4"",
where we provide a first nontrivial example of a Kim function on a surface.
  Central to our approach to Chabauty-Kim theory (as developed in works by S.
Wewers, D. Corwin, and the first author) is the possibility of separating the
geometric part of the computation from its arithmetic context. However, we find
that in this case the geometric step grows beyond the bounds of standard

solve this seemingly straightforward problem, and our new Kim function is huge.

Recently, several papers have presented insightful perspectives into how the

begin with experimental observations and the authors propose structures,

consider a perspective that past works have not, as a complementary approach to
the experimentally-grounded ones. We approach the same problem as past authors
but from the other end of the computational spectrum, from the problem nature,
as Marr's Computational Level would prescribe. What problem must the brain
solve when orchestrating attentional processes in order to successfully
complete one of the myriad possible visuospatial tasks at which we as humans
excel? The hope, of course, is for the approaches to eventually meet and thus
form a complete theory, but this is likely not soon. We make the first steps
towards this by addressing the necessity of attentional control, examining the
breadth and computational difficulty of the visuospatial and attentional tasks
seen in human behavior, and suggesting a sketch of how attentional control
might arise in the brain. The key conclusions of this paper are that an
executive controller is necessary for human attentional function in vision, and
that there is a 'first principles' computational approach to its understanding
that is complementary to the previous approaches that focus on modelling or
learning from experimental observations directly.

supported galaxies to their flat disk velocities. A popular form of the BTFR
linked to MOND is based on an empirically determined characteristic
acceleration, a0 that serves as the constant of proportionality. In this work,
we propose an alternative, parametric form of the BTFR employing individual
galactic properties from the SPARC galaxy database. Based on this data we find
that a precise mass-velocity correlation is possible taking into account
galactic disk radius and two dynamical related properties; mass discrepancy and
disk surface density. We find no need to invoke a characteristic acceleration
constant although its ansatz can be extracted and compared to several recent
analyses also arguing against the MOND interpretation of a0. This improved BTFR
finding has ramifications for the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) as well.
Rather than a universal relation that describes the dynamics of all

and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. We find that, in an ideal
setting without further systematics, the starlet $\ell_1$-norm remarkably
outperforms commonly used summary statistics, such as the power spectrum or the
combination of peak and void counts, in terms of constraining power,
representing a promising new unified framework to simultaneously account for
the information encoded in peak counts and voids. We find that the starlet

we propose a structured methodology of augmenting a deep neural network (DNN)

(ANS), a novel metric for measuring the adversarial gradient contribution of
different intermediate layers of a network. Based on the ANS value, we append a
detector to the most sensitive layer. In prior works, more complex detectors
were added to a DNN, increasing the inference computational cost of the model.
In contrast, our structured and strategic addition of a detector to a DNN
reduces the complexity of the model while making the overall network
adversarially resilient. Through comprehensive white-box and black-box
experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, we show that our method improves
state-of-the-art detector robustness against adversarial examples. Furthermore,
we validate the energy efficiency of our proposed adversarial detection
methodology through an extensive energy analysis on various hardware scalable
CMOS accelerator platforms. We also demonstrate the effects of quantization on

Our results show distinct motions for individual duos and trios, and different

thanks to the new generation of experiments, and in particular the AMS-02
mission. At the same time, significant progress has been made in the
propagation models of galactic cosmic rays. These models include several
propagation parameters, which are usually inferred from the ratios of secondary
to primary cosmic rays, and which depend on the cross sections describing the
collisions among the various species of cosmic-ray nuclei. At present, our
knowledge of these cross sections in the energy range where cosmic-ray
interactions occur is limited, and this is a source of uncertainties in the
predicted fluxes of secondary cosmic-ray nuclei. In this work we study the
impact of the cross section uncertainties on the fluxes of light secondary
nuclei (Li, Be, B) using a preliminary version of the upcoming {\tt DRAGON2}
code. We first present a detailed comparison of the secondary fluxes computed
by implementing different parametrizations for the network of spallation cross
sections. Then, we propose for the first time the use of
secondary-over-secondary cosmic-ray flux ratios as a tool to investigate the
consistency of cross sections models and give insight of the overall
uncertainties coming from the cross sections parametrizations. We show that the
uncertainties inferred from the cross section data are enough to explain the
discrepancies in the Be and Li fluxes with respect to the AMS-02 data, with no
need of a primary component in their spectra. In addition, we show that the
fluxes of B, Be and Li can be simultaneously reproduced by rescaling their
cross sections within the experimental uncertainty. Finally, we also revisit
the diffusive estimation of the halo size, obtaining good agreement with
previous works and a best fit value of $6.8 \pm 1$ kpc from the most updated
cross sections parametrizations.

individual databases. In the specific but very common context of the Cox
proportional hazards model, we show that standard meta analysis methods then
lead to substantial bias when outcome counts are small. This bias derives
primarily from the normal approximations that the methods utilize. Here we
propose and evaluate methods that eschew normal approximations in favor of
three more flexible approximations: a skew-normal, a one-dimensional grid, and
a custom parametric function that mimics the behavior of the Cox likelihood
function. In extensive simulation studies we demonstrate how these
approximations impact bias in the context of both fixed-effects and (Bayesian)
random-effects models. We then apply these approaches to three real-world

theoretical works have been devoted to understand the origin of the

the role of hole and electron doping by rare-earth substitutions in RNiO$_3$

theory (DFT) we study the effect of hole and electron doping in a prototypical
nickelate SmNiO3. We perform calculations without Hubbard-like U potential on
Ni 3d levels but with a meta-GGA better amending self-interaction errors. We
find that at low doping, polarons form with intermediate localized states in
the band gap resulting in a semiconducting behavior. At larger doping, the
intermediate states spread more and more in the band gap until they merge
either with the valence (hole doping) or the conduction (electron doping) band,
ultimately resulting in a metallic state at 25% of R cation substitution. These
results are reminiscent of experimental data available in the literature and
demonstrate that DFT simulations without any empirical parameter are qualified
for studying doping effects in correlated oxides and to explore the mechanisms
underlying the superconducting phase of rare-earth nickelates.

mechanical milling. However, for Si-Ni3Sn4 composites, milling also induces a
chemical reaction between the two components leading to the formation of free
Sn and NiSi2, which is detrimental to the performance of the electrode. To
prevent this reaction, a modification of the surface chemistry of the silicon
has been undertaken. Si nanoparticles coated with a surface layer of either
carbon or oxide were used instead of pure silicon. The influence of the coating
on the composition, (micro)structure and electrochemical properties of
Si-Ni3Sn4 composites is studied and compared with that of pure Si. Si coating
strongly reduces the reaction between Si and Ni3Sn4 during milling. Moreover,
contrary to pure silicon, Si-coated composites have a plate-like mor-phology in
which the surface-modified silicon particles are surrounded by a
nanostructured, Ni3Sn4-based matrix leading to smooth potential profiles during
electrochemical cycling. The chemical homogeneity of the matrix is more uniform
for carbon-coated than for oxygen-coated silicon. As a consequence, different
electrochemical behaviors are obtained depending on the surface chemistry, with
better lithiation properties for the carbon-covered silicon able to deliver
over 500 mAh/g for at least 400 cycles.

key property of living systems. Yet, in spite of being discussed since the
1950s, how robustness emerges from the complexity of genetic architectures and
how it evolves still remains unclear. In particular, whether or not robustness
is independent to various sources of perturbations conditions the range of
adaptive scenarios that can be considered. For instance, selection for
robustness to heritable mutations is likely to be modest and indirect, and its
evolution might result from indirect selection on a pleiotropically-related
character (e.g., homeostasis). Here, I propose to treat various robustness
measurements as quantitative characters, and study theoretically, by
individual-based simulations, their propensity to evolve independently. Based
on a simple evolutionary model of a gene regulatory network, I showed that five
measurements of the robustness of gene expression to genetic or non-genetic
disturbances were substantially correlated. Yet, robustness was mutationally
variable in several dimensions, and robustness components could evolve
differentially under direct selection pressure. Therefore, the fact that the
sensitivity of gene expression to mutations and environmental factors rely on
the same gene networks does not preclude distinct evolutionary histories of
robustness components. This article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by

emerge due to their large spin-orbit coupling in combination with their crystal
symmetries. Here, we provide simple symmetry arguments in a group-theory
approach to unveil the symmetry-allowed spin scattering mechanisms, and
indicate how one can use these concepts towards an external control of the spin

that play a role in these systems. We show that, in monolayer TMDs, electrons
and holes transform fundamentally differently -- leading to distinct
spin-scattering processes. We find that one of the electronic states in the
conduction band is partially protected by time-reversal symmetry, indicating a
longer spin lifetime for that state. In bilayer and bulk TMDs, a hidden
spin-polarization can exist within each layer despite the presence of global
inversion symmetry. We show that this feature enables control of the interlayer
spin-flipping scattering processes via an out-of-plane electric field,
providing a mechanism for electrical control of the spin lifetime.

long-standing questions: (1) How does the magnetic field couple the different
layers of the atmosphere, and how does it transport energy? (2) How does the
magnetic field structure, drive and interact with the plasma in the
chromosphere and upper atmosphere? (3) How does the magnetic field destabilise
the outer solar atmosphere and thus affect the interplanetary environment? (4)
How do magnetic processes accelerate particles to high energies? New
ground-breaking observations are needed to address these science questions. We
suggest a suite of three instruments that far exceed current capabilities in
terms of spatial resolution, light-gathering power, and polarimetric
performance: (a) A large-aperture UV-to-IR telescope of the 1-3 m class aimed
mainly to measure the magnetic field in the chromosphere by combining high
spatial resolution and high sensitivity. (b) An extreme-UV-to-IR coronagraph
that is designed to measure the large-scale magnetic field in the corona with
an aperture of about 40 cm. (c) An extreme-UV imaging polarimeter based on a 30
cm telescope that combines high throughput in the extreme UV with polarimetry
to connect the magnetic measurements of the other two instruments. This mission

bandit algorithms for a platform that personalizes users' experience to
maximize its rewards. For each action directed to a given user, the platform is
given a positive reward, which is a non-decreasing function of the action, if
this action is below the user's threshold. Users are equipped with a patience
budget, and actions that are above the threshold decrease the user's patience.
When all patience is lost, the user abandons the platform. The platform
attempts to learn the thresholds of the users in order to maximize its rewards,
based on two different feedback models describing the information pattern
available to the platform at each action. We define a notion of regret by
determining the best action to be taken when the platform knows that the user's
threshold is in a given interval. We then propose bandit algorithms for the two
feedback models and show that upper and lower bounds on the regret are of the
order of $\tilde{O}(N^{2/3})$ and $\tilde\Omega(N^{2/3})$, respectively, where
$N$ is the total number of users. Finally, we show that the waiting time of any
user before receiving a personalized experience is uniform in $N$.

a subject of great interest in fields ranging from biology to physics and

to address swarm-on-swarm dynamics, and in particular the scattering of two
large, colliding swarms with nonlinear interactions. To build on early
numerical insights, we develop a mean-field approach that can be used to
predict the parameters under which colliding swarms are expected to form a
milling state. Our analytical method relies on the assumption that, upon
collision, two swarms oscillate near a limit-cycle, where each swarm rotates
around the other while maintaining an approximately constant and uniform
density. Using this approach we are able to predict the critical swarm-on-swarm
interaction coupling, below which two colliding swarms merely scatter, for near
head-on collisions as a function of control parameters. We show that the
critical coupling corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation of a stable limit
cycle in the uniform, constant density approximation. Our results are tested

case that this argument redefines the quantity frequency and then draws
conclusions from equations that rely on the standard definition being used. The
problems that this redefinition is designed to address arise from the
widespread unstated adoption of the Radian Convention, which treats the radian
as a dimensionless quantity equal to the number 1, in effect making the radian
a hidden unit. This convention is currently built-in to the SI, when it should
be separable from it. The unhelpful status of angles in the SI can be remedied
with minimal disruption by (1) changing the definition of the radian from a
radian equals 1 m/m to e.g. a right angle equals $\pi/2$ radians, and (2)
acknowledging that the adoption of the Radian Convention is acceptable, when
made explicit. The standard definitions of frequency and the hertz should
remain unchanged.

which hosts three transiting planets that were recently discovered using data
from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The three planets are
1.2, 2.4, and 2.1 times the size of Earth and have orbital periods of 3.4, 5.7,
and 11.4 days. We obtained 29 high-resolution optical spectra with the newly
commissioned Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic
Observations (ESPRESSO) and 58 spectra using the High Accuracy Radial velocity
Planet Searcher (HARPS). From these observations, we find the masses of the
planets to be $1.58 \pm 0.26$, $6.15 \pm 0.37$, and $4.78 \pm 0.43$ M$_\oplus$,
respectively. The combination of radius and mass measurements suggests that the
innermost planet has a rocky composition similar to that of Earth, while the
outer two planets have lower densities. Thus, the inner planet and the outer
planets are on opposite sides of the `radius valley' -- a region in the
radius-period diagram with relatively few members, which has been interpreted
as a consequence of atmospheric photo-evaporation. We place these findings into
the context of other small close-in planets orbiting M dwarf stars, and use
support vector machines to determine the location and slope of the M dwarf
($T_\mathrm{eff} < 4000$ K) radius valley as a function of orbital period. We
compare the location of the M dwarf radius valley to the radius valley observed
for FGK stars, and find that its location is a good match to photo-evaporation
and core-powered mass loss models. Finally, we show that planets below the M
dwarf radius valley have compositions consistent with stripped rocky cores,
whereas most planets above have a lower density consistent with the presence of
a H-He atmosphere.

the magnetorotational instability in the inner disk regions, clump infall in
gravitationally fragmented disks and close encounters with an intruder star,
were studied to determine the disk kinematic characteristics that can help to
distinguish between these burst mechanisms. Methods. Numerical hydrodynamics
simulations in the thin-disk limit were employed to model the bursts in disk
environments that are expected for each burst mechanism. Results. We found that
the circumstellar disks featuring accretion bursts can bear kinematic features
that are distinct for different burst mechanisms, which can be useful when
identifying the burst origin. The disks in the stellar encounter and
clump-infall models are characterized by tens of percent deviations from the
Keplerian rotation, whie the disks in the MRI models are characterized only a
few percent deviation, which is mostly caused by the gravitational instability
that fuels the MRI bursts. Velocity channel maps also show distinct kinks and
wiggles, which are caused by gas disk flows that are peculiar to each
considered burst mechanism. The deviations of velocity channels in the
burst-hosting disks from a symmetric pattern typical of Keplerian disks are
strongest for the clump-infall and collision models, and carry individual
features that may be useful for the identification of the corresponding burst
mechanism. The considered burst mechanisms produce a variety of light curves
with the burst amplitudes varying in the \Delta m=2.5-3.7 limits, except for
the clump-infall model where \Delta m can reach 5.4, although the derived
numbers may be affected by a small sample and boundary conditions. Conclusions.
Burst triggering mechanisms are associated with distinct kinematic features in
the burst-hosting disks that may be used for their identification. Abridged.

measured the radial-velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\mathrm{RV}$) as a proxy for
the close binary fraction in ten OB associations in the Galaxy and the Large
Magellanic Cloud, spanning an age range from 1 to 6 Myrs. We find a positive

an interaction with a remnant accretion disk or with other young stellar

concerned a single physical system, differing from one another in what
properties they require the system to have. However, many physical scenarios of
interest involve multiple interacting systems, e.g. organelles within a
biological cell. Here we show how to extend the conventional TURs to those
scenarios. A common feature of these extended versions of the TURs is that they
bound the global EP, jointly generated by the set of interacting systems, in
terms of a weighted sum of the precisions of the local currents generated
within those systems -- plus an information-theoretic correction term.
Importantly, these extended TURs can bound the global EP even when the global
system does not meet any of the requirements of the conventional TURs. After
deriving these extended TURs we use them to obtain bounds that do not involve
the global EP, but instead relate the local EPs of the individual systems and
the statistical coupling among the currents generated within those systems. We
derive such bounds for both scalar-valued and vector-valued currents within

is based on a truncation, $Q^{\operatorname{tr}}(f,f)$, of the Boltzmann
collision operator, $Q(f,f)$, whose Fourier transform is given by a weighted
convolution. The truncated collision operator models the situation in which two
colliding particles ignore each other if their relative speed exceeds a
threshold, $g_{\text{tr}}$. We demonstrate that the choice of truncation
parameter plays a critical role in the accuracy of the numerical computation of
$Q$. Significantly, if $g_{\text{tr}}$ is too large, then accurate numerical
computation of the weighted convolution integral is not feasible, since the
decay rate and degree of oscillation of the convolution weighting function both
increase as $g_{\text{tr}}$ increases. We derive an upper bound on the
pointwise error between $Q$ and $Q^{\text{tr}}$, assuming that both operators
are computed exactly. This bound provides some additional theoretical
justification for the spectral-Lagrangian method, and can be used to guide the
choice of $g_{\text{tr}}$ in numerical computations. We then demonstrate how to
choose $g_{\text{tr}}$ and the numerical discretization parameters so that the
computation of the truncated collision operator is a good approximation to $Q$

being the well-known analytical Schwarzschild solution in the outer vacuum

being determined mostly analytically but partially numerically, within the
matter region. The solutions for the temporal coefficient of the metric and for
the pressure within this region are given in terms of a non-elementary but
fairly straightforward real integral. We show that in this solution there is a
singularity at the origin, and give the parameters of that singularity in terms
of the geometrical and physical parameters of the shell. This does not
correspond to an infinite concentration of matter, but in fact to zero energy
density at the center. It does, however, imply that the spacetime within the
spherical cavity is not flat, so that there is a non-trivial gravitational
field there, in contrast with Newtonian gravitation. This gravitational field
has the effect of stabilizing the geometrical configuration of the matter,
since any particle of the matter that wanders out into the vacuum regions tends
to be brought back to the bulk of the matter by the gravitational field.

and the magnesium ion storage behavior is discussed when applied in the cathode
for RMBs. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the nanosphere-like
CuCo$_2$S$_4$/Cu$_7$S$_4$ composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity
of 256 mAh/g at 10 mA/g and 123 mAh/g at 300 mA/g at room temperature.
Furthermore, an outstanding long-term cyclic stability with a reversible
capacity of 106 mA/g after 300 cycles and the coulombic efficiency of about 99%
are achieved at 300 mA/g. Such remarkable electrochemical performance is owing
to the nanosphere-like structure, ternary composition and pseudocapacitive
storage behavior of CuCo$_2$S$_4$/Cu$_7$S$_4$. The results of this work
indicate that the CuCo$_2$S$_4$/Cu$_7$S$_4$ nanocomposites synthesized by a

represented using a single consonant or typographic ligature, along with a
default vowel or optional diacritic(s) to denote other vowels. However, texting
in these languages has some unique challenges in spite of the advent of devices
with soft keyboard supporting custom key layouts. The number of characters in
these languages is large enough to require characters to be spread over
multiple views in the layout. Having to switch between views many times to type
a single word hinders the natural thought process. This prevents popular usage
of native keyboard layouts. On the other hand, supporting romanized scripts
(native words transcribed using Latin characters) with language model based
suggestions is also set back by the lack of uniform romanization rules.
  To this end, we propose a disambiguation algorithm and showcase its
usefulness in two novel mutually non-exclusive input methods for languages
natively using the abugida writing system: (a) disambiguation of ambiguous
input for abugida scripts, and (b) disambiguation of word variants in romanized

improvement in typing speed by 19.49%, 25.13%, and 14.89%, in Hindi, Bengali,

locating keys combined with the efficiency of our inference method. Our Word

securely outsource data storage, sharing, and computation on clouds / fogs.
However, data encryption is complicated in terms of the key management and
distribution; existing secure computation techniques are expensive in terms of
computational / communication cost and therefore do not scale to big data
computation. Tensor network decomposition and distributed tensor computation
have been widely used in signal processing and machine learning for
dimensionality reduction and large-scale optimization. However, the potential
of distributed tensor networks for big data privacy preservation have not been
considered before, this motivates the current study. Our primary intuition is
that tensor network representations are mathematically non-unique, unlinkable,
and uninterpretable; tensor network representations naturally support a range
of multilinear operations for compressed and distributed / dispersed
computation. Therefore, we propose randomized algorithms to decompose big data
into randomized tensor network representations and analyze the privacy leakage
for 1D to 3D data tensors. The randomness mainly comes from the complex
structural information commonly found in big data; randomization is based on
controlled perturbation applied to the tensor blocks prior to decomposition.
The distributed tensor representations are dispersed on multiple clouds / fogs
or servers / devices with metadata privacy, this provides both distributed
trust and management to seamlessly secure big data storage, communication,
sharing, and computation. Experiments show that the proposed randomization
techniques are helpful for big data anonymization and efficient for big data

the standard forward-only mode of computation with the ability to execute a
sequence of operations in reverse at any point during computation. As such, in
this thesis we propose a reversible approach to Petri nets by introducing
machinery and associated operational semantics to tackle the challenges of the
main forms of reversibility. Our proposal concerns a variation of cyclic Petri
nets, called Reversing Petri Nets (RPNs) where tokens are persistent and
distinguished from each other by an identity. An immediate extension of the
original model includes allowing multiple tokens of the same base/type to occur
in a model. Specifically, we explore the individual token interpretation where
one distinguishes different tokens residing in the same place by keeping track
of where they come from. We also propose the collective token interpretation,
as the opposite approach to token ambiguity, which considers all tokens of a
certain type to be identical, disregarding their history during execution. Both
of the proposed models of RPNs (with single or multi tokens) implement the
notion of uncontrolled reversibility, meaning that it specifies how to reverse
an execution and allows to do so freely, yet it places no restrictions as to
when and whether to prefer backward execution over forward execution or vice
versa. In this respect, a further aim is to control reversibility by extending
our formal semantics where transitions are associated with conditions whose
satisfaction allows the execution of transitions in the forward/reversed
direction.

neglecting deformations. Our approach considers multiple balances of
microforces augmented by multiple constituent content balance equations within
an extended Larch\'e--Cahn framework. As for the Larch\'e--Cahn framework, we
incorporate into the theory the Larch\'e--Cahn derivatives with respect to the
phase fields and their gradients. We also explain the implications of the
resulting constrained gradients of the phase fields in the form of the gradient
energy coefficients. Moreover, we derive a configurational balance that
includes all the associated configurational fields in agreement with the

the problem of improved visualization of underdrawings and ghost-paintings in

revealed by x-ray or infrared techniques which yield images that are grayscale,
and thus devoid of color and full style information. Past methods for inferring
color in underdrawings have been based on physical x-ray fluorescence spectral
imaging of pigments in ghost-paintings and are thus expensive, time consuming,
and require equipment not available in most conservation studios. Our
algorithmic methods do not need such expensive physical imaging devices. Our
proof-of-concept system, applied to works by Pablo Picasso and Leonardo, reveal
colors and designs that respect the natural segmentation in the ghost-painting.
We believe the computed images provide insight into the artist and associated
oeuvre not available by other means. Our results strongly suggest that future
applications based on larger corpora of paintings for training will display
color schemes and designs that even more closely resemble works of the artist.
For these reasons refinements to our methods should find wide use in art
conservation, connoisseurship, and art analysis.
