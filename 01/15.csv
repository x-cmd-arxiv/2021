to successful bipartisan communication from local leadership. For example,
recent empirical findings have shown that conservatives are less likely to
adhere to COVID-19 health directives. This behavior is in direct contradiction
to past research which indicates that conservatives are more rule abiding,
prefer to avoid loss, and are more prevention-motivated than liberals. We
reconcile this disconnect between recent empirical findings and past research
by using insights gathered from press releases, millions of tweets, and
mobility data capturing local movement in retail, grocery, workplace, parks,
and transit domains during COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. We find that
conservatives adhere to health directives when they express more fear of the
virus. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we analyze both official
and citizen communications and find that press releases from local and federal
government, along with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, lead to an
increase in expressions of fear on Twitter.

we propose a novel method, AVGCN, for trajectory prediction utilizing graph

estimates the importance of neighboring pedestrians, using gaze data collected
as subjects perform a bird's eye view crowd navigation task. Then, we
incorporate the learned attention weights modulated by constraints on the
pedestrian's visual field into a trajectory prediction network that uses a GCN
to aggregate information from neighbors efficiently. AVGCN also considers the
stochastic nature of pedestrian trajectories by taking advantage of variational
trajectory prediction. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
several trajectory prediction benchmarks, and the lowest average prediction

conceal themselves into the surroundings, has recently drawn increasing
research efforts in the field of computer vision. In practice, the success of
deep learning based COD is mainly determined by two key factors, including (i)
A significantly large receptive field, which provides rich context information,
and (ii) An effective fusion strategy, which aggregates the rich multi-level
features for accurate COD. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we
propose a novel deep learning based COD approach, which integrates the large
receptive field and effective feature fusion into a unified framework.
Specifically, we first extract multi-level features from a backbone network.
The resulting features are then fed to the proposed dual-branch mixture
convolution modules, each of which utilizes multiple asymmetric convolutional
layers and two dilated convolutional layers to extract rich context features
from a large receptive field. Finally, we fuse the features using
specially-designed multi-level interactive fusion modules, each of which
employs an attention mechanism along with feature interaction for effective
feature fusion. Our method detects camouflaged objects with an effective fusion
strategy, which aggregates the rich context information from a large receptive
field. All of these designs meet the requirements of COD well, allowing the
accurate detection of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of accurately
detecting camouflaged objects and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

required to be a unitary sampled uniformly randomly from the Haar measure. This
however is known to require an exponential amount of resources. In this work,
we propose an efficient construction of these devices using unitary t-designs,

QPUFs to include efficient constructions and showcase that QPUF_t still retains
the provable security guarantees against a bounded quantum polynomial adversary

unitary t-design construction for arbitrary t, as opposed to previous
applications of t-designs where usually a few (relatively low) values of t are
known to be useful for performing some task. We study the noise-resilience of
QPUF_t against specific types of noise, unitary noise, and show that some
resilience can be achieved particularly when the error rates affecting
individual qubits become smaller as the system size increases. To make the

quantum of magnetic flux, $\Phi_0$. The MF is quantitatively described as the
$2\pi$-kink in the distribution of Josephson phases, and for JJPAs with high
kinetic inductances the characteristic length of such distribution (""the size""
of MF) is drastically reduced. Characterizing such MFs by the Josephson phases
of three consecutive Josephson junctions we analyse the various coherent
macroscopic quantum effects in the MF quantum dynamics. In particular, we
obtain the MF energy band originating from the coherent quantum tunnelling of a
single MF between adjacent cells of JJPAs. The dependencies of the band width
$\Delta$ on the Josephson coupling energy $E_J$, charging energy $E_C$ and the
inductive energy of a cell $E_L$, are studied in detail. In long linear JJPAs
the coherent quantum dynamics of MF demonstrates decaying quantum oscillations
with characteristic frequency $f_{qb}=\Delta/h$. In short annular JJPAs the
coherent quantum dynamics of MF displays complex oscillations controlled by the
Aharonov-Casher phase $\chi \propto V_g$, where $V_g$ is an externally applied

incoherent dynamics of quantum MF is realized in the form of macroscopic Bloch
oscillations leading to a typical ""nose"" current-voltage characteristics of

expressed as global Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications, to teams of

capture their different capabilities, and each task may require robots of
multiple types. The specific robots assigned to each task are immaterial, as
long as they are of the desired type. Given a discrete workspace, our goal is
to design paths, i.e., sequences of discrete states, for the robots so that the
LTL specification is satisfied. To obtain a scalable solution to this complex
temporal logic task allocation problem, we propose a hierarchical approach that
first allocates specific robots to tasks using the information about the tasks
contained in the Nondeterministic Buchi Automaton (NBA) that captures the LTL
specification, and then designs low-level executable plans for the robots that
respect the high-level assignment. Specifically, we first prune and relax the
NBA by removing all negative atomic propositions. This step is motivated by
""lazy collision checking"" methods in robotics and allows to simplify the
planning problem by checking constraint satisfaction only when needed. Then, we
extract sequences of subtasks from the relaxed NBA along with their temporal
orders, and formulate a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to allocate these
subtasks to the robots. Finally, we define generalized multi-robot path
planning problems to obtain low-level executable robot plans that satisfy both
the high-level task allocation and the temporal constraints captured by the
negative atomic propositions in the original NBA. We show that our method is
complete for a subclass of LTL that covers a broad range of tasks and present
numerical simulations demonstrating that it can generate paths with lower cost,

galaxies increases as a function of the absolute $r'$-band magnitude (and
stellar mass), with the largest change occurring between -14 mag $\lesssim
M_{r'}\lesssim$ -19 mag. This same trend was observed for galaxies in the Virgo
cluster and in the field, which suggests that the formation or maintenance of
morphological structures (e.g. bulges, bar) is largely dependent on the stellar
mass of the galaxies, rather than their environment.

of robots that should be properly allocated to tasks in time and space for an
effective and efficient system performance. In particular, we deal with the
dynamic capacitated production planning problem with sequence independent setup
costs where quantities of products to manufacture and location of robots need
to be determined at consecutive periods within a given time horizon and
products can be anticipated or backordered related to the demand period. We
consider a decentralized multi-agent variant of this problem in an open factory
setting with multiple owners of robots as well as different owners of the items
to be produced, both considered self-interested and individually rational.
Existing solution approaches to the classic constrained lot-sizing problem are
centralized exact methods that require sharing of global knowledge of all the
participants' private and sensitive information and are not applicable in the
described multi-agent context. Therefore, we propose a computationally
efficient decentralized approach based on the spillover effect that solves this
NP-hard problem by distributing decisions in an intrinsically decentralized
multi-agent system environment while protecting private and sensitive
information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized
algorithm for the solution of the studied problem in intrinsically
decentralized environments where production resources and/or products are owned
by multiple stakeholders with possibly conflicting objectives. To show its
efficiency, the performance of the Spillover Algorithm is benchmarked against
state-of-the-art commercial solver CPLEX 12.8.

Amesim, or Simscape, rely on Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs), i.e.,
constraints of the form f(\dot{x},x,u)=0. This drastically facilitates modeling
from first principles of the physics, as well as model reuse. In recent works
[RR-9334], we presented the mathematical theory needed to establish the
development of compilers and tools for DAE-based physical modeling languages on
solid mathematical grounds.At the core of this analysis sits the so-called
*structural analysis*, whose purpose, at compile time, is to either identify
under- and over-specified subsystems (if any), or to rewrite the model in a
form amenable of existing DAE solvers, including the handling of mode change
events. The notion of ""structure"" collects, for each mode and mode change
event, the variables and equations involved, as well as the *latent equations*
(additional equations redundant with the system), needed to prepare the code
submitted to the solver. The notion of DAE *index* (the minimal number of times
any equation has to be possibly differentiated) is part of this structural
analysis. This report complements [RR-9334] by collecting all the needed
background on structural analysis. The body of knowledge on structural analysis
is large and scattered, which also motivated us to collect it in a single
report.We first explain the primary meaning of structural analysis of systems
of equations, namely the study of their regularity or singularity in some
generic sense. We then briefly review the body of graph theory used in this
context. We develop some extensions, for which we are not aware of any
reference, namely the structural analysis of systems of equations with
existential quantifiers. For the structural analysis of DAE systems, we focus
on John Pryce's Sigma-method, that we both summarize and extend to non-square
systems. The uses of these tools and methods in [RR9334] are highlighted in
this report.

that the separate universe approach can be generically used, as long as a

applicable also to models with shear on large scales and also to modified

finite-size analysis of the quantum model of a p,q-spin-interaction system, a
generalized p-spin interaction system, which can be implemented in
fully-connected spin-1/2 ensembles. We find the following conditions for the
observation of the BTC phase: First, the BTC appears when the discrete symmetry
held by the Hamiltonian, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the considered models, is explicitly
broken by the Lindblad jump operators. Second, the system must be coupled
uniformly to the same bath in order to preserve the total angular momentum
during the time evolution. If these conditions are not satisfied, any
oscillatory behavior appears only as a transient in the dynamics and a
time-independent stationary state is eventually reached. Our results suggest
that these two elements may be general requirements for the observation of a
stable BTC phase relating symmetries and conserved quantities in arbitrary spin

solving linear programs with two-sided constraints. In the special case of the
minimum cost flow problem on $n$-vertex $m$-edge graphs with integer
polynomially-bounded costs and capacities we obtain a randomized method which
solves the problem in $\tilde{O}(m+n^{1.5})$ time. This improves upon the
previous best runtime of $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ (Lee-Sidford 2014) and, in the
special case of unit-capacity maximum flow, improves upon the previous best
runtimes of $m^{4/3+o(1)}$ (Liu-Sidford 2020, Kathuria 2020) and
$\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ (Lee-Sidford 2014) for sufficiently dense graphs.
  For $\ell_1$-regression in a matrix with $n$-columns and $m$-rows we obtain a
randomized method which computes an $\epsilon$-approximate solution in
$\tilde{O}(mn+n^{2.5})$ time. This yields a randomized method which computes an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy of a discounted Markov Decision Process with $S$
states and $A$ actions per state in time $\tilde{O}(S^2A+S^{2.5})$. These
methods improve upon the previous best runtimes of methods which depend
polylogarithmically on problem parameters, which were $\tilde{O}(mn^{1.5})$
(Lee-Sidford 2015) and $\tilde{O}(S^{2.5}A)$ (Lee-Sidford 2014,
Sidford-Wang-Wu-Ye 2018).
  To obtain this result we introduce two new algorithmic tools of independent
interest. First, we design a new general interior point method for solving
linear programs with two sided constraints which combines techniques from
(Lee-Song-Zhang 2019, Brand et al. 2020) to obtain a robust stochastic method
with iteration count nearly the square root of the smaller dimension. Second,
to implement this method we provide dynamic data structures for efficiently
maintaining approximations to variants of Lewis-weights, a fundamental
importance measure for matrices which generalize leverage scores and effective
resistances.

needs. However, even after solving the critical research challenges,
engineering and materials science will still impose significant constraints on

must transition to low-carbon sources by 2050 to prevent the worst effects of
climate change. We review three factors affecting fusion's future trajectory:
(1) the significant drop in the price of renewable energy, (2) the
intermittency of renewable sources and implications for future energy grids,
and (3) the recent proposition of intermediate-level nuclear waste as a product
of fusion. Within the scenario assumed by our premises, we find that while
there remains a clear motivation to develop fusion power plants, this
motivation is likely weakened by the time they become available. We also
conclude that most current fusion reactor designs do not take these factors
into account and, to increase market penetration, fusion research should
consider relaxed nuclear waste design criteria, raw material availability
constraints and load-following designs with pulsed operation.

the quadratic $k$-means excess risk related to the quantization of an i.i.d
sample in a separable Hilbert space. We improve the bound of order $\mathcal{O}
\bigl( k / \sqrt{n} \bigr)$ of Biau, Devroye and Lugosi, recovering the rate
$\sqrt{k/n}$ that has already been proved by Fefferman, Mitter, and Narayanan
and by Klochkov, Kroshnin and Zhivotovskiy but with worse log factors and
constants. More precisely, we bound the mean excess risk of an empirical
minimizer by the explicit upper bound $16 B^2 \log(n/k) \sqrt{k \log(k) / n}$,
in the bounded case when $\mathbb{P}( \lVert X \rVert \leq B) = 1$. This is
essentially optimal up to logarithmic factors since a lower bound of order
$\mathcal{O} \bigl( \sqrt{k^{1 - 4/d}/n} \bigr)$ is known in dimension $d$. Our
technique of proof is based on the linearization of the $k$-means criterion
through a kernel trick and on PAC-Bayesian inequalities. To get a $1 /

concept of $\delta$-net with the perturbation of the parameter by an infinite
dimensional Gaussian process.
  In the meantime, we embed the usual $k$-means criterion into a broader family
built upon the Kullback divergence and its underlying properties. This results
in a new algorithm that we named information $k$-means, well suited to the
clustering of bags of words. Based on considerations from information theory,
we also introduce a new bounded $k$-means criterion that uses a scale parameter
but satisfies a generalization bound that does not require any boundedness or
even integrability conditions on the sample. We describe the counterpart of
Lloyd's algorithm and prove generalization bounds for these new $k$-means
criteria.

the stepwise addition or removal of individual combs along the cylinder's axis.
Transitions occur in a fully reversible and, consequently, deterministic way.
The phenomenon puts forward a novel paradigm for Kerr frequency comb formation

a network, recently there has been significant interest in structural
embeddings that are based on node equivalences, a notion rooted in sociology:
equivalences or positions are collections of nodes that have similar
roles--i.e., similar functions, ties or interactions with nodes in other
positions--irrespective of their distance or reachability in the network.
Unlike the proximity-based methods that are rigorously evaluated in the
literature, the evaluation of structural embeddings is less mature. It relies
on small synthetic or real networks with labels that are not perfectly defined,
and its connection to sociological equivalences has hitherto been vague and
tenuous. With new node embedding methods being developed at a breakneck pace,
proper evaluation and systematic characterization of existing approaches will
be essential to progress. To fill in this gap, we set out to understand what
types of equivalences structural embeddings capture. We are the first to
contribute rigorous intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methodology for
structural embeddings, along with carefully-designed, diverse datasets of
varying sizes. We observe a number of different evaluation variables that can
lead to different results (e.g., choice of similarity measure, classifier,
label definitions). We find that degree distributions within nodes' local
neighborhoods can lead to simple yet effective baselines in their own right and
guide the future development of structural embedding. We hope that our findings
can influence the design of further node embedding methods and also pave the
way for more comprehensive and fair evaluation of structural embedding methods.

used the Multi-Channel Subtractive Optimally Localised Averaging inversion
method with regularisation of the cross-talk. We combined the difference and
the mean travel-time averaging geometries. We applied this methodology to
travel-time maps averaged over more than 10000 individual supergranular cells.
These cells were detected automatically in travel-time maps computed for 64
quiet days around the disc centre. The ensemble averaging method allows us to
significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to obtain a clear picture
of the flows in the average supergranule. We found near-surface divergent
horizontal flows which quickly and monotonously weakened with depth; they
became particularly weak at the depth of about 7 Mm, where they even apparently
switched sign. To learn about the vertical component, we integrated the
continuity equation from the surface. The derived estimates of the vertical
flow depicted a sub-surface increase from about 5 m/s at the surface to about
35 m/s at the depth of about 3 Mm followed by a monotonous decrease to greater
depths. The vertical flow remained positive (an upflow) and became
indistinguishable from the background at the depth of about 15 Mm. We further
detected a systematic flow in the longitudinal direction. The course of this
systematic flow with depth agrees well with the model of the solar rotation in
the sub-surface layers.

Finally, we prioritize classes for tuning, based on the estimated ""Tuning
Gains"" and spend the tuning budget only on the highly-ranked classes. To
evaluate our approach, we exhaustively analyze 1,200 hyper-parameter
configurations of a well-known search-based test generation tool (EvoSuite) for
250 classes of 19 projects from benchmarks such as SF110 and SBST2018 tool
competition. We used a tuning approach called Meta-GA and compared the tuning
results with and without the proposed class prioritization. The results show
that for a low tuning budget, prioritizing classes outperforms the alternatives
in terms of extra covered branches (10 times more than a traditional global
tuning). In addition, we report the impact of different features of our
approach such as search space size, tuning budgets, tuning algorithms, and the
number of classes to tune, on the final results.

a unique crest and trough per period or a monotone structure near troughs as
classically imposed in the water wave problem, we formulate a reflection
criterion, which allows to affirm the symmetry of periodic traveling waves. The
reflection criterion weakens the assumption of monotonicity between trough and
crest and enables to treat a priori solutions with multiple crests of different
sizes per period. Moreover, our result not only applies to smooth solutions,
but also to traveling waves with a non-smooth structure such as peaks or cusps
at a crest. The proof relies on a so-called touching lemma, which is related to
a strong maximum principle for elliptic operators, and a weak form of the

details are abstracted away. In the case of $\lambda$-calculus translated to
proof-nets, these inessential details are captured by a notion of equivalence
on $\lambda$-terms known as $\simeq_\sigma$-equivalence, in both the
intuitionistic (due to Regnier) and classical (due to Laurent) cases. The
purpose of this paper is to uncover a strong bisimulation behind
$\simeq_\sigma$-equivalence, as formulated by Laurent for Parigot's
$\lambda\mu$-calculus. This is achieved by introducing a relation $\simeq$,
defined over a revised presentation of $\lambda\mu$-calculus we dub $\Lambda
M$.
  More precisely, we first identify the reasons behind Laurent's
$\simeq_\sigma$-equivalence on $\lambda\mu$-terms failing to be a strong
bisimulation. Inspired by Laurent's \emph{Polarized Proof-Nets}, this leads us
to distinguish multiplicative and exponential reduction steps on terms. Second,
we enrich the syntax of $\lambda\mu$ to allow us to track the exponential
operations. These technical ingredients pave the way towards a strong
bisimulation for the classical case. We introduce a calculus $\Lambda M$ and a
relation $\simeq$ that we show to be a strong bisimulation with respect to
reduction in $\Lambda M$, ie. two $\simeq$-equivalent terms have the exact same
reduction semantics, a result which fails for Regnier's
$\simeq_\sigma$-equivalence in $\lambda$-calculus as well as for Laurent's
$\simeq_\sigma$-equivalence in $\lambda\mu$. Although $\simeq$ is formulated
over an enriched syntax and hence is not strictly included in Laurent's
$\simeq_\sigma$, we show how it can be seen as a restriction of it.

high-energy neutrino bursts may travel at different speeds with a typical delay
measured at the order of hours or days. We discuss two potential
interpretations for the GRB delay: dispersion of light in interstellar medium
and violation of Lorentz invariance due to quantum gravitational fluctuations.
Among a few other media, we consider dispersion of light in an axion plasma,
obtaining the axion plasma frequency and the dispersion relation from quantum
field theory for the first time. We find that the density of axions inferred
from observations is far too low to produce the observed GRB delay. However, a
more precise estimation of the spatial distribution of axions is required for a
conclusive result. Other known media are also unable to account for the GRB
delay, although there remains uncertainties in the observations of the delays.
The interpretation in terms of Lorentz invariance violation and modified
dispersion relation suffers from its own problems: since the modification of
the dispersion relation should not be dependent on particle type, delays
between photons and neutrinos are hard to explain. Thus neither interpretation
is sufficient to explain the observations. We conclude that a crucial
difference between the two interpretations is the frequency dependence of the
propagation speed of radiation: in dispersive plasma the group speed increases
with higher frequency, while Lorentz invariance violation implies lower speed
at higher frequency. Future experiments shall resolve which one of the two
frequency dependencies of GRB is actually the case.

region around 6$\%$ Co content, while both $T_\mathrm{c}$ and the
superconducting volume fraction rapidly drop in the neighbouring doping regime.
Ultimately, no microscopic coexistence between the superconducting and magnetic
phases can be assessed within our resolution limit, in sharp contrast with
other iron-pnictide families, e.g., electron- and hole-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$.

hybridization) is a driving force for many unusual phenomena. To provide
insight into it, systematic studies of CeCoIn$_5$ heavy fermion superconductor
have been performed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in a
large angular range at temperature of $T=6$ K. The used photon energy of 122 eV
corresponds to Ce $4d$-$4f$ resonance. Calculations carried out with
relativistic multiple scattering Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method and one-step
model of photoemission yielded realistic simulation of the ARPES spectra
indicating that Ce-In surface termination prevails. Surface states, which have
been identified in the calculations, contribute significantly to the spectra.
Effects of the hybridization strongly depend on wave vector. They include a
dispersion of heavy electrons and bands gaining $f$-electron character when
approaching Fermi energy. We have also observed a considerable variation of
$f$-electron spectral weight at $E_F$, which is normally determined by both
matrix element effects and wave vector dependent $c$-$f$ hybridization. Fermi
surface scans covering a few Brillouin zones revealed large matrix element
effects. A symmetrization of experimental Fermi surface, which reduces matrix
element contribution, yielded a specific variation of $4f$-electron enhanced
spectral intensity at $E_F$ around $\bar{\Gamma}$ and $\bar{M}$ points.
Tight-binding approximation calculations for Ce-In plane provided the same
universal distribution of $4f$-electron density for a range of values of the
parameters used in the model.

physics and material science. Along these lines, several kagome magnets have
appeared as the most promising platforms. Here, we explore magnetic
correlations in the transition-metal-based kagome magnet TbMn$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$
using muon spin rotation, combined with local field analysis and neutron
diffraction. Our results show that the system exhibits an out-of-plane
ferrimagnetic structure $P6/mm'm'$ (comprised by Tb and Mn moments) with slow
magnetic fluctuations below $T_{\rm C2}$~=~320~K. These fluctuations exhibit a
slowing down below $T_{\rm C1}^{*}$~${\simeq}$~120~K, and we see the formation
of static patches with ideal out-of-plane order below $T_{\rm
C1}$~${\simeq}$~20~K which grow in a volume with decreasing temperature. The
appearance of the static patches has a similar onset to the interesting
phenomenon such as spin-polarized Dirac dispersion with a large Chern gap and
topological edge states. We further show that the temperature evolution of the
anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is strongly influenced by the low temperature
magnetic crossover. Our presented experimental results show that the onset of
the topological electronic properties tied to the Dirac band is promoted only
by true static out-of-plane ferrimagnetic order in TbMn$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ and is
washed out by the slow magnetic fluctuations above $T_{\rm

static out-of-plane topological ferrimagnetic ground state in the whole volume
of the sample. Therefore the exciting perspective arises of a magnetic system

distance of a few au from the central protostar. Accretion through such a
magnetically layered disk can be intrinsically unstable and has been associated
with episodic outbursts in young stellar objects. We present the first
investigation into the effects of low metallicity environment on the structure
of the dead zone as well as the resulting outbursting behavior of the
protoplanetary disk. We conducted global numerical hydrodynamic simulations of
protoplanetary disk formation and evolution in the thin-disk limit. The
consequences of metallicity were considered via its effects on the gas and dust
opacity of the disk, the thickness of the magnetically active surface layer,
and the temperature of the prestellar cloud core. We show that the metal poor
disks accumulate much more mass in the innermost regions, as compared to the
solar metallicity counterparts. The duration of the outbursting phase also
varies with metallicity - the low metallicity disks showed more powerful
luminosity eruptions with a shorter burst phase, which was confined mostly to
the early, embedded stages of the disk evolution. The lowest metallicity disks
with the higher cloud core temperature showed the most significant differences.
The occurrence of outbursts was relatively rare in the disks around low mass
stars and this was especially true at lowest metallicities. We conclude that
the metal content of the disk environment can have profound effects on both the
disk structure and evolution in terms of episodic accretion.

The tidally locked ultra-hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b has a day/night temperature

ionisation to the dayside. Both have distinct observational signatures. We
analyse plasma and magnetic processes in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot
Jupiter HAT-P-7b to investigate the formation of a thermal ionosphere and the
possibility of magnetically coupling the atmospheric gas as the base for an
extended exosphere. We show which ions and atoms may be used as spectral
tracers, and if and where conditions for lightning may occur within the clouds
of HAT-P-7b, evaluate characteristic plasma and magnetic coupling parameters,
and a LTE radiative transfer is solved for the ionised gas phase. The
ionisation throughout HAT-P-7b's atmosphere varies drastically between day- and
nightside. The dayside has high levels of thermal ionisation and long-range
electromagnetic interactions dominate over kinetic electron-neutral
interactions, suggesting a day-night difference in magnetic coupling. K+, Na+,
Li+, Ca+, and Al+ are more abundant than their atomic counterparts on the
dayside. The minimum magnetic flux density for electrons for magnetic coupling
is B<0.5G for all regions of HAT-P-7b's atmosphere. HAT-P-7b's dayside has an
asymmetric ionosphere that extends deep into the atmosphere, the nightside has
no thermally driven ionosphere. A corresponding asymmetry is imprinted in the
ion/neutral composition at the terminators. The ionosphere on HAT-P-7b may be
directly traced by the Ca+ H&K lines if the local temperature is > 5000K. The
whole atmosphere may couple to a global, large-scale magnetic field, and
lightning may occur on the nightside.

in NextG radio access networks, where the base station (gNodeB) allocates
resource blocks (RBs) to the requests of user equipments and aims to maximize
the total reward of accepted requests over time. Based on adversarial machine
learning, a novel over-the-air attack is introduced to manipulate the RL
algorithm and disrupt NextG network slicing. The adversary observes the
spectrum and builds its own RL based surrogate model that selects which RBs to
jam subject to an energy budget with the objective of maximizing the number of
failed requests due to jammed RBs. By jamming the RBs, the adversary reduces
the RL algorithm's reward. As this reward is used as the input to update the RL
algorithm, the performance does not recover even after the adversary stops
jamming. This attack is evaluated in terms of both the recovery time and the
(maximum and total) reward loss, and it is shown to be much more effective than
benchmark (random and myopic) jamming attacks. Different reactive and proactive
defense schemes (protecting the RL algorithm's updates or misleading the
adversary's learning process) are introduced to show that it is viable to
defend NextG network slicing against this attack.

vulnerable to message injection attacks. These injections change the overall
timing characteristics of messages on the bus, and thus, to detect these

proposed. However, time-based IDSs are usually trained and tested on
low-fidelity datasets with unrealistic, labeled attacks. This makes difficult
the task of evaluating, comparing, and validating IDSs. Here we detail and
benchmark four time-based IDSs against the newly published ROAD dataset, the
first open CAN IDS dataset with real (non-simulated) stealthy attacks with
physically verified effects. We found that methods that perform hypothesis
testing by explicitly estimating message timing distributions have lower

outperform ""distribution-based"" methods by at least 55% in area under the

of O(10s) with a pathway to O(1s) live migrations. It opens a myriad of

metals fabricated by additive manufacturing technologies are significantly
determined by the underlying process-specific microstructure evolution. In this
work a novel physics-based and data-supported phenomenological microstructure
model for Ti-6Al-4V is proposed that is suitable for the part-scale simulation
of selective laser melting processes. The model predicts spatially homogenized
phase fractions of the most relevant microstructural species, namely the stable
$\beta$-phase, the stable $\alpha_{\text{s}}$-phase as well as the metastable
Martensite $\alpha_{\text{m}}$-phase, in a physically consistent manner. In
particular, the modeled microstructure evolution, in form of diffusion-based
and non-diffusional transformations, is a pure consequence of energy and
mobility competitions among the different species, without the need for
heuristic transformation criteria as often applied in existing models. The
mathematically consistent formulation of the evolution equations in rate form
renders the model suitable for the practically relevant scenario of
temperature- or time-dependent diffusion coefficients, arbitrary temperature
profiles, and multiple coexisting phases. Due to its physically motivated
foundation, the proposed model requires only a minimal number of free
parameters, which are determined in an inverse identification process
considering a broad experimental data basis in form of time-temperature
transformation diagrams. Subsequently, the predictive ability of the model is
demonstrated by means of continuous cooling transformation diagrams, showing
that experimentally observed characteristics such as critical cooling rates
emerge naturally from the proposed microstructure model, instead of being
enforced as heuristic transformation criteria.

learning image restoration and enhancement models for real-world applications.
Current strategies aim to synthesize realistic training data by modeling noise
and degradations that appear in real-world settings. We propose DeFlow, a
method for learning stochastic image degradations from unpaired data. Our
approach is based on a novel unpaired learning formulation for conditional
normalizing flows. We model the degradation process in the latent space of a
shared flow encoder-decoder network. This allows us to learn the conditional
distribution of a noisy image given the clean input by solely minimizing the
negative log-likelihood of the marginal distributions. We validate our DeFlow
formulation on the task of joint image restoration and super-resolution. The
models trained with the synthetic data generated by DeFlow outperform previous
learnable approaches on three recent datasets. Code and trained models are

  particular in Section 12",,,,"math.DS math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work addresses problems on simultaneous Diophantine approximation on
fractals, motivated by a long standing problem of Mahler regarding Cantor's
middle $1/3$ set. We obtain the first instances where a complete analogue of
Khintchine's Theorem holds for fractal measures. Our results apply to fractals
which are self-similar by a system of rational similarities of $\mathbb{R}^d$
(for any $d\geq 1$) and have sufficiently small Hausdorff co-dimension. A
concrete example of such measures in the context of Mahler's problem is the
Hausdorff measure on the ""middle $1/5$ Cantor set""; i.e. the set of numbers
whose base $5$ expansions miss a single digit.
  The key new ingredient is an effective equidistribution theorem for certain
fractal measures on the homogeneous space $\mathcal{L}_{d+1}$ of unimodular
lattices; a result of independent interest. The latter is established via a new
technique involving the construction of $S$-arithmetic operators possessing a
spectral gap and encoding the arithmetic structure of the maps generating the
fractal. As a consequence of our methods, we show that spherical averages of
certain random walks naturally associated to the fractal measures effectively
equidistribute on $\mathcal{L}_{d+1}$.

inconsistency manifests as the (artificial) stochastic production of
electromagnetic energy, which ultimately heats the plasma particles. The
MC-induced numerical heating can significantly impact the evolution of the

whether the sign clusters of the free field on $\tilde{\mathcal G}$ are bounded

and establishes the continuity of this phase transition in a wide range of
cases, including all vertex-transitive graphs. When the sign clusters on
$\tilde{\mathcal G}$ do not percolate, we further determine by means of
isomorphism theory the exact law of the capacity of compact clusters at any

refinement of Lupu's recent isomorphism theorem relating the free field and
random interlacements, proved along the way, and which holds under the sole

this goal. However, state-of-the-art APT instruments generate noisy and sparse
datasets that provide information about elemental type, but obscure atomic

application of a materials fingerprinting process, a machine learning algorithm
coupled with topological data analysis, provides an avenue by which
here-to-fore unprecedented structural information can be extracted from an APT
dataset. As a proof of concept, the material fingerprint is applied to
high-entropy alloy APT datasets containing body-centered cubic (BCC) and
face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structures. A local atomic configuration
centered on an arbitrary atom is assigned a topological descriptor, with which
it can be characterized as a BCC or FCC lattice with near perfect accuracy,

astrometric positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and photometry from EDR3 to
select different populations and components and to calculate the distances and

the current disc, the spatial and kinematical distributions of early accreted
versus in-situ stars, the structures in the outer parts of the disc, and the
orbits of open clusters Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1. We find that: i) the dynamics
of the Galactic disc are very complex with vertical asymmetries, and new
correlations, including a bimodality with disc stars with large angular
momentum moving vertically upwards from below the plane, and disc stars with
slightly lower angular momentum moving preferentially downwards; ii) we resolve
the kinematic substructure (diagonal ridges) in the outer parts of the disc for
the first time; iii) the red sequence that has been associated with the
proto-Galactic disc that was present at the time of the merger with
Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is currently radially concentrated up to around 14 kpc,
while the blue sequence that has been associated with debris of the satellite
extends beyond that; iv) there are density structures in the outer disc, both
above and below the plane, most probably related to Monoceros, the Anticentre
Stream, and TriAnd, for which the Gaia data allow an exhaustive selection of
candidate member stars and dynamical study; and v) the open clusters
Berkeley~29 and Saurer~1, despite being located at large distances from the
Galactic centre, are on nearly circular disc-like orbits. We demonstrate how,
once again, the Gaia are crucial for our understanding of the different pieces
of our Galaxy and their connection to its global structure and history.

First, I consider the effects of a
coupling between the $O(4)$ chiral field, $\vec{\phi}$, and the $\omega_\mu$
meson, $\sim + \, \omega_\mu^2 \, \vec{\phi}^{\, 2}$; for any net baryon
density, a condensate for $\omega_0$ is unavoidably generated. I assume that
with increasing density, a decrease of the chiral condensate and the effective
$\omega_0$ mass gives a stiff equation of state (EoS). In order to match that
onto a soft EoS for quarkyonic matter, I consider an $O(N)$ field at large $N$,
where at nonzero temperature quantum fluctuations disorder any putative pion
""condensate"" into a quantum pion liquid (Q$\pi$L) (arXiv:2005.10259). In this
paper I show that the Q$\pi$L persists at zero temperature. If valid
qualitatively at $N=4$, the $\omega_0$ mass goes up sharply and suppresses the
$\omega_0$ condensate. This could generate a spike in the speed of sound at
high density, which is of relevance to neutron stars. Second, I propose a toy
model of a $Z(3)$ gauge theory with three flavors of fermions, where $Z(3)$
vortices confine fermions into baryons. In $1+1$ dimensions this model can be
studied numerically with present techniques, using either classical or quantum
computers.

regions of both size-mass and $\Sigma_1$-mass space. The nine star-forming
groups lie along the integrated star-forming $\Sigma_1$-mass relation. However,
these star-forming groups form steep parallel relations in the size-mass plane,
with slopes similar to the quiescent size-mass relation. These steep slopes can
be explained as a transformation of the star-forming $\Sigma_1$-mass relation
and its scatter. We identify three types of transitional galaxies. Green valley
and post-starburst galaxies are similarly compact at $z>1.5$; however, their
distinct color gradients indicate that the two populations represent different
pathways to quenching. Post-starburst galaxies have flat color gradients and
compact structures, consistent with a fast quenching pathway which requires
structural change and operates primarily at high redshift. Green valley
galaxies have negative color gradients, and are both larger and more numerous
towards lower redshift. These galaxies are consistent with slow quenching
without significant structural change. We find that dusty star-forming galaxies
at $z\gtrsim2$ are very compact, and may represent the ""burst"" before
post-starburst galaxies; at $z\lesssim2$, dusty star-forming galaxies are
extended and have shallow color gradients consistent with slow quenching. Our
results suggest that star-forming galaxies grow gradually up the \sig-mass

quiescence, or (b) a compaction-type event rapidly increases their $\Sigma_1$.

the Universe. Discs that are misaligned to the black hole spin can become
warped over time by Lense-Thirring precession. Recent work has shown that
strongly warped discs can become unstable, causing the disc to break into
discrete rings producing a more dynamic and variable accretion flow. In a
companion paper, we present numerical simulations of this instability and the
resulting dynamics. In this paper, we discuss the implications of this dynamics
for accreting black hole systems, with particular focus on the variability of
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We discuss the timescales on which variability
might manifest, and the impact of the observer orientation with respect to the
black hole spin axis. When the disc warp is unstable near the inner edge of the
disc, we find quasi periodic behaviour of the inner disc which may explain the
recent quasi periodic eruptions observed in, for example, the Seyfert 2 galaxy
GSN 069 and in the galactic nucleus of RX J1301.9+2747. These eruptions are
thought to be similar to the `heartbeat' modes observed in some X-ray binaries
(e.g. GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624). When the instability manifests at
larger radii in the disc, we find that the central accretion rate can vary on
timescales that may be commensurate with, e.g., changing-look AGN. We therefore
suggest that some of the variability properties of accreting black hole systems
may be explained by the disc being significantly warped, leading to disc
tearing.

control problems with sliding modes. The proposed procedure has several
features which distinguishes it from the other procedures for the problem.
First of all a sliding mode is coped with differential-algebraic equations
(DAEs) and that guarantees accurate tracking of the sliding motion surface. The
second important feature is the calculation of cost and constraints functions
gradients with the help of adjoint equations. The adjoint equations presented
in the paper take into account sliding motion and exhibit jump conditions at
transition instants. The procedure uses the discretization of system equations
by Radau IIA Runge--Kutta scheme and the evaluation of optimization functions
gradients with the help of the adjoint equations stated for discretized system
equations. In the first part of the paper we demonstrate the correspondence
between the discrete adjoint equations and the discretized version of the
continuous adjoint equations in the case of system equations described by ODEs.
We show that the discrete adjoint state trajectories converge to their
continuous counterparts in the case of ODEs.

parent Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) Hamiltonian to render the Majorana and the
spin-$1/2$ Hilbert spaces perfectly equivalent to each other. As a consequence,
we demonstrate that this decoupling of the Kitaev interaction in terms of the
SO(3) Majorana fermions reproduces exactly the spectrum of the KSL model alone.
Then, by considering the effect of a local Kondo coupling $J_K$ in the model
and decoupling it in terms of an order parameter that physically must have a
finite staggering phase, we obtain that the system undergoes a quantum phase
transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid to a nematic triplet
superconducting (SC) phase as $J_K$ is increased. Depending on the model
parameters, this SC phase can exhibit either Dirac points, Bogoliubov-Fermi
lines, or Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces as nodal bulk manifolds. The surface states
in this latter case are also characterized by topologically protected
antichiral edge modes. The SC phase breaks time-reversal symmetry and exhibits
a coexistence of a dominant odd-frequency pairing with a small even-frequency

small mass corrections to the chiral kinetic theory. In the massless case, only
four Wigner functions are needed to describe positive and negative energy
fermions of left and right chirality, corresponding to the vectorial components
of a fermionic two-point Green's function. As soon as mass correction are
introduced, tensorial components are also needed, while the scalar components
strictly vanish in the OSEFT. The tensorial components are conveniently
parametrized in the so-called spin coherence function, which describe quantum
coherent mixtures of left-right and right-left chiral fermions, of either
positive or negative energy. We show that, up to second order in the energy
expansion, vectorial and tensorial components are decoupled, and obey the same

We study the mass modifications of the reparametrization invariance of the

associated symmetry transformations. We study how the macroscopic properties of

for learning an effective, lower-dimensional, coarse-grained dynamical model

its behavior under different initial conditions. We target fine-grained models
as they arise in physical applications (e.g. molecular dynamics, agent-based
models), the dynamics of which are strongly non-stationary but their transition
to equilibrium is governed by unknown slow processes which are largely
inaccessible by brute-force simulations. Approaches based on domain knowledge
heavily rely on physical insight in identifying temporally slow features and
fail to enforce the long-term stability of the learned dynamics. On the other
hand, purely statistical frameworks lack interpretability and rely on large
amounts of expensive simulation data (long and multiple trajectories) as they
cannot infuse domain knowledge. The generative framework proposed achieves the
aforementioned desiderata by employing a flexible prior on the complex plane
for the latent, slow processes, and an intermediate layer of physics-motivated
latent variables that reduces reliance on data and imbues inductive bias. In
contrast to existing schemes, it does not require the a priori definition of
projection operators from the fine-grained description and addresses
simultaneously the tasks of dimensionality reduction and model estimation. We
demonstrate its efficacy and accuracy in multiscale physical systems of
particle dynamics where probabilistic, long-term predictions of phenomena not
contained in the training data are produced.

earlier at higher frequencies. Although the observed chromatic activity window
disfavors models of periodicity in FRB 180916 driven by the occultation of a
neutron star by the optically-thick wind from a stellar companion, the
connection to theories where periodicity arises from the motion of a bursting
magnetar remains unclear. In this paper, we show how altitude-dependent radio
emission from magnetar curvature radiation, with bursts emitted from regions
which are asymmetric with respect to the magnetic dipole axis, can lead to
burst activity windows and polarization consistent with the recent
observations. In particular, the fact that bursts arrive systematically earlier
at higher frequencies disfavors theories where the FRB periodicity arises from
forced precession of a magnetar by a companion or fallback disk, but is
consistent with theories where periodicity originates from a slowly-rotating or
freely-precessing magnetar. Several observational tests are proposed to
verify/differentiate between the remaining theories, and pin-down which theory

J0432+1827, and J1100-7619) using ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO (J=2--1) and
$^{13}$CO (J=2--1) emission. These are the first dynamical stellar mass
measurements for J0432+1827 and J1100-7619 and the most precise measurement for

treatment of magnetic activity, agree with the dynamical measurement of
J0432+1827 but underpredict the mass by $\sim$60\% for FP Tau and $\sim$80\%
for J1100-7619. Possible explanations for the underpredictions include
inaccurate assumptions of stellar effective temperature, undetected binarity
for J1100-7619, and that fiducial stellar evolutionary models are not complex
enough to represent these stars. In the former case, the stellar effective
temperatures would need to be increased by $\sim$40K to $\sim$340K to reconcile
the fiducial model predictions with the dynamically-measured masses. In the
latter case, we show that the dynamical masses can be reproduced using results
from stellar evolutionary models with starspots, which incorporate fractional
starspot coverage to represent the manifestation of magnetic activity. Folding
in low-mass M-stars from the literature and assuming that the stellar effective
temperatures are imprecise but accurate, we find tentative evidence of a
relationship between fractional starspot coverage and observed effective

neural network verification systems. Many efficient bounding algorithms have
been presented recently, but they are often too loose to verify more
challenging properties. This is due to the weakness of the employed relaxation,
which is usually a linear program of size linear in the number of neurons.
While a tighter linear relaxation for piecewise-linear activations exists, it
comes at the cost of exponentially many constraints and currently lacks an
efficient customized solver. We alleviate this deficiency by presenting two
novel dual algorithms: one operates a subgradient method on a small active set
of dual variables, the other exploits the sparsity of Frank-Wolfe type
optimizers to incur only a linear memory cost. Both methods recover the
strengths of the new relaxation: tightness and a linear separation oracle. At
the same time, they share the benefits of previous dual approaches for weaker
relaxations: massive parallelism, GPU implementation, low cost per iteration
and valid bounds at any time. As a consequence, we can obtain better bounds
than off-the-shelf solvers in only a fraction of their running time, attaining
significant formal verification speed-ups.

suitability for solving instance segmentation tasks. It has been dismissed as
theoretically flawed due to the shift equivariance of the employed CNNs and
their respective inability to distinguish same-looking objects. Yet it has been
shown to yield state of the art results for a variety of tasks, and practical
issues have mainly been reported in the context of tile-and-stitch approaches,
where discontinuities at tile boundaries have been observed. To date, neither
of the reported issues have undergone thorough formal analysis. In our work, we
contribute a comprehensive formal analysis of the shift equivariance properties
of encoder-decoder-style CNNs, which yields a clear picture of what can and
cannot be achieved with metric learning in the face of same-looking objects. In
particular, we prove that a standard encoder-decoder network that takes
$d$-dimensional images as input, with $l$ pooling layers and pooling factor
$f$, has the capacity to distinguish at most $f^{dl}$ same-looking objects, and
we show that this upper limit can be reached. Furthermore, we show that to
avoid discontinuities in a tile-and-stitch approach, assuming standard batch
size 1, it is necessary to employ valid convolutions in combination with a
training output window size strictly greater than $f^l$, while at test-time it
is necessary to crop tiles to size $n\cdot f^l$ before stitching, with $n\geq
1$. We complement these theoretical findings by discussing a number of
insightful special cases for which we show empirical results on synthetic data.

identified, semiparametric estimation of the outcome equation proceeds within a

combines the high computational capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks with
a fast and easy training method. Likewise, successful implementation of
neuro-inspired plasticity rules into RC artificial networks has boosted the
performance of the original models. In this manuscript, we analyze the role
that plasticity rules play on the changes that lead to a better performance of
RC. To this end, we implement synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity rules in a
paradigmatic example of RC model: the Echo State Network. Testing on nonlinear
time series prediction tasks, we show evidence that improved performance in all
plastic models are linked to a decrease of the pair-wise correlations in the
reservoir, as well as a significant increase of individual neurons ability to
separate similar inputs in their activity space. Here we provide new insights
on this observed improvement through the study of different stages on the
plastic learning. From the perspective of the reservoir dynamics, optimal
performance is found to occur close to the so-called edge of instability. Our
results also show that it is possible to combine different forms of plasticity
(namely synaptic and non-synaptic rules) to further improve the performance on
prediction tasks, obtaining better results than those achieved with
single-plasticity models.

and the $n$th-order correlation function is measured, the point-spread function
(PSF) effectively becomes $\sqrt n$ times narrower relatively to classical
coherent imaging. Quite surprisingly, measuring $n$-photon correlations is not
the best choice if an $n$-photon entangled state is available. We show that for
measuring $(n-1)$-photon coincidences (thus, ignoring one of the available
photons), PSF can be made even narrower. This observation paves a way for a
strong conditional resolution enhancement by registering one of the photons

Modern mobile services are distributed between end-devices, such as

context-specific recommendations. An increasingly common method to predict
future contexts, such as location, is via machine learning (ML) models. Recent
work in context prediction has focused on ML model personalization where a
personalized model is learned for each individual user in order to tailor

personalized models increases efficacy of the mobile service, we argue that it
increases privacy risk since a personalized model encodes contextual behavior
unique to each user. To demonstrate these privacy risks, we present several

privacy with up to 78% efficacy for top-3 predictions. We present Pelican, a

years to automate the FL process, including information retrieval (IR)-based
techniques. These methods localize the fault based on the similarity of the
reported bug report and the source code. Newer variations of IR-based FL (IRFL)
techniques also look into the history of bug reports and leverage them during
the localization. However, all existing IRFL techniques limit themselves to the
current project's data (local data). In this study, we introduce Globug, which
is an IRFL framework consisting of methods that use models pre-trained on the
global data (extracted from open-source benchmark projects). In Globug, we
investigate two heuristics: a) the effect of global data on a state-of-the-art
IR-FL technique, namely BugLocator, and b) the application of a Word Embedding
technique (Doc2Vec) together with global data. Our large scale experiment on 51
software projects shows that using global data improves BugLocator on average
6.6% and 4.8% in terms of MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) and MAP (Mean Average
Precision), with over 14% in a majority (64% and 54% in terms of MRR and MAP,
respectively) of the cases. This amount of improvement is significant compared
to the improvement rates that five other state-of-the-art IRFL tools provide
over BugLocator. In addition, training the models globally is a one-time
offline task with no overhead on BugLocator's run-time fault localization. Our
study, however, shows that a Word Embedding-based global solution did not
further improve the results.

TCV plasmas with negative triangularity. Considering a limited L-mode plasma,
corresponding to an experimental triangularity scan, numerical results are able
to reproduce the actual transport level over a major fraction of the plasma
minor radius for a plasma with $\delta_{\rm LCFS}=-0.3$ and its equivalent with
standard positive triangularity $\delta$. For the same heat flux, a larger
electron temperature gradient is sustained by $\delta<0$, in turn resulting in
an improved electron energy confinement. Consistently with the experiments, a
reduction of the electron density fluctuations is also seen. Local flux-tube
simulations are used to gauge the magnitude of nonlocal effects. Surprisingly,
very little differences are found between local and global approaches for
$\delta>0$, while local results yield a strong overestimation of the heat
fluxes when $\delta<0$. Despite the high sensitivity of the turbulence level
with respect to the input parameters, global effects appear to play a crucial
role in the negative triangularity plasma and must be retained to reconcile
simulations and experiments. Finally, a general stabilizing effect of negative
triangularity, reducing fluxes and fluctuations by a factor dependent on the
actual profiles, is recovered.

been recently shown experimentally that upon electrostatic doping by electrons
bilayer CrI3 undergoes an antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic (AFM-FM) phase

other hand, does not induce the same transition in the experiment, which points
to an intrinsic asymmetry in the hole and electron doping that limits the
control of the transition by doping. We here show, based on first-principles
calculations, that the asymmetry originates in the relativistic nature of the
valence-band-edge states of the pristine bilayer, which inhibits the magnetic
transition upon hole doping. Based on this finding, we propose an approach to
engineer this system so that it displays the AFM-FM transition for both hole
and electron doping by using moderate uniaxial strain along the soft direction
of the bilayer.

spheres orbiting above a no-slip surface to model interacting flexible cilia;
and (3) whirling rods above a no-slip surface to address the interaction of
nodal cilia. By calculating the flow fields explicitly, we show that the rate

we note a discrepancy in the derived matrix eigenvalues in the limit where the
Hawking radiation entropy goes to zero. The small corrections to the density
matrix for the radiation infer that ${\rm tr}(\rho_\textsf{R}^2)$, equally a
sum over the eigenvalues squared, must be small ($\ll1$) at all times. This is
in contradiction with an ensemble dominated by a density matrix with an
eigenvalue close to unity. Also, the radiation entropy has been approximated by
the ensemble averaged entropy, as in a final state analysis. For
$\rho_\textsf{R}=\rho_\textsf{R}(\sigma)$ with $\sigma$ the set of variables
used in the average, the ensemble average is only an accurate estimate of the
entropy after $\sigma$ has been measured. At the formation of each Hawking
pair, there is a distribution over $\sigma$ that affects the entropy. Without a
real time determination of $\sigma$, the radiation entropy follows Hawking's
result during the evaporation. A question remains of how quickly such
determinations can be assumed to occur. A complete argument for that the
radiation entropy follows the Page curve should address this.

training process by enabling learning statistical models with massive
participants while keeping their data in local clients. However, standard
federated learning techniques that naively minimize an average loss function
are vulnerable to data corruptions from outliers, systematic mislabeling, or
even adversaries. In addition, it is often prohibited for service providers to
verify the quality of data samples due to the increasing concern of user data
privacy. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing Auto-weighted
Robust Federated Learning (arfl), a novel approach that jointly learns the
global model and the weights of local updates to provide robustness against
corrupted data sources. We prove a learning bound on the expected risk with
respect to the predictor and the weights of clients, which guides the
definition of the objective for robust federated learning. The weights are
allocated by comparing the empirical loss of a client with the average loss of
the best p clients (p-average), thus we can downweight the clients with
significantly high losses, thereby lower their contributions to the global
model. We show that this approach achieves robustness when the data of
corrupted clients is distributed differently from benign ones. To optimize the
objective function, we propose a communication-efficient algorithm based on the
blockwise minimization paradigm. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR-10, FEMNIST and Shakespeare, considering different
deep neural network models. The results show that our solution is robust
against different scenarios including label shuffling, label flipping and noisy
features, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in most scenarios.

metallic lasers that support plasmonic modes can provide miniaturized sources
of electromagnetic waves. Such devices often exploit a multilayer design, in
which a semiconductor gain layer is placed near a metallic interface with a gap
layer in between. However, despite many experimental demonstrations, key
considerations for these planar metallic lasers remain understudied, leading to
incorrect conclusions about the optimal design. Here, we pursue a detailed
experimental and theoretical study of planar metallic lasers to explore the
effect of design parameters on the lasing behavior. We print semiconductor
nanoplatelets as a gain layer of controllable thickness onto alumina-coated
silver films with integrated planar Fabry-P\'erot cavities. Lasing behavior is
then monitored with spectrally and polarization-resolved far-field imaging. The
results are compared with a theoretical waveguide model and a detailed
rate-equation model, which consider both plasmonic and photonic modes. We show
that the nature of the lasing mode is dictated by the gain-layer thickness.
Moreover, by explicitly treating gain in our waveguide model, we find that,
contrary to conventional wisdom, a gap layer with high refractive index is
advantageous for plasmonic lasing. Additionally, our rate-equation model
reveals a regime where plasmonic and photonic modes compete within the same
device, raising the possibility of facile, active mode switching. These
findings provide guidance for future designs of metallic lasers and could lead
to on-chip lasers with controlled photonic and plasmonic output, switchable at
high speeds.

study the regularisation of traces for the global pseudo-differential calculus
in the context of non-harmonic analysis. Indeed, using the global
pseudo-differential calculus on manifolds (with or without boundary) developed
in [30], the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt Theorem and the global functional calculus

the sharp regularity orders for the Dixmier traceability of the global

obtain non-harmonic analogues of several classical results arising from the
microlocal analysis of regularised traces for pseudo-differential operators

the dynamic popularity and heterogeneity through ensemble learning. Instead of
trying to find a single dominating caching policy for all the caching
scenarios, we employ an ensemble of constituent caching policies and adaptively
select the best-performing policy to control the cache. Towards this goal, we
first show through formal analysis and experiments that different variations of
the LFU and LRU policies have complementary performance in different caching
scenarios. We further develop a novel caching algorithm that enhances LFU/LRU
with deep recurrent neural network (LSTM) based time-series analysis. Finally,
we develop a deep reinforcement learning agent that adaptively combines base
caching policies according to their virtual hit ratios on parallel virtual
caches. Through extensive experiments driven by real content requests from two
large video streaming platforms, we demonstrate that CEC not only consistently
outperforms all single policies, but also improves the robustness of them. CEC
can be well generalized to different caching scenarios with low computation
overheads for deployment.

$(k_1,k_2,u)$, where $k_1 = k\cos\phi$, $k_2 = k\sin\phi$. In both sets,
$\hat{T}_3 = -i\hbar\partial/\partial u$, so any operator that is a function of

conventional distribution grid is advancing towards interconnected

the power demand of critical infrastructures in the microgrids unless
sufficient battery storage is maintained. Further, an emerging need is that the

minimally dependent on the main grid, thus safeguarding the system from
grid-related contingencies. In this article, we propose a dynamic battery
allocation and control strategy to optimize the power provided by the battery
reserve while ensuring that critical demand is met with a provable guarantee.
Our solution is built upon stochastic feedback control techniques. Under our

balancing the RES and battery resources and eliminates the risk of over or
underproduction. We derive battery power capability control strategy for
multi-microgrid systems in two settings: when microgrids can (interconnected)

examples under different scenarios with detailed comparison of performance of
the proposed algorithm for individualized and shared settings. In particular,
the advantages of interconnecting microgrids through savings in battery power
requirements under IMMG over individualized microgrids are quantified. We
demonstrate the utility and scalability of our algorithm by instantiating it to

DERs have the ability to provide frequency regulation; however, existing

dynamics with high penetrations of DERs. Although electromagnetic transient
(EMT) simulation tools can simulate distribution network dynamics, the

The challenge of synchronizing frequency between the transmission network and

the distribution networks. Thereby, local voltage constraints can be respected
when dispatching the DER power for frequency response. The DER frequency

behaviours in abstract models of computation. Therefore, given a monoid $M$, it
is natural to ask how long a sequence of elements of $M$ needs to be to ensure
the presence of consecutive idempotent factors. This question is formalised
through the notion of the Ramsey function $R_M$ associated to M, obtained by
mapping every positive integer $k$ to the minimal integer $R_M(k)$ such that
every word $u$ in $M^*$ of length $R_M(k)$ contains $k$ consecutive non-empty
factors that correspond to the same idempotent element of $M$.
  In this work, we study the behaviour of the Ramsey function $R_M$ by
investigating the regular $D$-length of $M$, defined as the largest size $L(M)$
of a submonoid of $M$ isomorphic to the set of natural numbers $\{1,2, ...,
L(M)\}$ equipped with the Max operation. We show that the regular $D$-length of
$M$ determines the degree of $R_M$, by proving that $k^{L(M)} \leq R_M(k) \leq
(k|M|^4)^{L(M)}$.
  To allow applications of this result, we provide the value of the regular
$D$-length of diverse monoids. In particular, we prove that the full monoid of
$n \times n$ Boolean matrices, which is used to express transition monoids of
non-deterministic automata, has a regular $D$-length of $\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$.

Analyzing the final structure indicates that, including the ion potential leads
to a slightly lower interface mixing and fewer point defects (such as vacancies

However, by including the ion potential the collision pattern changes. We also

parameter values has driven the design of fast numerical algorithms with
certifiable accuracies. The reduced basis method (RBM) presents itself as such
an option. RBM features a mathematically rigorous error estimator which drives
the construction of a low-dimensional subspace. A surrogate solution is then
sought in this low-dimensional space approximating the parameter-induced high
fidelity solution manifold. However when the system is nonlinear or its
parameter dependence nonaffine, this efficiency gain degrades tremendously, an
inherent drawback of the application of the empirical interpolation method
(EIM).
  In this paper, we augment and extend the EIM approach as a direct solver, as
opposed to an assistant, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations
on the reduced level. The resulting method, called Reduced Over-Collocation
method (ROC), is stable and capable of avoiding the efficiency degradation. Two
critical ingredients of the scheme are collocation at about twice as many
locations as the number of basis elements for the reduced approximation space,
and an efficient error indicator for the strategic building of the reduced
solution space. The latter, the main contribution of this paper, results from
an adaptive hyper reduction of the residuals for the reduced solution.
Together, these two ingredients render the proposed R2-ROC scheme both offline-
and online-efficient. A distinctive feature is that the efficiency degradation
appearing in traditional RBM approaches that utilize EIM for nonlinear and
nonaffine problems is circumvented, both in the offline and online stages.
Numerical tests on different families of time-dependent and steady-state
nonlinear problems demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of our R2-ROC
and its superior stability performance.

studying ground state properties of extended materials. The computational
complexity of describing the Kohn-Sham orbitals is replaced by introducing a
set of random (stochastic) orbitals leading to linear and often sub-linear
scaling of certain ground-state observable at the account of introducing a
statistical error. Schemes to reduce the noise are essential, for example, for
determining the structure using the forces obtained from sDFT. Recently we have
introduced two embedding schemes to mitigate the statistical fluctuations in
the electron density and resultant forces on the nuclei. Both techniques were
based on fragmenting the system either in real-space or slicing the occupied
space into energy windows, allowing for a significant reduction of the
statistical fluctuations. For chemical accuracy further reduction of the noise
is required, which could be achieved by increasing the number of stochastic
orbitals. However, the convergence is relatively slow as the statistical error
scales as $1/\sqrt{N_\chi}$ according to the central limit theorem, where
$N_\chi$ is the number of random orbitals. In this paper we combined the
aforementioned embedding schemes and introduced a new approach that builds on
overlapped fragments and energy windows. The new approach significantly lowers
the noise for ground state properties such as the electron density, total
energy, and forces on the nuclei, as demonstrated for a G-center in bulk
silicon.

scientific and engineering applications ranging from wind power, weather

becoming popular in many branches of science and engineering due to their
non-intrusive nature and online learning capability. Despite the robust
performance of data-driven models, they are faced with challenges of poor
generalizability and difficulty in interpretation. These challenges have
encouraged the integration of physics-based models with data-driven models,
herein denoted hybrid analysis and modeling (HAM). We propose two different
frameworks under the HAM paradigm for applications relevant to wind energy in
order to bring the physical realism within emerging digital twin technologies.
The physics-guided machine learning (PGML) framework reduces the uncertainty of
neural network predictions by embedding physics-based features from a
simplified model at intermediate layers and its performance is demonstrated for
the aerodynamic force prediction task. Our results show that the proposed PGML
framework achieves approximately 75\% reduction in uncertainty for smaller
angle of attacks. The interface learning (IL) framework illustrates how
different solvers can be coupled to produce a multi-fidelity model and is
successfully applied for the Boussinesq equations that govern a broad class of
transport processes. The IL approach paves the way for seamless integration of
multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-fidelity models (M^3 models).

enormously influence the system, with spatial correlations being observable for
a prolonged period beyond the peaks of maximum DH. Further, we discover that

using molecular dynamics simulations. In the model, a melt pool is
incrementally added and cooled to a target temperature under isobaric
conditions to build a metallic column from bottom up. Common neighbor analysis
(CNA) is used to observe the evolution of atomic scale defects during this
process. The solidification is seen to proceed along two directions for an
added molten layer. The molten layer in contact with the cooler lattice has a
fast solidification front that competes with the slower solidification front
starting from the top layer. Defect structure formed strongly depends on the
speeds of the two competing solidification fronts. Up to a critical layer
thickness, defect free single crystals are obtained as the faster
solidification front reaches the top of the melt pool before the initiation of
the slower front from the top. Slower cooling rates lead to reduction in
defects, however, the benefits diminish below a critical rate. Defect content
can be significantly reduced by raising the temperature of the powder bed to a
critical temperature. This temperature is determined by two competing
mechanisms: slower cooling rates at higher temperatures competing against
increase in amorphousness as one gets closer to the melting point. Finally,
effect of added soft inclusion (SiS2) and a hard inclusion (SiC) on the defect
structure is studied. Hard inclusions lead to retained defect structure while
soft inclusions reduce defective content compared to a pure metal.

Simulators using explicit time-stepping schemes require tiny time steps to
avoid numerical instabilities in gradient computation, and simulators using
implicit time integration typically compute gradients by employing the adjoint
method and solving the expensive linearized dynamics. Inspired by Projective
Dynamics (PD), we present Differentiable Projective Dynamics (DiffPD), an
efficient differentiable soft-body simulator based on PD with implicit time
integration. The key idea in DiffPD is to speed up backpropagation by
exploiting the prefactorized Cholesky decomposition in forward PD simulation.
In terms of contact handling, DiffPD supports two types of contacts: a
penalty-based model describing contact and friction forces and a
complementarity-based model enforcing non-penetration conditions and static
friction. We evaluate the performance of DiffPD and observe it is 4-19 times
faster compared with the standard Newton's method in various applications
including system identification, inverse design problems, trajectory
optimization, and closed-loop control. We also apply DiffPD in a

technology that is considered a promising solution for high-speed indoor

the VLC channel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects
the channel gain significantly. In addition, due to the use of optical
frequency bands, the presence of different obstacles (e.g., walls, human
bodies, furniture) may easily block the VLC links. One solution to overcome
these issues is the integration of the intelligent reflective surface (IRS),
which is a new and revolutionizing technology that has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of wireless networks. IRS is capable of
smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment with the use of
massive low-cost passive reflecting elements integrated on a planar surface. In
this paper, a framework for integrating IRS in indoor VLC systems is presented.
We give an overview of IRS, including its advantages, different types and main
applications in VLC systems, where we demonstrate the potential of IRS in
overcoming the effects of random device orientation and links blockages. We
discuss key factors pertaining to the design and integration of IRS in VLC
systems, namely, the deployment of IRSs, the channel state information
acquisition, the optimization of IRS configuration and the real-time IRS
control. We also lay out a number of promising research directions that center
around the integration of IRS in indoor VLC systems.

Backdoor attacks are notably dangerous since they do not affect the model's
performance on clean examples, yet can fool the model to make incorrect
prediction whenever the trigger pattern appears during testing. In this paper,
we propose a novel defense framework Neural Attention Distillation (NAD) to
erase backdoor triggers from backdoored DNNs. NAD utilizes a teacher network to
guide the finetuning of the backdoored student network on a small clean subset
of data such that the intermediate-layer attention of the student network
aligns with that of the teacher network. The teacher network can be obtained by
an independent finetuning process on the same clean subset. We empirically
show, against 6 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, NAD can effectively erase
the backdoor triggers using only 5\% clean training data without causing
obvious performance degradation on clean examples. Code is available in

result from vector calculus that the normals to an implicit surface are
curl-free. By using a curl-free radial basis function (RBF) interpolation of
the normals, we can extract a potential for the vector field whose zero-level

polyharmonic splines for this task, since they are free of any shape or support

how CFPU can be adapted to enforce exact interpolation of a point cloud and can
be regularized to handle noise in both the normal vectors and the point

transport. It is urgent to need a magnetized Rutherford scattering formula
since the magnetic field increases significantly in different fusion areas
(e.g. tokamak magnetic field, self-generated magnetic field, and compressed
magnetic field). The electron-ion Coulomb collisions perpendicular to the
external magnetic field are studied in this paper. The scattering angle is
defined according to the electron trajectory and asymptotic line (without
magnetic field). A magnetized Rutherford scattering formula is obtained
analytically under the weak magnetic field approximation. It is found that the
scattering angle decreases as external magnetic field increases. It is easy to
find the scattering angle decreasing significantly as incident distance, and
incident velocity increasing. It is shown that the theoretical results agree
well with numerical calculation by checking the dependence of scattering angle

By exploiting vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, traffic signal
timing, and queue length estimations, optimized and smoothed speed profiles for
the ego-vehicle are generated to reduce energy consumption. Next, the planned
eco-trajectories are incorporated into a real-time predictive optimization
framework that coordinates the cabin thermal load (in cold weather) with the
speed preview, i.e., eco-heating. To enable eco-heating, the engine coolant (as
the only heat source for cabin heating) and the cabin air are leveraged as two
thermal energy storages. Our eco-heating strategy stores thermal energy in the
engine coolant and cabin air while the vehicle is driving at high speeds, and
releases the stored energy slowly during the vehicle stops for cabin heating
without forcing the engine to idle to provide the heating source. To test and
validate these solutions, a power-split hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) has been
instrumented for cabin thermal management, allowing to regulate heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system inputs (cabin temperature
setpoint and blower flow rate) in real-time. Experiments were conducted to
demonstrate the energy-saving benefits of eco-driving and eco-heating
strategies over real-world city driving cycles at different cold ambient
temperatures. The data confirmed average fuel savings of 14.5% and 4.7%
achieved by eco-driving and eco-heating, respectively, offering a combined
energy saving of more than 19% when comparing to the baseline vehicle driven by
a human driver with a constant-heating strategy.

application of edge computing to smart factories for mission-critical task
offloading through wireless links. In such scenarios, although high end-to-end
delays from the generation to completion of tasks happen with low probability,
they may incur severe casualties and property loss, and should be seriously

adopt the Conditional Value at Risk to capture the tail of the delay

through analysis of the queues both at the devices and the edge computing

be able to estimate the feedback energy in the ICM and use it as a probe of the
non-gravitational processes. To address this issue we calculate the ICM entropy
profiles in a sample of 47 galaxy clusters and groups, which have been observed
out to at least $\sim r_{500}$ with Chandra, XMM-Newton and/or Suzaku, by
constructing a physical model to incorporate the effects of both gravity and

mission-critical and privacy-sensitive applications such as autopilot. To solve
this problem, recent advances unleash DNN services using the edge computing
paradigm. The existing approaches split a DNN into two parts and deploy the two
partitions to computation nodes at two edge computing tiers. Nonetheless, these
methods overlook collaborative device-edge-cloud computation resources.
Besides, previous algorithms demand the whole DNN re-partitioning to adapt to
computation resource changes and network dynamics. Moreover, for
resource-demanding convolutional layers, prior works do not give a parallel
processing strategy without loss of accuracy at the edge side. To tackle these
issues, we propose D3, a dynamic DNN decomposition system for synergistic
inference without precision loss. The proposed system introduces a heuristic
algorithm named horizontal partition algorithm to split a DNN into three parts.
The algorithm can partially adjust the partitions at run time according to
processing time and network conditions. At the edge side, a vertical separation
module separates feature maps into tiles that can be independently run on
different edge nodes in parallel. Extensive quantitative evaluation of five
popular DNNs illustrates that D3 outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts
up to 3.4 times in end-to-end DNN inference time and reduces backbone network

solutions with well defined properties although the potential is non-analytical
at the origin. The model contains a control parameter $\delta$ that breaks the
degeneracy of the potential minima, giving rise to two different phases for the
system. The $\delta<0$ phases do not possess solitary wave solutions. At the
transition point $\delta=0$ all the potential minima are degenerate and three
different kink solutions result. As the transition to the $\delta>0$ phase
takes place, the minima of the potential are no longer degenerate and a unique
kink $\phi_\delta$ solution is produced. Remarkably, this kink is a coherent
structure that results from the merge of three kinks that can be identified
with those observed at the transition point. To support the interpretation of
$\phi_\delta$ as a bound state of three kinks, we calculate the force between
the kink-kink pair components of $\phi_\delta$, obtaining an expression that
has both exponentially repulsive and constant attractive contributions that
yields an equilibrium configuration, explaining the formation of the
$\phi_\delta$ multi-kink state. We further investigate kink properties
including their stability guaranteed by the positive defined spectrum of small
fluctuations around the kink configurations. The findings of our work together
with a semiclassical WKB quantization, including the one loop mass
renormalization, enable computing quantum corrections to the kink masses. The
general results could be relevant to the development of effective theories for
non-equilibrium steady states and for the understanding of the formation of

celebrated formula of Berg and Purcell for the rate that cell surface receptors
capture extracellular molecules. Indeed, this influential result is only valid
if receptors transport molecules through the cell wall at a rate much faster
than molecules arrive at receptors. From a mathematical perspective, ignoring
receptor kinetics is convenient because it makes the diffusing molecules
independent. In contrast, including receptor kinetics introduces correlations
between the diffusing molecules since, for example, bound receptors may be
temporarily blocked from binding additional molecules. In this work, we present
a modeling framework for coupling bulk diffusion to surface receptors with
finite kinetic rates. The framework uses boundary homogenization to couple the
diffusion equation to nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the
boundary. We use this framework to derive an explicit formula for the cellular
uptake rate and show that the analysis of Berg and Purcell significantly
overestimates uptake in some typical biophysical scenarios. We confirm our

associations, where a definition is a program location that assigns a value to
a variable and a use is a location where that value is accessed. Data flow
testing is expensive, largely because of the number of test requirements.
Luckily, many DU-associations are redundant in the sense that if one test
requirement (e.g., node, edge, DU-association) is covered, other
DU-associations are guaranteed to also be covered. This relationship is called
subsumption. Thus, testers can save resources by only covering DU-associations
that are not subsumed by other testing requirements. In this work, we formally
describe the Data Flow Subsumption Framework (DSF) conceived to tackle the data
flow subsumption problem. We show that DFS is a distributive data flow analysis
framework which allows efficient iterative algorithms to find the
Meet-Over-All-Paths (MOP) solution for DSF transfer functions. The MOP solution
implies that the results at a point $p$ are valid for all paths that reach $p$.
We also present an algorithm, called Subsumption Algorithm (SA), that uses DSF
transfer functions and iterative algorithms to find the local
DU-associations-node subsumption; that is, the set of DU-associations that are
covered whenever a node $n$ is toured by a test. A proof of SA's correctness is
presented and its complexity is analyzed.

one dimension. The main focus is on the existence and stability of interface
modes that are induced by topological properties of the bulk structure. For a
general 1D photonic structure with time-reversal symmetry, the associated Zak
phase (or Berry phase) may not be quantized. We investigate the existence of an
interface mode which is induced by a Dirac point upon perturbation.
Specifically, we establish conditions on the perturbation which guarantee the
opening of a band gap around the Dirac point and the existence of an interface
mode. For a periodic photonic structure with both time-reversal and inversion
symmetry, the Zak phase is quantized, taking only two values $0, \pi$. We show
that the Zak phase is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the Bloch modes
at the band edges. For a photonic structure consisting of two semi-infinite
systems on the two sides of an interface with distinct topological indices, we
show the existence of an interface mode inside the common gap. The stability of
the mode under perturbations is also investigated. Finally, we study resonances
for finite topological structures. Our results are based on the transfer matrix
method and the oscillation theory for Sturm-Liouville operators. The methods
and results can be extended to general topological Sturm-Liouville systems in
one dimension.

lives. Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model,
we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the
model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or
poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these
objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of
end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and
validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving.
Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the
objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research
directions towards this vision - depth, breadth, and usability - to measure
progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be
deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be
handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for
fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning.
Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of
machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and
propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair
and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves
fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the
techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch
selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice
Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We
believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine
learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.

site-dependent environment interactions such as hyperfine coupling with

multi-directional displacement in a $3\times 3$ array of tunnel coupled quantum
dots enhances the spin coherence time via the motional narrowing phenomenon.
More specifically, up to 10 configurations are explored by the electrons to
study the impact of the displacement on spin dynamics. An increase of the

These networks typically evolve according to certain laws, such as the law of

representation learning of temporal networks should be able to capture such
laws and further be applied to systems that follow the same laws but have not
been unseen during the training stage. Previous works in this area depend on
either network node identities or rich edge attributes and typically fail to
extract these laws. Here, we propose Causal Anonymous Walks (CAWs) to
inductively represent a temporal network. CAWs are extracted by temporal random
walks and work as automatic retrieval of temporal network motifs to represent
network dynamics while avoiding the time-consuming selection and counting of
those motifs. CAWs adopt a novel anonymization strategy that replaces node
identities with the hitting counts of the nodes based on a set of sampled walks
to keep the method inductive, and simultaneously establish the correlation
between motifs. We further propose a neural-network model CAW-N to encode CAWs,
and pair it with a CAW sampling strategy with constant memory and time cost to
support online training and inference. CAW-N is evaluated to predict links over
6 real temporal networks and uniformly outperforms previous SOTA methods by

the target speaker, such as lip movement and facial expressions, because the
visual aspect of speech is essentially unaffected by acoustic environment. In
this paper, we address the problem of enhancing corrupted speech signal from
videos by using audio-visual (AV) neural processing. Most of recent AV speech
enhancement approaches separately process the acoustic and visual features and
fuse them via a simple concatenation operation. Although this strategy is
convenient and easy to implement, it comes with two major drawbacks: 1)
evidence in speech perception suggests that in humans the AV integration occurs
at a very early stage, in contrast to previous models that process the two
modalities separately at early stage and combine them only at a later stage,
thus making the system less robust, and 2) a simple concatenation does not
allow to control how the information from the acoustic and the visual
modalities is treated. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a multi-layer
feature fusion convolution network (MFFCN), which separately process acoustic
and visual modalities for preserving each modality features while fusing both
modalities' features layer by layer in encoding phase for enjoying the human AV
speech perception. In addition, considering the balance between the two
modalities, we design channel and spectral attention mechanisms to provide
additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information expanding
the representational ability of the convolution neural network. Experimental
results show that the proposed MFFCN demonstrates the performance of the
network superior to the state-of-the-art models.

observations, as they are excited at lower beam energies and generally have
larger growth rates. Local analytic theory is used to explain key features of
the simulation results, including the preferential excitation of different
modes based on beam injection geometry and the growth rate dependence on the
beam injection velocity, critical velocity, and degree of velocity space
anisotropy. The background damping rate is inferred from simulations and

variabilities in the soft (0.8 - 1.5 keV) and the hard (1.5 - 8.0 keV) bands in
the light curves. Spectral variability on intraday timescales is estimated
using the hardness ratio. The blazar usually becomes harder when brighter and
vice versa, following the typical behavior of high synchrotron peak blazars.
The power spectral density (PSD) analyses of 11 out of 13 light curves in the
total energy (0.8 - 8.0 keV) are found to be red-noise dominated, with
power-law spectral indices that span a large range, from -2.81 to -0.88.
Discrete correlation function analyses of all the 13 light curves between the
soft and the hard bands show that they are well correlated and peak at, or very
close to, zero lag. This indicates that the emissions in soft and hard bands
are probably cospatial and emitted from the same population of leptons.
Considering fluxes versus variability timescales, we found no correlation on
intraday timescales, implying that X-ray emission from PKS 2155-304 is not
dominated by simple changes in the Doppler factor. We briefly discuss the most
likely emission mechanisms responsible for the observed flux and spectral
variabilities and place constraints on magnetic field strength and Lorentz
factors of the electrons emitting the X-rays in the most likely scenario.

of the CNN was done on a subset of 100 perfusion data, while 15 samples were
used as validation. All the data used for the training/validation of the
network and to generate ground truth (GT) maps, using a state-of-the-art
deconvolution-algorithm, were previously pre-processed using a standard
pipeline. Validation was carried out through manual segmentation of infarct
core and penumbra on both CNN-derived maps and GT maps. Concordance among
segmented lesions was assessed using the Dice and the Pearson correlation
coefficients across lesion volumes. Results: Mean Dice scores from two
different raters and the GT maps were > 0.70 (good-matching). Inter-rater
concordance was also high and strong correlation was found between lesion
volumes of CNN maps and GT maps (0.99, 0.98). Conclusion: Our CNN-based
approach generated clinically relevant perfusion maps that are comparable to
state-of-the-art perfusion analysis methods based on deconvolution of the data.
Moreover, the proposed technique requires less information to estimate the

demonstrate the achievable 3D positioning and tracking performance in the

achieving robust, high-performance and cost-efficient positioning solutions are
outlined and discussed, identifying various potential directions for future

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.NA cs.NE math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful
unsupervised method to model the statistical patterns of real-world data sets,
such as natural images. These networks are trained to map random inputs in
their latent space to new samples representative of the learned data. However,
the structure of the latent space is hard to intuit due to its high
dimensionality and the non-linearity of the generator, which limits the
usefulness of the models. Understanding the latent space requires a way to
identify input codes for existing real-world images (inversion), and a way to
identify directions with known image transformations (interpretability). Here,
we use a geometric framework to address both issues simultaneously. We develop
an architecture-agnostic method to compute the Riemannian metric of the image
manifold created by GANs. The eigen-decomposition of the metric isolates axes
that account for different levels of image variability. An empirical analysis
of several pretrained GANs shows that image variation around each position is
concentrated along surprisingly few major axes (the space is highly
anisotropic) and the directions that create this large variation are similar at
different positions in the space (the space is homogeneous). We show that many
of the top eigenvectors correspond to interpretable transforms in the image
space, with a substantial part of eigenspace corresponding to minor transforms
which could be compressed out. This geometric understanding unifies key
previous results related to GAN interpretability. We show that the use of this
metric allows for more efficient optimization in the latent space (e.g. GAN
inversion) and facilitates unsupervised discovery of interpretable axes. Our
results illustrate that defining the geometry of the GAN image manifold can
serve as a general framework for understanding GANs.

Here we investigate the FIR/MIR response of redox-chemically doped

expectations, the Drude-type plasmon shifts to lower wavenumbers with
increasing doping level. By means of Monte-Carlo simulations of the optical
response, we attribute this behavior to the confinement of excess charge
carriers at low doping levels and their progressive delocalization when
approaching degenerate doping. The coupling of vibrational modes to intraband
excitations in the doped s-SWNTs can be probed via a double resonance process
similar to that responsible for the Raman D-band. The resulting Fano
antiresonances shed new light onto the character and coupling of electronic and
vibrational degrees of freedom in these one-dimensional semiconductors.

methods in image deblurring have displayed, there still exists major challenge
with various non-uniform motion blur. Previous methods simply take all the
image features as the input to the decoder, which handles different degrees
(e.g. large blur, small blur) simultaneously, leading to challenges for sharp
image generation. To tackle the above problems, we present a deep two-branch
network to deal with blurry images via a component divided module, which
divides an image into two components based on the representation of blurry
degree. Specifically, two component attentive blocks are employed to learn
attention maps to exploit useful deblurring feature representations on both
large and small blurry regions. Then, the blur-aware features are fed into
two-branch reconstruction decoders respectively. In addition, a new feature
fusion mechanism, orientation-based feature fusion, is proposed to merge sharp
features of the two branches. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art
approaches.

that accurately captures the quantum- and in-medium effects of QCD at low

at source level. To prevent optimizing compilers from altering the protection,
security engineers embed input/output side-effects into the protection. These
side-effects are error-prone and compiler-dependent, and the current practice
involves analyzing the generated machine code to make sure security or privacy
properties are still enforced. Vu et al. recently demonstrated how to automate
the insertion of volatile side-effects in a compiler [52], but these may be too
expensive in fined-grained protections such as control-flow integrity. We
introduce observations of the program state that are intrinsic to the correct
execution of security protections, along with means to specify and preserve
observations across the compilation flow. Such observations complement the
traditional input/output-preservation contract of compilers. We show how to

this work, we take a step towards more robust and interpretable classifiers

they allow for generating counterfactual images. We demonstrate the ability of

for bridging different scales of organization of brain structure and function.
Recent advances in deriving mean-field descriptions for networks of coupled
oscillators have sparked the development of a new generation of neural mass
models. Of notable interest are mean-field descriptions of all-to-all coupled
quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons, which have already seen numerous
extensions and applications. These extensions include different forms of
short-term adaptation (STA) considered to play an important role in generating
and sustaining dynamic regimes of interest in the brain. It is an open
question, however, whether the incorporation of pre-synaptic forms of synaptic
plasticity driven by single neuron activity would still permit the derivation
of mean-field equations using the same method. Here, we discuss this problem
using an established model of short-term synaptic plasticity at the single
neuron level, for which we present two different approaches for the derivation
of the mean-field equations. We compare these models with a recently proposed
mean-field approximation that assumes stochastic spike timings. In general, the
latter fails to accurately reproduce the macroscopic activity in networks of
deterministic QIF neurons with distributed parameters. We show that the
mean-field models we propose provide a more accurate description of the network
dynamics, although they are mathematically more involved. Using bifurcation
analysis, we find that QIF networks with pre-synaptic short-term plasticity can
express regimes of periodic bursting activity as well as bi-stable regimes.
Together, we provide novel insight into the macroscopic effects of short-term
synaptic plasticity in spiking neural networks, as well as two different
mean-field descriptions for future investigations of such networks.

tropical cyclones by shallowing the upper layer and warming the subsurface
ocean in the Bay of Bengal. Here, we use in situ and satellite data with
reanalysis products to showcase how river water can experience a significant
increase in salinity on subseasonal timescales. This involves the trapping and
homogenization of freshwater by a cyclonic eddy in the Bay. Specifically, in
October 2015, river water is shown to enter a particularly long-lived eddy
along with its attracting manifolds within a period of two weeks. The eddy
itself is quite unique in that it lasted for 16 months in the Bay where average
lifespans are of the order of 2-3 months. This low salinity water results in
the formation of a highly stratified surface layer. In fact, when freshest, the
eddy has the highest sea-level anomalies, spins fastest, and supports strong
lateral gradients in salinity. Subsequently, observations reveal progressive
homogenization of salinity and relaxation of sea-level anomalies and salinity
gradients within a month. In particular, salty water spirals in, and freshwater
is pulled out across the eddy boundary. Lagrangian experiments elucidate this
process, whereby horizontal chaotic mixing provides a mechanism for the rapid
increase in surface salinity on the order of timescale of a month. This pathway
is distinct from vertical mixing and likely to be important in the eddy-rich
Bay of Bengal.

values, including through participatory design-processes. In this paper we look
more closely at the question of AI value alignment and suggest that the power
and autonomy of AI systems gives rise to opportunities and challenges in the
domain of value that have not been encountered before. Drawing important
continuities between the work of the fairness, accountability, transparency and
ethics community, and work being done by technical AI safety researchers, we
suggest that more attention needs to be paid to the question of 'social value
alignment' - that is, how to align AI systems with the plurality of values
endorsed by groups of people, especially on the global level.

motion processes in ambient data space and associated probabilistic techniques.
Intuitively, our ideas correspond to placing a heat source at the decision
boundary and observing how effectively the sample points warm up. We are
largely motivated by the search for a soft measure that sheds further light on
the decision boundary's geometry. En route, we bridge aspects of potential
theory and geometric analysis (Mazya, 2011, Grigoryan-Saloff-Coste, 2002) with
active fields of ML research such as adversarial examples and generalization
bounds. First, we focus on the geometric behavior of decision boundaries in the
light of adversarial attack/defense mechanisms. Experimentally, we observe a
certain capacitory trend over different adversarial defense strategies:
decision boundaries locally become flatter as measured by isoperimetric
inequalities (Ford et al, 2019); however, our more sensitive heat-diffusion
metrics extend this analysis and further reveal that some non-trivial geometry
invisible to plain distance-based methods is still preserved. Intuitively, we
provide evidence that the decision boundaries nevertheless retain many
persistent ""wiggly and fuzzy"" regions on a finer scale. Second, we show how
Brownian hitting probabilities translate to soft generalization bounds which
are in turn connected to compression and noise stability (Arora et al, 2018),
and these bounds are significantly stronger if the decision boundary has
controlled geometric features.

In heavy ion collisions, there is no direct way of measuring the state
variables like entropy, pressure, energy and hence unambiguous characterization
of phase transition becomes difficult. This work proposes new signatures of
phase transition that can be extracted from the observables which are easily
accessible in experiments. It is observed that the temperature dependence of
the first order derivative of the order parameters in nuclear liquid gas phase
transition exhibit similar behavior as that of the variation of specific heat
at constant volume Cv which is an established signature of first order phase
transition. This motivates us to propose these derivatives as confirmatory
signals of liquid-gas phase transition. The measurement of these signals in
easily feasible in most experiments as compared to the other signatures like
specific heat, caloric curve or bimodality. Total multiplicity, size of largest
cluster are some of the order parameters which have been studied. Statistical
Models based on canonical ensemble and lattice gas model has been used for the
study. This temperature where the peak appears is designated to be the
transition temperature and the effect of certain parameters on this has also
been examined. The multiplicity derivative signature proposed in this work has
been further confirmed by other theoretical models as well as in experimental
study.

u=-\mathrm{div}(A_0 \nabla u)$, $Lu=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)$ be two real
uniformly elliptic operators in $\Omega$, with $\omega_{L_0}, \omega_L$ the

  Also, we characterize the absolute continuity of $\omega_{L_0}$ with respect

This is also equivalent to the finiteness $\omega_{L_0}$-a.e. of the truncated

we show that $\omega_{L_0}\ll\omega_L$ if the disagreement of the coefficients
satisfies some qualitative quadratic estimate in truncated cones for
$\omega_{L_0}$-a.e. vertex. Finally, when $L_0$ is either the transpose of $L$

so-called zero crossing, a property related to the ghost dominance at the
infrared scales that restricts the behaviour of the three gluon vertex. We also
explore the possible existence of a ghost mass preventing the IR divergence.
Functional forms were used to model the lattice data and explore the two
different possibilities for the IR behaviour. In the first case we estimate the
mass scale associated with the crossing and search for a possible sign of the

  We show that if R is a set of pairwise-disjoint axis-aligned rectangles, then
we can preprocess R to reconstruct the Pareto front of P efficiently. To refine
our algorithmic analysis, we introduce a new notion of algorithmic optimality

unobtainable in the preprocessing model, whenever the classic algorithmic

uncertainty-region optimal with respect to real RAM instructions, and instance

operations on contracts in a manner that supports best the development of
systems in that area. At the other end, contract meta-theories attempt to
provide a systematic view on the various contract theories by axiomatising
their desired properties. However, there exists a noticeable gap between the
most well-known contract meta-theory of Benveniste et al., which focuses on the
design of embedded and cyber-physical systems, and the established way of using
contracts when developing general software, following Meyer's
design-by-contract methodology. At the core of this gap appears to be the
notion of procedure: while it is a central unit of composition in software
development, the meta-theory does not suggest an obvious way of treating
procedures as components.
  In this paper, we provide a first step towards a contract theory that takes
procedures as the basic building block, and is at the same time an
instantiation of the meta-theory. To this end, we propose an abstract contract
theory for sequential programming languages with procedures, based on
denotational semantics. We show that, on the one hand, the specification of
contracts of procedures in Hoare logic, and their procedure-modular
verification, can be cast naturally in the framework of our abstract contract
theory. On the other hand, we also show our contract theory to fulfil the
axioms of the meta-theory. In this way, we give further evidence for the
utility of the meta-theory, and prepare the ground for combining our

capture all crystal lattice dynamics properly. Phonon-phonon scattering
mechanisms become important and limit the phonon lifetimes. We take a novel
approach and simulate the phonon dispersion of a complex dynamic solid at
elevated temperatures with Machine-Learning Force Fields of
near-first-principles accuracy. Through large-scale molecular dynamics
simulations the projected velocity autocorrelation function (PVACF) is

Imaginary modes in the harmonic picture of this perovskite are absent in the

is a function that can represent a localized behavior, like a transient or a

reproduction number R0, which provides an estimation of the contagiousness of
the disease. When R0 > 1, the disease spread will potentially lead to an
outbreak, such that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics. During the evolution of
an outbreak, various non-pharmaceutical interventions are employed, the impact
of which is frequently assessed by the reduction that they introduce to the
effective reproduction number Rt; reduction below 1 is an indication of
eventual dying out of the disease spread. Motivated by the fact that R0
essentially expresses the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, in this
work, Rt was examined in the view of timescale analysis. It was shown that
during the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, when various
interventions were in place, Rt had a clear relation with the explosive
timescale characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, it is
shown that the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of
the epidemics implies Rt > 1, while its absence implies Rt < 1. In addition, as
this timescale converges/diverges with the immediately slowest one, Rt
approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. These results suggest that
timescale analysis can be utilized for the assessment of the impact of various
interventions, since it reflects the insight provided by the effective
reproduction number, without being hindered by the selection of the population

continuous quantum-to-classical transition emerges. The mechanism driving this

contain few-atom wide terraces separated by monoatomic steps similar to the
complex Au surfaces used in experiments. The structure of the SAMs is probed
via several structural properties including tilt angles, mean C atom heights
from the surface, precession angles, gauche defects, gyration tensors and
relative shape anisotropy. Comparing these properties to those of the
well-studied SAMs on Au(111), we observe similarities but also striking
differences. A clear order to disorder transition is observed by changing the
substrate: well-ordered SAMs on (111) and (211) surfaces become mixed
ordered-disordered structures on (311) and fully disordered on (221). The
presence of steps on the Au surfaces also results in preferential tilt
orientations with long-range order. Our results show that in addition to the
expected grafting density dependence, the transition from order to disorder
crucially depends on substrate morphology. The onset of ordering behavior is
related to the atomic structure of the surface. The key parameter that affects
long-range order is the energy for changing the dihedral angle between
Au-S-$\mathrm{C^{(1)}-C^{(2)}}$ of the adsorbed alkanethiol.

Ushakov. It is defined for each finitely generated group $G$ and takes as input
group elements $g_1,\ldots,g_n,g\in G$ and asks whether there are
$x_1,\ldots,x_n\ge 0$ with $g_1^{x_1}\cdots g_n^{x_n}=g$. We study the knapsack
problem for wreath products $G\wr H$ of groups $G$ and $H$. Our main result is
a characterization of those wreath products $G\wr H$ for which the knapsack
problem is decidable. The characterization is in terms of decidability
properties of the indiviual factors $G$ and $H$. To this end, we introduce two
decision problems, the intersection knapsack problem and its restriction, the
positive intersection knapsack problem. Moreover, we apply our main result to
$H_3(\mathbb{Z})$, the discrete Heisenberg group, and to Baumslag-Solitar
groups $\mathsf{BS}(1,q)$ for $q\ge 1$. First, we show that the knapsack
problem is undecidable for $G\wr H_3(\mathbb{Z})$ for any $G\ne 1$. This
implies that for $G\ne 1$ and for infinite and virtually nilpotent groups $H$,
the knapsack problem for $G\wr H$ is decidable if and only if $H$ is virtually
abelian and solvability of systems of exponent equations is decidable for $G$.
Second, we show that the knapsack problem is decidable for
$G\wr\mathsf{BS}(1,q)$ if and only if solvability of systems of exponent
equations is decidable for $G$.

non-locally compact Polish subspaces of infinite-dimensional separable Banach
spaces which, under suitable assumptions, are minimizers of causal variational
principles in the non-locally compact setting. Moreover, for non-trivial
minimizers the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are derived. The method
is to exhaust the underlying Banach space by finite-dimensional subspaces and
to prove existence of minimizers of the causal variational principle restricted
to these finite-dimensional subsets of the Polish space under suitable
assumptions on the Lagrangian. This gives rise to a corresponding sequence of
minimizers. Restricting the resulting sequence to countably many compact
subsets of the Polish space, by considering the resulting diagonal sequence we
are able to construct a regular measure on the Borel algebra over the whole
topological space.
  For continuous Lagrangians of bounded range it can be shown that, under
suitable assumptions, the obtained measure is a (possibly non-trivial)
minimizer under variations of compact support. Under additional assumptions, we
prove that the constructed measure is a minimizer under variations of finite
volume and solves the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. Afterwards, we
extend our results to continuous Lagrangians vanishing in entropy. Finally,
assuming that the obtained measure is locally finite, topological properties of
spacetime are worked out and a connection to dimension theory is established.

transnational migration on consumption of visible goods. We utilize the
plausibly exogenous variation in migration networks in the neighbourhood and
religious communities to account for the potential endogeneity. The findings
indicate a significantly positive and robust effect of migration on conspicuous
consumption, even after controlling for household income. In terms of the
mechanisms, while we are unable to rule out the associated taste-based changes
in preferences and the peer group effects driving up the spending on status
goods, we observe only limited effects of these channels. A potential channel
that we propose is information gap among permanent residents about the income
levels of an out-migrant, which is leveraged by them to signal higher status in
society. We explore this channel through a theoretical model where we connect
migration, information gap and status good consumption. We derive a set of
conditions to test whether migrants exhibit snobbish or conformist behaviour.
Empirical observations indicate predominance of a snobbish behaviour.

phospholipid headgroups but surprisingly enhances its intermediate-range order
(IRO) over a distance, at least, twice as large. Here, we explore how the IRO
is related to the water's hydrogen bond network (HBN) and its coordination
defects. We characterize the increased IRO by an alteration of the HBN up to
more than eight coordination shells of hydration water. The HBN analysis
emphasizes the existence of a bound-unbound water interface at $\sim 0.8$ nm
from the membrane. The unbound water has a distribution of defects intermediate
between bound and bulk water, but with density and dynamics similar to bulk,
while bound water has reduced thermal energy and much more HBN defects than
low-temperature water. This observation could be fundamental for developing

first-order splitting methods for solving smooth convex optimization problems
and cocoercive equations. From a theoretical point of view, we compare
convergence rates of gradient descent, forward-backward, Peaceman-Rachford, and
Douglas-Rachford algorithms for minimizing the sum of two smooth convex
functions when one of them is strongly convex. A similar comparison is given in
the more general cocoercive setting under the presence of strong monotonicity
and we observe that the convergence rates in optimization are strictly better
than the corresponding rates for cocoercive equations for some algorithms. We
obtain improved rates with respect to the literature in several instances by
exploiting the structure of our problems. Moreover, we indicate which algorithm
has the lowest convergence rate depending on strong convexity and cocoercive
parameters. From a numerical point of view, we verify our theoretical results
by implementing and comparing previous algorithms in well-established signal
and image inverse problems involving sparsity. We replace the widely used
$\ell_1$ norm with the Huber loss and we observe that fully proximal-based
strategies have numerical and theoretical advantages with respect to methods
using gradient steps.

demonstrating a crossover with increasing temperature. Using the crossover
temperature $T_0$, the coherence length along the c axis $\xi_c(0)$, was

rehearsal-based methods show their success in mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting problem by replaying samples from previous tasks during learning a

method, named learning Invariant Representation for Continual Learning (IRCL),
in which class-invariant representation is disentangled from a conditional
generative model and jointly used with class-specific representation to learn
the sequential tasks. Disentangling the shared invariant representation helps
to learn continually a sequence of tasks, while being more robust to forgetting
and having better knowledge transfer. We focus on class incremental learning
where there is no knowledge about task identity during inference. We
empirically evaluate our proposed method on two well-known benchmarks for
continual learning: split MNIST and split Fashion MNIST. The experimental

not universally valid and violated in general. In recent years, the
reformulation of uncertainty relations is actively studied, and several
universally valid uncertainty relations are derived. On the other hand, several
measuring models, in particular, spin-1/2 measurements, are constructed and
quantitatively examined. However, there are not so many studies on simultaneous
measurements of position and momentum despite their importance. Here we show
that an error-trade-off relation (ETR), called the Branciard-Ozawa ETR, for
simultaneous measurements of position and momentum gives the achievable bound
in minimum uncertainty states. We construct linear simultaneous measurements of

community over the recent years. However, the proposed approaches vary in many
ways, which makes it hard to assess the individual contribution of the model
components. In style transfer, the most important component is the optimization
technique used to guide the learning in the absence of parallel training data.
In this work we empirically compare the dominant optimization paradigms which
provide supervision signals during training: backtranslation, adversarial
training and reinforcement learning. We find that backtranslation has
model-specific limitations, which inhibits training style transfer models.
Reinforcement learning shows the best performance gains, while adversarial
training, despite its popularity, does not offer an advantage over the latter
alternative. In this work we also experiment with Minimum Risk Training, a
popular technique in the machine translation community, which, to our
knowledge, has not been empirically evaluated in the task of style transfer. We
fill this research gap and empirically show its efficacy.

unexplained. In order to better understand these particular stars, we performed
a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of 49 candidate A/F-type hybrid stars and one
cool(er) hybrid object detected by the {\it Kepler} mission. We determined a
lower limit of 27 % for the multiplicity fraction. For six spectroscopic

velocities and can be attributed to orbital motion. We aim to improve the
orbital solutions for those systems with long orbital periods (order of 4-6
years) among the {\it Kepler} hybrid stars. The orbits are computed based on a
simultaneous modelling of the RVs obtained with high-resolution spectrographs
and the photometric time delays derived from time-dependent frequency analyses
of the {\it Kepler} light curves. We refined the orbital solutions of four
spectroscopic systems with A/F-type {\it Kepler} hybrid component stars: KIC
4480321, 5219533, 8975515 and KIC 9775454. Simultaneous modelling of both data

more robust and accurate information on the mass ratio, and identify the

we were also able to derive new constraints for the minimum component masses.
From a search for regular frequency patterns in the high-frequency regime of
the Fourier transforms of each system, we found no evidence of tidal splitting
among the triple systems with close (inner) companions. However, some systems
exhibit frequency spacings which can be explained by the mechanism of
rotational splitting.

phase of protoplanetary disks. X-rays emitted from the central young stellar
object (YSO) that irradiate interstellar ices in the disk, followed by the
ejection of molecules in the gas phase, are a possible route to explain the
abundances observed in the cold regions. This process, known as X-ray
photodesorption, needs to be quantified for methanol-containing ices. This
paper I focuses on the case of X-ray photodesorption from pure methanol ices.
We aim at experimentally measuring X-ray photodesorption yields of methanol and
its photo-products from pure CH$_3$OH ices, and to shed light on the mechanisms
responsible for the desorption process. We irradiated methanol ices at 15 K
with X-rays in the 525 - 570 eV range. The release of species in the gas phase
was monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry, and photodesorption yields were
derived. Under our experimental conditions, the CH$_3$OH X-ray photodesorption
yield from pure methanol ice is 10$^{-2}$ molecule/photon at 564 eV.
Photo-products such as CH$_4$, H$_2$CO, H$_2$O, CO$_2$ , and CO also desorb at
increasing efficiency. X-ray photodesorption of larger COMs, which can be
attributed to either ethanol, dimethyl ether, and/or formic acid, is also
detected. The physical mechanisms at play are discussed and must likely involve
the thermalization of Auger electrons in the ice, thus indicating that its
composition plays an important role. Finally, we provide desorption yields
applicable to protoplanetary disk environments for astrochemical models. The
X-rays are shown to be a potential candidate to explain gas-phase abundances of
methanol in disks. However, more relevant desorption yields derived from
experiments on mixed ices are mandatory to properly support the role played by
X-rays in nonthermal desorption of methanol (see paper II).

(mPAP) $>$ 20 mmHg, is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance
and decreased pulmonary arterial compliance. There are few measurable
biomarkers of PH progression, but a conclusive diagnosis of the disease
requires invasive right heart catheterization (RHC). Patient-specific
computational models of the cardiovascular system are a potential noninvasive
tool for determining additional indicators of disease severity. Using
computational modeling, this study quantifies physiological parameters
indicative of disease severity in nine PH patients. The model includes all four
heart chambers and the pulmonary and systemic circulations. We consider two
sets of calibration data: static (systolic \& diastolic values) RHC data and a
combination of static and continuous, time-series waveform data. We determine a
subset of identifiable parameters for model calibration using sensitivity
analyses and multistart inference, and carry out uncertainty quantification
post-inference. Results show that additional waveform data enables accurate
calibration of the right atrial reservoir and pump function across the PH
cohort. Model outcomes, including stroke work and pulmonary
resistance-compliance relations, reflect typical right heart dynamics in PH
phenotypes. Lastly, we show that estimated parameters agree with previous,
non-modeling studies, supporting this type of analysis in translational PH
research.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.DC cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emerging hybrid memory systems that comprise technologies such as Intel's
Optane DC Persistent Memory, exhibit disparities in the access speeds and
capacity ratios of their heterogeneous memory components. This breaks many
assumptions and heuristics designed for traditional DRAM-only platforms. High
application performance is feasible via dynamic data movement across memory
units, which maximizes the capacity use of DRAM while ensuring efficient use of
the aggregate system resources. Newly proposed solutions use performance models
and machine intelligence to optimize which and how much data to move
dynamically; however, the decision of when to move this data is based on
empirical selection of time intervals, or left to the applications. Our
experimental evaluation shows that failure to properly configure the data
movement frequency can lead to 10%-100% slowdown for a given data movement
policy; yet, there is no established methodology on how to properly configure
this value for a given workload, platform and policy. We propose Cori, a
system-level tuning solution that identifies and extracts the necessary
application-level data reuse information, and guides the selection of data
movement frequency to deliver gains in application performance and system
resource efficiency. Experimental evaluation shows that Cori configures data
movement frequencies that provide application performance within 3% of the
optimal one, and that it can achieve this up to 5x more quickly than random or
brute-force approaches. System-level validation of Cori on a platform with DRAM
and Intel's Optane DC PMEM confirms its practicality and tuning efficiency.

in India with the second largest load of COVID-19 cases and a relatively
resource-scarce medical infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes essential to
triage the patients based on the severity of their disease and devote resources
towards critically ill patients. Yan et al. 1 have published a very pertinent
research that uses Machine learning (ML) methods to predict the outcome of
COVID-19 patients based on their clinical parameters at the day of admission.
They used the XGBoost algorithm, a type of ensemble model, to build the
mortality prediction model. The final classifier is built through the
sequential addition of multiple weak classifiers. The clinically operable
decision rule was obtained from a 'single-tree XGBoost' and used lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) values. This decision tree achieved a 100% survival prediction and 81%
mortality prediction. However, these models have several technical challenges
and do not provide an out of the box solution that can be deployed for other

phase of protoplanetary disks. X-rays emitted from the central young stellar
object (YSO) that irradiate interstellar ices in the disk, followed by the
ejection of molecules in the gas phase, are a possible route to explain the
abundances observed in the cold regions. This process, known as X-ray
photodesorption, needs to be quantified for methanol-containing ices. We aim at
experimentally measuring X-ray photodesorption yields of methanol and its
photo-products from binary mixed ices: $^{13}$CO:CH$_3$OH ice and
H$_2$O:CH$_3$OH ice. We irradiated these ices at 15 K with X-rays in the 525 -
570 eV range. The release of species in the gas phase was monitored by
quadrupole mass spectrometry, and photodesorption yields were derived. For
$^{13}$CO:CH$_3$OH ice, CH$_3$OH X-ray photodesorption yield is estimated to be
10$^{-2}$ molecule/photon at 564 eV. X-ray photodesorption of larger COMs,
which can be attributed to either ethanol, dimethyl ether, and/or formic acid,
is detected with a yield of 10$^{-3}$ molecule/photon. When methanol is mixed
with water, X-ray photodesorption of methanol and of the previous COMs is not
detected. X-ray induced chemistry, dominated by low-energy secondary electrons,
is found to be the main mechanism that explains these results. We also provide
desorption yields that are applicable to protoplanetary disk environments for
astrochemical models. The X-ray emission from YSOs should participate in the
enrichment of the protoplanetary disk gas phase with COMs such as methanol in
the cold and X-ray dominated regions because of X-ray photodesorption from
methanol-containing ices.

themselves from scratch in an online fashion, without resorting to a hand

training is used to orchestrate this self-training. Although the randomly
initialized optimizers initially make slow progress, as they improve they
experience a positive feedback loop, and become rapidly more effective at

using advanced techniques in the field of machine learning. The objective is to
regulate control signals to adjust the desired internal room setpoint
temperature, affected indirectly by the external weather states. The
methodology involves developing a time-series machine learning model with
either a Long Short Term Memory model (LSTM) or a Gradient Boosting Algorithm
(XGboost), capable of forecasting this weather states for any desired time
horizon and concurrently optimising the control signals to the desired set
point. The supervised learning model for mapping the weather states together
with the control signals to the room temperature is constructed using a
previously developed methodology called Cluster Classify regress (CCR), which
is similar in style but scales better to high dimensional dataset than the
well-known Mixture-of-Experts. The overall method called CCR-MPC involves a
combination of a time series model for weather states prediction, CCR for
forwarding and any numerical optimisation method for solving the inverse
problem. Forward uncertainty quantification (Forward-UQ) leans towards the
regression model in the CCR and is attainable using a Bayesian deep neural
network or a Gaussian process (GP). For this work, in the CCR modulation, we
employ K-means clustering for Clustering, XGboost classifier for Classification
and 5th order polynomial regression for Regression. Inverse UQ can also be
obtained by using an I-ES approach for solving the inverse problem or even the
well-known Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The developed CCR-MPC is
elegant, and as seen on the numerical experiments is able to optimise the
controller to attain the desired setpoint temperature.

Traditional ways to improve storage technologies are to reduce their costs;
however, the cheapest energy storage is not always the most valuable in energy
systems. Modern techno-economical evaluation methods try to address the cost
and value situation but do not judge the competitiveness of multiple
technologies simultaneously. This paper introduces the market potential method
as a new complementary valuation method guiding innovation of multiple energy
storage. The market potential method derives the value of technologies by
examining common deployment signals from energy system model outputs in a
structured way. We apply and compare this method to cost evaluation approaches
in a renewables-based European power system model, covering diverse energy
storage technologies. We find that characteristics of high-cost hydrogen
storage can be more valuable than low-cost hydrogen storage. Additionally, we
show that modifying the freedom of storage sizing and component interactions
can make the energy system 10% cheaper and impact the value of technologies.
The results suggest looking beyond the pure cost reduction paradigm and focus
on developing technologies with suitable value approaches that can lead to
cheaper electricity systems in future.

configuration. Several examples are used to demonstrate the newly proposed
model and method.

  Description Generation","The 2nd Workshop on NLG for HRI colocated with The 13th International
  Conference on Natural Language Generation",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Socially competent robots should be equipped with the ability to perceive the
world that surrounds them and communicate about it in a human-like manner.
Representative skills that exhibit such ability include generating image
descriptions and visually grounded referring expressions. In the NLG community,
these generation tasks are largely investigated in non-interactive and
language-only settings. However, in face-to-face interaction, humans often
deploy multiple modalities to communicate, forming seamless integration of
natural language, hand gestures and other modalities like sketches. To enable
robots to describe what they perceive with speech and sketches/gestures, we
propose to model the task of generating natural language together with
free-hand sketches/hand gestures to describe visual scenes and real life
objects, namely, visually-grounded multimodal description generation. In this
paper, we discuss the challenges and evaluation metrics of the task, and how
the task can benefit from progress recently made in the natural language
processing and computer vision realms, where related topics such as visually
grounded NLG, distributional semantics, and photo-based sketch generation have
been extensively studied.

  operation of Turing reaction model",,"PLOS ONE. August 11, 2021","10.1371/journal.pone.0256025",,"q-bio.QM cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many cephalopods such as octopus and squid change their skin color
purposefully within a very short time. Furthermore, it is widely known that
some octopuses have the ability to change the color and unevenness of the skin
and to mimic the surroundings in short time. However, much research has not
been done on the entire mimicry mechanism in which the octopus recognizes the
surrounding landscape and changes the skin pattern. It seems that there is no
hypothetical model to explain the whole mimicry mechanism yet. In this study,
the mechanism of octopus skin pattern formation was assumed to be based on the
Turing model. Here, the pattern formation by the Turing model was realized by
the equivalent filter calculation model using the cellular automaton, instead
of directly solving the differential equations. It was shown that this model
can create various patterns with two feature parameters. Furthermore, for the
eyes recognition part where two features are extracted from the Turing pattern
image, our study proposed a method that can be calculated back with small
amount of calculation using the characteristics of the cellular Turing pattern
model. These two calculations can be expressed in the same mathematical frame
based on the cellular automaton model using the convolution filter. As a
result, it can be created a model which is capable of extracting features from
patterns and reconstructing patterns in a short time, the model is considered
to be a basic model for considering the mimicry mechanism of octopus. Also, in
terms of application to machine learning, it is considered that it shows the
possibility of leading to a model with a small amount of learning calculation.

magnetized neutral vector boson gas at any temperature, with the aim to provide
equations of state that allow more general and precise descriptions of
astrophysical phenomena. The all temperature analytical expressions for the
thermodynamic magnitudes, as well as their non relativistic limits, are
obtained starting from the energy spectrum given by Proca's theory. With these
expressions, and considering the system under astrophysical conditions
(particle densities, temperatures and magnetic fields in the order of the
estimated for Neutron Stars), we investigate the Bose Einstein condensation,
the magnetic properties and the equations of state of the gas, making a special
emphasis on the influence of antiparticles and magnetic field. In all cases,
the results are compared with their analogues in the low temperature and the
non relativistic limits. This allows us to establish the ranges of validity of
these approximations and to achieve a better understanding of their effects on
the studied system.

a pure Nb metal, doped magnetically by long-lived Mossbauer 93mNb gamas. A giga
fine-structure constant NI*alpha characterizes various properties of the
soliton, in which NI ~ 3 * 10^10 is the instanton number. A hierarchy of
photonic solitons is classified into six flavours, i.e., three generations in
each of two homotopy classes. The underdoped metallic heterostructure contains
two topologically distinct sectors. When the gama-dopant filling factor > 0.88,
the nontrivial sector becomes a chiral superfluid at T >> 300 K to provide a
gama-clock Q-factor > 10^27 for some decades, while the trivial sector becomes
a superconductor below 9.3 K. Distinct soliton flavours carrying Kopnin masses
> 14 PeV, Majorana mass < 36 aeV, and nuclear B > 35000 T imply a range of
possible applications, e.g., topological quantum computation and the detection
of invisible particles.
