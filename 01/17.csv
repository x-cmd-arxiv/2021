mutual interaction in mixed neutrino system. We show that with trapped ions one

mainly designed by describing the neighborhood of each node as a perceptual
whole, while the implicit semantic associations behind highly complex
interactions of graphs are largely unexploited. In this paper, we propose a
Semantic Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCN) that explores the implicit
semantics by learning latent semantic-paths in graphs. In previous work, there
are explorations of graph semantics via meta-paths. However, these methods
mainly rely on explicit heterogeneous information that is hard to be obtained
in a large amount of graph-structured data. SGCN first breaks through this
restriction via leveraging the semantic-paths dynamically and automatically
during the node aggregating process. To evaluate our idea, we conduct
sufficient experiments on several standard datasets, and the empirical results
show the superior performance of our model.

Venturini studied the effect of various fill patterns by calculating the charge

assumed that the only collective force was from the beam loading (wake field)
of the harmonic cavity in its lowest mode. The present paper improves the
notation and organization of the equations so as to allow an easy inclusion of
multiple resonator wake fields. This allows one to study the effects of beam
loading of the main accelerating cavity, higher order modes of the cavities,
and short range geometric wakes represented by low-$Q$ resonators. As an
example these effects are explored for ALS-U. The compensation of the induced
voltage in the main cavity, achieved in practice by a feedback system, is
modeled by adjustment of the generator voltage through a new iterative scheme.
Except in the case of a complete fill, the compensated main cavity beam loading
has a substantial effect on the bunch profiles and the Touschek lifetimes. A

velocity of tropical cyclones from environmental parameters. At the point of
maximum wind, E-PI's key equation relates proportionally the centrifugal
acceleration (squared maximum velocity divided by radius) to the radial
gradient of saturated moist entropy. The proportionality coefficient depends on
the outflow temperature. Here it is shown that a different relationship between
the same quantities derives straightforwardly from the gradient-wind balance
and the definition of entropy, with the proportionality coefficient depending
on the radial gradient of local air temperature. The robust alternative reveals
a previously unexplored constraint: for E-PI to be valid, the outflow
temperature should be a function of the radial temperature gradient at the
point of maximum wind. When the air is horizontally isothermal (which, as we
argue, is not an uncommon condition), this constraint cannot be satisfied, and
E-PI's key equation underestimates the squared maximum velocity by
approximately twofold. This explains ""superintensity"" (maximum wind speeds
exceeding E-PI). The new formulation predicts less superintensity at higher
temperatures, corroborating recent numerical simulations. Previous analyses are
re-evaluated to reveal inconsistent support for the explanation of
superintensity by supergradient winds alone. In Hurricane Isabel 2003, maximum
superintensity is found to be associated with minimal gradient-wind imbalance.
Modified to diagnostically account for supergradient winds, the new formulation
shows that air temperature increasing towards the storm center can mask the
effect of gradient-wind imbalance, thus reducing ""superintensity"" and formally
bringing E-PI closer to observations. The implications of these findings for
assessing real storms are discussed.

objective is to carry out a stable user-IRS matching, such that the sum rate of
the system is improved. The first stage of the proposed algorithm employs a
well-known Gale Shapley matching designed for the stable marriage problem.
However, due to interference in multiuser systems, the matching obtained after
the first stage may not be stable. To overcome this issue, one-sided (i.e.,
only IRSs) blocking pairs (BPs) are identified in the second stage of the
proposed algorithm, where the BP is a pair of IRSs which are better off after
exchanging their partners. Thus, the second stage validates the stable matching
in the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed assignment
achieves better sum rate performance compared to distance-based and random

we present a framework based on statistical physics to study dynamics of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that drives learning in neural networks. By
using the minibatch gradient ensemble, we construct order parameters to
characterize dynamics of weight updates in SGD. Without mislabeled data, we
find that the SGD learning dynamics transitions from a fast learning phase to a
slow exploration phase, which is associated with large changes in order
parameters that characterize the alignment of SGD gradients and their mean
amplitude. In the case with randomly mislabeled samples, SGD learning dynamics
falls into four distinct phases. The system first finds solutions for the
correctly labeled samples in phase I, it then wanders around these solutions in
phase II until it finds a direction to learn the mislabeled samples during
phase III, after which it finds solutions that satisfy all training samples
during phase IV. Correspondingly, the test error decreases during phase I and
remains low during phase II; however, it increases during phase III and reaches
a high plateau during phase IV. The transitions between different phases can be
understood by changes of order parameters that characterize the alignment of
mean gradients for the correctly and incorrectly labeled samples and their
(relative) strength during learning. We find that individual sample losses for
the two datasets are most separated during phase II, which leads to a cleaning
process to eliminate mislabeled samples for improving generalization.

systems and inverter-dominated microgrids (MGs), in which frequency dynamics
constraints are developed to optimize the amount of load restoration and
guarantee the dynamic performance of system frequency response during the
restoration process. After extreme events, the damaged distribution systems can
be sectionalized into several isolated MGs to restore critical loads and
tripped non-black start distributed generations (DGs) by black start DGs.
However, the high penetration of inverter-based DGs reduces the system inertia,
which results in low-inertia issues and large frequency fluctuation during the
restoration process. To address this challenge, we propose a two-level
simulation-assisted sequential service restoration model, which includes a
mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based optimization model and a
transient simulation model. The proposed MILP model explicitly incorporates the
frequency response into constraints, by interfacing with transient simulation
of inverter-dominated MGs. Numerical results on a modified IEEE 123-bus system
have validated that the frequency dynamic performance of the proposed service
restoration model are indeed improved.

correspond to certain parameters (i.e., slots) of a user request/query. Slot
filling is one of the most important challenges in modern task-oriented dialog
systems. Supervised learning approaches have proven effective at tackling this
challenge, but they need a significant amount of labeled training data in a
given domain. However, new domains (i.e., unseen in training) may emerge after
deployment. Thus, it is imperative that these models seamlessly adapt and fill
slots from both seen and unseen domains -- unseen domains contain unseen slot
types with no training data, and even seen slots in unseen domains are
typically presented in different contexts. This setting is commonly referred to
as zero-shot slot filling. Little work has focused on this setting, with
limited experimental evaluation. Existing models that mainly rely on
context-independent embedding-based similarity measures fail to detect slot
values in unseen domains or do so only partially. We propose a new zero-shot
slot filling neural model, LEONA, which works in three steps. Step one acquires
domain-oblivious, context-aware representations of the utterance word by
exploiting (a) linguistic features; (b) named entity recognition cues; (c)
contextual embeddings from pre-trained language models. Step two fine-tunes
these rich representations and produces slot-independent tags for each word.
Step three exploits generalizable context-aware utterance-slot similarity
features at the word level, uses slot-independent tags, and contextualizes them
to produce slot-specific predictions for each word. Our thorough evaluation on
four diverse public datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently
outperforms the SOTA models by 17.52%, 22.15%, 17.42%, and 17.95% on average

model with on-site repulsion, the Bloch equations for a wave-number-dependent
pseudospin -- whose components describe the charge-density difference, current
density, and bond density between the two sublattices -- involve an
alternatingly tilted pseudomagnetic field, which assists the synchronization of
pseudospins with different wave numbers, irrespective of the initial condition.
This fact is numerically confirmed by the dynamics in finite lattices based on
the exact diagonalization method. In the presence of nearest-neighbor
repulsion, however, the synchronization can be hindered by excitons. Therefore,
the excitation of a sufficiently large density of free electron-hole pairs, but
low density of excitons, is needed to achieve synchronization.

  Learning Techniques",,,,,"eess.SP cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Earthquake signals are non-stationary in nature and thus in real-time, it is
difficult to identify and classify events based on classical approaches like
peak ground displacement, peak ground velocity. Even the popular algorithm of
STA/LTA requires extensive research to determine basic thresholding parameters
so as to trigger an alarm. Also, many times due to human error or other
unavoidable natural factors such as thunder strikes or landslides, the
algorithm may end up raising a false alarm. This work focuses on detecting
earthquakes by converting seismograph recorded data into corresponding audio
signals for better perception and then uses popular Speech Recognition
techniques of Filter bank coefficients and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCC) to extract the features. These features were then used to train a
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network.
The proposed method can overcome the above-mentioned problems and help in
detecting earthquakes automatically from the waveforms without much human
intervention. For the 1000Hz audio data set the CNN model showed a testing
accuracy of 91.1% for 0.2-second sample window length while the LSTM model
showed 93.99% for the same. A total of 610 sounds consisting of 310 earthquake
sounds and 300 non-earthquake sounds were used to train the models. While
testing, the total time required for generating the alarm was approximately 2
seconds which included individual times for data collection, processing, and
prediction taking into consideration the processing and prediction delays. This
shows the effectiveness of the proposed method for Earthquake Early Warning
(EEW) applications. Since the input of the method is only the waveform, it is
suitable for real-time processing, thus the models can also be used as an
onsite EEW system requiring a minimum amount of preparation time and workload.

communication (DSRC) is a distributed communication system, in which all the
nodes share the wireless channel with carrier sense multiple access/collision
avoid (CSMA/CA) protocol. However, the competition and backoff mechanisms of
CSMA/CA often bring additional delays and data packet collisions, which may
hardly meet the QoS requirements in terms of delay and packets delivery ratio
(PDR). Moreover, because of the distribution nature of security information in
broadcast mode, the sender cannot know whether the receivers have received the
information successfully. Similarly, this problem also exists in no-acknowledge
(non-ACK) transmissions of VANET. Therefore, the probability of packet
collisions should be considered in broadcast or non-ACK working modes. This
paper presents a connection-level scheduling algorithm overlaid on CSMA/CA to
schedule the start sending time of each transmission. By converting the object
of reducing collision probability to minimizing the overlap of transmission
durations of connections, the probability of backoff-activation can be greatly
decreased. Then the delay and the probability of packet collisions can also be
decreased. Numerical simulations have been conducted in our unified platform

image memes that are highly viral on social media from those that do not get

Drawing from research in art theory, psychology, marketing, and neuroscience,
we develop a codebook to characterize image memes, and use it to annotate a set
of 100 image memes collected from 4chan's Politically Incorrect Board (/pol/).
On the one hand, we find that highly viral memes are more likely to use a
close-up scale, contain characters, and include positive or negative emotions.
On the other hand, image memes that do not present a clear subject the viewer
can focus attention on, or that include long text are not likely to be
re-shared by users.
  We train machine learning models to distinguish between image memes that are
likely to go viral and those that are unlikely to be re-shared, obtaining an
AUC of 0.866 on our dataset. We also show that the indicators of virality
identified by our model can help characterize the most viral memes posted on
mainstream online social networks too, as our classifiers are able to predict

from the formation of conductive channels along the grain boundaries. It is
proposed that point defects (most likely Ga interstitials) and structural
disorder at the grain boundaries provide the ideal environment to enable the
filamentary switching process. Next, we explored if such defects can give rise
to mid-gap states, and if so could they be activated by photonic excitation.
Both first-principles calculations as well as UV-vis and photoluminescence
spectroscopy strongly point to the possibility of mid-gap electronic states in
the polycrystalline GaP film. Photoconductive atomic force microscopy (phAFM),
a scanning probe technique, is used to image photocurrents generated as a
function of incident photon energy (ranging from sub band-gap to above
band-gap) on the GaP film surface. We observe photocurrents even for incident
photon energies lower than the band-gap, consistent with the presence of
mid-gap electronic states. Moreover the photocurrent magnitude is found to be
directly proportional to the incident photon energy with a concomitant decrease
in the filament resistance. This demonstrates GaP directly integrated on Si can
be a promising photonic resistive switching materials system.

It is unfeasible to physically conduct a V2X communication experiment to test
the performance of C-V2X by arranging hundreds of real vehicles and their
transceiving on-board units. Although multiple simulators based on frameworks

the current state of the art and shown to improve performance in the solution
of numerical PDEs. A variety of other benchmarks and use cases for the GPU
methodologies are presented using the Cahn--Hilliard equation as a core
example, but it is emphasised the methods are completely general. Finally
through the application of the GPU methodologies to the Cahn--Hilliard equation
new results are presented on the growth rates of the coarsened domains. In
particular a statistical model is built up using batches of simulations run on
GPUs from which the growth rates are extracted, it is shown that in a finite
domain that the traditionally presented results of 1/3 scaling is in fact a
distribution around this value. This result is discussed in conjunction with
modelling via a stochastic PDE and sheds new light on the behaviour of the
Cahn--Hilliard equation in finite domains.

with stronger relationships, with distinct and overlapping properties.
Community detection is crucial for various reasons, such as serving as a
functional unit of a network that captures local interactions among nodes.
Communities come in various forms and types, ranging from biologically to
technology-induced ones. As technology-induced communities, social media
networks such as Twitter and Facebook connect a myriad of diverse users,
leading to a highly connected and dynamic ecosystem. Although many algorithms
have been proposed for detecting socially cohesive communities on Twitter,
mining and related tasks remain challenging. This study presents a novel
detection method based on a scalable framework to identify related communities
in a network. We propose a multilevel clustering technique (MCT) that leverages
structural and textual information to identify local communities termed
microcosms. Experimental evaluation on benchmark models and datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. This study contributes a new
dimension for the detection of cohesive communities in social networks. The
approach offers a better understanding and clarity toward describing how
low-level communities evolve and behave on Twitter. From an application point
of view, identifying such communities can better inform recommendation, among
other benefits.

gradient method for minimizing a smooth convex function $f$ can be thought of
as the time discretization of a second-order ODE, and that $f(x(t))$ converges
to its optimal value at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/t^2)$ along any trajectory
$x(t)$ of this ODE. A variational formulation was introduced in Wibisono et al.
(2016) which allowed for accelerated convergence at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/t^p)$, for arbitrary $p>0$, in normed vector spaces. This
framework was exploited in Duruisseaux et al. (2021) to design efficient
explicit algorithms for symplectic accelerated optimization. In Alimisis et al.
(2020), a second-order ODE was proposed as the continuous-time limit of a
Riemannian accelerated algorithm, and it was shown that the objective function
$f(x(t))$ converges to its optimal value at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/t^2)$
along solutions of this ODE. In this paper, we show that on Riemannian
manifolds, the convergence rate of $f(x(t))$ to its optimal value can also be
accelerated to an arbitrary convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(1/t^p)$, by
considering a family of time-dependent Bregman Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
systems on Riemannian manifolds. This generalizes the results of Wibisono et
al. (2016) to Riemannian manifolds and also provides a variational framework
for accelerated optimization on Riemannian manifolds. An approach based on the
time-invariance property of the family of Bregman Lagrangians and Hamiltonians
was used to construct very efficient optimization algorithms in Duruisseaux et
al. (2021), and we establish a similar time-invariance property in the
Riemannian setting. One expects that a geometric numerical integrator that is
time-adaptive, symplectic, and Riemannian manifold preserving will yield a
class of promising optimization algorithms on manifolds.

semantic information combined with object-level geometric constraints to
quickly detect the static parts of the scene. Then, we perform a two-step
coarse-to-fine ego-motion tracking with reference to the static parts. This
leads to a novel dynamic visual SLAM formation. We test our proposals through a

by showing that this class of operators forms an open subset of

Neutron Source (CSNS) that emit through the incoming proton channel were
exploited to build a white neutron beam facility (the so-called Back-n white
neutron source), which was completed in March 2018. The Back-n neutron beam is
very intense, at approximately 2*10^7 n/cm^2/s at 55 m from the target, and has
a nominal proton beam with a power of 100 kW in the CSNS-I phase and a kinetic
energy of 1.6 GeV and a thick tungsten target in multiple slices with modest
moderation from the cooling water through the slices. In addition, the
excellent energy spectrum spanning from 0.5 eV to 200 MeV, and a good time
resolution related to the time-of-flight measurements make it a typical white
neutron source for nuclear data measurements; its overall performance is among
that of the best white neutron sources in the world. Equipped with advanced
spectrometers, detectors, and application utilities, the Back-n facility can
serve wide applications, with a focus on neutron-induced cross-section
measurements. This article presents an overview of the neutron beam
characteristics, the experimental setups, and the ongoing applications at
Back-n.

In parallel, data-driven algorithms for learning interpretable continuum models
have shown promising potential for the recovery of underlying partial

learning macroscopic hydrodynamic equations for active matter directly from

a framework that leverages spectral basis representations and sparse regression

our scheme learns hydrodynamic equations that reproduce quantitatively the

different numbers of excess atoms have not been previously studied. We apply a
general Burgers circuit analysis to calculate the Burgers vectors b of
junctions in two {\Sigma}5 Cu boundaries previously simulated with molecular
dynamics. The Burgers vectors of these junctions cannot be described by the
displacement shift complete (DSC) lattice alone. We show that, in general, the
normal component of b is not equal to the difference in the GB excess volumes,
but contains another contribution from the numbers of GB atoms per unit area
{\Delta}N required to transform one GB phase into another. In the boundaries
studied, the latter component dominates and even changes the sign of b. We
derive expressions for the normal and tangential components of b in terms of
the DSC lattice vectors and the non-DSC part due to {\Delta}N and additional GB
excess properties, including excess volume and shears. These expressions
provide a connection between GB phase transformations driven by the GB free
energy difference and the motion of GB junctions under applied normal and shear

calculate the elastic part of the energy of these defects, evaluate their
contribution to the nucleation barrier during GB phase transformations, and

spacing of about ~8-9 meV. We experimentally confirm this proposal by utilizing
gate tuning and measuring QHO states using an aluminum single-electron
transistor (SET). A sharp and fast oscillation with period of ~7-8 mV appears
in addition to the regular Coulomb blockade (CB) oscillation with much larger
period, for positive gate biases above 0.5 V. The observation of fast
oscillation and its behavior is quantitatively consistent with our theoretical
result, manifesting the harmonic motion of electrons from the QHO. Our results

galactic nucleus unification models, have found heterogeneous results. These
models typically consist of a central engine surrounded by a torus of discrete
dusty clouds. These clouds would absorb and scatter optical emission, blocking
broad nuclear emission lines, and reradiate in mid-infrared. Some scattered
broad-line emission may be observable, depending on geometry, which would be
polarized. We present a wide-band infrared spectroscopic analysis of 10 nearby
FR I radio galaxies to determine whether there is significant emission from a

decompose Spitzer/IRS spectra of our sample. We constrained the wide-band

approaches bifurcate into two main categories, model-driven approaches and

highly relies on existing physical traffic flow models, such as
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) models, which may only capture limited
dynamics of real-world traffic, resulting in low-quality estimation, while the
latter requires massive data in order to perform accurate and generalizable

physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) framework to efficiently conduct
high-quality TSE with small amounts of observed data. PIDL contains both
model-driven and data-driven components, making possible the integration of the
strong points of both approaches while overcoming the shortcomings of either.
This paper focuses on highway TSE with observed data from loop detectors, using

solve (with data from loop detectors) two popular physical traffic flow models,

(particularly in 4D space-time dimensions) thanks to deep learning methods.
However, they typically rely on large amounts of high-quality labels to achieve
good performance, which often require time-consuming and expensive work by
human annotators. To address this we propose an automatic annotation pipeline
that generates accurate object trajectories in 3D space (i.e., 4D labels) from
LiDAR point clouds. The key idea is to decompose the 4D object label into two
parts: the object size in 3D that's fixed through time for rigid objects, and
the motion path describing the evolution of the object's pose through time.
Instead of generating a series of labels in one shot, we adopt an iterative
refinement process where online generated object detections are tracked through
time as the initialization. Given the cheap but noisy input, our model produces
higher quality 4D labels by re-estimating the object size and smoothing the
motion path, where the improvement is achieved by exploiting aggregated
observations and motion cues over the entire trajectory. We validate the
proposed method on a large-scale driving dataset and show a 25% reduction of
human annotation efforts. We also showcase the benefits of our approach in the
annotator-in-the-loop setting.

  Interactions: Synoptic-Scale Patterns and Long-Term Trends",,,,,"physics.geo-ph physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is well known that rapid changes in tropical cyclone motion occur during
interaction with extratropical waves. While the translation speed has received
much attention in the published literature, acceleration has not. Using a large
data sample of Atlantic tropical cyclones, we formally examine the composite
synoptic-scale patterns associated with tangential and \curvature components of
their acceleration. During periods of rapid tangential acceleration, the
composite tropical cyclone moves poleward between an upstream trough and
downstream ridge of a developing extratropical wavepacket. The two systems
subsequently merge in a manner that is consistent with extratropical
transition. During rapid curvature acceleration, a prominent downstream ridge
promotes recurvature of the tropical cyclone. In contrast, during rapid
tangential or curvature deceleration, a ridge is located directly poleward of
the tropical cyclone. Locally, this arrangement takes the form of a
cyclone-anticyclone vortex pair somewhat akin to a dipole block. On average,
the tangential acceleration peaks 18 hours prior to extratropical transition
while the curvature acceleration peaks at recurvature. These findings confirm
that rapid acceleration of tropical cyclones is mediated by interaction with
extratropical baroclinic waves. Furthermore, The tails of the distribution of
acceleration and translation speed show a robust reduction over the past 5
decades. We speculate that these trends may reflect the poleward shift and
weakening of extratropical Rossby waves.

Under this setting, standard algorithms are cost-inefficient as they evaluate
on the validation set at every round. In contrast, the cost-efficient GP-UCB
algorithm proposed in this paper queries the unknown function only when the
model is less confident about current decisions. We evaluate our proposed

tackle this problem in two steps: first depth estimation from stereo images is

a 3D object detector. However, this approach is suboptimal due to the

with wormlike micellar solutions in the creeping ow regime. The two-species VCM
(Vasquez-Cook- McKinley) and single-species Giesekus constitutive models are
used to characterize the rheological behaviour of micellar solutions. Once the
Weissenberg number exceeds a critical value, an unsteady motion downstream of
the sphere is observed in the case of two-species model. We provide the
evidence that this unsteady motion downstream of the sphere is caused due to
the sudden rupture of long and stretched micelles in this region, resulting
from an increase in the extensional ow strength. The corresponding
single-species Giesekus model for the wormlike micellar solution, with no
breakage and reformation, predicts a steady ow field under otherwise identical
conditions. Therefore, it further ascertains the evidence presented herein for
the onset of this unsteady motion. Furthermore, we find that the onset of this
unsteady motion downstream of the sphere is delayed as the sphere to tube
diameter ratio decreases. A similar kind of unsteady motion has also been
observed in earlier several experiments for the problem of a sphere sedimenting
in a tube filled wormlike micellar solutions. We find a remarkable qualitative
similarity in the ow characteristics between the present numerical results on

setting that we investigate are: (i) guaranteeing correspondence and
segmentation consistency across multiple input point clouds capturing different
spatial arrangements of bodies or body parts; and (ii) obtaining robust
motion-based rigid body segmentation applicable to novel object categories. We
propose an approach to address these issues that incorporates spectral
synchronization into an iterative deep declarative network, so as to
simultaneously recover consistent correspondences as well as motion
segmentation. At the same time, by explicitly disentangling the correspondence
and motion segmentation estimation modules, we achieve strong generalizability
across different object categories. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our method is effective on various datasets ranging from rigid parts in
articulated objects to individually moving objects in a 3D scene, be it
single-view or full point clouds.

suggest that the measured background with PolarLight is dominated by high
energy electrons, with a minor contribution from protons and the CXB. The
simulation reveals that, in the energy range of 2-8 keV, there are roughly 28%
of the background events are caused by energy deposit from a secondary electron
with an energy of a few keV, in a physical process identical to the detection
of X-rays. Thus, this fraction of background cannot be discriminated from X-ray
events. The background distribution is uneven on the detector plane, with an
enhancement near the edges. The edge effect is because high energy electrons
tend to produce long tracks, which are discarded by the readout electronics
unless they have partial energy deposits near the edges. The internal
background rate is expected to be around 6 x 10^-3 counts/s/cm2 in 2-8 keV if
an effective particle discrimination algorithm can be applied. This indicates
that the internal background should be negligible for future focusing X-ray
polarimeters with a focal size in the order of mm.

of large neural networks. To achieve a good trade-off between model size and
performance, popular pruning techniques usually rely on hand-crafted heuristics
and require manually setting the compression ratio for each layer. This process
is typically time-consuming and requires expert knowledge to achieve good
results. In this paper, we propose NAP, a unified and automatic pruning
framework for both fine-grained and structured pruning. It can find out
unimportant components of a network and automatically decide appropriate
compression ratios for different layers, based on a theoretically sound
criterion. Towards this goal, NAP uses an efficient approximation of the
Hessian for evaluating the importances of components, based on a
Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature method. Despite its simpleness to use,
NAP outperforms previous pruning methods by large margins. For fine-grained
pruning, NAP can compress AlexNet and VGG16 by 25x, and ResNet-50 by 6.7x
without loss in accuracy on ImageNet. For structured pruning (e.g. channel
pruning), it can reduce flops of VGG16 by 5.4x and ResNet-50 by 2.3x with only
1% accuracy drop. More importantly, this method is almost free from
hyper-parameter tuning and requires no expert knowledge. You can start NAP and

sciences. This framework turns the traditional view of perception upside down,
claiming that the main flow of information processing is realized in a top-down
hierarchical manner. Furthermore, it aims at unifying perception, cognition,
and action as a single inferential process. However, in the related literature,
the predictive processing framework and its associated schemes such as
predictive coding, active inference, perceptual inference, free-energy
principle, tend to be used interchangeably.
  In the field of cognitive robotics there is no clear-cut distinction on which
schemes have been implemented and under which assumptions. In this paper,
working definitions are set with the main aim of analyzing the state of the art
in cognitive robotics research working under the predictive processing
framework as well as some related non-robotic models.
  The analysis suggests that, first, both research in cognitive robotics
implementations and non-robotic models needs to be extended to the study of how
multiple exteroceptive modalities can be integrated into prediction error
minimization schemes. Second, a relevant distinction found here is that
cognitive robotics implementations tend to emphasize the learning of a
generative model, while in non-robotics models it is almost absent. Third,
despite the relevance for active inference, few cognitive robotics
implementations examine the issues around control and whether it should result
from the substitution of inverse models with proprioceptive predictions.
  Finally, limited attention has been placed on precision weighting and the
tracking of prediction error dynamics. These mechanisms should help to explore
more complex behaviors and tasks in cognitive robotics research under the
predictive processing framework.

When interventions are available, we provide guarantees on identifiability and
learnability under mild assumptions. We assume a linear structural equation

planets significantly. To explore the influence of dynamical history on planet
formation and evolution from observations, we assume that stars who experienced
significantly different dynamical histories tend to have different relative
velocities. Utilizing the accurate Gaia-Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog, we
select single main-sequence stars and divide these stars into three groups
according to their relative velocities, i.e. high-V, medium-V, and low-V stars.
After considering the known biases from Kepler data and adopting prior and
posterior correction to minimize the influence of stellar properties on planet
occurrence rate, we find that high-V stars have a lower occurrence rate of
super-Earths and sub-Neptunes (1--4 R$_{\rm \oplus}$, P<100 days) and higher
occurrence rate of sub-Earth (0.5--1 R$_{ \oplus}$, P<30 days) than low-V
stars. Additionally, high-V stars have a lower occurrence rate of hot Jupiter
sized planets (4--20 R$_{\oplus}$, P<10 days) and a slightly higher occurrence
rate of warm or cold Jupiter sized planets (4--20 R$_{\oplus}$, 10<P<400 days).
After investigating the multiplicity and eccentricity, we find that high-V
planet hosts prefer a higher fraction of multi-planets systems and lower
average eccentricity, which is consistent with the eccentricity-multiplicity
dichotomy of Kepler planetary systems. All these statistical results favor the
scenario that the high-V stars with large relative velocity may experience
fewer gravitational events, while the low-V stars may be influenced by stellar
clustering significantly.

transient is simultaneously observed in all the UV and EUV channels of AIA and
the three slit-jaw images from IRIS. The co-existence of the transient in all
AIA and IRIS SJI channels suggests the transient's multi-thermal nature. The
transient consists of short loops located at the base of the transient as well
as longe loops. A differential emission measure (DEM) analysis shows that the
transient has a clumpy structure. The highest emission observed at the base is
within the temperature bin of $\log\, T = 6.65 - 6.95$. We observe the longer

conclude that the magnetic reconnection may have caused the transient. Our

its quenched neutron triplet superfluidity of nuclear matter in viscosity and
hence in the gravitational-wave-driven $r$-mode instability of neutron stars

especially the superfluid effect at low temperatures which is also able to
reduce the inferred core temperature of NSs. Intriguingly, due to the neutron

this paper, we study a coronal jet related to a C3.4 circular-ribbon flare in
active region 12434 on 2015 October 16. Two minifilaments were located under a
3D fan-spine structure before flare. The flare was generated by the eruption of
one filament. The kinetic evolution of the jet was divided into two phases: a
slow rise phase at a speed of $\sim$131 km s$^{-1}$ and a fast rise phase at a
speed of $\sim$363 km s$^{-1}$ in the plane-of-sky. The slow rise phase may
correspond to the impulsive reconnection at the breakout current sheet. The
fast rise phase may correspond to magnetic reconnection at the flare current
sheet. The transition between the two phases occurred at $\sim$09:00:40 UT. The
blueshifted Doppler velocities of the jet in the Si {\sc iv} 1402.80 {\AA} line
range from -34 to -120 km s$^{-1}$. The accelerated high-energy electrons are
composed of three groups. Those propagating upward along open field generate
type \textrm{III} radio bursts, while those propagating downward produce HXR
emissions and drive chromospheric condensation observed in the Si {\sc iv}
line. The electrons trapped in the rising filament generate a microwave burst
lasting for $\le$40 s. Bidirectional outflows at the base of jet are manifested
by significant line broadenings of the Si {\sc iv} line. The blueshifted
Doppler velocities of outflows range from -13 to -101 km s$^{-1}$. The
redshifted Doppler velocities of outflows range from $\sim$17 to $\sim$170 km

improving the gravitational search algorithm's performance. In order to
increase the efficiency of the gravitational search algorithm in solving large

  concentrations in shallow wells of Bangladesh from laboratory and field data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millions of people in Bangladesh drink well water contaminated with arsenic.
Despite the severity of this heath crisis, little is known about the extent to
which groundwater arsenic concentrations change over time: Are concentrations
generally rising, or is arsenic being flushed out of aquifers? Are spatially
patterns of high and low concentrations across wells homogenizing over time, or
are these spatial gradients becoming more pronounced? To address these
questions, we analyze a large set of arsenic concentrations that were sampled
within a 25 km$^2$ area of Bangladesh over time. We compare two blanket survey
collected in 2000/2001 and 2012/2013 from the same villages but relying on a
largely different set of wells. The early set consists of 4574 accurate
laboratory measurements, but the later set poses a challenge for analysis
because it is composed of 8229 less accurate categorical measurements conducted
in the field with a kit. We construct a Bayesian model that jointly calibrates
the measurement errors, applies spatial smoothing, and describes the
spatiotemporal dynamic with a diffusion-like process model. Our statistical
analysis reveals that arsenic concentrations change over time and that their
mean dropped from 110 to 96 $\mu$g/L over 12 years, although one quarter of
individual wells are inferred to see an increase. The largest decreases
occurred at the wells with locally high concentrations where the estimated
Laplacian indicated that the arsenic surface was strongly concave. However,
well with initially low concentrations were unlikely to be contaminated by
nearby high concentration wells over a decade. We validate the model using a
posterior predictive check on an external subset of laboratory measurements
from the same 271 wells in the same study area available for 2000, 2014, and
2015.

propose a novel framework by exploiting the spatiotemporal attention to model
the subtle changes. Our model is named Coarse Temporal Attention Network
(CTA-Net), in which coarse temporal branches are introduced in a trainable
glimpse network. The goal is to allow the glimpse to capture high-level
temporal relationships, such as 'during', 'before' and 'after' by focusing on a
specific part of a video. These branches also respect the topology of the
temporal dynamics in the video, ensuring that different branches learn
meaningful spatial and temporal changes. The model then uses an innovative
attention mechanism to generate high-level action specific contextual

The attention mechanism helps in learning to decide the importance of each

The normalized (per site) density $n_s$ of clusters of size (mass) $s$ is

network nodes, e.g., routers and network management systems. However, sometimes
deployed networks do not have failure prediction built into their initial
design but subsequently need arises for such mechanisms. For such systems,
there are two key challenges. Firstly, statistics of failure distribution,

neural network training. However, existing publicly available datasets used in
facial landmark localization are usually much smaller than those for other
computer vision tasks. A small dataset without diverse and balanced training
samples cannot support the training of a deep network effectively. To address
the above issues, this paper presents a novel Separable Batch Normalization
(SepBN) module with a Cross-protocol Network Training (CNT) strategy for robust
facial landmark localization. Different from the standard BN layer that uses
all the training data to calculate a single set of parameters, SepBN considers
that the samples of a training dataset may belong to different sub-domains.
Accordingly, the proposed SepBN module uses multiple sets of parameters, each
corresponding to a specific sub-domain. However, the selection of an
appropriate branch in the inference stage remains a challenging task because
the sub-domain of a test sample is unknown. To mitigate this difficulty, we
propose a novel attention mechanism that assigns different weights to each
branch for automatic selection in an effective style. As a further innovation,
the proposed CNT strategy trains a network using multiple datasets having
different facial landmark annotation systems, boosting the performance and
enhancing the generalization capacity of the trained network. The experimental
results obtained on several well-known datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

revealed emission in the 1665 MHz line with an estimated total intensity of
$\sim 4$ Jy. We did not detect any emission from the 1667-MHz and 1720-MHz
lines.
  The full polarization mode of MERLIN enables us to investigate the magnetic
field in the OH maser region. Our results show that IRAS 06056+2131 is a highly
circularly polarized source. In this transition, a Zeeman pair is identified
from which a magnetic strength of $\sim -1.5$ mG is inferred. The orientation
of the linear polarization vectors suggests that the magnetic field lines at
the location of the OH maser emission \textbf{might be} in agreement with the
orientation of the outflow thought to be associated with this source. The star
forming evolutionary status of the embedded proto-stellar object is discussed.

a framework of multivariate utility optimization with general benchmark
variables, which include stochastic reference levels as typical examples. The
utility is state-dependent and the objective is no longer
distribution-invariant. We provide the optimal solution(s) and fully
investigate the issues of well-posedness, feasibility, finiteness and
attainability. The discussion does not require many classic conditions and
assumptions, e.g., the Lagrange multiplier always exists. Moreover, several
surprising phenomena and technical difficulties may appear: (i) non-uniqueness
of the optimal solutions, (ii) various reasons for non-existence of the
Lagrangian multiplier and corresponding results on the optimal solution, (iii)
measurability issues of the concavification of a multivariate utility and the
selection of the optimal solutions, and (iv) existence of an optimal solution
not decreasing with respect to the pricing kernel. These issues are thoroughly
addressed, rigorously proved, completely summarized and insightfully

neural networks. Existing methods are mainly evaluated on spare labeling
applications. However, dense labeling applications are those closer to real
world problems that require real-time processing on resource-constrained mobile
devices. Pruning for dense labeling applications is still a largely unexplored
field. The prevailing filter channel pruning method removes the entire filter
channel. Accordingly, the interaction between each kernel in one filter channel
is ignored.
  In this study, we proposed kernel cluster pruning (KCP) to prune dense
labeling networks. We developed a clustering technique to identify the least
representational kernels in each layer. By iteratively removing those kernels,
the parameter that can better represent the entire network is preserved; thus,
we achieve better accuracy with a decent model size and computation reduction.
When evaluated on stereo matching and semantic segmentation neural networks,
our method can reduce more than 70% of FLOPs with less than 1% of accuracy
drop. Moreover, for ResNet-50 on ILSVRC-2012, our KCP can reduce more than 50%
of FLOPs reduction with 0.13% Top-1 accuracy gain. Therefore, KCP achieves

5.5 eV, as well as the meta-stable change in absorption induced by ultraviolet
(UV) irradiation (photochromism), and the restoration of the initial state
under the action of irradiation of 2 - 4 eV or elevated temperatures. UV
irradiation results in a decrease of the absorption coefficient from 110
cm$^{-1}$ to 55 cm$^{-1}$ at 4.7 eV while in the visible range the absorption
coefficient increases from values below 5 cm$^{-1}$ to ~35 cm$^{-1}$.
Measurements with two linear polarizations, parallel and perpendicular to the
optical axis, provide determination of several different absorption bands at
2.6, 2.8, 3.4, 4.0, 4.5, and 4.8 eV. The bands at 2.6 eV and 3.4 eV identify
the defect levels near to the valence band, while the band peaking at 2.8 eV is
related to the conduction band. The photochromism allows controlling the
absorption of light in two related spectral ranges because the decrease of UV
absorption and increase of the visible absorption are related to switching the
charge state of the same defects.

in recognizing themselves and to profit from the rights and advantages given to

the traditional way of issuance f these identities and many hurdles that impede
people from getting their benefits or exercising their rights. These
paper-based identities can be forged easily and are hard to authenticate at
various civil end points. There are reports of identity thefts. In this paper,
we are discussing how Blockchain can be employed to overcome these problems and
makes these identities confidential, immutable, and secured. Blockchain
technology can help the governing bodies in maintaining and verifying these
identities in a quick manner with less chance for human errors, meaning more
reach for government plans and aid

challenge, we have proposed three transformer-based question-answering systems
using BERT, ALBERT, and T5 models. Since the CORD-19 dataset is unlabeled, we
have evaluated the question-answering models' performance on two labeled
questions answers datasets \textemdash CovidQA and CovidGQA. The BERT-based QA
system achieved the highest F1 score (26.32), while the ALBERT-based QA system
achieved the highest Exact Match (13.04). However, numerous challenges are
associated with developing high-performance question-answering systems for the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. At the end of this paper, we
discuss these challenges and suggest potential solutions to address them.

dimensional Myers-Perry black hole. Unlike heat represented by Hawking
radiation, the quantum work is represented by a unitary information preserving
process, and becomes important for black holes only at small quantum scales. It
will be observed that at such short distances, the quantum work will be
corrected by non-perturbative quantum gravitational corrections. We will use
the Jarzynski equality to obtain this quantum work modified by non-perturbative
quantum gravitational corrections. These non-perturbative corrections will also
modify the stability of a quantum Myers-Perry black hole. We will define a
quantum corrected information geometry by incorporating the non-perturbative
quantum corrections in the information geometry of a Myers-Perry black hole. We
will use several different quantum corrected effective information metrics to
analyze the stability of a quantum Myers-Perry black hole.

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health
crisis. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 (in particular the receptor binding
domain, RBD) to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the
antibodies is of great importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19
and evaluating the candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose
a new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
(MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to
ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to
ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol,
which agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol,
respectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the
example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD,
which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the
framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main
driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational
alanine scanning method. The present study offers a computationally efficient
and numerically reliable method to evaluate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2
binding to other proteins, which may stimulate the development of the
therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease in real applications.
