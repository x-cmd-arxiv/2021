two-dimensional band hybridizes with a fermionic operator of a critical
holographic sector, while also interacting with other bands that preserve
quasiparticle characteristics. Besides the scaling dimension $\nu$ of the
fermionic operator in the holographic sector, the effective theory has two
{dimensionless} couplings $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ determining the holographic and
Fermi-liquid-type contributions to the self-energy respectively. We find that
irrespective of the choice of the holographic critical sector, there exists a
ratio of the effective couplings for which we obtain linear-in-$T$ resistivity
for a wide range of temperatures. This scaling persists to arbitrarily low
temperatures when $\nu$ approaches unity in which limit we obtain a marginal
Fermi liquid with a specific temperature dependence of the self-energy.

challenging problem. While for rigid scenes learning-based methods have been
offering promising results even in unsupervised cases, there exists little to
no literature addressing the same for dynamic and deformable scenes. In this
work, we present an unsupervised monocular framework for dense depth estimation
of dynamic scenes, which jointly reconstructs rigid and non-rigid parts without
explicitly modelling the camera motion. Using dense correspondences, we derive
a training objective that aims to opportunistically preserve pairwise distances
between reconstructed 3D points. In this process, the dense depth map is
learned implicitly using the as-rigid-as-possible hypothesis. Our method
provides promising results, demonstrating its capability of reconstructing 3D
from challenging videos of non-rigid scenes. Furthermore, the proposed method
also provides unsupervised motion segmentation results as an auxiliary output.

interface between cold and hot stable phases, given by its width and surface
tension, is found to feature a wider phase separation and a smaller surface

To improve the adversarial robustness, adversarial data augmentation (ADA) has
been widely adopted to cover more search space of adversarial attacks by adding
textual adversarial examples during training. However, the number of
adversarial examples for text augmentation is still extremely insufficient due
to the exponentially large attack search space. In this work, we propose a
simple and effective method to cover a much larger proportion of the attack
search space, called Adversarial and Mixup Data Augmentation (AMDA).
Specifically, AMDA linearly interpolates the representations of pairs of
training samples to form new virtual samples, which are more abundant and
diverse than the discrete text adversarial examples in conventional ADA.
Moreover, to fairly evaluate the robustness of different models, we adopt a
challenging evaluation setup, which generates a new set of adversarial examples
targeting each model. In text classification experiments of BERT and RoBERTa,
AMDA achieves significant robustness gains under two strong adversarial attacks
and alleviates the performance degradation of ADA on the clean data. Our code

protocols are typically designed for a specific set of network conditions and
so cannot accommodate any drastic changes in those conditions. For instance,
protocols designed for connected networks cannot be easily applied to
disconnected networks. In this paper, we develop a distributed routing strategy
based on deep reinforcement learning that generalizes to diverse traffic
patterns, congestion levels, network connectivity, and link dynamics. We make
the following key innovations in our design: (i) the use of relational features
as inputs to the deep neural network approximating the decision space, which
enables our algorithm to generalize to diverse network conditions, (ii) the use
of packet-centric decisions to transform the routing problem into an episodic
task by viewing packets, rather than wireless devices, as reinforcement
learning agents, which provides a natural way to propagate and model rewards
accurately during learning, and (iii) the use of extended-time actions to model
the time spent by a packet waiting in a queue, which reduces the amount of
training data needed and allows the learning algorithm to converge more
quickly. We evaluate our routing algorithm using a packet-level simulator and

quantization to the limit by weight binarization. We find that a binary BERT is
hard to be trained directly than a ternary counterpart due to its complex and
irregular loss landscape. Therefore, we propose ternary weight splitting, which
initializes BinaryBERT by equivalently splitting from a half-sized ternary

using this algorithm is the dairy frequency of testing at zones where a high

the performance of neural machine translation (NMT) systems but they could be

breaks Transformers and if there exist solutions to deal with such issues.
There is a large body of work in the NMT literature on analyzing the behavior
of conventional models for the problem of noise but Transformers are relatively
understudied in this context. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel
data-driven technique called Target Augmented Fine-tuning (TAFT) to incorporate

strategy. Moreover, we propose two other novel extensions to the original

modify the neural architecture as well as the training process to handle noise.
One important characteristic of our techniques is that they only impact the
training phase and do not impose any overhead at inference time. We evaluated
our techniques to translate the English--German pair in both directions and
observed that our models have a higher tolerance to noise. More specifically,
they perform with no deterioration where up to 10% of entire test words are

represented, \emph{i.e.}, voxel-based or point-based representation. Many
existing high performance 3D detectors are point-based because this structure
can better retain precise point positions. Nevertheless, point-level features
lead to high computation overheads due to unordered storage. In contrast, the
voxel-based structure is better suited for feature extraction but often yields
lower accuracy because the input data are divided into grids. In this paper, we
take a slightly different viewpoint -- we find that precise positioning of raw
points is not essential for high performance 3D object detection and that the
coarse voxel granularity can also offer sufficient detection accuracy. Bearing
this view in mind, we devise a simple but effective voxel-based framework,
named Voxel R-CNN. By taking full advantage of voxel features in a two stage
approach, our method achieves comparable detection accuracy with
state-of-the-art point-based models, but at a fraction of the computation cost.
Voxel R-CNN consists of a 3D backbone network, a 2D bird-eye-view (BEV) Region
Proposal Network and a detect head. A voxel RoI pooling is devised to extract
RoI features directly from voxel features for further refinement. Extensive
experiments are conducted on the widely used KITTI Dataset and the more recent
Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that compared to existing voxel-based
methods, Voxel R-CNN delivers a higher detection accuracy while maintaining a
real-time frame processing rate, \emph{i.e}., at a speed of 25 FPS on an NVIDIA

properties of the structured data -- the underlying correlations and

This structure is often expressed as integrity and schema constraints, or with

useful for any downstream tasks that require this structure to be preserved.
  This work presents Kamino, a data synthesis system to ensure differential

remove its entire trace since downstream machine learning models may store some
information about the samples used to train them. A sample can be perfectly
unlearned if we retrain all models that used it from scratch with that sample
removed from their training dataset. When multiple such unlearning requests are
expected to be served, unlearning by retraining becomes prohibitively
expensive. Ensemble learning enables the training data to be split into smaller
disjoint shards that are assigned to non-communicating weak learners. Each
shard is used to produce a weak model. These models are then aggregated to
produce the final central model. This setup introduces an inherent trade-off
between performance and unlearning cost, as reducing the shard size reduces the
unlearning cost but may cause degradation in performance. In this paper, we
propose a coded learning protocol where we utilize linear encoders to encode
the training data into shards prior to the learning phase. We also present the
corresponding unlearning protocol and show that it satisfies the perfect

the OPE. We provide explicit computations in two and four-dimensional CFTs,
focusing mainly on commutators of components of the stress-tensor. We rederive
several familiar results, such as the canonical commutation relations of free
field theory, the local form of the Poincar\'e algebra, and the Virasoro

light scalar conformal primaries. In four-dimensional CFT we define a new
infinite set of light-ray operators constructed from the stress-tensor, which

two-dimensional Virasoro light-ray operators that are obtained from a conformal
embedding of Minkowski space in the Lorentzian cylinder. They obey Hermiticity

macroscopic bodies with an optimized elastic response, which is achieved by
means of a spatially-variant cellular architecture on the microscale. The
chosen spinodoid topology for the cellular network on the microscale (which is
inspired by natural microstructures forming during spinodal decomposition)
admits a seamless spatial grading as well as tunable elastic anisotropy, and it
is parametrized by a small set of design parameters associated with the
underlying Gaussian random field. The macroscale boundary value problem is
discretized by finite elements, which in addition to the displacement field
continuously interpolate the microscale design parameters. By assuming a
separation of scales, the local constitutive behavior on the macroscale is
identified as the homogenized elastic response of the microstructure based on
the local design parameters. As a departure from classical FE$^2$-type
approaches, we replace the costly microscale homogenization by a data-driven
surrogate model, using deep neural networks, which accurately and efficiently
maps design parameters onto the effective elasticity tensor. The model is
trained on homogenized stiffness data obtained from numerical homogenization by
finite elements. As an added benefit, the machine learning setup admits
automatic differentiation, so that sensitivities (required for the optimization
problem) can be computed exactly and without the need for numerical derivatives
- a strategy that holds promise far beyond the elastic stiffness. Therefore,
this framework presents a new opportunity for multiscale topology optimization
based on data-driven surrogate models.

component of many distributed systems and databases. However, these protocols
offer relatively low throughput due to several bottlenecked components.
Numerous existing protocols fix different bottlenecks in isolation but fall
short of a complete solution. When you fix one bottleneck, another arises. In
this paper, we introduce compartmentalization, the first comprehensive
technique to eliminate state machine replication bottlenecks.
Compartmentalization involves decoupling individual bottlenecks into distinct
components and scaling these components independently. Compartmentalization has
two key strengths. First, compartmentalization leads to strong performance. In
this paper, we demonstrate how to compartmentalize MultiPaxos to increase its
throughput by 6x on a write-only workload and 16x on a mixed read-write
workload. Unlike other approaches, we achieve this performance without the need
for specialized hardware. Second, compartmentalization is a technique, not a
protocol. Industry practitioners can apply compartmentalization to their
protocols incrementally without having to adopt a completely new protocol.

remotely physical properties of atmospheres. The data processing requires one
to properly account for refractivity while modeling the time/frequency
transfers of an electromagnetic signal. On theoretical grounds, little work
have been done concerning the elaboration of a covariant approach for modeling
occultation data. Aims: We present an original method allowing one to derive up
to the appropriate order fully analytical expressions for the covariant
description of time/frequency transfers during an atmospheric occultation
experiment. Methods: We make use of two independent powerful relativistic
theoretical tools, namely the optical spacetime metric, and the time transfer
functions formalism. The first one allows us to consider refractivity as
spacetime curvature while the second one is used to determine the
time/frequency transfers occurring in a curved spacetime. Results: We provide
the integral form of the time transfer function up to any post-Minkowskian
order. We specify the discussion to a stationary optical spacetime describing
an occultation by a steady rotating and spherically symmetric atmosphere.
Explicit analytical expressions for the time/frequency transfers are provided
at the first post-Minkowskian order and their accuracy is assessed by comparing
them to results of a numerical integration of the equations for optical rays.
Conclusions: The method accurately describes vertical temperature gradients and
properly accounts for light-dragging effect due to the motion of the optical
medium. It can be pushed further in order to derive the explicit form of the
time transfer function at higher order and beyond the spherical symmetry
assumption.

Its lowest rotational emission lines are in the radio regime and thanks to
Galactic rotation emission at different distances is Doppler shifted. For a
given gas flow model the observed spectra can thus be deprojected along the
line of sight to infer the gas distribution. We use the CO line survey of Dame
et al. (2001) to reconstruct the three-dimensional density of H2. We consider
the deprojection as a Bayesian variational inference problem. The posterior
distribution of the gas densities allows us to estimate both the mean and
uncertainty of the reconstructed density. Unlike most of the previous attempts,
we take into account the correlations of gas on a variety of scales which
allows curing some of the well-known pathologies, like fingers-of-god effects.
Both gas flow models that we adopt incorporate a Galactic bar which induces
radial motions in the inner few kiloparsecs and thus offers spectral resolution
towards the Galactic centre. We compare our gas maps with those of earlier
studies and characterise their statistical properties, e.g. the radial profile
of the average surface mass density. We have made our three-dimensional gas
maps and their uncertainties available to the community at

(sgluons) in supersymmetric models with Dirac gaugino masses that feature an
explicitly broken $R$ symmetry ($R$-broken models). We construct such models by
augmenting minimal $R$-symmetric models with a fairly general set of
supersymmetric and softly supersymmetry-breaking operators that explicitly
break $R$ symmetry. We then compute the rates of all significant two-body
decays and highlight new features that appear as a result of $R$ symmetry
breaking, including enhancements to extant decay rates, novel tree- and
loop-level decays, and improved cross sections of single sgluon production. We
demonstrate in some detail how the familiar results from minimal $R$-symmetric
models can be obtained by restoring $R$ symmetry. In parallel to this
discussion, we explore constraints on these models from the Large Hadron
Collider. We find that, in general, $R$ symmetry breaking quantitatively
affects existing limits on color-octet scalars, perhaps closing loopholes for
light CP-odd (pseudoscalar) sgluons while opening one for a light CP-even
(scalar) particle. Qualitatively, however, we find that -- much as for minimal
$R$-symmetric models, despite stark differences in phenomenology -- scenarios
with broken $R$ symmetry and two sgluons below the TeV scale can be
accommodated by existing searches.

automated cardiac magnetic resonance image segmentation. However, when using
CNNs in a large real-world dataset, it is important to quantify segmentation
uncertainty and identify segmentations which could be problematic. In this
work, we performed a systematic study of Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods for
estimating uncertainty in segmentation neural networks.
  Methods: We evaluated Bayes by Backprop, Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles,
and Stochastic Segmentation Networks in terms of segmentation accuracy,
probability calibration, uncertainty on out-of-distribution images, and
segmentation quality control.
  Results: We observed that Deep Ensembles outperformed the other methods
except for images with heavy noise and blurring distortions. We showed that
Bayes by Backprop is more robust to noise distortions while Stochastic
Segmentation Networks are more resistant to blurring distortions. For
segmentation quality control, we showed that segmentation uncertainty is
correlated with segmentation accuracy for all the methods. With the
incorporation of uncertainty estimates, we were able to reduce the percentage
of poor segmentation to 5% by flagging 31--48% of the most uncertain
segmentations for manual review, substantially lower than random review without
using neural network uncertainty (reviewing 75--78% of all images).
  Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods and showed that Deep Ensembles outperformed other methods in
most cases.
  Significance: Neural network uncertainty measures can help identify
potentially inaccurate segmentations and alert users for manual review.

restricted $2$-matching in a subcubic graph $G$. (A $2$-matching is any subset

Depending on the variant a restricted $2$-matching means a $2$-matching that is
either triangle-free or square-free or both triangle- and square-free. While
there exist polynomial time algorithms for the first two types of
$2$-matchings, they are quite complicated or use advanced methodology. For each
of the three problems we present a simple reduction to the computation of a
maximum weight $b$-matching. The reduction is conducted with the aid of
half-edges. A half-edge of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$
containing exactly one of its endpoints. For a subset of triangles of $G$, we
replace each edge of such a triangle with two half-edges. Two half-edges of one
edge $e$ of weight $w(e)$ may get different weights, not necessarily equal to
$\frac{1}{2}w(e)$. In the metric setting when the edge weights satisfy the
triangle inequality, this has a geometric interpretation connected to how an
incircle partitions the edges of a triangle. Our algorithms are additionally
faster than those known before. The running time of each of them is
$O(n^2\log{n})$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph.

tracing the magnetic field. We find that for localized clouds, the velocity
fluctuations are most prominent at the wing part of the spectral line, and they
dominate the density fluctuations. The same velocity dominance applies to
extended HI regions undergoing galactic rotation. Our numerical experiment
demonstrates that velocity channels arising from the cold phase of atomic
hydrogen (HI) are still affected by velocity fluctuations at small scales. We
apply the VDA to HI GALFA-DR2 data corresponding to the high-velocity cloud
HVC186+19-114 and high latitude galactic diffuse HI data. Our study confirms
the crucial role of velocity fluctuations in explaining why linear structures
are observed within PPV cubes. We discuss the implications of VDA for both

the foreground for the Cosmic Microwave Background studies. Additionally, we
address the controversy related to the filamentary nature of the HI channel

solution to oxygen-vacancy migration under a DC voltage -- the cause of
resistance degradation in SrTiO$_3$ -- agrees with previous numerical
solutions. However, all solutions fail to explain why degradation kinetics
feature a very strong voltage dependence, which we attribute to the nucleation
and growth of cathode-initiated fast-conducting needles. While they have no
color contrast in SrTiO$_3$ single crystals and are nominally invisible,
needles presence in DC-degraded samples -- in silicone oil and in air -- was
unambiguously revealed by in-situ hot-stage photography. Observations in
silicone oil and thermodynamic considerations of voltage boundary conditions
further revealed a cooccurrence of copious oxygen bubbling and the onset of
final accelerating degradation, suggesting sudden oxygen loss is a precursor of
final failure. Remarkably, both undoped and Fe-doped SrTiO$_3$ can emit
electroluminescence at higher current densities, thus providing a vivid
indicator of resistance degradation and a metal-to-insulator resistance
transition during cooling. The implications of these findings to thin ceramic

similar findings in likewise degraded fast-ion yttria-stabilized zirconia.

is important for reducing the illumination influence on the image colors. To
motivate the generation of new ideas and the development of new algorithms in
this field, the 2nd Illumination estimation challenge~(IEC\#2) was conducted.
The main advantage of testing a method on a challenge over testing in on some
of the known datasets is the fact that the ground-truth illuminations for the
challenge test images are unknown up until the results have been submitted,
which prevents any potential hyperparameter tuning that may be biased.
  The challenge had several tracks: general, indoor, and two-illuminant with
each of them focusing on different parameters of the scenes. Other main
features of it are a new large dataset of images (about 5000) taken with the
same camera sensor model, a manual markup accompanying each image, diverse
content with scenes taken in numerous countries under a huge variety of
illuminations extracted by using the SpyderCube calibration object, and a
contest-like markup for the images from the Cube+ dataset that was used in

super-organismal, aggregated rafts of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). While
these features are easily observed, what permits their recuring initiation,
growth, and recession is not immediately clear. Ants rafts are comprised of a
floating, structural network of interconnected ants on which a layer of freely
active ants walks. We show here that sustained shape evolution is permitted by
treadmilling defined by the competition between perpetual raft contraction due
to displacement of bulk structural ants into the active layer, and outwards
raft expansion due to deposition of free ants into the structural network at
the edges. Furthermore, we see that protrusions emerge due to asymmetries in
the edge deposition rate of surface ants, and we provide strong evidence that
these asymmetries occur stochastically due to wall accumulation effects and
local alignment interactions. Together these effects permit the cooperative,
yet spontaneous formation of protrusions that fire ants utilize for functional
exploration and to escape flooded environments. Ant raft dynamics mirror the
treadmilling that facilitates morphogenesis and motility of cytoskeletons, thus
providing another example in which reshaping of condensed active matter is
explained by free constituent transport, yet whose continuance relies on
perpetual phase transition between structural and free members.

autoencoder: we take temporally-ordered event sequences, shuffle them, delete
some events, and then attempt to recover the original event sequence. This task
teaches the model to make inferences given incomplete knowledge about the
events in an underlying scenario. On the temporal ordering task, we show that
our model is able to unscramble event sequences from existing datasets without
access to explicitly labeled temporal training data, outperforming both a
BERT-based pairwise model and a BERT-based pointer network. On event infilling,
human evaluation shows that our model is able to generate events that fit
better temporally into the input events when compared to GPT-2 story completion
models.

responses. However, existing numerical design methods require prior
identification of specific material-structure combinations, or device classes,
as the starting point for optimization. As such, a unified solution that
simultaneously optimizes across materials and geometries has yet to be
realized. To overcome these challenges, we present a global deep learning-based
inverse design framework, where a conditional deep convolutional generative
adversarial network is trained on colored images encoded with a range of
material and structural parameters, including refractive index, plasma
frequency, and geometric design. We demonstrate that, in response to target
absorption spectra, the network can identify an effective metasurface in terms
of its class, materials properties, and overall shape. Furthermore, the model
can arrive at multiple design variants with distinct materials and structures
that present nearly identical absorption spectra. Our proposed framework is
thus an important step towards global photonics and materials design strategies

methods to scale multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to many agent

agent has access to exact cumulative metrics regarding the mean field behaviour
of the system, which it can then use to take its actions. In this paper, we
relax this assumption and maintain a distribution to model the uncertainty
regarding the mean field of the system. We consider two different settings for
this problem. In the first setting, only agents in a fixed neighbourhood are
visible, while in the second setting, the visibility of agents is determined at
random based on distances. For each of these settings, we introduce a
Q-learning based algorithm that can learn effectively. We prove that this
Q-learning estimate stays very close to the Nash Q-value (under a common set of
assumptions) for the first setting. We also empirically show our algorithms
outperform multiple baselines in three different games in the MAgents
framework, which supports large environments with many agents learning
simultaneously to achieve possibly distinct goals.

  convolution",,,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I present a method for the fast convolution of a model galaxy profile by a
point-spread function (PSF) model represented as a pixel grid. The method
relies upon three observations: First, most simple radial galaxy profiles of
common interest (deVaucouleurs, exponential, Sersic) can be approximated as
mixtures of Gaussians. Second, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a
Gaussian, thus the Fourier transform of a mixture-of-Gausssian approximation of
a galaxy can be directly evaluated as a mixture of Gaussians in Fourier space.
Third, if a mixture component would result in Fourier-space aliasing, that
component can be evaluated in real space. For mixture components to be
evaluated in Fourier space, we use the FFT for the PSF model, direct evaluation
of the Fourier transform for the galaxy, and the inverse-FFT to return the
result to pixel space. For mixture components to be evaluated in real
space---which only happens when the mixture components is much larger than the
PSF---we use a simple Gaussian approximation of the PSF, perform the
convolution analytically, and evaluate in real pixel space. The method is fast
and exact (to the extent that the mixture-of-Gaussians approximation of the
galaxy profile is exact) as long as the pixelized PSF model is well sampled.
This Fourier method can be seen as a way of applying a perfect low-pass filter
to the (typically strongly undersampled) galaxy profile before convolution by
the PSF, at exactly the Nyquist frequency of the PSF pixel model grid. In this
way, it avoids the computational expense of a traditional super-resolution
approach. This method allows the efficient use of pixelized PSF models (ie, a
PSF represented as a grid of pixel values) in galaxy forward model-fitting
approaches such as the Tractor.

we show how the evolution of the system is described by a complex
reparametrization field with a classical Hamiltonian. We study correlation
functions in this system and compare the large-$q$ theory with the bulk low
energy effective theory. In particular, we study the special case of a
``rescued black hole'', which describes how a time-evolved thermofield double
state can evolve to the ground state of a coupled SYK model by a carefully
tuned time-dependent coupling. In the low energy region, there is a holographic
dual interpretation, which is a geometry that crosses over from an eternal
black hole to a global AdS$_2$ vacuum. This family of geometries allow us to
access the bulk region that would be the black hole interior without the rescue
process. By comparing the large-$q$ and low energy theory, we find that even in
the low energy region the deviation from the low energy theory cannot be
neglected if the rescue process starts late. This provides evidence that the
low energy effective theory of the bulk fails near the inner horizon of the
black hole. We note the possibility of a connection to a two-dimensional analog

As contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have
not been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the
post-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from
quantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus
protocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction
capacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded.
Thus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm
for security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used
to not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to
existing classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining.
Meanwhile, an identity-based post-quantum signature is embedded into a
transaction process to construct lightweight transactions. Subsequently, we
provide a detailed description on the execution of the post-quantum lightweight
transaction in a blockchain. Overall, this work can help enrich the research on
future post-quantum blockchain and support the construction or architecture of
emerging blockchain-based smart cities.

entering a configuration in which all agents agree on a correct consensus

describe a protocol that solves this problem using $O(\log n)$ states ($\log

the identity in Frobenius norm.
  In the absence of contamination, prior work gave a simple tester for this
hypothesis testing task that uses $O(d)$ samples. Moreover, this sample upper
bound was shown to be best possible, within constant factors. Our main result
is that the sample complexity of covariance testing dramatically increases in
the contaminated setting. In particular, we prove a sample complexity lower

an infinite-dimensional Witt-Ka\v{c}-Moody symmetry, generated by certain
field-dependent coordinate and gauge transformations. On a cylinder, however,
the equal spacing of the descendants' energies predicted by such a symmetry
algebra is inconsistent with the known finite-size spectrum of $J\bar T$ -
deformed CFTs. Also, the associated quantum symmetry generators do not have a
proper action on the Hilbert space. In this article, we resolve this tension by
finding a new set of (classical) conserved charges, whose action is consistent
with semi-classical quantization, and which are related to the previous
symmetry generators by a type of energy-dependent spectral flow. The previous
inconsistency between the algebra and the spectrum is resolved because the
energy operator does not belong to the spectrally flowed sector.

long-range interacting systems both in the classical and in the quantum realms.
Often, they emerge after a sudden quench of the Hamiltonian internal parameters
and present a macroscopic life-time, which increases with the system size.
Despite their ubiquity, the fundamental mechanism at their root remains
unknown. Here, we show that the spectrum of systems with power-law decaying
couplings remains discrete up to the thermodynamic limit. As a consequence,
several traditional results on the chaotic nature of the spectrum in many-body
quantum systems are not satisfied in presence of long-range interactions. In
particular, the existence of QSSs may be traced back to the finiteness of
Poincar\'e recurrence times. This picture justifies and extends known results
on the anomalous magnetization dynamics in the quantum Ising model with
power-law decaying couplings. The comparison between the discrete spectrum of
long-range systems and more conventional examples of pure point spectra in the
disordered case is also discussed.

specifically, we show how causal Bayesian networks can play an important role

scenarios. We describe how optimal transport theory can be used to develop
methods that impose constraints on the full shapes of distributions
corresponding to different sensitive attributes, overcoming the limitation of
most approaches that approximate fairness desiderata by imposing constraints on
the lower order moments or other functions of those distributions. We present a

the Schwinger mechanism provided they are unconfined. If, as in QED in
(3+1)-$d$ these particles are massive, the particle production rate is
exponentially suppressed below a threshold field strength. Above this
threshold, the energy for pair creation must come from the electric field
itself which ought to eventually relax to the threshold strength. Calculating
this relaxation in a self-consistent manner, however, is difficult. Chu and
Vachaspati addressed this problem in the context of capacitor discharge in
massless QED$_2$ [1] by utilizing bosonization in two-dimensions. When the bare
fermions are massless, the dual bosonized theory is free and capacitor
discharge can be analyzed exactly [1], however, special care is required in its
interpretation given that the theory exhibits confinement. In this paper we
reinterpret the findings of [1], where the capacitors Schwinger-discharge via
electrically neutral dipolar meson-production, and generalize this to the case
where the fermions have bare masses. Crucially, we note that when the initial
charge of the capacitor is large compared to the charge of the fermions, $Q \gg
e$, the classical equation of motion for the bosonized model accurately
characterizes the dynamics of discharge. For massless QED$_2$, we find that the
discharge is suppressed below a critical plate separation that is commensurate
with the length scale associated with the meson dipole moment. For massive
QED$_2$, we find in addition, a mass threshold familiar from (3+1)-$d$, and
show the electric field relaxes to a final steady state with a magnitude
proportional to the initial charge. We discuss the wider implications of our
findings and identify challenges in extending this treatment to higher
dimensions.

technical results. We first show anticoncentration for probabilities in random
FLO circuits of both kind. Moreover, we prove robust average-case hardness of
computation of probabilities. To achieve this, we adapt the
worst-to-average-case reduction based on Cayley transform, introduced recently
by Movassagh, to representations of low-dimensional Lie groups. Taken together,
these findings provide hardness guarantees comparable to the paradigm of Random
Circuit Sampling.
  Importantly, our scheme has also a potential for experimental realization.
Both passive and active FLO circuits are relevant for quantum chemistry and
many-body physics and have been already implemented in proof-of-principle
experiments with superconducting qubit architectures. Preparation of the
desired quantum input states can be obtained by a simple quantum circuit acting
independently on disjoint blocks of four qubits and using 3 entangling gates
per block. We also argue that due to the structured nature of FLO circuits,
they can be efficiently certified.

  MOOCs",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since its introduction in 2011, there have been over 4000 MOOCs on various
subjects on the Web, serving over 35 million learners. MOOCs have shown the
ability to democratize knowledge dissemination and bring the best education in
the world to every learner. However, the disparate distances between
participants, the size of the learner population, and the heterogeneity of the
learners' backgrounds make it extremely difficult for instructors to interact
with the learners in a timely manner, which adversely affects learning
experience. To address the challenges, in this thesis, we propose a framework:
educational content linking. By linking and organizing pieces of learning
content scattered in various course materials into an easily accessible
structure, we hypothesize that this framework can provide learners guidance and
improve content navigation. Since most instruction and knowledge acquisition in
MOOCs takes place when learners are surveying course materials, better content
navigation may help learners find supporting information to resolve their
confusion and thus improve learning outcome and experience. To support our
conjecture, we present end-to-end studies to investigate our framework around
two research questions: 1) can manually generated linking improve learning? 2)
can learning content be generated with machine learning methods? For studying
the first question, we built an interface that present learning materials and
visualize the linking among them simultaneously. We found the interface enables
users to search for desired course materials more efficiently, and retain more
concepts more readily. For the second question, we propose an automatic content
linking algorithm based on conditional random fields. We demonstrate that
automatically generated linking can still lead to better learning, although the
magnitude of the improvement over the unlinked interface is smaller.

different plant density scenarios, locations, types of crops, sensors, and

information obtained within the plantation-row is updated into the plant
detection branch and retro-feed to the row branch; which are then refined by a
Multi-Stage Refinement method. In the corn plantation datasets (with both
growth phases, young and mature), our approach returned a mean absolute error

the underlying probability distribution, defined with an action space and a
loss function, and use this property to answer the basic questions in
statistical learning theory: the excess risk analyses for various learning
methods. We first derive upper and lower bounds for the entropy difference of
two distributions in terms of several commonly used f-divergences, the
Wasserstein distance, a distance that depends on the action space and the loss
function, and the Bregman divergence generated by the entropy, which also
induces bounds in terms of the Euclidean distance between the two
distributions. Examples are given along with the discussion of each general
result, comparisons are made with the existing entropy difference bounds, and
new mutual information upper bounds are derived based on the new results. We
then apply the entropy difference bounds to the theory of statistical learning.
It is shown that the excess risks in the two popular learning paradigms, the
frequentist learning and the Bayesian learning, both can be studied with the
continuity property of different forms of the generalized entropy. The analysis
is then extended to the continuity of generalized conditional entropy. The
extension provides performance bounds for Bayes decision making with mismatched
distributions. It also leads to excess risk bounds for a third paradigm of
learning, where the decision rule is optimally designed under the projection of
the empirical distribution to a predefined family of distributions. We thus
establish a unified method of excess risk analysis for the three major
paradigms of statistical learning, through the continuity of generalized
entropy.

bounded by below by the density of states of $U(1)$ gravity. This immediately
implies that the maximal value of the spectral gap for primary fields is
$\Delta_1=c/(2\pi e)$. To test the self-consistency of this proposal, we study
its implications using chiral lattice CFTs and CFTs based on quantum stabilizer
codes. First we notice that the conjecture yields a new bound on quantum
stabilizer codes, which is compatible with previously known bounds in the
literature. We proceed to discuss the variance of the density of states, which
for consistency must be vanishingly small in the large-$c$ limit. We consider
ensembles of code and chiral theories and show that in both cases the density

an isolated source in background-dominated imaging with perfectly known
background level, point-spread function, and noise models. We show that the

observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh
also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations

a transition from the subcritical to the supercritical accretion regime which
allows exploring different properties of the source in the supercritical

(FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder progressively reduces
the spatial resolution and learns more abstract/semantic visual concepts with
larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is critical for segmentation,
the latest efforts have been focused on increasing the receptive field, through
either dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, the
encoder-decoder based FCN architecture remains unchanged. In this paper, we aim
to provide an alternative perspective by treating semantic segmentation as a
sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure
transformer (ie, without convolution and resolution reduction) to encode an
image as a sequence of patches. With the global context modeled in every layer
of the transformer, this encoder can be combined with a simple decoder to
provide a powerful segmentation model, termed SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR).
Extensive experiments show that SETR achieves new state of the art on ADE20K
(50.28% mIoU), Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU) and competitive results on
Cityscapes. Particularly, we achieve the first position in the highly

agreement with a state-counting model based on statistical theory, but also
reveal several deviating state-pairs. In particular, we observe a strong
suppression of population in the state-pair closest to the exoergicity limit,
which we precisely determine to be $9.7711^{+0.0007}_{-0.0005}$ cm$^{-1}$, as a

many applications such as natural language processing and information
retrieval. The calculation of full softmax is costly from the computational and

this challenge, popularly known as negative sampling (NS). Ideally, NS should
sample negative classes from a distribution that is dependent on the input
data, the current parameters, and the correct positive class. Unfortunately,
due to the dynamically updated parameters and data samples, there is no
sampling scheme that is provably adaptive and samples the negative classes
efficiently. Therefore, alternative heuristics like random sampling, static
frequency-based sampling, or learning-based biased sampling, which primarily
trade either the sampling cost or the adaptivity of samples per iteration are
adopted. In this paper, we show two classes of distributions where the sampling
scheme is truly adaptive and provably generates negative samples in
near-constant time. Our implementation in C++ on CPU is significantly superior,
both in terms of wall-clock time and accuracy, compared to the most optimized
TensorFlow implementations of other popular negative sampling approaches on
powerful NVIDIA V100 GPU.

$Z_2$ gauge theory, realized for example in the toric code. This phase permits
a duality that exchanges electric and magnetic excitations (``$e$'' and ``$m$''
particles). Condensing either particle while the other remains gapped yields a
phase transition with 3D Ising exponents. More mysterious, however, is the
transition out of the deconfined phase when self-duality symmetry is preserved.
If this transition is continuous, which has so far been unclear, then it may be
the simplest critical point for which we still lack any useful continuum
Lagrangian description. This transition also has a soft matter interpretation,
as a multicritical point for classical membranes in 3D.
  We study the self-dual transition with Monte Carlo simulations of the $Z_2$
gauge-Higgs model on cubic lattices of linear size $L\leq 96$. Our results
indicate a continuous transition: for example, cumulants show a striking
parameter-free scaling collapse. We estimate scaling dimensions by using
duality symmetry to distinguish the leading duality-odd/duality-even scaling
operators $A$ and $S$. All local operators have large scaling dimensions,
making standard techniques for locating the critical point ineffective. We
develop an alternative using ``renormalization group trajectories'' of
cumulants. We check that two- and three-point functions, and temporal
correlators in the Monte-Carlo dynamics, are scale-invariant, with scaling
dimensions $x_A$ and $x_S$ and dynamical exponent $z$.
  We also give a picture for emergence of 1-form symmetries, in some parts of
the phase diagram, in terms of ``patching'' of membranes/worldsurfaces. We
relate this to the percolation of anyon worldlines in spacetime. Analyzing
percolation yields a fourth exponent for the self-dual transition. We propose

non-linear optical processes such as sum frequency generation and second
harmonic generation. Additional requirements that arise from the finite

is essential to study the structural connectome, i.e., the wiring of different
brain regions to each other through axonal pathways. However, the high degree
of plasticity and cross-population variability in human brains makes it
difficult to relate structure to function, motivating a search for invariant
patterns in the connectivity. At the same time, variability within a population
can provide information about generative mechanisms. In this paper we analyze
the connection topology and link-weight distribution of human structural
connectomes obtained from a database comprising 196 subjects. By demonstrating
a correspondence between the occurrence frequency of individual links and their
average weight across the population, we show that the process by which the
brain is wired is not independent of the process by which the link weights of
the connectome are determined. Furthermore, using the specific distribution of
the weights associated with each link over the entire population, we show that
a single parameter that is specific to a link can account for its frequency of
occurrence, as well as, the variation in its weight across different subjects.
This parameter provides a basis for ``rescaling'' the link weights in each
connectome, allowing us to obtain a generic network representative of the human
brain, distinct from a simple average over the connectomes. We obtain
functional connectomes by implementing a neural mass model on each of the
vertices of the corresponding structural connectomes. By comparing with the
empirical functional brain networks, we demonstrate that the rescaling
procedure yields a closer structure-function correspondence. Finally, we show
that the representative network can be decomposed into a basal component that
is stable across the population and a highly variable superstructure.

first train our masking policy to extract spans that are likely to be tested,

consequent 2D Mott-insulating square lattice is a crystallographic analog of a
copper oxide layer in high-temperature superconductors such as YBCO and BSCCO.
Subsequent temperature cycles of the thus produced ideal Hubbard crystal
realize zero resistance at 60 K, and the zero-resistance state remains up to
300 K, being retained in the atmosphere (i.e., at room temperature, in a
terrestrial magnetic field, and under atmospheric pressure). The necessity of
the latter temperature cycles remains unclear in this study; however, a
possible transition mechanism involving the combined Josephson and charging
effects is discussed. The critical current and critical field of the
room-temperature superconductor (RTSC) are $I_{C}$ = 18.8 mA and
$\mu_{0}H_{\perp}$ = 12 T, respectively. Once a large current exceeding $I_{C}$
is applied to the RTSC, some of the $d$ electrons are forced out, and a special

formed. Carriers diffuse because of the nonequilibrium charge concentration,
but they are Andreev-reflected back. In the reversible, thermally isolated

right-handed ""sterile"" neutrinos, gapless unparticle physics, more general

surface operators or defects, etc., whose open ends carry deconfined
fractionalized particle or anyonic string excitations) or gapless conformal
matter. Physical characterizations of these gapped extended objects require the
mathematical theories of cohomology, cobordism, or category. Although weaker
than the weak force, Topological Force is infinite-range or long-range which
does not decay in the distance, and mediates between the linked worldvolume
trajectories via fractional or categorical statistical interactions.

disorder is correlated along the new dimension. The extra dimension increases
the number of paths between any two sites and allows for interference between
their amplitudes. We study the localisation problem within the forward
scattering approximation (FSA) which we adapt to this extended graph. At low
frequency, this favours delocalisation as the availability of a large number of
extra paths dominates. By contrast, at high frequency, it stabilises
localisation compared to the static system. These lead to a regime of
re-entrant localisation in the phase diagram. Analysing the statistics of path

even 45 years after the first calculation of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ we do not
know to which degree the Standard Model agrees with this data and how large is
the room left for new physics contributions to this ratio. This is due to
significant non-perturbative (hadronic) uncertainties accompanied by partial
cancellation between the QCD penguin contributions and electroweak penguin
contributions. While the significant control over the short distance
perturbative effects has been achieved already in the early 1990s, with several

thirty years. In fact even today the uncertainty in the room left for NP

finite mass impurity injected into a three-dimensional quantum Bose fluid as it
starts shedding Bogoliubov excitations. We uncover a transition in the dynamics
as the impurity's velocity crosses a critical value which depends on the
strength of the interaction between the impurity and bosons as well as the
impurity's recoil energy. We find that in injection experiments, the two
regimes differ not only in the character of the impurity velocity abatement,
but also exhibit qualitative differences in the Loschmidt echo, density ripples
excited in the BEC, and momentum distribution of scattered bosonic particles.
The transition is a manifestation of a dynamical quantum Cherenkov effect, and
should be experimentally observable with ultracold atoms using Ramsey
interferometry, RF spectroscopy, absorption imaging, and time-of-flight
imaging.

observing the largest angular scales ($2 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 200$) of the

about reionization and inflation during the early universe. The instrument
stability necessary to observe these angular scales from the ground is achieved
through the use of a variable-delay polarization modulator (VPM) as the first

scheme used to extract the polarization timestreams from the CLASS data and
apply this method to selected data from the first two years of observations by
the 40 GHz CLASS telescope. These timestreams are used to measure the $1/f$
noise and temperature-to-polarization ($T\rightarrow P$) leakage present in the
CLASS data. We find a median knee frequency for the pair-differenced
demodulated linear polarization of 15.12 mHz and a $T\rightarrow P$ leakage of
$<3.8\times10^{-4}$ (95\% confidence) across the focal plane. We examine the
sources of $1/f$ noise present in the data and find the component of $1/f$ due

  Prediction of Lithium-ion Batteries",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper presents the development of machine learning-enabled data-driven
models for effective capacity predictions for lithium-ion batteries under
different cyclic conditions. To achieve this, a model structure is first
proposed with the considerations of battery ageing tendency and the
corresponding operational temperature and depth-of-discharge. Then based on a
systematic understanding of covariance functions within the Gaussian process
regression, two related data-driven models are developed. Specifically, by
modifying the isotropic squared exponential kernel with an automatic relevance
determination structure, 'Model A' could extract the highly relevant input
features for capacity predictions. Through coupling the Arrhenius law and a
polynomial equation into a compositional kernel, 'Model B' is capable of
considering the electrochemical and empirical knowledge of battery degradation.
The developed models are validated and compared on the Nickel Manganese Cobalt
Oxide (NMC) lithium-ion batteries with various cycling patterns. Experimental
results demonstrate that the modified Gaussian process regression model
considering the battery electrochemical and empirical ageing signature
outperforms other counterparts and is able to achieve satisfactory results for
both one-step and multi-step predictions. The proposed technique is promising
for battery capacity predictions under various cycling cases.

reduces the portability of the findings. To tackle this problem, we represent
complex real-world privacy leakage scenarios under a universal
parameterization, \textit{Knowledge, Anonymization, Resource, and Target}

of privacy leakage in each experiment and (ii) it improves the comparability of
the findings of risk assessments. We show that previous studies can be simply
reviewed by parameterizing the scenarios with KART. We also demonstrate privacy
risk assessments in different scenarios under the same attack method, which
suggests that KART helps approximate the upper bound of risk under a specific
attack or scenario. We believe that KART helps integrate past and future
findings on privacy risk and will contribute to a standard for sharing language

complements the previous result of Lewandowski and Pawlowski. We prove that it
depends on 5 independent parameters, namely deficit angles on the north and
south poles of a spherical-like section of the horizon, its radius (area), and
total electric and magnetic charges of the black hole. The deficit angles and
both charges can be separately set to zero. In the second part of our paper, we
identify this general axially symmetric solution for EIH with extremal horizons
in exact electrovacuum Plebanski-Demianski spacetimes, using the convenient
parametrization of this family by Griffiths and Podolsky. They represent all

constant. Apart from a conicity, they depend on 6 physical parameters (mass,
Kerr-like rotation, NUT parameter, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges)
constrained by the extremality condition. We were able to determine their
relation to the EIH geometrical parameters. This explicit identification of

comprehensively. One of the important underlying issues is the location of a
zero-displacement point, known as the null point. This study investigates how
the location of a combined null point in fully floating energy piles is
affected by relative magnitudes of thermal and mechanical loads. Analytical
solutions are used to address four different loading scenarios including
compressive and tensile loads, and heating and cooling. It was found that the
location of the combined null point coincides with the location of the maximum
magnitude of the axial stress induced by thermo-mechanical load. Furthermore,
while a thermal null point is always present in fully floating energy piles,
the combined null point is absent in the case of a small magnitude of thermal
load as compared to the mechanical load. With increase in the relative
magnitude of thermal load as compared to the mechanical load the combined null
point emerges at different locations for different load combinations. In all

the relative magnitude of thermal load.

direct measurements, numerical simulations play a key role in investigating the
fundamental physics underlying MR. The choice of an adequate plasma model to be
employed in numerical simulations, while also compromising with their
computational cost, is crucial to efficiently address the problem. We consider
a new plasma model that includes a refined electron response within the
hybrid-kinetic framework (kinetic ions, fluid electrons). The extent to which
this new model can reproduce a full-kinetic description of 2D MR, with
particular focus on its robustness during the non-linear stage, is evaluated.
We perform 2D simulations of MR with moderate guide field by means of three
different plasma models: a hybrid-Vlasov-Maxwell model with isotropic,
isothermal electrons, a hybrid-Vlasov-Landau-fluid (HVLF) model where an
anisotropic electron fluid is equipped with a Landau-fluid closure, and a
full-kinetic one. When compared to the full-kinetic case, the HVLF model
effectively reproduces the main features of MR, as well as several aspects of
the associated electron micro-physics and its feedback onto proton dynamics.
This includes the global evolution of MR and the local physics occurring within
the so-called electron-diffusion region, as well as the evolution of species
pressure anisotropy. In particular, anisotropy driven instabilities (such as
firehose, mirror, and cyclotron instabilities) play a relevant role in
regulating electrons anisotropy during the non-linear stage of MR. As expected,
the HVLF model captures all these features, except for the electron-cyclotron
instability.

(1) Simulations reveal a photoevaporative outflow ($\sim 0.5~M_{\oplus}~{\rm

the symmetric transit shape (Vissapragada et al. 2020). (2) 3D simulations are
mandatory for hydrodynamic features, including Coriolis force, advection, and
kinematic line broadening. (3) EUV ($>13.6~{\rm eV}$) photons dominate
photoevaporative outflows and populate He* via recombination; FUV is also
detrimental by destroying He*; X-ray plays a secondary role. (4) K stars hit
the sweet spot of EUV/FUV balance for He* line observation, while G and M stars

confirmed by three different instruments. We employ full 3D hydrodynamics
coupled with co-evolving non-equilibrium thermochemistry and ray-tracing
radiation, predicting mass loss rates, temperature profiles, and synthetic He*
line profiles and light curves from first principles. We found that a stellar
wind stronger than solar is demanded by the observed heavily blueshifted line
profile and asymmetric transit light curve. Contrary to previous beliefs, we
argue that radiation pressure can be important for Ly$\alpha$ observations but
{\it not} He*. We found WASP-107b is losing mass at a rate of $\dot{M} \simeq
1.0\times 10^{-9}~M_\oplus~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Although $\dot{M}$ varies by $<1~\%$
given constant wind and irradiation from the host, shear instabilities still
emerge from wind impacts, producing $\sim 10~\%$ fluctuations of He* transit
depths over hour-long timescales. The common assumption that He* transit depth
indicates the fluctuation of $\dot{M}$ is problematic. The trailing tail is
more susceptible than planet adjacency to the shear instabilities, thus the
line profile is more variable in the blue-shifted wing, while the transit light
curve is more variable after mid-transit. We stress the synergy between
Ly$\alpha$ (higher altitudes, lower density) and He* (lower altitudes, higher
density) transit observations, particularly simultaneous ones, yield better
understanding of planetary outflows and stellar wind properties.

surfaces (PES) using machine learning (ML) approaches is becoming popular in
molecular and materials research. Training an ML-PES is typically performed in
two stages: feature extraction and structure-property relationship modeling.
The feature extraction stage transforms atomic positions into a
symmetry-invariant mathematical representation. This representation can be
fine-tuned by adjusting on a set of so-called ""hyper-parameters"" (HPs).
Subsequently, an ML algorithm such as neural networks or Gaussian process
regression (GPR) is used to model the structure-PES relationship based on
another set of HPs. Choosing optimal values for the two sets of HPs is critical
to ensure the high quality of the resulting ML-PES model.
  In this paper, we explore HP optimization strategies tailored for ML-PES
generation using a custom-coded parallel particle swarm optimizer (available
freely at https://github.com/suresh0807/PPSO.git). We employ the smooth overlap
of atomic positions (SOAP) descriptor in combination with GPR-based Gaussian
approximation potentials (GAP) and optimize HPs for four distinct systems: a
toy C dimer, amorphous carbon, $\alpha$-Fe, and small organic molecules (QM9
dataset). We propose a two-step optimization strategy in which the HPs related
to the feature extraction stage are optimized first, followed by the
optimization of the HPs in the training stage. This strategy is computationally
more efficient than optimizing all HPs at the same time by means of
significantly reducing the number of ML models needed to be trained to obtain
the optimal HPs. This approach can be trivially extended to other combinations
of descriptor and ML algorithm and brings us another step closer to fully
automated ML-PES generation.

upon the active subspace method for dimension reduction, we propose a clustered

construct low dimensional and local GP emulators within the clusters.
Specifically we design a clustering method based on the gradient information to

considerably; for example, enabling preference learning, learning common-sense
knowledge, including defaults and exceptions, and learning non-deterministic
theories.
  Early versions of ILASP can be considered meta-level ILP approaches, which
encode a learning task as a logic program and delegate the search to an ASP
solver. More recently, ILASP has shifted towards a new method, inspired by
conflict-driven SAT and ASP solvers. The fundamental idea of the approach,
called Conflict-driven ILP (CDILP), is to iteratively interleave the search for
a hypothesis with the generation of constraints which explain why the current
hypothesis does not cover a particular example. These coverage constraints
allow ILASP to rule out not just the current hypothesis, but an entire class of
hypotheses that do not satisfy the coverage constraint.
  This paper formalises the CDILP approach and presents the ILASP3 and ILASP4
systems for CDILP, which are demonstrated to be more scalable than previous

$k$ rounds informs how many processors are needed to achieve a parallel time of
$k$.
  We focus on the d-dimensional grid $[n]^d$, where the dimension $d$ is a
constant, and consider two regimes for the number of rounds: constant and
polynomial in n. We give algorithms and lower bounds that characterize the
trade-off between the number of rounds of adaptivity and the query complexity

  When the number of rounds $k$ is constant, we show that the query complexity
of local search in $k$ rounds is $\Theta\bigl(n^{\frac{d^{k+1} - d^k}{d^k -

which the growing connectomes topology is resistant to biological noise. We
show that the developing connectome topology is both relatively robust to
changes in neuron birth times and not captured by similar growth models.
Additionally, we quantify the consequence of a neurons specific birth time and
ask if this metric tracks other biological properties of neurons. Our results
suggest that the connectomes growing topology is a robust feature of the
developing connectome that is distinct from other network properties, and that
the growing topology is particularly sensitive to the exact birth times of a
small set of predominantly motor neurons. By utilizing novel measurements that
track biological features, we anticipate that our study will be helpful in the
construction of more accurate models of neuronal development in C. elegans

techniques such as Batch Normalization (BN) or Weight Normalization (WN) are
used together with Weight Decay (WD). The main property of the minimizers that
bounds their expected error is the norm: we prove that among all the
close-to-interpolating solutions, the ones associated with smaller Frobenius
norms of the unnormalized weight matrices have better margin and better bounds
on the expected classification error. With BN but in the absence of WD, the
dynamical system is singular. Implicit dynamical regularization -- that is
zero-initial conditions biasing the dynamics towards high margin solutions --
is also possible in the no-BN and no-WD case. The theory yields several
predictions, including the role of BN and weight decay, aspects of Papyan, Han

in number and variety underpins the importance of a good thumbnail because it
saves potential viewers time to choose videos and even entice them to click on

video while at the same time capturing viewers' attention. However, the
techniques and models in the past only focus on frames within a video, and we
believe such narrowed focus leave out much useful information that are part of
a video. In this paper, we expand the definition of content to include title,
description, and audio of a video and utilize information provided by these
modalities in our selection model. Specifically, our model will first sample
frames uniformly in time and return the top 1,000 frames in this subset with
the highest aesthetic scores by a Double-column Convolutional Neural Network,
to avoid the computational burden of processing all frames in downstream task.
Then, the model incorporates frame features extracted from VGG16, text features
from ELECTRA, and audio features from TRILL. These models were selected because
of their results on popular datasets as well as their competitive performances.
After feature extraction, the time-series features, frames and audio, will be
fed into Transformer encoder layers to return a vector representing their
corresponding modality. Each of the four features (frames, title, description,
audios) will pass through a context gating layer before concatenation. Finally,
our model will generate a vector in the latent space and select the frame that
is most similar to this vector in the latent space. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to propose a multi-modal deep learning model to
select video thumbnail, which beats the result from the previous

non-negligible concentration of interferer molecules in the channel, which have
similar receptor-binding characteristics with the information molecules, and
the receiver employs single type of receptors. We investigate the performance
of four different detection methods, which make use of different statistics of
the ligand-receptor binding reactions: instantaneous number of bound receptors,
unbound time durations of receptors, bound time durations of receptors, and
combination of unbound and bound time durations of receptors within a sampling

evaluated in terms of bit error probability for varying strength of molecular
interference, similarity between information and interferer molecules, number

anions in the electrosorption cell forms a self-sharpening reaction-diffusion
wave front. Based on the model, a three-step stop-flow operation scheme with a
pure stripping solution of target anions is proposed that optimizes the ion
adsorption performance and increases the purity of the regeneration stream to
almost 100%, which is beneficial for downstream processing.

the theory of asymptotic expansion for Skorohod integrals having a mixed normal

classify the level of the effect of each term appearing in the stochastic
expansion of the variable in question. To solve this problem, we consider a
class ${\cal L}$ of certain sequences $({\cal I}_n)_{n\in{\mathbb N}}$ of
Wiener functionals and we give a systematic way of estimation of the order of

of exponent of the sequence $({\cal I}_n)_{n\in{\mathbb N}}$, and investigate
the stability and contraction effect of the operators $D_{u_n}$ and $D$ on
${\cal L}$, where $u_n$ is the integrand of a Skorohod integral. After
constructed these machineries, we derive asymptotic expansion of the variation

future problems, such as reduced maintainability. Except for anecdotal cases
(e. g. code dropout), a code smell survives until it gets explicitly refactored
or removed. This paper presents a longitudinal study on the survival of code
smells for web apps built with PHP.
  Objectives: RQ: (i) code smells survival depends on their scope? (ii)
practitioners attitudes towards code smells removal in web apps have changed
throughout time? (iii) how long code smells survive in web applications? (iv)
are there sudden variations (anomalies) in the density of code smells through
the evolution of web apps?
  Method: We analyze the evolution of 6 code smells in 8 web applications
written in PHP at the server side, across several years, using the survival
analysis technique. We classify code smells according to scope in two
categories: scattered and localized. Scattered code smells are expected to be
more harmful since their influence is not circumscribed as in localized code
smells. We split the observations for each web app into two equal and
consecutive timeframes, to test the hypothesis that code smells awareness has
increased throughout time. As for the anomalies, we standardize their detection
criteria.
  Results: We present some evidence that code smells survival depends on their
scope: the average survival rate decreases in some of them, while the opposite
is observed for the remainder. The survival of localized code smells is around
4 years, while the scattered ones live around 5 years. Around 60% of the smells
are removed, and some live through all the application life. We also show how a
graphical representation of anomalies found in the evolution of code smells
allows unveiling the story of a development project and make managers aware of
the need for enforcing regular refactoring practices.

(EFWI) by proposing to synthesize the low frequencies of multi-component
elastic seismic records, and use those ""artificial"" low frequencies to seed the
frequency sweep of elastic FWI. Our solution involves deep learning: we
separately train the same convolutional neural network (CNN) on two training

large convolutional kernels or dilated convolution. Numerical examples on the

study Bloom-Gilman duality of deep inelastic scattering. Separate expressions
for structure functions in terms of quark and hadronic degrees of freedom are
presented, with a goal of relating the two expressions. A two-parton model is
defined and resonance transition form factors are computed using previously
derived light front wave functions. A new form of global duality is derived
from the valence quark-number sum rule. Using a complete set of hadronic states
is necessary for this new global duality to be achieved. Previous original work
does not provide such a set. This is remedied by amending the model to include
a longitudinal confining potential, and the resulting complete set is
sufficient to carry out the study of Bloom-Gilman duality. Expressions for
transition form factors are obtained and all are shown to fall asymptotically
as 1/Q2. The Feynman mechanism dominates the asymptotic behavior of the model.
These transition form factors are used to assess the validity of the global and
local duality sum rules, with the result that both neither are satisfied.
Evaluations of the hadronic expression for q(x,Q2) provide more details about
this lack. This result shows that the observed validity of both global and
local forms of duality for deep inelastic scattering must be related to a
feature of QCD that is deeper than completeness. Our simple present model
suggests a prediction that Bloom-Gilman duality would not be observed if deep
inelastic scattering experiments were to be made on the pion. The underlying
origin of the duality phenomenon in deep inelastic scattering is deeply buried
within the confinement aspects of QCD, and remains a mystery.

phenomena is observed from a large collection of chosen random variables it is
natural to ask if this behavior is specific to the chosen random variable or if
the behavior occurs for a larger class of random variables.
  The rank statistics of random matrices chosen uniformly from
$\operatorname{Mat}(\mathbf{F}_q)$ over a finite field are well understood. The
universality properties of these statistics are not yet fully understood
however. Recently Wood [39] and Maples [26] considered a natural requirement
where the random variables are not allowed to be too close to constant and they
showed that the rank statistics match with the uniform model up to an error of
type $e^{-cn}$. In this paper we explore a condition called near uniform, under
which we are able to prove tighter bounds $q^{-cn}$ on the asymptotic
convergence of the rank statistics.
  Our method is completely elementary, and allows for a small number of the
entries to be deterministic, and for the entries to not be identically
distributed so long as they are independent. More importantly, the method also
extends to near uniform symmetric, alternating matrices.
  Our method also applies to two models of perturbations of random matrices

The natural frequency of vortex shedding from a stationary cylinder,

The (dimensionless) frequency, $f^*=f/{f_{\text{St}}}$, and amplitude,
$A^*=A/D$, of the cylinder's motion was varied over a large portion of the
fundamental synchronization region (i.e., for $f^* \approx 1$), and a `map' of
wake patterns was constructed in ${(f^*, A^*)}$ space. Lock-on between the
frequency of the cylinder's motion and the dominant frequency of the resulting
vortex wake was observed for a large range of this parameter space,
predominantly manifested as synchronized `2S' and `2P' wake modes. Synchronized
`P+S', `2T', and `transitional' wakes were also found in smaller regions of
parameter space. Unsynchronized `coalescing' and `perturbed von~\karman' wakes
were observed as the oscillation frequency became sufficiently different from
$f_{\text_{St}}$. The wake patterns and vortex formation processes found in
this study, particularly for the 2P mode wakes, are more similar to those
observed by \cite{Williamson1988} in three-dimensional experiments than those
found by \cite{Leontini2006} in two-dimensional simulations, despite the
physical constraint from the soap film that prevents three-dimensional effects

their task to one of the $M$ CAPs or the remote cloud server, in order to
possibly reduce their processing cost. We aim to jointly optimize the
offloading decisions of the users and the resource allocation decisions for
each CAP over a global objective function, defined as a weighted sum of total
energy consumption and the round time. We first present a centralized heuristic
solution, termed MCAP, where the original problem is relaxed to a semi-definite

recognizing that the users often exhibit selfish behavior to reduce their
individual cost, we propose a game-theoretical approach, termed MCAP-NE, which
allows us to compute a Nash Equilibrium (NE) through a finite improvement
method starting from the previous SDP solution. This approach leads to a
solution from which the users have no incentive to deviate, with substantially
reduced NE computation time. In simulation, we compare the system cost of the
NE solution with those of MCAP, MCAP-NE, a random mapping, and the optimal

as one of the preeminent applications of quantum computing, offering an
exponential speedup for the solution of the electronic structure for certain
strongly correlated electronic systems. To date, most treatments have ignored
the question of whether relativistic effects, which are described most
generally by quantum electrodynamics (QED), can also be simulated on a quantum
computer in polynomial time. Here we show that effective QED, which is
equivalent to QED to second order in perturbation theory, can be simulated in
polynomial time under reasonable assumptions while properly treating all four
components of the wavefunction of the fermionic field. In particular, we
provide a detailed analysis of such simulations in position and momentum basis
using Trotter-Suzuki formulas. We find that the number of $T$-gates needed to
perform such simulations on a $3D$ lattice of $n_s$ sites scales at worst as
$O(n_s^3/\epsilon)^{1+o(1)}$ in the thermodynamic limit for position basis
simulations and $O(n_s^{4+2/3}/\epsilon)^{1+o(1)}$ in momentum basis. We also
find that qubitization scales slightly better with a worst case scaling of
$\widetilde{O}(n_s^{2+2/3}/\epsilon)$ for lattice eQED and complications in the
prepare circuit leads to a slightly worse scaling in momentum basis of
$\widetilde{O}(n_s^{5+2/3}/\epsilon)$. We further provide concrete gate counts
for simulating a relativistic version of the uniform electron gas that show
challenging problems can be simulated using fewer than $10^{13}$ non-Clifford
operations and also provide a detailed discussion of how to prepare
multi-reference configuration interaction states in effective QED which can
provide a reasonable initial guess for the ground state. Finally, we estimate
the planewave cutoffs needed to accurately simulate heavy elements such as
gold.

problem of $2m$-th order in $\mathbb{R}^N\times (0,T)$ with analytic
coefficients (in space and time variables) and analytic initial data (in space
variables) are investigated. They are expressed in terms of holomorphic
continuation of global (weak) solutions to the system valued in a suitable
Besov interpolation space of $B^{s;p,p}$-type at every time moment $t\in
[0,T]$. Given $0 < T'< T\leq \infty$, it is proved that any $B^{s;p,p}$-type
solution $u\colon \mathbb{R}^N\times (0,T)\to \mathbb{C}^M$ with analytic
initial data possesses a bounded holomorphic continuation $u(x + \mathrm{i}y,
\sigma + \mathrm{i}\tau)$ into a complex domain in $\mathbb{C}^N\times
\mathbb{C}$ defined by $(x,\sigma)\in \mathbb{R}^N\times (T',T)$, $|y| < A'$
and $|\tau | < B'$, where $A', B'> 0$ are constants depending upon~$T'$. The
proof uses the extension of a weak solution to a $B^{s;p,p}$-type solution in a
domain in $\mathbb{C}^N\times \mathbb{C}$, such that this extension satisfies
the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The holomorphic extension is obtained with a help
from holomorphic semigroups and maximal regularity theory for parabolic
problems in Besov interpolation spaces of $B^{s;p,p}$-type imbedded (densely
and continuously) into an $L^p$-type Lebesgue space. Applications include risk

cosmological parameter inference, assuming hypothetical measurements of the
projected correlation function of galaxies, $w_{\rm p}(R)$, and the
galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, $\Delta\!\Sigma(R)$, from the spectroscopic SDSS
galaxies and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Year1 (HSC-Y1) galaxies. To do this, we use
\textsc{Dark Emulator} developed in Nishimichi et al. based on an ensemble of
$N$-body simulations, which is an emulation package enabling a fast, accurate
computation of halo clustering quantities for flat-geometry $w$CDM cosmologies.
Adopting the halo occupation distribution, the emulator allows us to obtain
model predictions of $\Delta\!\Sigma$ and $w_{\rm p}$ for the SDSS-like
galaxies at a few CPU seconds for an input set of parameters. We present
performance and validation of the method by carrying out Markov Chain Monte
Carlo analyses of the mock signals measured from a variety of mock catalogs
that mimic the SDSS and HSC-Y1 galaxies. We show that the halo model method can
recover the underlying true cosmological parameters to within the 68\% credible
interval, except for the mocks including the assembly bias effect (although we
consider the unrealistically-large amplitude of assembly bias effect). Even for
the assembly bias mock, we demonstrate that the cosmological parameters can be
recovered {\it if} the analysis is restricted to scales $R\gtrsim 10~h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc}$. We also show that, by using a single population of source galaxies to
infer the relative strengths of $\Delta\!\Sigma$ for multiple lens samples at
different redshifts, the joint probes method allows for self-calibration of
photometric redshift errors and multiplicative shear bias. Thus we conclude
that the emulator-based halo model method can be safely applied to the HSC-Y1
dataset, achieving a precision of $\sigma(S_8)\simeq 0.04$.

entanglement harvesting of both a pair of inertial and uniformly accelerated
detectors locally interacting with vacuum massless scalar fields subjected to a
perfectly reflecting plane boundary. We find that the presence of the boundary
generally degrades the harvested entanglement when two detectors are very close
to the boundary. However, when the distance between detectors and the boundary
becomes comparable to the interaction duration parameter, the amount of the
harvested entanglement approaches a peak, which even goes beyond that without a
boundary. Remarkably, the parameter space of the detectors' separation and the
magnitude of acceleration that allows
  entanglement harvesting to occur is enlarged due to the presence of the
boundary. In this sense, the boundary plays a double-edged role on entanglement
harvesting,
  degrading in general the harvested entanglement while enlarging the
entanglement harvesting-achievable parameter space.
  A comparison of three different acceleration scenarios of the detectors with
respect to the boundary, i.e., parallel, anti-parallel and mutually
perpendicular acceleration, shows that the phenomenon of entanglement
harvesting crucially depends on the acceleration, the separation between two
detectors and the detectors' distance from the boundary.

optimal (DSO) traffic assignment with fixed departure times. We first formulate
the DSO traffic assignment problem as a strategic game wherein atomic users
select routes that minimise their marginal social costs, called a 'DSO game'.
By utilising the fact that the DSO game is a potential game, we prove that a
globally optimal state is a stochastically stable state under the logit
response dynamics, and the better/best response dynamics converges to a locally
optimal state. Furthermore, as an application of DSO assignment, we examine
characteristics of the evolutionary implementation scheme of marginal cost
pricing. Through theoretical comparison with a fixed pricing scheme, we found
the following properties of the evolutionary implementation scheme: (i) the
total travel time decreases smoother to an efficient traffic state as
congestion externalities are perfectly internalised; (ii) a traffic state would
reach a more efficient state as the globally optimal state is stabilised.
Numerical experiments also suggest that these properties make the evolutionary
scheme robust in the sense that they prevent a traffic state from going to
worse traffic states with high total travel times.

Markov chain Monte Carlo literature -- adaptive Metropolis sampler and
two-stage Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The proposed sampling method will be
particularly very useful for high-dimensional posterior sampling in Bayesian
models with expensive likelihoods. In the first stage of the proposed
algorithm, an adaptive proposal is used based on the previously sampled states
and the corresponding acceptance probability is computed based on an
approximated inexpensive target density. The true expensive target density is
evaluated while computing the second stage acceptance probability only if the
proposal is accepted in the first stage. The adaptive nature of the algorithm
guarantees faster convergence of the chain and very good mixing properties. On
the other hand, the two-stage approach helps in rejecting the bad proposals in
the inexpensive first stage, making the algorithm computationally efficient. As
the proposals are dependent on the previous states the chain loses its Markov
property, but we prove that it retains the desired ergodicity property. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing algorithms

samples rivaling the quality of recent GAN-based approaches. However, the
softmax classifier that JEM exploits is inherently discriminative and its
latent feature space is not well formulated as probabilistic distributions,
which may hinder its potential for image generation and incur training
instability. We hypothesize that generative classifiers, such as Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), might be more suitable for image generation since
generative classifiers model the data generation process explicitly. This paper
therefore investigates an LDA classifier for image classification and
generation. In particular, the Max-Mahalanobis Classifier (MMC), a special case
of LDA, fits our goal very well. We show that our Generative MMC (GMMC) can be
trained discriminatively, generatively, or jointly for image classification and

state-of-the-art discriminative and generative performances, while
outperforming JEM in calibration, adversarial robustness, and

have contributed to the autonomic computing knowledge base in search of a new
kind of system -- a self-adaptive system (SAS). These systems are characterized
by being context-aware and can act on that awareness. The actions carried out
could be on the system or on the context (or environment). The underlying goal
of a SAS is the sustained achievement of its goals despite changes in its
environment.
  Objective: Despite a number of literature reviews on specific aspects of SASs
ranging from their requirements to quality attributes, we lack a systematic
understanding of the current state of the art.
  Method: This paper contributes a systematic literature review into
self-adaptive systems using the dblp computer science bibliography as a
database. We filtered the records systematically in successive steps to arrive
at 293 relevant papers. Each paper was critically analyzed and categorized into
an attribute matrix. This matrix consisted of five categories, with each
category having multiple attributes. The attributes of each paper, along with
the summary of its contents formed the basis of the literature review that
spanned 30 years.
  Results: We characterize the maturation process of the research area from
theoretical papers over practical implementations to more holistic and generic
approaches, frameworks, and exemplars, applied to areas such as networking, web
services, and robotics, with much of the recent work focusing on IoT and IaaS.
  Conclusion: While there is an ebb and flow of application domains, domains
like bio-inspired approaches, security, and cyber physical systems showed
promise to grow heading into the 2020s.

theory and quantum mechanics, are $p\times p$ unitary matrices given by the
diagonal matrix whose entries are the $p$-th roots of unity and the cyclic
shift matrix. Weyl's unitaries, which we denote by $\mathfrak u$ and $\mathfrak
v$, satisfy $\mathfrak u^p=\mathfrak v^p=1_p$ (the $p\times p$ identity matrix)
and the commutation relation $\mathfrak u\mathfrak v=\zeta \mathfrak v\mathfrak
u$, where $\zeta$ is a primitive $p$-th root of unity. We prove that Weyl's
unitary matrices are universal in the following sense: if $u$ and $v$ are any
$d\times d$ unitary matrices such that $u^p= v^p=1_d$ and $ u v=\zeta vu$, then
there exists a unital completely positive linear map $\phi:\mathcal M_p(\mathbb
C)\rightarrow\mathcal M_d(\mathbb C)$ such that $\phi(\mathfrak u)= u$ and
$\phi(\mathfrak v)=v$. We also show, moreover, that any two pairs of $p$-th
order unitary matrices that satisfy the Weyl commutation relation are
completely order equivalent.
  When $p=2$, the Weyl matrices are two of the three Pauli matrices from
quantum mechanics. It was recently shown that $g$-tuples of Pauli-Weyl-Brauer
unitaries are universal for all $g$-tuples of anticommuting selfadjoint unitary
matrices; however, we show here that the analogous result fails for positive
integers $p>2$.
  Finally, we show that the Weyl matrices are extremal in their matrix range,
using recent ideas from noncommutative convexity theory.

(e.g., function and location) of a sensor needed for deploying smart building
applications. Sensor names, however, are curated in a building vendor-specific
manner using different structures and vocabularies that are often esoteric.
They thus require tremendous manual effort to annotate on a per-building basis;
even to just segment these sensor names into meaningful chunks. In this paper,
we propose a fully automated self-supervised framework, Sensei, which can learn
to segment sensor names without any human annotation. Specifically, we employ a
neural language model to capture the underlying sensor naming structure and
then induce self-supervision based on information from the language model to
build the segmentation model. Extensive experiments on five real-world
buildings comprising thousands of sensors demonstrate the superiority of Sensei
over baseline methods.

a magnetized pre-stellar core using non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations including ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation. The dynamical
contraction of the pre-stellar core ultimately leads to the formation of a
first hydrostatic core, after ambipolar diffusion decouples the magnetic field
from the predominantly neutral gas. The hydrostatic core accumulates angular
momentum from the infalling material, evolving into a rotationally supported
torus; this `first hydrostatic torus' then forms an accreting protostar and a
rotationally supported disc. The disc spreads out by gravitational instability,
reaching $\sim$30 au in diameter at $\sim$3 kyr after protostar formation. The
total mass and angular momentum of the protostar-disc system are determined
mainly by accretion of gas from an infalling pseudo-disc, which has low
specific angular momentum because of magnetic braking; their removal from the
protostar-disc system by outflow and disc magnetic braking are negligible, in
part because the magnetic field is poorly coupled there. The redistribution of
angular momentum within the protostar-disc system is facilitated mainly by
gravitational instability; this allows formation of relatively large discs even
when the specific angular momentum of infalling material is low. We argue that
such discs should remain marginally unstable as they grow (with Toomre $Q\sim
1$-$2$), an idea that is broadly consistent with recent observational estimates
for Class 0/I discs. We discuss the numerical convergence of our results, and
show that properly treating the inner boundary condition is crucial for
achieving convergence at an acceptable computational cost.

Deep Learning (DL) in various domains to solve real-world problems. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is the application of DL in the domain of
Reinforcement Learning (RL). Like any software systems, DRL applications can
fail because of faults in their programs. In this paper, we present the first
attempt to categorize faults occurring in DRL programs. We manually analyzed
761 artifacts of DRL programs (from Stack Overflow posts and GitHub issues)
developed using well-known DRL frameworks (OpenAI Gym, Dopamine, Keras-rl,
Tensorforce) and identified faults reported by developers/users. We labeled and
taxonomized the identified faults through several rounds of discussions. The
resulting taxonomy is validated using an online survey with 19
developers/researchers. To allow for the automatic detection of faults in DRL
programs, we have defined a meta-model of DRL programs and developed DRLinter,
a model-based fault detection approach that leverages static analysis and graph
transformations. The execution flow of DRLinter consists in parsing a DRL
program to generate a model conforming to our meta-model and applying detection
rules on the model to identify faults occurrences. The effectiveness of
DRLinter is evaluated using 15 synthetic DRLprograms in which we injected
faults observed in the analyzed artifacts of the taxonomy. The results show
that DRLinter can successfully detect faults in all synthetic faulty programs.

the techniques of pump laser conveying and two-point locking, we implement
re-generation of a Kerr soliton microcomb that faithfully clones the frequency

leveraging the coherence-cloned soliton microcombs as carriers and local

traditional digital processes for frequency offset estimation is totally
dispensed with, and carrier phase estimation is substantially simplified via
slowed-down phase estimation rate per channel and joint phase estimation among
multiple channels. Our work reveals that, in addition to providing a multitude
of laser tones, regulating the frequency and phase of Kerr soliton microcombs

coupled to the standard model so that elastic scattering between dark matter

detection experiments are analyzed according to that assumption. We show that
when the fundamental DM-baryon interaction is attractive, dark matter-nucleus
scattering is non-perturbative in much of the relevant parameter range. The
cross section exhibits rich resonant behavior with a highly non-trivial
dependence on atomic mass; furthermore, the extended rather than point-like
nature of nuclei significantly impacts the cross sections. The repulsive case
also requires full numerical calculation. These non-perturbative effects change
existing constraints.
  Near a resonance value of the parameters, the cross section has non-trivial
velocity dependence rather than the usual $\sigma \sim v^0$; we take the
velocity dependence into account. (However doing so has little impact on
current constraints.)
  We report the corrected exclusion regions superseding previous limits from
XQC, CRESST Surface Run, CMB power spectrum and extensions with Lyman-$\alpha$

than previous bounds in the literature, while others become stronger. Gaps
which open by correct treatment of some particular constraint can sometimes be
closed using a different constraint. We also discuss the dependence on mediator
mass and give approximate expressions for the velocity dependence near a
resonance. Sexaquark ($uuddss$) DM with mass around 2 GeV, which exchanges QCD
mesons with baryons, remains unconstrained for most of the parameter space of
interest.

trade-off between gradient/sampling complexity and communication complexity. We
propose new algorithms whose gradient and sampling complexities are graph
topology invariant while their communication complexities remain optimal. For
convex smooth deterministic problems, we propose a primal dual sliding (PDS)
algorithm that computes an $\epsilon$-solution with
$O((\tilde{L}/\epsilon)^{1/2})$ gradient and
$O((\tilde{L}/\epsilon)^{1/2}+\|\mathcal{A}\|/\epsilon)$ communication
complexities, where $\tilde{L}$ is the smoothness parameter of the objective
and $\mathcal{A}$ is related to either the graph Laplacian or the transpose of
the oriented incidence matrix of the communication network. The results can be
improved to $O((\tilde{L}/\mu)^{1/2}\log(1/\epsilon))$ and
$O((\tilde{L}/\mu)^{1/2}\log(1/\epsilon) + \|\mathcal{A}\|/\epsilon^{1/2})$
respectively with $\mu$-strong convexity. We also propose a stochastic variant,
the primal dual sliding (SPDS) algorithm for problems with stochastic
gradients. The SPDS algorithm utilizes the mini-batch technique and enables the
agents to perform sampling and communication simultaneously. It computes a
stochastic $\epsilon$-solution with $O((\tilde{L}/\epsilon)^{1/2} +
(\sigma/\epsilon)^2)$ sampling complexity, which can be improved to
$O((\tilde{L}/\mu)^{1/2}\log(1/\epsilon) + \sigma^2/\epsilon)$ with strong
convexity. Here $\sigma^2$ is the variance. The communication complexities of
SPDS remain the same as that of the deterministic case. All the aforementioned
gradient and sampling complexities match the lower complexity bounds for
centralized convex smooth optimization and are independent of the network
structure. To the best of our knowledge, these gradient and sampling
complexities have not been obtained before for decentralized optimization over
a constraint feasible set.

to accelerate the solution of combinatorial optimization problems by expressing
these problems as a ground-state search of the Ising model. A common theme of
such Ising Machines is to tailor the physics of underlying hardware to the
mathematics of the Ising model to improve some aspect of performance that is
measured in speed to solution, energy consumption per solution or area
footprint of the adopted hardware. One such approach to build an Ising spin, or
a binary stochastic neuron (BSN), is a compact mixed-signal unit based on a
low-barrier nanomagnet based design that uses a single magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) and three transistors (3T-1MTJ) where the MTJ functions as a stochastic
resistor (1SR). Such a compact unit can drastically reduce the area footprint
of BSNs while promising massive scalability by leveraging the existing Magnetic
RAM (MRAM) technology that has integrated 1T-1MTJ cells in ~Gbit densities. The
3T-1SR design however can be realized using different materials or devices that
provide naturally fluctuating resistances. Extending previous work, we evaluate
hardware BSNs from this general perspective by classifying necessary and
sufficient conditions to design a fast and energy-efficient BSN that can be
used in scaled Ising Machine implementations. We connect our device analysis to
systems-level metrics by emphasizing hardware-independent figures-of-merit such
as flips per second and dissipated energy per random bit that can be used to
classify any Ising Machine.

theoretical investigation of the period-doubling bifurcation in spatiotemporal

observed that the pulse train modulation varies with the transverse-mode, and
the output beam profile fluctuates rapidly and periodically. The numerical

the mode-dependent saturable absorption effect, and the experimental results

learning models. When applying neural networks to multi-category
classification, the correlations among different categories are often ignored.
For example, in text generation, a language model makes a choice of each new
word based only on the former selection of its context. In this scenario, the
link statistics information of concurrent words based on a corpus (an analogy
of the natural way of expression) is also valuable in choosing the next word,
which can help to improve the sentence's fluency and smoothness. To fully
explore such important information, we propose a graph softmax function for

dominated by both the language model and graphical text relationships among

incorporate the concurrent relationship into the language model. The total
variation of the generated words should be small locally. We apply the proposed

often challenging to accurately model engineering structures with intricate
geometric features and inhomogeneous material properties. For such cases, this
paper proposes a novel method to estimate group velocities from experimental
data-driven models. Experimental frequency response functions (FRFs) are used
to develop data-driven models, {which are then used to estimate dispersion
curves}. The advantages of this approach over other traditionally used
transient techniques stem from the need to conduct only steady-state
experiments. In comparison, transient experiments often need a higher-sampling
rate for wave-propagation applications and are more susceptible to noise.
  The vector-fitting (VF) algorithm is adopted to develop data-driven models
from experimental in-plane and out-of-plane FRFs of a one-dimensional
structure. The quality of the corresponding data-driven estimates is evaluated
using an analytical Timoshenko beam as a baseline. The data-driven model (using
the out-of-plane FRFs) estimates the anti-symmetric ($A_0$) group velocity with
a maximum error of $4\%$ over a 40~kHz frequency band. In contrast, group
velocities estimated from transient experiments resulted in a maximum error of
$6\%$ over the same frequency band.

field fluctuations present in the hot QCD medium has been studied. A finite
quark chemical potential has been considered while modeling the hot QCD medium
counting the fact that the upcoming experimental facilities such as Anti-proton
and Ion Research (FAIR) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) are
expected to operate at finite baryon density and moderate temperature. The
effective kinetic theory approach has been adopted where the collisions have
been incorporated using the well defined collisional kernel, known as
Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK). To incorporate the non-ideal equations of state
(EoSs) effects/ medium interaction effects, an extended effective fugacity
model has been adopted. The momentum dependence of the energy change due to
fluctuation for the charm and bottom quark has been investigated at different
values of collision frequency and chemical potential. The results are exciting
as the heavy quarks are found to gain energy due to fluctuations while moving
through the produced medium at finite chemical potential and collision
frequency.

  Optimization","17 pages",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Stress and driving are a dangerous combination which can lead to crashes, as
evidenced by the large number of road traffic crashes that involve stress.
Motivated by the need to address the significant costs of driver stress, it is
essential to build a practical system that can classify driver stress level
with high accuracy. However, the performance of an accurate driving stress
levels classification system depends on hyperparameter optimization choices
such as data segmentation (windowing hyperparameters). The configuration
setting of hyperparameters, which has an enormous impact on the system
performance, are typically hand-tuned while evaluating the algorithm. This
tuning process is time consuming and often depends on personal experience.
There are also no generic optimal values for hyperparameters values. In this
work, we propose a meta-heuristic approach to support automated hyperparameter
optimization and provide a real-time driver stress detection system. This is
the first systematic study of optimizing windowing hyperparameters based on
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal in the domain of driving safety. Our approach is
to propose a framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to
select an optimal/near optimal windowing hyperparameters values. The
performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on two datasets: a public
dataset (DRIVEDB dataset) and our collected dataset using an advanced
simulator. DRIVEDB dataset was collected in a real time driving scenario, and
our dataset was collected using an advanced driving simulator in the control
environment. We demonstrate that optimising the windowing hyperparameters
yields significant improvement in terms of accuracy. The most accurate built
model applied to the public dataset and our dataset, based on the selected
windowing hyperparameters, achieved 92.12% and 77.78% accuracy, respectively.

branches of nuclear physics: nuclear structure and relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. At the heart of this connection is the recent discovery made at
particle colliders that the elliptic flow of outgoing hadrons in central
nucleus-nucleus collisions is strongly impacted by the quadrupole deformation
of the colliding nuclear species. I review the physics of the soft sector of
relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and I explain that the interpretation of
elliptic flow data in central $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au, $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U, and
$^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions requires a deep understanding the structure of
these ions. Subsequently, I introduce a technique that permits one to isolate
collision configurations in which the deformed shapes of the colliding nuclei
maximally break rotational (azimuthal) symmetry in the interaction region. This
allows me to construct observables that possess an unparalleled sensitivity to
the quadrupole deformation of the colliding ions, and thus to conclude that
nuclear experiments at high energy can be used to place new quantitative
constraints on the deformation of atomic nuclei. I emphasize the great
opportunities offered by potential collider experiments aimed at the systematic
study of nuclear deformation across the valley of stability.

inspiration from the psychology of human creativity for producing novel art.
First, we propose CIZSL-v1 as a creativity inspired model for generative ZSL.
We relate ZSL to human creativity by observing that ZSL is about recognizing
the unseen, and creativity is about creating a likable unseen. We introduce a
learning signal inspired by creativity literature that explores the unseen
space with hallucinated class-descriptions and encourages careful deviation of
their visual feature generations from seen classes while allowing knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes. Second, CIZSL-v2 is proposed as an
improved version of CIZSL-v1 for generative zero-shot learning. CIZSL-v2
consists of an investigation of additional inductive losses for unseen classes
along with a semantic guided discriminator. Empirically, we show consistently
that CIZSL losses can improve generative ZSL models on the challenging task of
generalized ZSL from a noisy text on CUB and NABirds datasets. We also show the
advantage of our approach to Attribute-based ZSL on AwA2, aPY, and SUN

positive mass gap solutions with broken or restored chiral symmetry,
respectively. In the iterative approach gap solutions exist which exhibit
restored chiral symmetry beyond a certain dynamical cut-off energy. A chirally
broken, non-chaotic domain with no emergent mass poles and hence with no
quasi-particle excitations exists below this energy cutoff. The transition
domain between these two energy separated domains is chaotic. As a result, the
dispersion relation is that of quarks with restored chiral symmetry, cut at a
dynamical energy scale, determined by fractal structures. We argue that the
chaotic origin of the infrared cut-off could hint at a chaotic nature of
confinement and the deconfinement phase transition.

classification by proposing a novel framework for discriminative graph
learning. To learn discriminative graphs, we invoke the assumption that signals
belonging to each class are smooth with respect to the corresponding graph
while maintaining non-smoothness with respect to the graphs corresponding to
other classes. Secondly, we extend our work to tackle increasingly dynamic
environments and real-time topology inference. We develop a proximal gradient
(PG) method which can be adapted to situations where the data are acquired
on-the-fly. Beyond discrimination, this is the first work that addresses the
problem of dynamic graph learning from smooth signals where the sought network
alters slowly. The validation of the proposed frameworks is comprehensively
investigated using both synthetic and real data.

the GW level of approximation. In this work, we apply this method to examine
the substrate effect on excitonic excitation and recombination of 2D materials
by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We predict the nonrigid shift of 1s and
2s excitonic peaks due to substrate screening, in excellent agreements with
experiments. We then reveal its underlying physical mechanism through 2D
hydrogen model and the linear relation between quasiparticle gaps and exciton
binding energies when varying the substrate screening. At the end, we calculate
the exciton radiative lifetime of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride with
various substrates at zero and room temperature, as well as the one of WS2

semantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly observable, the model
parameters can only be optimized by differentiating the error between
demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost estimate. We
propose a new model of expert behavior that enables error minimization using a
closed-form subgradient computed only over a subset of promising states via a
motion planning algorithm. Our approach allows generalizing the learned
behavior to new environments with new spatial configurations of the semantic
categories. We analyze the different components of our model in a minigrid

implementing the FL in IoV networks, such as dynamic activities and diverse
quality-of-information (QoI) from a large number of SVs, VSP's limited payment
budget, and profit competition among SVs. In this paper, we propose a novel
dynamic FL-based economic framework for an IoV network to address these

determine a set of the best SVs for the FL process according to the
significance of their current locations and information history at each
learning round. Then, each selected SV can collect on-road information and
offer a payment contract to the VSP based on its collected QoI. For that, we
develop a multi-principal one-agent contract-based policy to maximize the
profits of the VSP and learning SVs under the VSP's limited payment budget and
asymmetric information between the VSP and SVs. Through experimental results
using real-world on-road datasets, we show that our framework can converge 57%
faster (even with only 10% of active SVs in the network) and obtain much higher
social welfare of the network (up to 27.2 times) compared with those of other

their robust structure. With increase in sensitivity of LIGO detectors we
expect many more sources of gravitational waves in the universe to be detected.
However, deep learning networks are trained only once. When used for
classification task, deep neural networks are trained to predict only a fixed
number of classes. Therefore, when a new type of gravitational wave is to be

networks can be used to learn data with simple patterns but fail to give good
results with increase in complexity of data. Remodelling the neural network
with detection of each new type of GW is highly infeasible. In this letter, I

the resulting subproblems can be solved by using effective optimization methods
in a parallel framework. Here, the differential dynamic programming (DDP)
algorithm is capable of addressing the nonlinearity of the system dynamics
rather effectively; and the nonconvex coupling constraints with small

proposed approach effectively realizes real-time implementation and thus also
extra assurance of driving safety is provided. In addition, two transportation

computational burden, which hinders the practical implementation in real time.
This paper proposes the use of sequential convex programming (SCP), which is a
powerful approach to solving the nonlinear and nonconvex MPC problem in real
time. To appropriately deploy the methodology, as a first stage, SCP requires
linearization and discretization when addressing the nonlinear dynamics of the
system model adequately. Based on the linearization and discretization, the
original MPC problem can be transformed into a quadratically constrained
quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. Besides, SCP also involves
convexification to handle the associated nonconvex constraints. Thus, the
nonconvex QCQP can be reduced to a quadratic programming (QP) problem that can
be solved rather quickly. Therefore, the computational efficiency is suitably
improved despite the existence of nonlinear and nonconvex characteristics,
whereby the implementation is realized in real time. Furthermore, simulation

insufficient training tasks resulting in over-parameterized models with poor
generalization performance for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose a
Bayesian neural network based MAML algorithm, which we refer to as the B-SMALL
algorithm. The proposed framework incorporates a sparse variational loss term
alongside the loss function of MAML, which uses a sparsifying approximated KL
divergence as a regularizer. We demonstrate the performance of B-MAML using
classification and regression tasks, and highlight that training a sparsifying
BNN using MAML indeed improves the parameter footprint of the model while
performing at par or even outperforming the MAML approach. We also illustrate
applicability of our approach in distributed sensor networks, where sparsity
and meta-learning can be beneficial.

we show that even the most extreme black hole known, P\=oniu\=a'ena, can grow
from a $10 M_\odot$ seed black hole via Eddington-limited luminous accretion,
provided that accretion proceeds almost continuously, but is composed of a
large number of episodes with individually-uncorrelated initial directions.
This chaotic accretion scenario ensures that the growing black hole spins
slowly, with the dimensionless spin parameter $a \lesssim 0.2$, so its
radiative efficiency is also low, $\epsilon \simeq 0.06$. If accretion is even
partially aligned, with $20-40\%$ of accretion events happening in the same
direction, the black hole spin and radiative efficiency are much higher,
leading to significantly slower growth. We suggest that the chaotic accretion
scenario can be completely falsified only if a $10^9 M_\odot$ black hole is
discovered at $z \geq 9.1$, approximately $150$~Myr before P\=oniu\=a'ena. The
space density of extreme quasars suggests that only a very small fraction,
roughly one in $4 \times 10^7$, of seed black holes need to encounter
favourable growth conditions to produce the observed extreme quasars. Other
seed black holes grow much less efficiently, mainly due to lower duty cycles,
so are much more difficult to detect.

mixing. After about 17 convective turnover times, the magnetic field is
approaching saturation levels in the oxygen shell with an average field
strength of $\mathord{\sim}10^{10}\, \mathrm{G}$, and does not reach kinetic
equipartition. The field remains dominated by small to medium scales, and the
dipole field strength at the base of the oxygen shell is only $10^{9}\,

tensor mirror those of the Reynolds stress tensor, but are about one order of
magnitude smaller. The shear flow at the oxygen-neon shell interface creates
relatively strong fields parallel to the convective boundary, which noticeably
inhibit the turbulent entrainment of neon into the oxygen shell. The reduced
ingestion of neon lowers the nuclear energy generation rate in the oxygen shell

effect, we find that magnetic fields do not appreciably alter the flow inside

physicochemical processes (surface group dissociation, ion adsorption, etc...)
occurring in the few layers of molecules at the interface between the solid and

experimental challenges in probing interfacial charge dynamics with
sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we resolve at the
single-charge scale, the dynamics of proton charges at the interface between an
hBN crystal and binary mixtures of water and organic amphiphilic solvents (e.g.
alcohol), evidencing a dramatic influence of solvation on interfacial dynamics.
Our observations rely on the application of spectral Single Molecule
Localization Microscopy (sSMLM) to two types of optically active defects at the
hBN surface, which act as intrinsic optical markers for both surface
protonation and interaction with apolar alkyl groups of the organic solvent. We
use sSMLM to reveal interfacial proton charge transport as a succession of
jumps between the titratable surface defects, mediated by the transport of the
solvated proton charge along the solid/liquid interface. By changing the
relative concentration of water in binary mixtures, we evidence a non-trivial
effect on interfacial proton charge dynamics, leading at intermediate water
concentration to an increased affinity of the proton charge to the solid
surface, accompanied by an increased surface diffusivity. These measurements
confirm the strong role of solvation on interfacial proton charge transport and
establish the potential of single-molecule localization techniques to probe a
wide range of dynamic processes at solid/liquid interfaces.

However, the trade-off between the cost and performance is often a challenge in

  In this paper, using real indoor activity and mobility traces, floor plans,

the trade-offs between the cost of sensor deployments and expected labeling

that the performance of the desired context-aware task is affected by different

  Optimization","27 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The low-rank stochastic semidefinite optimization has attracted rising
attention due to its wide range of applications. The nonconvex reformulation
based on the low-rank factorization, significantly improves the computational
efficiency but brings some new challenge to the analysis. The stochastic
variance reduced gradient (SVRG) method has been regarded as one of the most
effective methods. SVRG in general consists of two loops, where a reference
full gradient is first evaluated in the outer loop and then used to yield a
variance reduced estimate of the current gradient in the inner loop. Two
options have been suggested to yield the output of the inner loop, where Option
I sets the output as its last iterate, and Option II yields the output via
random sampling from all the iterates in the inner loop. However, there is a
significant gap between the theory and practice of SVRG when adapted to the
stochastic semidefinite programming (SDP). SVRG practically works better with
Option I, while most of existing theoretical results focus on Option II. In
this paper, we fill this gap via exploiting a new semi-stochastic variant of
the original SVRG with Option I adapted to the semidefinite optimization.
Equipped with this, we establish the global linear submanifold convergence
(i.e., converging exponentially fast to a submanifold of a global minimum under
the orthogonal group action) of the proposed SVRG method, given a provable
initialization scheme and under certain smoothness and restricted strongly
convex assumptions. Our analysis includes the effects of the mini-batch size
and update frequency in the inner loop as well as two practical step size
strategies, the fixed and stabilized Barzilai-Borwein step sizes. Some
numerical results in matrix sensing demonstrate the efficiency of proposed SVRG
method outperforming Option II counterpart as well as others.

Therefore, we propose a hypothesis that the expected evacuation distance will

conduct an experiment in a 12-story office building, that is, to study whether
there would be an influence and what kind of influence would be caused on speed

the results, we find that with the increase of expected evacuation distance,

milder growing weighting strategy on squared past gradient, in which weights
grow linearly. Based on this idea, we propose weighted adaptive gradient method

prove that WADA can achieve a weighted data-dependent regret bound, which could
be better than the original regret bound of ADAGRAD when the gradients decrease

advantages: (i) it resolves the spurious vanishing problem without accessing
the coefficients of terms, resulting in a drastically small basis; (ii) it
provides the basis computation with a scaling consistency that ensures that
input scaling does not lead to an essential change in the output; and (iii) it
is provably robust against input perturbations, where the upper bound of error
is determined only by the magnitude of the perturbations. Existing studies did
not achieve any of these. As further applications of gradient information, we
propose a monomial-agnostic basis reduction method to remove redundant
polynomials and a regularization method to manage positive-dimensional ideals.
We confirmed the effectiveness of (i)--(iii) through numerical experiments.

introduce the prior distribution to the weights in the Tensor Network and
predict the labels of the new observations by the posterior predictive

portions of PSP's fourth solar encounter, likely due to the proximity to the
heliospheric current sheet (HCS) in the outbound period. Near the HCS, in the
streamer belt wind, the turbulence was found to have lower amplitudes, higher
magnetic compressibility, a steeper magnetic field spectrum (with spectral
index close to -5/3 rather than -3/2), a lower Alfv\'enicity, and a ""1/f"" break
at much lower frequencies. These are also features of slow wind at 1 au,
suggesting the near-Sun streamer belt wind to be the prototypical slow solar

~4{\deg} from the HCS, suggesting ~8{\deg} as the full-width of the streamer

However, existing 5G handoff algorithms often do not consider the computational

algorithm still significantly reduces the number of large delays, caused by
congestion at MECs, at the expense of a small increase in transmission delay.

Riemannian-geometric context, the stability/instability of the dynamics depends
on the curvature properties of the ambient manifold and is investigated by
means of the Jacobi--Levi-Civita (JLC) equation for geodesic spread. It is
confirmed that the dominant mechanism at the ground of chaotic dynamics is
parametric instability due to curvature variations along the geodesics. A
comparison is reported of the outcomes of the JLC equation written also for the
Jacobi metric on configuration space and for another metric due to Eisenhart on
an extended configuration space-time. This has been applied to the
H\'enon-Heiles model, a two-degrees of freedom system. Then the study has been
extended to the 1D classical Heisenberg XY model at a large number of degrees
of freedom. Both the advantages and drawbacks of this geometrization of
Hamiltonian dynamics are discussed. Finally, a quick hint is put forward

system in the background of self-interacting Brans-Dicke gravity. We measure
complexity of the structure in terms of inhomogeneous energy density,
anisotropic pressure and massive scalar field. For this purpose, we formulate
structure scalars by orthogonally splitting the Riemann tensor. We show that
self-gravitating models collapsing homologously follow the simplest mode of
evolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effect of scalar field on the
complexity and evolution of non-dissipative as well as dissipative systems. The
criteria under which the system deviates from the initial state of zero
complexity is also discussed. It is concluded that complexity of the sphere
increases in self-interacting Brans-Dicke gravity because the homologous model
is not shear-free.

protocols, and describing how systems evolve in space and time. As such, they
play a key role in the manipulation of quantum resources, and they are often
resources themselves, called dynamical resources. This forces us to go beyond
standard resource theories of quantum states. Here we provide a rigorous
foundation for dynamical resource theories, where the resources into play are
quantum channels, explaining how to manipulate dynamical resources with free
superchannels. In particular, when the set of free superchannels is convex, we
present a novel construction of an infinite and complete family of convex
resource monotones, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for
convertibility under free superchannels. After showing that the conversion
problem in convex dynamical resource theories can be solved with conic linear
programming, we define various resource-theoretic protocols for dynamical
resources. These results serve as the framework for the study of concrete
examples of theories of dynamical resources, such as dynamical entanglement
theory.

in recent years, it is still challenging to balance real-time performance and

upsampling module based on the slicing operation in the learned bilateral grid.
The slicing layer is parameter-free, which allows us to obtain a high quality
cost volume of high resolution from a low-resolution cost volume under the
guide of the learned guidance map efficiently. The proposed cost volume
upsampling module can be seamlessly embedded into many existing stereo matching
networks, such as GCNet, PSMNet, and GANet. The resulting networks are
accelerated several times while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore,
we design a real-time network (named BGNet) based on this module, which
outperforms existing published real-time deep stereo matching networks, as well
as some complex networks on the KITTI stereo datasets. The code is available at

ultra-high bandwidth of operation with moderate training efforts. Several
optoelectronic demonstrations reported state of the art performances for hard
tasks as speech recognition, object classification and time series prediction.
Scaling these systems in space and time faces challenges in control complexity,
size and power demand, which can be relieved by integrated optical solutions.
Silicon photonics can be the disruptive technology to achieve this goal.
However, the experimental demonstrations have been so far focused on spatially
distributed reservoirs, where the massive use of splitters/combiners and the
interconnection loss limits the number of nodes. Here, we propose and validate
an all optical RC scheme based on a silicon microring (MR) and time
multiplexing. The input layer is encoded in the intensity of a pump beam, which
is nonlinearly transferred to the free carrier concentration in the MR and
imprinted on a secondary probe. We harness the free carrier dynamics to create
a chain-like reservoir topology with 50 virtual nodes. We give proof of concept
demonstrations of RC by solving two nontrivial tasks: the delayed XOR and the
classification of Iris flowers. This forms the basic building block from which
larger hybrid spatio-temporal reservoirs with thousands of nodes can be
realized with a limited set of resources.

FS sub-network. Consequently, the proposed integrated network can be tested in
two ways. We propose a novel two-step dense attention mechanism to discover
attribute-guided local visual features. We introduce new mutual learning
between the sub-networks to exploit mutually beneficial information for

analysis of constrained physical systems subjected to external forces.
Consequently, BVPs frequently emerge in nearly every engineering discipline and
span problem domains including fluid mechanics, electromagnetics, quantum

leading method for solving linear BVPs that enables facile computation of new
solutions to systems under any external forcing. However, fundamental Green's
function solutions for nonlinear BVPs are not feasible since linear
superposition no longer holds. In this work, we propose a flexible deep
learning approach to solve nonlinear BVPs using a dual-autoencoder
architecture. The autoencoders discover an invertible coordinate transform that
linearizes the nonlinear BVP and identifies both a linear operator $L$ and
Green's function $G$ which can be used to solve new nonlinear BVPs. We find
that the method succeeds on a variety of nonlinear systems including nonlinear
Helmholtz and Sturm--Liouville problems, nonlinear elasticity, and a 2D
nonlinear Poisson equation. The method merges the strengths of the universal
approximation capabilities of deep learning with the physics knowledge of
Green's functions to yield a flexible tool for identifying fundamental
solutions to a variety of nonlinear systems.

the primary objective is to categorise observations into similar clusters. In
recent decades, several algorithms and methods have been developed for
analysing clustered data. We notice that most of these techniques
deterministically define a cluster based on the value of the attributes,
distance, and density of homogenous and single-featured datasets. However,
these definitions are not successful in adding clear semantic meaning to the
clusters produced. Evolutionary operators and statistical and
multi-disciplinary techniques may help in generating meaningful clusters. Based
on this premise, we propose a new evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECAStar)
based on social class ranking and meta-heuristic algorithms for stochastically
analysing heterogeneous and multiple-featured datasets. The ECAStar is
integrated with recombinational evolutionary operators, Levy flight
optimisation, and some statistical techniques, such as quartiles and
percentiles, as well as the Euclidean distance of the K-means algorithm.
Experiments are conducted to evaluate the ECAStar against five conventional
approaches: K-means (KM), K-meansPlusPlus (KMPlusPlus), expectation
maximisation (EM), learning vector quantisation (LVQ), and the genetic
algorithm for clusteringPlusPlus (GENCLUSTPlusPlus).

variations in the measurement of the gravitational constant. We have performed
