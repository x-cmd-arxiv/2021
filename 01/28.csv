to plan its distribution strategy. In this paper, we formulated a
multi-objective linear programming model to optimize vaccine distribution and
applied it to the agent-based version of our age-stratified and
quarantine-modified SEIR with non-linear incidence rates (ASQ-SEIR-NLIR)
compartmental model. Simulations were performed using COVID-19 data from Quezon
City and results were analyzed under various scenarios: (1) no vaccination, (2)
base vaccination (prioritizing essential workers and vulnerable population),
(3) prioritizing mobile workforce, (4) prioritizing elderly, and (5)
prioritizing mobile workforce and elderly; in terms of (a) reducing infection
rates and (b) reducing mortality incidence. After 10 simulations on
distributing 500,000 vaccine courses, results show that prioritizing mobile
workforce minimizes further infections by 24.14%, which is better than other
scenarios. On the other hand, prioritizing the elderly yields the highest
protection (439%) for the Quezon City population compared to other scenarios.
This could be due to younger people, when contracted the disease, has higher
chances of recovery than the elderly. Thus, this leads to reduction of
mortality cases.

automation, but little has examined how job contents evolve in the information
age as new technologies substitute for tasks, shifting required skills rather
than eliminating entire jobs. Here we explore the patterns and consequences of
changes in occupational skill contents and characterize occupations and workers
subject to the greatest re-skilling pressure. Recent research suggests that
high-skilled STEM and technology-intensive occupations have experienced the
highest rates of skill content change. Analyzing 727 occupations across 167
million job posts covering the near-universe of the U.S. online labor market
between 2010 and 2018, we find that when skill distance is accounted for,
re-skilling pressure is much higher for low-skilled occupations, no matter how
""low-skill: is defined, either by skill number, pay level, or education degree.
We investigate the implications of uneven occupational skill change on workers
and find that those from large labor markets and large employers experienced
less change, while non-white males in low-skill jobs are the most
demographically vulnerable. We conclude by discussing the broad potential of
our skill embedding model, which learns skill proximity from skill co-presence
across job posts and represents it as distance in the high-dimensional space of
complex human capital that corresponds with skilling costs for workers. This
model offers a fine-grained measure of the extent to which jobs evolve, and
also indicates in what direction job are evolving, as illustrated by the
decline in demand for human-interface skills and the rise for those at the
machine-interface.

$P_1$-approximation equations. In relatively optically-thin media the heat
propagation is supersonic,~i.e. hydrodynamic motion is negligible, and thus can
be described by the radiative transfer Boltzmann equation, coupled with the
material energy equation. However, the exact thermal radiative transfer problem
is still difficult to solve and requires massive simulation capabilities.
Hence, there still exists a need for adequate approximations that are
comparatively easy to carry out. Classic approximations, such as the classic
diffusion and classic $P_1$, fail to describe the correct heat wave velocity,
when the optical depth is not sufficiently high. Therefore, we use the recently
developed discontinuous asymptotic $P_1$ approximation, which is a
time-dependent analogy for the adjustment of the discontinuous asymptotic
diffusion for two different zones. This approximation was tested via several
benchmarks, showing better results than other common approximations, and has
also demonstrated a good agreement with a main Marshak wave experiment and its
Monte-Carlo gray simulation. Here we derive energy expansion of the
discontinuous asymptotic $P_1$ approximation in slab geometry, and test it with
numerous experimental results for propagating Marshak waves inside low density
foams. The new approximation describes the heat wave propagation with good
agreement. Furthermore, a comparison of the simulations to exact implicit
Monte-Carlo slab-geometry multi-group simulations, in this wide range of
experimental conditions, demonstrates the superiority of this approximation to
others.

magnetohydrodynamic wind models are thermally driven, while Alfv\'en waves act
as additional acceleration and heating mechanisms in the Alfv\'en wave driven
model. We confirm that an AW-driven model is required to reproduce the observed
bimodality of slow and fast solar winds. We are also able to reproduce the
observed anti-correlation between the terminal wind velocity and the coronal
source temperature with the AW-driven wind model. We also show that the wind
properties along an eleven-year cycle differ significantly from one model to
the other. The AW-driven model again shows the best agreement with
observational data. Indeed, solar surface magnetic field topology plays an
important role in the Alfv\'en wave driven wind model, as it enters directly
into the input energy sources via the Poynting flux. On the other hand, the
polytropic wind model is driven by an assumed pressure gradient; thus it is
relatively less sensitive to the surface magnetic field topology. Finally, we
note that the net torque spinning down the Sun exhibits the same trends in the
two models, showing that the polytropic approach still captures correctly the
essence of stellar winds.

to rely on reduced order models. Such approaches, in general, use measurement
data of one-time instance. However, oftentimes data available from sensors is
sequential and ignoring it results in information loss. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep learning based state estimation framework that learns from
sequential data. The proposed model structure consists of the recurrent cell to
pass information from different time steps enabling utilization of this
information to recover the full state. We illustrate that utilizing sequential
data allows for state recovery from only one or two sensors. For efficient
recovery of the state, the proposed approached is coupled with an auto-encoder
based reduced order model. We illustrate the performance of the proposed
approach using two examples and it is found to outperform other alternatives

receptors of the host cell are free to move over its membrane, allowing a local
change in their concentration. In the contact zone the membrane inflects and
forms an envelope around the virus. The created vesicle imports its cargo into
the cell. This paper assumes the diffusion equation accompanied by boundary
conditions requiring the conservation of binders to describe the process.
Moreover, it introduces a condition defining the energy balance at the front of
the adhesion zone. The latter yields the upper limit for the size of virus

We
investigate if its signature, which distinguishes between time and space, could
be a result of the dynamics rather than being built in already in the
formulation of a model. For short distances we formulate our model as a
Yang-Mills theory with fermions and vector fields. For the local gauge symmetry
we take the non-compact group SO(4,\,$\mathbb{C}$). The particular
representation of the vector field permits us to implement diffeomorphism
invariant kinetic terms. Geometry and general relativity emerge at large
distances due to a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry which induces
masses for the gauge bosons. The difference between time and space arises
directly from this spontaneous symmetry breaking. For a euclidean metric all
fields have a standard propagator at high momenta. Analytic continuation to a
Minkowski-metric is achieved by a change of field values. We conjecture that
this type of model could be consistent with unitarity and well behaved in the
short distance limit.

computation of the Wasserstein distance, methods for approximating the
Wasserstein distance using a tree metric have been proposed. These tree-based
methods allow fast comparisons of a large number of documents; however, they
are unsupervised and do not learn task-specific distances. In this work, we
propose the Supervised Tree-Wasserstein (STW) distance, a fast, supervised
metric learning method based on the tree metric. Specifically, we rewrite the
Wasserstein distance on the tree metric by the parent-child relationships of a
tree and formulate it as a continuous optimization problem using a contrastive
loss. Experimentally, we show that the STW distance can be computed fast, and
improves the accuracy of document classification tasks. Furthermore, the STW
distance is formulated by matrix multiplications, runs on a GPU, and is
suitable for batch processing. Therefore, we show that the STW distance is
extremely efficient when comparing a large number of documents.

not always work. We theoretically analyze the generalization performance and
propose a light-weight regularization term that avoids the high scales of node

ID$_{50}$). The counting of plaques or foci at a given dilution intuitively and
directly provides the concentration of infectious doses in the undiluted

example, it relies on one's judgement in distinguishing between two merged
plaques and a larger one, or between small plaques and staining artifacts. In
this regard, ED assays are more robust because one need only determine whether
infection occurred. The output of the ED assay, the 50% infectious dose
(ID$_{50}$), is calculated using either the Spearman-Karber (SK, 1908,1931) or
Reed-Muench (RM, 1938) mathematical approximations. However, these are often
miscalculated and their ID$_{50}$ approximation is biased. We propose that the
PFU and FFU assays be abandoned, and that the measured output of the ED assay,
the ID$_{50}$, be replaced by a more useful measure we coined Specific
INfections (SIN). We introduce a free, open-source web-application, midSIN,
that computes the SIN concentration in a virus sample from a standard ED assay,
requiring no changes to current experimental protocols. We demonstrate that the
SIN/mL of a sample reliably corresponds to the number of infections the sample
will cause per unit volume, and directly relates to the multiplicity of
infection. midSIN estimates are shown to be more accurate and robust than those
using the RM and SK approximations. The impact of ED plate design choices
(dilution factor, replicates per dilution) on measurement accuracy is also
explored. The simplicity of SIN as a measure and the greater accuracy of midSIN
make them an easy, superior replacement for the PFU, FFU, and ID$_{50}$

known, periodic stress variations provide important opportunities to learn
about the earthquake nucleation process. Yet, reliable detection of earthquake
periodicity is complicated by the presence of earthquake clustering due to
aftershocks and foreshocks. Existing methods for detecting periodicity in an
earthquake catalogue typically require the prior removal of these clustered
events. Declustering is a highly uncertain process, so declustering methods are
inherently non-unique. Incorrect declustering may remove some independent
events, or fail to remove some aftershocks or foreshocks, or both. These two
types of error could respectively lead to false negative or false positive
reporting of periodic seismicity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new method for detecting earthquake periodicity that does not require
declustering. Our approach is to modify the existing Schuster Spectrum Test

presence of clustered earthquakes within the catalogue without requiring their
identification and removal.

monitor the system's health. As the requirement to obtain a dataset from
rotating machines where all possible faults are explicitly labeled is difficult
to satisfy, we propose a method that focuses on the normal behavior of the
machine instead. We propose an autoencoder model-based method for condition
monitoring of rotating machines by using an anomaly detection approach. The
method learns the characteristics of a rotating machine using the normal
vibration signals to model the healthy state of the machine. A threshold-based
approach is then applied to the reconstruction error of unseen data, thus
enabling the detection of unseen anomalies. The proposed method can directly
extract the salient features from raw vibration signals and eliminate the need
for manually engineered features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method by employing two rotating machine datasets and the quality of
the automatically learned features is compared with a set of handcrafted
features by training an Isolation Forest model on either of these two sets.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed

behaviour of one of the brightest misaligned active galaxies in gamma-rays, NGC
1275 utilising 11 years of Fermi, and available Swift and AstroSat
observations. Based on the cumulative flux distribution of the gamma-ray
lightcurve, we identified four distinct activity states and noticed an increase
in the baseline flux during the first three states. Similar nature of the
increase in the average flux was also noticed in X-ray and UV bands. A large
flaring activity in gamma-rays was noticed in the fourth state. The source was
observed twice by AstroSat for shorter intervals (~days) during the longer
observing periods (~years) state 3 and 4. During AstroSat observing periods,
the source gamma-ray flux was higher than the average flux observed during
longer duration states. The increase in the average baseline flux from state 1
to state 3 can be explained considering a corresponding increase of jet
particle normalisation. The inverse Comptonisation of synchrotron photons
explained the average X-ray and gamma-ray emission by jet electrons during the
first three longer duration states. However, during the shorter duration
AstroSat observing periods, a shift of the synchrotron peak frequency was
noticed, and the synchrotron emission of jet electrons well explained the
observed X-ray flux.

can probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium
during the epoch of reionization, complementary to the 21 cm temperature
fluctuations. Previous study (Babich & Loeb 2005) estimated the strength of
polarization with a toy model and claimed that it can be detected with 1-month
observation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Here we revisit this
investigation with account of nonlinear terms due to inhomogeneous
reionization, using seminumerical reionization simulations to provide the
realistic estimation of the 21 cm TE and EE angular power spectra ($C^{\rm
TE}_\ell$ and $C^{\rm EE}_\ell$). We find that (1) both power spectra are
enhanced on sub-bubble scales but suppressed on super-bubble scales, compared
with previous results; (2) $C^{\rm TE}_\ell$ displays a zero-crossing at
$\ell<100$, and its angular scale is sensitive to the scale-dependence of H I
bias on large scales; (3) the ratios of the power spectrum to its maximum value
during reionization at a given $\ell$, i.e. $C^{\rm TE}_\ell / C^{\rm
TE}_{\ell,{\rm max}} $ and $C^{\rm EE}_{\ell}/C^{\rm EE}_{\ell,{\rm max}}$,
show robust correlations with the global ionized fraction. However, measurement
of this signal will be very challenging not only because the overall strength
is weaker than the sensitivity of SKA, but also because of the polarized
foregrounds from diffuse synchrotron emission, and Faraday rotation which
modifies the observed polarization. Nevertheless, the 21 cm linear polarization
signal may still likely be detectable through other approaches, e.g. its
cross-correlation with other probes.

studies devoted to equilibrium properties, by molecular dynamics simulations
based on validated and optimized interatomic potentials with the primary aim of
better understanding the nature of this universal relaxation process from a
dynamic heterogeneity (DH) perspective. The present relatively low temperature
and long-time simulations reveal a direct correspondence between the JG
$\beta$-relaxation time $\tau_{JG}$ and the lifetime of the mobile particle
clusters $\tau_M$, defined as in previous DH studies, a relationship dual to
the corresponding previously observed relationship between the
$\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ and the lifetime of immobile particle
clusters $\tau_{IM}$. Moreover, we find that the average diffusion coefficient
D nearly coincides with D$_{Al}$, of the smaller atomic species (Al), and that
the hopping time associated with D coincides with $\tau_{JG}$ to within
numerical uncertainty, both trends being in accord with experimental studies.
This indicates that the JG $\alpha$-relaxation is dominated by the smaller
atomic species and the observation of a direct relation between this relaxation
process and rate of molecular diffusion in GF materials at low temperatures
where the JG $\beta$-relaxation becomes the prevalent mode of structural
relaxation. As an unanticipated aspect of our study, we find that Al90Sm10

characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and
import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to
understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into
2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather
information from a relatively small (n = 19) but indicative group of producers.
The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority
of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been
unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also
add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply
challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses
the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and
automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although
automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry
(89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option
(32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently,
automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK's horticultural
workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The
conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative

Our
summarization approach retains only a user-specified proportion of the

so that they can be analyzed and processed effectively while preserving as many
of the node neighborhood properties as possible. Since many graph algorithms
are based on the neighborhood information available for each node, the idea is
to produce a smaller graph which can be used to allow these algorithms to
handle large graphs and run faster while providing good approximations.
Moreover, our compression allows users to control the size of the compressed
graph by adjusting the amount of information loss that can be tolerated. The
experiments conducted on various real and synthetic graphs show that our
compression reduces considerably the size of the graphs. Moreover, we conducted
several experiments on the obtained summaries using various graph algorithms
and applications, such as node embedding, graph classification and shortest
path approximations. The obtained results show interesting trade-offs between
the algorithms runtime speed-up and the precision loss.

within a specific context. Most existing methods for CAD use a single context
based on a set of user-specified contextual features. However, identifying the
right context can be very challenging in practice, especially in datasets, with
a large number of attributes. Furthermore, in real-world systems, there might
be multiple anomalies that occur in different contexts and, therefore, require
a combination of several ""useful"" contexts to unveil them. In this work, we
leverage active learning and ensembles to effectively detect complex contextual
anomalies in situations where the true contextual and behavioral attributes are
unknown. We propose a novel approach, called WisCon (Wisdom of the Contexts),
that automatically creates contexts from the feature set. Our method constructs
an ensemble of multiple contexts, with varying importance scores, based on the
assumption that not all useful contexts are equally so. Experiments show that
WisCon significantly outperforms existing baselines in different categories
(i.e., active classifiers, unsupervised contextual and non-contextual anomaly
detectors, and supervised classifiers) on seven datasets. Furthermore, the
results support our initial hypothesis that there is no single perfect context
that successfully uncovers all kinds of contextual anomalies, and leveraging
the ""wisdom"" of multiple contexts is necessary.

encoder for VL understanding, the pretraining of a universal encoder-decoder
for both VL understanding and generation remains challenging. The difficulty
originates from the inherently different peculiarities of the two disciplines,
e.g., VL understanding tasks capitalize on the unrestricted message passing
across modalities, while generation tasks only employ visual-to-textual message
passing. In this paper, we start with a two-stream decoupled design of
encoder-decoder structure, in which two decoupled cross-modal encoder and
decoder are involved to separately perform each type of proxy tasks, for
simultaneous VL understanding and generation pretraining. Moreover, for VL
pretraining, the dominant way is to replace some input visual/word tokens with
mask tokens and enforce the multi-modal encoder/decoder to reconstruct the
original tokens, but no mask token is involved when fine-tuning on downstream
tasks. As an alternative, we propose a primary scheduled sampling strategy that
elegantly mitigates such discrepancy via pretraining encoder-decoder in a
two-pass manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the compelling
generalizability of our pretrained encoder-decoder by fine-tuning on four VL
understanding and generation downstream tasks. Source code is available at

Recent work predicted that 2d active nematic turbulence follows universal
scaling laws. However, experimentally testing these predictions is conditioned
by the coupling to the 3d environment. Here, we measure the spectrum of the
kinetic energy, $E(q)$, in an active nematic film in contact with a passive oil
layer. At small and intermediate scales, we find the scaling regimes $E(q)\sim
q^{-4}$ and $E(q)\sim q^{-1}$, respectively, in agreement with the theoretical
prediction for 2d active nematics. At large scales, however, we find a new
scaling $E(q)\sim q$, which emerges when the dissipation is dominated by the 3d
oil layer. In addition, we derive an explicit expression for the spectrum that
spans all length scales, thus explaining and connecting the different scaling
regimes. This allows us to fit the data and extract the length scale that
controls the crossover to the new large-scale regime, which we tune by varying
the oil viscosity. Overall, our work experimentally demonstrates the emergence
of universal scaling laws in active turbulence, and it establishes how the
spectrum is affected by external dissipation.

into a top quark and a $\tau$-lepton is presented. The search is based on a
dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS
detector during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. Events are selected if they have one
light lepton (electron or muon) and at least one hadronically decaying
$\tau$-lepton, or at least two light leptons. In addition, two or more jets, at
least one of which must be identified as containing $b$-hadrons, are required.
Six final states, defined by the multiplicity and flavour of lepton candidates,
are considered in the analysis. Each of them is split into multiple event
categories to simultaneously search for the signal and constrain several
leading backgrounds. The signal-rich event categories require at least one
hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidate and exploit the presence of
energetic final-state objects, which is characteristic of signal events. No
significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed in any of
the considered event categories, and 95% CL upper limits are set on the
production cross section as a function of the leptoquark mass, for different
assumptions about the branching fractions into $t\tau$ and $b\nu$. Scalar
leptoquarks decaying exclusively into $t\tau$ are excluded up to masses of 1.43
TeV while, for a branching fraction of 50% into $t\tau$, the lower mass limit
is 1.22 TeV.

behavior when extrapolating. Uncertainty quantification approaches can flag
atomic configurations for which prediction confidence is low, but arriving at
such uncertain regions requires expensive sampling of the NN phase space, often
using atomistic simulations. Here, we exploit automatic differentiation to
drive atomistic systems towards high-likelihood, high-uncertainty

performing adversarial attacks on an uncertainty metric, informative geometries
that expand the training domain of NNs are sampled. When combined to an active
learning loop, this approach bootstraps and improves NN potentials while
decreasing the number of calls to the ground truth method. This efficiency is
demonstrated on sampling of kinetic barriers and collective variables in

success of high-energy physics experiments, such as the IceCube Neutrino

at the geographic South Pole where computational resources are limited.
However, to perform real-time analyses and to issue alerts to telescopes around
the world, powerful and fast reconstruction methods are desired. Deep neural
networks can be extremely powerful, and their usage is computationally
inexpensive once the networks are trained. These characteristics make a deep
learning-based approach an excellent candidate for the application in IceCube.
A reconstruction method based on convolutional architectures and hexagonally
shaped kernels is presented. The presented method is robust towards systematic
uncertainties in the simulation and has been tested on experimental data. In
comparison to standard reconstruction methods in IceCube, it can improve upon
the reconstruction accuracy, while reducing the time necessary to run the
reconstruction by two to three orders of magnitude.

of its true probability has direct implication on the risk capital demanded by
the Solvency II directive. We add to the existing literature by performing
extensive experiments that present highly practical results for various

Further, we detect shortcomings of prevalent model assessments, which are in
essence based on a confusion matrix. Our results indicate that accurate label
predictions and a sound modeling of the true probability can be opposing
objectives. We illustrate this with the example of resampling. While resampling
is capable of improving label prediction in rare event settings, such as
surrender, and thus is commonly applied, we show theoretically and numerically
that models trained on resampled data predict significantly biased event
probabilities. Following a probabilistic perspective on surrender, we further
propose time-dependent confidence bands on predicted mean surrender rates as a
complementary assessment and demonstrate its benefit. This evaluation takes a
very practical, going concern perspective, which respects that the composition
of a portfolio, as well as the nature of underlying risk drivers might change

sequential studies with early stopping rules when grouped data come from the
one-parameter exponential family.
  First, to obtain this elusive result, the probability measure of a group
sequential design is constructed with support for all possible outcome events,
as is useful for designing an experiment prior to having data. This
construction identifies impossible events that are not part of the support. The
overall probability distribution is dissected into stage specific components.
These components are sub-densities of interim test statistics first described
by Armitage, McPherson and Rowe (1969) that are commonly used to create
stopping boundaries given an $\alpha$-spending function and a set of interim
analysis times. Likelihood expressions conditional on reaching a stage are
given to connect pieces of the probability anatomy together.
  The reduction of the support caused by the adoption of an early stopping rule
induces sequential truncation (not nesting) in the probability distributions of
possible events. Multiple testing induces mixtures on the adapted support. Even
asymptotic distributions of inferential statistics are mixtures of truncated
distributions. In contrast to the classical result on local asymptotic
normality (Le Cam 1960), statistics that are asymptotically normal without
stopping options have asymptotic distributions that are mixtures of truncated

a compelling alternative to the conventional catalyst induced growth processes.
It not only provides a catalyst free process but the ability to control the
constituents of the inner tube if appropriate starting molecules are used. We
report herein the growth of inner SWCNTs from $^{13}$C labeled toluene and
natural carbon C$_{60}$. The latter molecule is essentially a stopper which
acts to retain the smaller toluene. The Raman spectrum of the inner nanotubes
is anomalous as it contains a highly isotope shifted ""tail"", which cannot be
explained by assuming a homogeneous distribution of the isotopes.
{\color{black}Semi-empirical} calculations of the Raman modes indicate that
this unsual effect is explicable if small clusters of $^{13}$C are assumed.
This indicates the absence of carbon diffusion during the inner tube growth.
When combined with appropriate molecular recognition, this may enable a
molecular engineering of the atomic and isotope composition of the inner tubes.

it to the goal position. We use model-based trajectory optimization and control

qubits via purely dissipative processes (i.e., in the Lindblad master equation
there is no coherent interaction between the qubits). The fundamental
ingredients are the presence of collective (i.e. nonlocal) dissipation and
unbalanced local dissipation rates (the qubits dissipate at different rates).
The resulting quantum trajectories show that the measurement backaction changes
the system wave function and induces a passage of the excitation from one qubit
to the other. While similar phenomena have been witnessed for a non-Markovian
environment, here the dissipative quantum state transfer is induced by an
update of the observer knowledge of the wave function in the presence of a
Markovian (memoryless) environment -- this is a single quantum trajectory
effect. Beyond single quantum trajectories and postselection, such an effect
can be observed by histogramming the quantum jumps along several realizations
at different times. By investigating the effect of the temperature in the
presence of unbalanced local dissipation, we demonstrate that, if appropriately
switched on and off, the collective dissipator can act as a Maxwell's demon.
These effects are a generalized measure equivalent to the standard projective
measure description of quantum teleportation and Maxwell's demon. They can be
witnessed in state-of-the-art setups given the extreme experimental control in,
e.g., superconducting qubits or Rydberg atoms.

  with the Back-Projected Fidelity Term",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vast majority of image recovery tasks are ill-posed problems. As such,
methods that are based on optimization use cost functions that consist of both
fidelity and prior (regularization) terms. A recent line of works imposes the
prior by the Regularization by Denoising (RED) approach, which exploits the
good performance of existing image denoising engines. Yet, the relation of RED
to explicit prior terms is still not well understood, as previous work requires
too strong assumptions on the denoisers. In this paper, we make two
contributions. First, we show that the RED gradient can be seen as a
(sub)gradient of a prior function--but taken at a denoised version of the
point. As RED is typically applied with a relatively small noise level, this
interpretation indicates a similarity between RED and traditional gradients.
This leads to our second contribution: We propose to combine RED with the
Back-Projection (BP) fidelity term rather than the common Least Squares (LS)
term that is used in previous works. We show that the advantages of BP over LS
for image deblurring and super-resolution, which have been demonstrated for
traditional gradients, carry on to the RED approach.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) respond to complex object shapes, recent
studies have shown that CNNs actually exhibit a `texture bias': given an image
with both texture and shape cues (e.g., a stylized image), a CNN is biased
towards predicting the category corresponding to the texture. However, these
previous studies conduct experiments on the final classification output of the
network, and fail to robustly evaluate the bias contained (i) in the latent
representations, and (ii) on a per-pixel level. In this paper, we design a
series of experiments that overcome these issues. We do this with the goal of
better understanding what type of shape information contained in the network is
discriminative, where shape information is encoded, as well as when the network
learns about object shape during training. We show that a network learns the
majority of overall shape information at the first few epochs of training and
that this information is largely encoded in the last few layers of a CNN.
Finally, we show that the encoding of shape does not imply the encoding of
localized per-pixel semantic information. The experimental results and findings
provide a more accurate understanding of the behaviour of current CNNs, thus
helping to inform future design choices.

Existing approaches rely on learning either shared or label-specific attention

In contrast, state-of-the-art single-label generative adversarial network (GAN)
based approaches learn to directly synthesize the class-specific visual
features from the corresponding class attribute embeddings. However,
synthesizing multi-label features from GANs is still unexplored in the context
of zero-shot setting. In this work, we introduce different fusion approaches at

increasing, and the count of the authorization hooks is nearly doubled. It is
important to provide up-to-date measurement results of LSM for system
practitioners so that they can make prudent trade-offs between security and
performance. This work evaluates the overhead of LSM for file accesses on Linux
v5.3.0. We build a performance evaluation framework for LSM. It has two parts,
an extension of LMBench2.5 to evaluate the overhead of file operations for
different security modules, and a security module with tunable latency for
policy enforcement to study the impact of the latency of policy enforcement on
the end-to-end latency of file operations. In our evaluation, we find opening a
file would see about 87% (Linux v5.3) performance drop when the kernel is
integrated with SELinux hooks (policy enforcement disabled) than without, while
the figure was 27% (Linux v2.4.2). We found that performance of the above
downgrade is affected by two parts, policy enforcement and hook placement. To
further investigate the impact of policy enforcement and hook placement
respectively, we build a Policy Testing Module, which reuses hook placements of
LSM, while alternating latency of policy enforcement. With this module, we are
able to quantitatively estimate the impact of the latency of policy enforcement
on the end-to-end latency of file operations by using a multiple linear
regression model and count policy authorization frequencies for each syscall.
We then discuss and justify the evaluation results with static analysis on our
enhanced syscalls' call graphs.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of interacting bosons in external potential
traps putting particular emphasis on the emerging many-body effects beyond
mean-field descriptions. To do so, methods have to be used that, in principle,
can provide numerically exact results for both the dynamics and the excitation
spectra in a systematic manner. Numerically exact results for the dynamics are
presented employing the well-established multicongurational time-dependent
Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method. The respective excitation spectra are
calculated utilizing the more recently introduced linear-response theory atop
it (LR-MCTDHB). The latter theory gives rise to an, in general, non-hermitian
eigenvalue problem. The theory and its newly developed implementation are
described in detail and benchmarked towards the exactly-solvable
harmonic-interaction model. Several applications to BECs in one- and
two-dimensional potential traps are discussed. With respect to dynamics, it is
shown that both the out-of-equilibrium tunneling dynamics and the dynamics of
trapped vortices are of many-body nature. Furthermore, many-body effects in the
excitation spectra are presented for BECs in different trap geometries. It is
demonstrated that even for essentially-condensed systems, the spectrum of the
lowest-in-energy excitations computed at the many-body level can differ
substantially from the standard mean-field description. In general, it is shown
that bosons carrying angular momentum are more sensitive to many-body effects
than bosons without. These effects are present in both the dynamics and the
excitation spectrum.

delineating the boundary between the string landscape and the swampland. Bounds
from the Weak Gravity Conjecture and the Repulsive Force Conjecture, for
instance, are exactly preserved under dimensional reduction. Motivated by its
success in these cases, we apply a similar dimensional reduction analysis to
bounds on the gradient of the scalar field potential $V$ and the mass scale $m$
of a tower of light particles in terms of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$,
which ideally may pin down ambiguous $O(1)$ constants appearing in the de
Sitter Conjecture and the (Anti) de Sitter Distance Conjecture, respectively.
We find that this analysis distinguishes the bounds $|\nabla V|/V \geq
\sqrt{4/(d-2)}$, $m \lesssim |\Lambda|^{1/2}$, and $m \lesssim |\Lambda|^{1/d}$
in $d$-dimensional Planck units. The first of these bounds precludes
accelerated expansion of the universe in Einstein-dilaton gravity and is almost
certainly violated in our universe, though it may apply in asymptotic limits of
scalar field space. The second bound cannot be satisfied in our universe,
though it is saturated in supersymmetric AdS vacua with well-understood uplifts
to 10d/11d supergravity. The third bound likely has a limited range of validity
in quantum gravity as well, so it may or may not apply to our universe.
However, if it does apply, it suggests a possible relation between the
cosmological constant and the neutrino mass, which (by the see-saw mechanism)
may further provide a relation between the cosmological constant problem and
the hierarchy problem. We also work out the conditions for eternal inflation in

astronomical objects. We calculate the first DTD for RR Lyrae variables using
29,810 RR Lyrae from the OGLE-IV survey and a map of the stellar-age

46\%$ of the OGLE-IV RR Lyrae are associated with delay-times older than 8 Gyr

existing constraints on their ages, but surprisingly about $51\%$ of RR Lyrae
appear have delay times $1.2-8$ Gyr (main-sequence masses between $1 - 2$
M$_{\odot}$ at LMC metallicity). This intermediate-age signal also persists
outside the Bar-region where crowding is less of a concern, and we verified
that without this signal, the spatial distribution of the OGLE-IV RR Lyrae is
inconsistent with the SAD map of the LMC. Since an intermediate-age RR Lyrae

broken in orbifolds if the orbifold has discrete torsion in the

However, some Ca-rich supernovae (SNe) and short gamma ray burst (sGRBs) appear
to be located at remote locations, far from the stellar population of their
host galaxy, challenging our understanding of their origin and/or physical
evolution. These findings instigated models suggesting that either large
velocity kicks were imparted to their progenitors, allowing them to propagate
to large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in
dense globular clusters residing in the halos. Here we show that instead, the
large spatial-offsets of these transients are naturally explained by the
observations of highly extended underlying stellar populations in (mostly early
type) galaxy halos, typically missed since they can only be identified through
ultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently, no large velocity kicks, nor halo
globular cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of
these transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on
white-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and
no/small-natal-kicks given to sGRB progenitors. Since early-type galaxies
contain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar
populations would have larger fractions of early-type galaxy hosts, and
consequently larger fractions of transients at large offsets. This is verified
by our results for sGRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions
in early vs. late-type galaxies. Furthermore, once divided between early and
late type galaxies, the offsets' distributions of the different transients are
consistent with each other. Finally, we point out that studies of other
transients' offset distribution (e.g. Ia-SNe or FRBs) should similarly consider
the host galaxy-type.

physical degrees of freedom in an arbitrary background solution. The symmetries
of the principal symbol arising from diffeomorphism invariance and the action
principle are determined. For gravity coupled to a single scalar field (i.e. a
Horndeski theory) it is shown that causality is governed by a characteristic
polynomial of degree $6$ which factorises into a product of quadratic and
quartic polynomials. The former is defined in terms of an ""effective metric""
and is associated with a ""purely gravitational"" polarisation, whereas the
latter generically involves a mixture of gravitational and scalar field
polarisations. The ""fastest"" degrees of freedom are associated with the quartic
polynomial, which defines a surface analogous to the Fresnel surface in crystal
optics. In contrast with optics, this surface is generically non-singular
except on certain surfaces in spacetime. It is shown that a Killing horizon is
an example of such a surface. It is also shown that a Killing horizon satisfies
the zeroth law of black hole mechanics. The characteristic polynomial defines a
cone in the cotangent space and a dual cone in the tangent space. The latter is
used to define basic notions of causality and to provide a definition of a

intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization. The simulations are
among the first to employ multi-frequency, on-the-fly radiation transfer and
constrained transport ideal MHD in a cosmological context to simultaneously
model the inhomogeneous process of reionization as well as the growth of PMFs.
We run a series of $(5\,\text{cMpc})^3$ cosmological volumes, varying both the
strength of the seed magnetic field ($B_0$) and its spectral index ($n_B$). We
find that PMFs that have $n_B > -0.562\log_{10}\left(\frac{B_0}{1{\rm

inconsistent with CMB constraints due to the unrealistically early collapse of
low-mass dwarf galaxies. For $n_B\geq-2.9$, our constraints are considerably
tighter than the $\sim{\rm n}G$ constraints from Planck. PMFs that do not
satisfy our constraints have little impact on the reionization history or the
shape of the UV luminosity function. Likewise, detecting changes in the Lya
forest due to PMFs will be challenging because photoionisation and photoheating
efficiently smooth the density field. However, we find that the first
absorption feature in the global 21cm signal is a sensitive indicator of the
properties of the PMFs, even for those that satisfy our $\tau_e$ constraint.
Furthermore, strong PMFs can marginally increase the escape of LyC photons by
up to 25\% and shrink the effective radii of galaxies by $\sim44\%$ which could
increase the completeness fraction of galaxy surveys. Finally, our simulations
show that surveys with a magnitude limit of ${\rm M_{UV,1500}=-13}$ can probe
the sources that provide the majority of photons for reionization out to

farther than the hard X-rays along the ionization cone, which may be explained
by a galactocentric radial dependence on the density of molecular clouds due to
the orientation of the ionization cone with respect to the galactic disk. These

and clocks, which identify a reference frame. In any concrete scenario,
reference frames are associated to physical systems, which are ultimately
quantum in nature. A relativistic description of the laws of physics hence
needs to take into account such quantum reference frames (QRFs), through which
spacetime can be given an operational meaning. Here, we introduce the notion of
a spacetime QRF, associated to a quantum particle in spacetime. Such
formulation has the advantage of treating space and time on equal footing, and
of describing the dynamical evolution of a set of quantum systems from the
perspective of another quantum system, where the evolution parameter coincides
with the proper time of the particle taken as the QRF. Crucially, the proper
times in two different QRFs are not related by a standard transformation, but
they might be in a quantum superposition. Concretely, we consider N
relativistic quantum particles in a weak gravitational field and introduce a
timeless formulation in which the global state of the N particles appears
""frozen"", but the dynamical evolution is recovered in terms of relational
quantities. The position and momentum Hilbert space of the particles is used to
fix the QRF via a transformation to the local frame of the particle such that
the metric is locally inertial at the origin of the QRF. The internal Hilbert

works presented quantum processes without classical common-cause and

relations (CCDC). In this work, we analyze the minimum requirements for a
quantum process to fail to admit a CCDC explanation and present ""simple""
processes, which we prove to be the most robust ones against general noise.
These simple processes can be realized by preparing a maximally entangled state
and applying the identity quantum channel, thus not requiring an explicit
coherent mixture of common-cause and direct-cause, exploiting the possibility
of a process to have both relations simultaneously. We then prove that,
although all bipartite direct-cause processes are bipartite separable
operators, there exist bipartite separable processes which are not
direct-cause. This shows that the problem of deciding weather a process is
direct-cause process is not equivalent to entanglement certification and points
out the limitations of entanglement methods to detect non-classical CCDC
processes. We also present a semi-definite programming hierarchy that can
detect and quantify the non-classical CCDC robustnesses of every non-classical
CCDC process. Among other results, our numerical methods allow us to show that
the simple processes presented here are likely to be also the maximally robust
against white noise. Finally, we explore the equivalence between bipartite
direct-cause processes and bipartite processes without quantum memory, to
present a separable process which cannot be realized as a process without

eigenimages have proved invaluable to exoplanet direct imaging. However, they
scale poorly in runtime when paired with differential imaging techniques. In
such observations, reference frames and frames to be starlight-subtracted are
drawn from the same set of data, requiring a new subset of references (and
eigenimages) for each frame processed to avoid self-subtraction of the signal
of interest. The data rates of extreme adaptive optics instruments are such
that the only way to make this computationally feasible has been to downsample
the data. We develop a technique that updates a pre-computed singular value
decomposition of the full dataset to remove frames (i.e. a ""downdate"") without
a full recomputation, yielding the modified eigenimages. This not only enables
analysis of much larger data volumes in the same amount of time, but also
exhibits near-linear scaling in runtime as the number of observations
increases. We apply this technique to archival data and investigate its scaling
behavior for very large numbers of frames $N$. The resulting algorithm provides
speed improvements of $2.6\times$ (for 200 eigenimages at $N = 300$) to $140

low temperatures. However, we expect that our results are quite generic and
applicable to a wide range of systems, including non-holographic. The probes we
consider include the entanglement entropy, mutual information, entanglement of
purification and the butterfly velocity. The latter turns out to be
particularly useful, given the universal connection between momentum and charge
diffusion in the vicinity of a black hole horizon. The RT surfaces used to
compute the above quantities, though, are largely insensitive to the electric
flux in the bulk. To address this deficiency, we propose a generalized
entanglement functional that is motivated through the Iyer-Wald formalism,
applied to a gravity theory coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. We argue that this
functional gives rise to a coarse grained measure of entanglement in the
boundary theory which is obtained by tracing over (part) of the fractionalized
and cohesive charge degrees of freedom. Based on the above, we construct a
candidate for an entropic $c$-function that accounts for the existence of bulk
charges. We explore some of its general properties and their significance, and

of this phenomenon in the topological Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2, where the
magnetic interfaces associated with domain walls suffice to bias the entire

corrections in the right direction, there are quantitative discrepancies
between different models. We observe a better agreement with the data for the
models including reliable collisional cross-sections. The agreement between
data and models is not always satisfactory when the 3D spectra are computed in
LTE. However, we note that for a fair comparison, 3D corrections should be
computed with self-consistently derived stellar parameters, and not on 1D

illustrate the situation, we present an analysis in which the Newtonian

fitting rotation curves from the SPARC database, in analogy to $g_{\dagger}$ in
the recently debated Bayesian analyses. When imposing flat priors on $G_N$, we
obtain a wide distribution of $G_N$ which, taken at face value, would rule out
$G_N$ as a universal constant with high statistical confidence. However,
imposing an empirically motivated log-normal prior returns a virtually constant
$G_N$ with no sacrifice in fit quality. This implies that the inference of a
variable $G_N$ (or g$_{\dagger}$) is the result of the combined effect of
parameter degeneracies and unavoidable uncertainties in the error model. When
these effects are taken into account, the SPARC data are consistent with a
constant $G_{\rm N}$ (and constant $g_\dagger$).

(AGN) is still a matter of debate. At least two physical models have been
considered in the literature: wind shocks and radiation pressure on dust. Here
we provide a first quantitative comparison of the AGN radiative feedback
scenario with observations of galactic outflows. We directly compare our
radiation pressure-driven shell models with the observational data from the
most recent compilation of molecular outflows on galactic scales. We show that
the observed dynamics and energetics of galactic outflows can be reproduced by
AGN radiative feedback, with the inclusion of radiation trapping and/or
luminosity evolution. The predicted scalings of the outflow energetics with AGN
luminosity can also quantitatively account for the observational scaling
relations. Furthermore, sources with both ultra-fast and molecular outflow
detections are found to be located in the `forbidden' region of the
$N_\mathrm{H} - \lambda$ plane. Overall, an encouraging agreement is obtained
over a wide range of AGN and host galaxy parameters. We discuss our results in
the context of recent observational findings and numerical simulations. In
conclusion, AGN radiative feedback is a promising mechanism for driving
galactic outflows that should be considered, alongside wind feedback, in the
interpretation of future observational data.

  rectifiable sets","22 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It has been recently established by the first and third author that on
uniformly rectifiable sets the Green function is almost affine in the weak
sense, and moreover, in some scenarios such Green function estimates are
equivalent to the uniform rectifiability of a set. The present paper tackles a
strong analogue of these results, starting with the ""flagship"" degenerate
operators on sets with lower dimensional boundaries.
  We consider the elliptic operators $L_{\beta,\gamma} =- {\rm div}
D^{d+1+\gamma-n} \nabla$ associated to a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^n$
with a uniformly rectifiable boundary $\Gamma$ of dimension $d < n-1$, the now
usual distance to the boundary $D = D_\beta$ given by $D_\beta(X)^{-\beta} =
\int_{\Gamma} |X-y|^{-d-\beta} d\sigma(y)$ for $X \in \Omega$, where $\beta >0$
and $\gamma \in (-1,1)$. In this paper we show that the Green function $G$ for
$L_{\beta,\gamma}$, with pole at infinity, is well approximated by multiples of
$D^{1-\gamma}$, in the sense that the function $\big| D\nabla\big(\ln\big(
\frac{G}{D^{1-\gamma}} \big)\big)\big|^2$ satisfies a Carleson measure estimate
on $\Omega$. We underline that the strong and the weak results are different in
nature and, of course, at the level of the proofs: the latter extensively used
compactness arguments, while the present paper relies on some intricate
integration by parts and the properties of the ""magical"" distance function from
a previous work from the first author, the third author, and Max Engelstein.

To overcome the lack of wireless resources, we propose a machine learning-based

the actuators are actuated by locally predicting the missing state and/or
action information using the previous uplink and/or downlink receptions via a
Gaussian process regression (GPR). This GPR prediction credibility is
determined using the age-of-information (AoI) of the latest reception.
Moreover, the successful reception is affected by the transmission power,
mandating a co-design of the communication and control operations. To this end,
we formulate a network-wide minimization problem of the average AoI and
transmission power under communication reliability and control stability
constraints. To solve the problem, we propose a dynamic control algorithm using
the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization framework. Numerical results
corroborate that the proposed algorithm can stably control $2$x more number of

the linear solver. These systems are extremely large and ill-conditioned.
Because of the wide range of processes and couplings that may be involved--e.g.
formation and propagation of fractures, deformation of the solid porous medium,
viscous flow of one or more fluids in the pores and fractures, complicated well

scalable preconditioners for several problems, notably: a hybrid discretization
of single-phase flow, compositional multiphase flow with complex wells, and
hydraulic fracturing simulations. Extension to other systems can be handled

spin relaxation times longer than a second. For sufficiently strong magnetic

gas kinematics are misaligned with respect to all other galaxy components; as
the gas works its way inward it is torqued into polar orbits about the stellar
kinematically-decoupled core (KDC), indicating that the stellar KDC is not
related to the current gas accretion event. The galaxy also exhibits unusually
high 12CO/13CO line ratios in its nucleus but typical 13CO/C18O ratios. Our
calculations show that this result does not necessarily indicate an unusual
[12CO/13CO] abundance ratio but rather that 12CO (1-0) is optically thin due to
high temperatures and/or large linewidths associated with the inner decoupled,
misaligned molecular structure. Line ratios of the higher-density tracers
suggest that the densest phase of molecular gas in NGC 7465 has a lower density
than is typical for nearby galaxies, possibly as a result of the recent gas
accretion. All of the observed molecular properties of NGC 7465 are consistent
with it having acquired its molecular (and atomic) gas from a spiral galaxy.
Further detailed studies of the CO isotopologues in other early-type galaxies

systems can be modelled via these types of random walks. Stationary
probabilities are one of the most sought statistical quantities in queueing
analysis. However, explicit expressions are available only for a very limited
number of models. Therefore, tail asymptotic properties become more important,
since they provide insightful information into the structure of the tail
probabilities, and often lead to approximations, performance bounds,
algorithms, among possible others.
  Characterizing tail asymptotics for random walks in the quarter plane is a
fundamental and also classical problem. Classical approaches are usually based
on a complete determination of the transformation for the unknown probabilities
of interest, for example, a singular integral presentation for the unknown
probability generating function through boundary value problems
\cite{FKM:82,Guillemin-Leeuwaarden:09}. In contrast to classical approaches
(approaches based on the solution for the unknown probabilities or the
transform of the unknown probabilities), the kernel method, reviewed here, is
very efficient for two-dimensional problems, which only requires the local
information about the location of the dominant singularity of the unknown
transformation function and the asymptotic property, through asymptotic
analysis in complex analysis, at the dominant singularity.
  This kernel method reviewed in this paper is an extension of the classical
one.

states occur, including ice rule obeying states and labyrinthine patterns. In
contrast to square pinning arrays, we find no sharp peaks in the critical
current due to the inherent frustration effect imposed by the Santa Fe ice

matches the number of pinning sites. For some fillings, the Santa Fe array
exhibits stronger pinning than the square array due to the suppression of
one-dimensional flow channels when the vortex motion in the Santa Fe lattice
occurs through the formation of both longitudinal and transverse flow channels.

can image, and the spatial resolution one can obtain from these images. Diffuse
optical tomography (DOT) is one of the most powerful techniques for imaging
deep within tissue -- well beyond the conventional $\sim$10-15 mean scattering
lengths tolerated by ballistic imaging techniques such as confocal and
two-photon microscopy. Unfortunately, existing DOT systems are limited,
achieving only centimeter-scale resolution. Furthermore, they suffer from slow
acquisition times and slow reconstruction speeds making real-time imaging
infeasible. We show that time-of-flight diffuse optical tomography (ToF-DOT)
and its confocal variant (CToF-DOT), by exploiting the photon travel time
information, allow us to achieve millimeter spatial resolution in the highly
scattered diffusion regime ($> 50 $ mean free paths). In addition, we
demonstrate two additional innovations: focusing on confocal measurements, and
multiplexing the illumination sources allow us to significantly reduce the
measurement acquisition time. Finally, we rely on a novel convolutional
approximation that allows us to develop a fast reconstruction algorithm,
achieving a 100$\times$ speedup in reconstruction time compared to traditional
DOT reconstruction techniques. Together, we believe that these technical

techniques to service terrestrial mobile users (MUs). The proposed framework
enables the terrestrial MUs to offload their computational tasks
simultaneously, intelligently, and flexibly, thus enhancing their connectivity
as well as reducing their transmission latency and their energy consumption. To
this end, the fundamentals of this framework are first introduced. Then, a
number of communication and AI techniques are proposed to improve the quality
of experiences of terrestrial MUs. To this end, federated learning and
reinforcement learning are introduced for intelligent task offloading and
computing resource allocation. For each learning technique, motivations,
challenges, and representative results are introduced. Finally, several key
technical challenges and open research issues of the proposed framework are
summarized.

precisely estimate the entire distribution of proactive inhibition. We
introduce an Asymmetric Laplace Gaussian (ALG) model to describe the

assumptions of independent trial type(go/stop) reaction times, and Ex-Gaussian
(ExG) models for them. Results indicated that the four parametric, ALG model
uniquely describes the proactive inhibition distribution and its key shape
features; and, its hazard function is monotonically increasing as are its three
parametric ExG components. In conclusion, both response inhibition components
can be uniquely modeled via variations of the four parametric ALG model
described with their associated similar distributional features.

reduces to classical DRS. Moreover, the weak convergence of primal-dual

goals with additional constraints (e.g., to satisfy fairness or diversity
criteria). Such optimization problems are quite challenging, often involving
non-convex functions along with considerations of user preferences in balancing
trade-offs. Pareto solutions represent optimal frontiers for jointly optimizing
multiple competing objectives. A major obstacle for frequently used
linear-scalarization strategies is that the resulting optimization problem
might not always converge to a global optimum. Furthermore, such methods only
return one solution point per run. A Pareto solution set is a subset of all
such global optima over multiple runs for different trade-off choices.
Therefore, a Pareto front can only be guaranteed with multiple runs of the
linear-scalarization problem, where all runs converge to their respective
global optima. Consequently, extracting a Pareto front for practical problems
is computationally intractable with substantial computational overheads,
limited scalability, and reduced accuracy. We propose a robust, low cost,
two-stage, hybrid neural Pareto optimization approach that is accurate and
scales (compute space and time) with data dimensions, as well as number of
functions and constraints. The first stage (neural network) efficiently
extracts a weak Pareto front, using Fritz-John conditions as the discriminator,
with no assumptions of convexity on the objectives or constraints. The second
stage (efficient Pareto filter) extracts the strong Pareto optimal subset given
the weak front from stage 1. Fritz-John conditions provide us with theoretical
bounds on approximation error between the true and network extracted weak
Pareto front. Numerical experiments demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency on
a canonical set of benchmark problems and a fairness optimization task from
prior works.

The memory block allows implementing sparse access to memory with square root
complexity scaling with respect to the memory capacity. The latter scaling is
possible due to the incorporation of Cartesian product space decomposition of
the key space for the nearest neighbour search. We have tested the memory layer
on the classification, image reconstruction and relocalization problems and
found that for some of those, the memory layers can provide significant
speed/accuracy improvement with the high utilization of the key-value elements,
while others require more careful fine-tuning and suffer from dying keys. To
tackle the later problem we have introduced a simple technique of memory
re-initialization which helps us to eliminate unused key-value pairs from the

relocalization models.

becoming more and more important for the gaming industry. Depending on the
diverse needs of diversified game players, game designers, graphical
developers, etc. in particular conditions, multi-modal aesthetic assessment is
required to consider different aesthetic dimensions/perspectives. Since there
are different underlying relationships between different aesthetic dimensions,
e.g., between the `Colorfulness' and `Color Harmony', it could be advantageous
to leverage effective information attached in multiple relevant dimensions. To
this end, we solve this problem via multi-task learning. Our inclination is to
seek and learn the correlations between different aesthetic relevant dimensions
to further boost the generalization performance in predicting all the aesthetic
dimensions. Therefore, the `bottleneck' of obtaining good predictions with
limited labeled data for one individual dimension could be unplugged by
harnessing complementary sources of other dimensions, i.e., augment the
training data indirectly by sharing training information across dimensions.
According to experimental results, the proposed model outperforms
state-of-the-art aesthetic metrics significantly in predicting four gaming
aesthetic dimensions.

Most of the current literature focusing on Bluetooth simulation concentrates on
the network protocols' performances and completely neglects the privacy
protection recommendations introduced in the BLE standard. Indeed, privacy
protection is one of the main issues handled in the Bluetooth standard. For
instance, the current standard forces devices to change the identifier they
embed within the public and private packets, known as MAC address
randomization. Although randomizing MAC addresses is intended to preserve
device privacy, recent literature shows many challenges that are still present.
One of them is the correlation between the public packets and the emitters.
Unfortunately, existing evaluation tools such as NS-3 are not designed to
reproduce this Bluetooth standard's essential functionality. This makes it
impossible to test solutions for different device-fingerprinting strategies as
there is a lack of ground truth for large-scale scenarios with the majority of
current BLE devices implementing MAC address randomization. In this paper, we
first introduce a solution of standard-compliant MAC address randomization in
the NS-3 framework, capable of emulating any real BLE device in the simulation
and generating real-world Bluetooth traces. In addition, since the simulation
run-time for trace-collection grows exponentially with the number of devices,
we introduce an optimization to linearize public-packet sniffing. This made the
large-scale trace-collection practically feasible. Then, we use the generated
traces and associated ground truth to do a case study on the evaluation of a
generic MAC address association available in the literature. Our case study
reveals that close to 90 percent of randomized addresses could be correctly
linked even in highly dense and mobile scenarios.

overall tumor cell ratio can then be aggregated. We perform experiments on a

spectroscopic binary. Using 17 ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetric (Stokes $V$)
observations we identified the weak spectral lines of the secondary component
and detected a strong magnetic field in the primary. We performed orbital
analysis of the radial velocities of both components to find a slightly
eccentric orbit ($e= 0.129$) with a period of $5.95382(2)$ days.
  The longitudinal magnetic field ($B_\ell$) of the primary was measured from
each of the Stokes $V$ profiles, with typical error bars smaller than 10 G.
Equivalent widths (EWs) of LSD profiles corresponding to only the Fe lines were
also measured. We performed frequency analysis of both the $B_\ell$ and EW
measurements, as well as of the Hipparcos, SMEI, and TESS photometric data. All
sets of photometric observations produce two clear, strong candidates for the
rotation period of the Bp star: 1.21 days and 3.82 days. The $B_\ell$ and EW
measurements are consistent with only the 3.82-day period. We conclude that HD
25267 consists of a late-type Bp star (M= $3.6_{-0.2}^{+0.1} M_\odot$, T=
$12580_{-120}^{+150}$ K) with a rotation period of 3.82262(4) days orbiting
with a period of 5.95382(2) days with a late-A/early-F type secondary companion
(M= $1.6\pm 0.1 M_\odot$, T= $7530_{-510}^{+580}$ K). The Bp star's magnetic
field is approximately dipolar with $i= 41\pm 2^{\circ}$, $\beta= 158\pm
5^{\circ}$ and $B_{\rm d}= 1040\pm 50$ G. All evidence points to the strong
$1.209912(3)$ day period detected in photometry, along with several other
weaker photometric signals, as arising from $g$-mode pulsations in the primary.

balloon-borne far-infrared telescope that will survey star formation history
over cosmological time scales to improve our understanding of why the star
formation rate declined at redshift z < 2, despite continued clustering of dark
matter. Specifically,EXCLAIM will map the emission of redshifted carbon
monoxide and singly-ionized carbon lines in windows over a redshift range 0 < z
< 3.5, following an innovative approach known as intensity mapping. Intensity
mapping measures the statistics of brightness fluctuations of cumulative line
emissions instead of detecting individual galaxies, thus enabling a blind,
complete census of the emitting gas. To detect this emission unambiguously,
EXCLAIM will cross-correlate with a spectroscopic galaxy catalog. The EXCLAIM
mission uses a cryogenic design to cool the telescope optics to approximately
1.7 K. The telescope features a 90-cm primary mirror to probe spatial scales on
the sky from the linear regime up to shot noise-dominated scales. The telescope
optical elements couple to six {\mu}-Spec spectrometer modules, operating over
a 420-540 GHz frequency band with a spectral resolution of 512 and featuring
microwave kinetic inductance detectors. A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip
(RFSoC) reads out the detectors in the baseline design. The cryogenic telescope
and the sensitive detectors allow EXCLAIM to reach high sensitivity in spectral
windows of low emission in the upper atmosphere. Here, an overview of the
mission design and development status since the start of the EXCLAIM project in
early 2019 is presented.

wavelength exceeding the average inter-particle separation in a galaxy like the
Milky Way, and are well described as classical waves. We outline the particle
physics motivations for them, including the QCD axion and ultra-light
axion-like-particles such as fuzzy dark matter. The wave nature of the dark
matter implies a rich phenomenology: (1) Wave interference leads to order unity
density fluctuations on de Broglie scale. A manifestation is vortices where the
density vanishes and around which the velocity circulates. There is one vortex
ring per de Broglie volume on average. (2) For sufficiently low masses, soliton
condensation occurs at centers of halos. The soliton oscillates and random
walks, another manifestation of wave interference. The halo/subhalo abundance
is suppressed at small masses, but the precise prediction from numerical wave
simulations remains to be determined. (3) For ultra-light ~$10^{-22}$ eV dark
matter, the wave interference substructures can be probed by tidal
streams/gravitational lensing. The signal can be distinguished from that due to
subhalos by the dependence on stream orbital radius/image separation. (4) Axion
detection experiments are sensitive to interference substructures for
moderately light masses. The stochastic nature of the waves affects the
interpretation of experiments and motivates the measurement of correlation
functions. Current constraints and open questions, covering detection
experiments and cosmological/galactic/black-hole observations, are discussed.

bone does not keep up with the loss of old bone, resulting in increased

quality of life diminished because of limited mobility, which can lead to
isolation and depression. We are developing a robust screening method capable
of identifying individuals predisposed to hip fracture to address this clinical
challenge. The method uses finite element analysis and relies on segmented
computed tomography (CT) images of the hip. Presently, the segmentation of the
proximal femur requires manual input, which is a tedious task, prone to human
error, and severely limits the practicality of the method in a clinical
context. Here we present a novel approach for segmenting the proximal femur
that uses a deep convolutional neural network to produce accurate, automated,
robust, and fast segmentations of the femur from CT scans. The network
architecture is based on the renowned u-net, which consists of a downsampling
path to extract increasingly complex features of the input patch and an
upsampling path to convert the acquired low resolution image into a high
resolution one. Skipped connections allow us to recover critical spatial
information lost during downsampling. The model was trained on 30 manually
segmented CT images and was evaluated on 200 ground truth manual segmentations.
Our method delivers a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th

of the Pierre Auger Observatory. It consists of particle counters buried 2.3 m
underground next to the water-Cherenkov stations that form the 23.5 km$^2$
large infilled array. The reduced distance between detectors in this denser
area allows the lowering of the energy threshold for primary cosmic ray
reconstruction down to about 10$^{17}$ eV. At the depth of 2.3 m the
electromagnetic component of cosmic ray showers is almost entirely absorbed so
that the buried scintillators provide an independent and direct measurement of
the air showers muon content. This work describes the design and implementation
of the AMIGA embedded system, which provides centralized control, data
acquisition and environment monitoring to its detectors. The presented system
was firstly tested in the engineering array phase ended in 2017, and lately
selected as the final design to be installed in all new detectors of the
production phase. The system was proven to be robust and reliable and has
worked in a stable manner since its first deployment.

  2021",,,,"cs.AR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a mixed-precision convolution unit architecture
which supports different integer and floating point (FP) precisions. The
proposed architecture is based on low-bit inner product units and realizes
higher precision based on temporal decomposition. We illustrate how to
integrate FP computations on integer-based architecture and evaluate overheads
incurred by FP arithmetic support. We argue that alignment and addition
overhead for FP inner product can be significant since the maximum exponent
difference could be up to 58 bits, which results into a large alignment logic.
To address this issue, we illustrate empirically that no more than
26-bitproduct bits are required and up to 8-bit of alignment is sufficient in
most inference cases. We present novel optimizations based on the above
observations to reduce the FP arithmetic hardware overheads. Our empirical
results, based on simulation and hardware implementation, show significant
reduction in FP16 overhead. Over typical mixed precision implementation, the
proposed architecture achieves area improvements of up to 25% in TFLOPS/mm2and
up to 46% in TOPS/mm2with power efficiency improvements of up to 40% in
TFLOPS/Wand up to 63% in TOPS/W.

  multi-version-project defect data sets","63 pages, 24 figures, 14 tables",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The label quality of defect data sets has a direct influence on the
reliability of defect prediction models. In this study, for
multi-version-project defect data sets, we propose an approach to automatically
detecting instances with inconsistent labels (i.e. the phenomena of instances
having the same source code but different labels over multiple versions of a
software project) and understand their influence on the evaluation and
interpretation of defect prediction models. Based on five multi-version-project
defect data sets (either widely used or the most up-to-date in the literature)
collected by diverse approaches, we find that: (1) most versions in the
investigated defect data sets contain inconsistent labels with varying degrees;
(2) the existence of inconsistent labels in a training data set may
considerably change the prediction performance of a defect prediction model as
well as can lead to the identification of substantially different true
defective modules; and (3) the importance ranking of independent variables in a
defect prediction model can be substantially shifted due to the existence of
inconsistent labels. The above findings reveal that inconsistent labels in
defect data sets can profoundly change the prediction ability and
interpretation of a defect prediction model. Therefore, we strongly suggest
that practitioners should detect and exclude inconsistent labels in defect data
sets to avoid their potential negative influence on defect prediction models.
What is more, it is necessary for researchers to improve existing defect label
collection approaches to reduce inconsistent labels. Furthermore, there is a
need to re-examine the experimental conclusions of previous studies using
multi-version-project defect data sets with a high ratio of inconsistent
labels.

achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale image classification,
object detection and natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we
consider noisy binary neural networks, where each neuron has a non-zero
probability of producing an incorrect output. These noisy models may arise from
biological, physical and electronic contexts and constitute an important class
of models that are relevant to the physical world. Intuitively, the number of
neurons in such systems has to grow to compensate for the noise while
maintaining the same level of expressive power and computation reliability. Our
key finding is a lower bound for the required number of neurons in noisy neural
networks, which is first of its kind. To prove this lower bound, we take an
information theoretic approach and obtain a novel strong data processing
inequality (SDPI), which not only generalizes the Evans-Schulman results for
binary symmetric channels to general channels, but also improves the tightness
drastically when applied to estimate end-to-end information contraction in
networks. Our SDPI can be applied to various information processing systems,
including neural networks and cellular automata. Applying the SDPI in noisy
binary neural networks, we obtain our key lower bound and investigate its
implications on network depth-width trade-offs, our results suggest a
depth-width trade-off for noisy neural networks that is very different from the
established understanding regarding noiseless neural networks. Furthermore, we
apply the SDPI to study fault-tolerant cellular automata and obtain bounds on
the error correction overheads and the relaxation time. This paper offers new
understanding of noisy information processing systems through the lens of
information theory.

datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n x n kernel
matrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on
approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m
inducing points. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most
scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using
structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m)
for approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables inference for very
large data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation
for extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced
to O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as
solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m
compact basis functions. With per-iteration complexity independent of the
dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets.
We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply the
method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over
100 million points.

chains, carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanoribbons have been proven to grow
inside single-wall carbon nanotubes. This gives rise to three types of hybrid
materials whose behaviour and properties compared among each other are far from
understood. After proving successful the synthesis of these nanostructured
materials in recently published work, we have now been able to study their
oxidation stability systematically by using resonance Raman spectroscopy.
Surprisingly, the linear carbon chains, which have been theoretically predicted
to be very unstable, are actually thermally stable up to 500 {\deg}C assisted
by the protection of the carbon nanotube hosts. Besides, longer linear carbon
chains inside narrower CNTs are more stable than the shorter ones inside larger
tubes, suggesting that the thermal stability not only depends on the length of
linear carbon chains alone, but it is correlated with the confinement of the
host tubes in a more complicated manner. In addition, graphene nanoribbons come
overall in view as the most stable confined structures. On the other hand,
peculiarities like the higher stability of the (6,5) CNT over its (6,4)
counterpart allow this study to provide a solid platform for further studies on
the application of these 1D nanocarbons (including true 1D linear carbon
chains) at ambient conditions.

Using intent classification as a case study, we demonstrate that increasing

meta-learning to reduce sampling bias. We make use of a conditional generator
for data augmentation that is trained directly using the meta-learning

connectivity, percolation model plays a key role in the development of network
science and its applications. On the one hand, the concepts and analytical
methods, such as the emergence of the giant cluster, the finite-size scaling,
and the mean-field method, which are intimately related to the percolation
theory, are employed to quantify and solve some core problems of networks. On
the other hand, the insights into the percolation theory also facilitate the
understanding of networked systems, such as robustness, epidemic spreading,
vital node identification, and community detection. Meanwhile, network science
also brings some new issues to the percolation theory itself, such as
percolation of strong heterogeneous systems, topological transition of networks
beyond pairwise interactions, and emergence of a giant cluster with mutual
connections. So far, the percolation theory has already percolated into the
researches of structure analysis and dynamic modeling in network science.
Understanding the percolation theory should help the study of many fields in
network science, including the still opening questions in the frontiers of
networks, such as networks beyond pairwise interactions, temporal networks, and
network of networks. The intention of this paper is to offer an overview of
these applications, as well as the basic theory of percolation transition on

long codewords become imprecise. To remedy this, in this paper, an average
coding rate expression is derived for a large scale network with short
codewords using stochastic geometry and the theory of coding in the finite
blocklength regime. The average coding rate and upper and lower bounds on the
outage probability of the large-scale network are derived, and a tight
approximation of the outage probability is presented. Then, simulations are
presented to study the effect of network parameters on the average coding rate
and the outage probability of the network, which demonstrate that results in
the literature derived for the infinite blocklength regime overestimate the
network performance, whereas the results in this paper provide a more realistic
performance evaluation.

process in a wide array of geophysical flows with spatio-temporal scales that
span many orders of magnitude. A quick numerical model prediction based on
external parameters of stratified boundary layers could greatly benefit the
understanding of the interaction between velocity and scalar flux at varying
scales. For these reasons, here, we use the resolvent framework to investigate
the effects of an active scalar on incompressible wall-bounded turbulence. We
obtain the state of the flow system by applying the linear resolvent operator
to the nonlinear terms in the governing Navier-Stokes equations with the
Boussinesq approximation. This extends the formulation to include the scalar
advection equation with the scalar component acting in the wall-normal
direction in the momentum equations. We use the mean velocity profiles from a
DNS of a stably-stratified turbulent channel flow at varying friction
Richardson number. The results obtained from the resolvent analysis are
compared to the premultiplied energy spectra, auto-correlation coefficient, and
the energy budget terms obtained from the DNS. It is shown that despite using
only a very limited range of representative scales, the resolvent model is able
to reproduce the balance of energy budget terms as well as provide meaningful
insight of coherent structures occurring in the flow. Computation of the
leading resolvent models, despite considering a limited range of scales,
reproduces the balance of energy budget terms, provides meaningful predictions
of coherent structures in the flow, and is more cost-effective than performing
full-scale simulations. This quick model can provide further understanding of

high-intensity irradiation of bulk solids, such as beam instabilities due to
crystal imperfections and collisions etc.
  In this work, we model an experimentally practicable solid-state acceleration
mechanism using collective electron oscillations in crystals that sustain
propagating surface waves. These surface waves are driven in the wake of a
submicron long particle beam in tube shaped nanostructured crystals with tube
wall densities, $n_{\rm tube}\sim10^{22-24}\rm cm^{-3}$. Particle-In-Cell (PIC)
simulations carried out under experimental constraints demonstrate the
possibility of accessing average acceleration gradients of several $\rm

Furthermore, our modeling demonstrates the possibility that as the surface
oscillations and resultantly the surface wave transitions into a nonlinear or
""crunch-in"" regime under $n_{\rm beam}/n_{\rm tube} \gtrsim 0.05$, not only
does the average gradient increase but strong transverse focusing fields extend

With examining the influence of lunar obliquity and inclination on the

decreasing as the obliquity and inclination increasing. Combining with the
evolution of lunar obliquity and inclination, our model shows that the
apex/ant-apex ratio does not monotonically decrease with Earth-Moon distance
and hence the influences of obliquity and inclination are not negligible on
evolution of apex/ant-apex ratio. This model is generalizable to other planets

considered in the nineteenth century in the course of investigations of

constructed from a solution to the Sine-Gordon equation, and vice versa. With
this as motivation, employing the fundamental theorem of surfaces in the
Heisenberg group $H_{1}$, we show in this paper that the existence of a
constant $p$-mean curvature surface (without singular points) is equivalent to
the existence of a solution to a nonlinear second-order ODE (1.2), which is a
kind of {\bf Li\'{e}nard equations}. Therefore, we turn to investigate this
equation. It is a surprise that we give a complete set of solutions to (1.2)

curvature surfaces into several classes. As a result, after a kind of
normalization, we obtain a representation of constant $p$-mean curvature
surfaces and classify further all constant $p$-mean curvature surfaces. In
Section 9, we provide an approach to construct $p$-minimal surfaces. It turns
out that, in some sense, generic $p$-minimal surfaces can be constructed via
this approach. Finally, as a derivation, we recover the Bernstein-type theorem

second-order in derivatives equations of motion we are able to detect the gauge
invariant sector of the theory by using a suitable approach based on the
projection of the Hamiltonians onto the tangential and normal directions of the
congruence of curves in the configuration space. Regarding this, we also

bijection between the vertex sets of two given graphs so as to maximally align
their edges. This fundamental computational problem arises frequently in
multiple fields such as computer vision and biology. Recently, there has been a
plethora of work studying efficient algorithms for graph matching under
probabilistic models. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for graph
matching: Our algorithm associates each vertex with a signature vector using a
multistage procedure and then matches a pair of vertices from the two graphs if
their signature vectors are close to each other. We show that, for two
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs with edge correlation $1-\alpha$, our algorithm
recovers the underlying matching exactly with high probability when $\alpha \le
1 / (\log \log n)^C$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in each graph and $C$
denotes a positive universal constant. This improves the condition $\alpha \le
1 / (\log n)^C$ achieved in previous work.

characterized by west-to-east winds over the equator, is a common phenomenon in
the atmospheres of Venus, Titan, Saturn, Jupiter, and tidally locked
exoplanets. The stratospheric atmosphere of Earth is also superrotating during
the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). However, whether
the same phenomenon can occur in ocean is poorly known. Through numerical
simulations, here we show that oceanic superrotation does occur on tidally
locked terrestrial planets around low-mass stars. Its formation (spun-up from
rest) is associated with surface winds, the equatorward momentum convergence by
Rossby waves, and the eastward propagation of Kelvin waves in the ocean. Its
maintenance is driven by equatorward momentum transports of coupled
Rossby-Kelvin waves in the ocean excited from the uneven stellar radiation
distribution. The width of the superrotation is mainly constrained by the
Rossby deformation radius in the ocean, while its strength is more complex.
Many factors can influence the strength, including planetary rotation rate,
stellar flux, greenhouse gas concentration, seawater salinity, bottom drag, and
a scaling theory is lack. This work confirms that superrotation can occur on
tidally locked terrestrial planets with seawater oceans and suggests that it
may also occur on tidally locked hot planets with magma oceans that will
possibly be observed in the near future.

particularly for information storage and spintronics. Creative attempts to
increase storage density need to overcome volatility due to thermal
fluctuations of nanoscopic domains and heating limitations. Topological
defects, such as solitons, skyrmions, and merons, may be much less susceptible
to fluctuations, owing to topological constraints, while also being
controllable with low current densities. Here, we present the first evidence
for soliton/soliton and soliton/antisoliton domain walls in the hexagonal
chiral magnet Mn1/3NbS2 that respond asymmetrically to magnetic fields and
exhibit pair-annihilation. This is important because it suggests the
possibility of controlling the occurrence of soliton pairs and the use of small
fields or small currents to control nanoscopic magnetic domains. Specifically,
our data suggest that either soliton/soliton or soliton/antisoliton pairs can
be stabilized by tuning the balance between intrinsic exchange interactions and
long-range magnetostatics in restricted geometries

Chebyshev approximation on a finite grid. We consider two models: multivariate

In the second case the approximations are ratios of linear forms and the basis

multivariate polynomial approximation on a finite grid the corresponding
optimisation problems can be reduced to solving a linear programming problem,
while the area of multivariate rational approximation is not so well
understood.In this paper we demonstrate that in the case of multivariate
generalised rational approximation the corresponding optimisation problems are
quasiconvex. This statement remains true even when the basis functions are not
limited to monomials. Then we apply a bisection method, which is a general
method for quasiconvex optimisation. This method converges to an optimal
solution with given precision. We demonstrate that the convex feasibility
problems appearing in the bisection method can be solved using linear
programming. Finally, we compare the deviation error and computational time for
multivariate polynomial and generalised rational approximation with the same

  UAV-aided Cellular Networks",,,,,"cs.IT cs.MM eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on
telecommunication for remote working and telemedicine has significantly
increased. In cellular networks, incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) can result in enhanced connectivity for outdoor users due to the high
probability of establishing Line of Sight (LoS) links. The UAV's limited
battery life and its signal attenuation in indoor areas, however, make it
inefficient to manage users' requests in indoor environments. Referred to as
the Cluster centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, the
network's coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments increases via a
two-phase clustering for FAPs' formation and UAVs' deployment. First objective
is to increase the content diversity. In this context, we propose a coded
content placement in a cluster-centric cellular network, which is integrated
with the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) to mitigate the inter-cell interference
in edge areas. Then, we compute, experimentally, the number of coded contents
to be stored in each caching node to increase the cache-hit ratio,
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and
decrease the users' access delay and cache redundancy for different content
popularity profiles. Capitalizing on clustering, our second objective is to
assign the best caching node to indoor/outdoor users for managing their
requests. In this regard, we define the movement speed of ground users as the
decision metric of the transmission scheme for serving outdoor users' requests
to avoid frequent handovers between FAPs and increase the battery life of UAVs.
Simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCUF implementation increases
the cache hit-ratio, SINR, and cache diversity and decrease the users' access
delay, cache redundancy and UAVs' energy consumption.

auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. The EKT allows for the
direct calculation of electron addition and removal spectral functions using
reduced density matrices of the $N$-particle system, and avoids the need for
analytic continuation. The lowest level of EKT with AFQMC, called EKT1-AFQMC,
is benchmarked using small molecules, 14-electron and 54-electron uniform
electron gas supercells, and diamond at the $\Gamma$-point. Via comparison with
numerically exact results (when possible) and coupled-cluster methods, we find
that EKT1-AFQMC can reproduce the qualitative features of spectral functions
for Koopmans-like charge excitations with errors in peak locations of less than
0.25 eV in a finite basis. We also note the numerical difficulties that arise
in the EKT1-AFQMC eigenvalue problem, especially when back-propagated
quantities are very noisy. We show how a systematic higher order EKT approach
can correct errors in EKT1-based theories with respect to the satellite region
of the spectral function. Our work will be of use for the study of low-energy
charge excitations and spectral functions in correlated molecules and solids
where AFQMC can be reliably performed.

it possible to integrate IoU head into RoI box head. And it does not add any

calculations. A significant enhancement, relative to a PYTHIA simulation of
$p$+$p$ collisions, is observed in the $D_{s}^{\pm}/D^0$ yield ratio in Au+Au

incorporating abundant strange-quark production in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)

transverse-momentum integrated yield ratio of $D_{s}^{\pm}/D^0$ at midrapidity
is consistent with a prediction from a statistical hadronization model with the
parameters constrained by the yields of light and strange hadrons measured at
the same collision energy. These results suggest that the coalescence of charm

geometry on the evolution and structure of the large-scale vortices which play
a key role in mixing characteristics in turbulent supersonic flows. Numerically
simulated results corresponding to varying parameters such as strut geometry
and jet spacing (Xn=nDj such that n=2, 3 & 5) for square jet of height Dj=0.6
mm is presented in the current study, while the work also investigates the
presence of the local quasi-two-dimensionality for the X2(2Dj) jet spacing;
however, the same is not true for higher jet spacing. Further, the tapered
strut (TS) section is modified to the straight strut (SS) for investigation,
where the remarkable difference in flow physics is unfolded between the two
configurations for similar jet spacing (X2: 2Dj). The instantaneous density and
vorticity contours reveal the structures of varying scales undergoing different
evolution for the different configurations. The effect of local spanwise
rollers is clearly manifested in the mixing efficiency and the jet spreading
rate. SS configuration exhibits excellent near field mixing behavior amongst
all the arrangements. However, in case of TS cases, only X2(2Dj) configuration
performs better due to the presence of local spanwise rollers. The qualitative
and quantitative analysis reveals that near-field mixing is strongly affected
by the two-dimensional rollers, while the early onset of wake mode is another
crucial parameter to have improved mixing. Modal decomposition performed for SS
arrangement sheds light into the spatial and temporal coherence of the
structures, where the most dominant structures are found to be the Von-Karman
street vortices in the wake region.

a new surrogate waveform model, \texttt{NRSur2dq1Ecc}, using 47 nonspinning,
equal-mass waveforms with eccentricities up to $0.2$ when measured at a
reference time of $5500M$ before merger. This is the first waveform model that
is directly trained on eccentric numerical relativity simulations and does not
require that the binary circularizes before merger. The model includes the
$(2,2)$, $(3,2)$, and $(4,4)$ spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes. We also
build a final black hole model, \texttt{NRSur2dq1EccRemnant}, which models the
mass, and spin of the remnant black hole. We show that our waveform model can
accurately predict numerical relativity waveforms with mismatches $\approx
10^{-3}$, while the remnant model can recover the final mass and dimensionless
spin with absolute errors smaller than $\approx 5 \times 10^{-4}M$ and $\approx
2 \times10^{-3}$ respectively. We demonstrate that the waveform model can also
recover subtle effects like mode-mixing in the ringdown signal without any
special ad-hoc modeling steps. Finally, we show that despite being trained only
on equal-mass binaries, \texttt{NRSur2dq1Ecc} can be reasonably extended up to
mass ratio $q\approx3$ with mismatches $\simeq 10^{-2}$ for eccentricities
smaller than $\sim 0.05$ as measured at a reference time of $2000M$ before

namely, model poisoning (MP). In this paper, we aim to propose effective MP
algorithms to combat state-of-the-art defensive aggregation mechanisms (e.g.,
Krum and Trimmed mean) implemented at the server without being noticed, i.e.,
covert MP (CMP). Specifically, we first formulate the MP as an optimization
problem by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the manipulated model and
designated one, constrained by a defensive aggregation rule. Then, we develop
CMP algorithms against different defensive mechanisms based on the solutions of
their corresponding optimization problems. Furthermore, to reduce the
optimization complexity, we propose low complexity CMP algorithms with a slight
performance degradation. In the case that the attacker does not know the
defensive aggregation mechanism, we design a blind CMP algorithm, in which the
manipulated model will be adjusted properly according to the aggregated model
generated by the unknown defensive aggregation. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed CMP algorithms are effective and substantially
outperform existing attack mechanisms.

of a tricomponent droplet consisting of water, ethanol, and oil (""ouzo""), by
high-speed monitoring of the entire gasification event taking place in the
well-controlled, levitated Leidenfrost state over a superheated plate. It is
observed that the preferential evaporation of the most volatile component,
ethanol, triggers nucleation of the oil microdroplets/nanodroplets in the
remaining drop, which, consequently, becomes an opaque oil-in-water
microemulsion. The tiny oil droplets subsequently coalesce into a large one,
which, in turn, wraps around the remnant water. Because of the encapsulating
oil layer, the droplet can no longer produce enough vapor for its levitation,
and, thus, falls and contacts the superheated surface. The direct thermal

height H at Reynolds number 150 to quantify the improvement. The cylinder is
elastically mounted with a spring such that it is only free to vibrate in the
direction transverse to the channel flow and has a fixed mass ratio (m*) of 10.
The energy extraction process is modelled as a damper, with spatially constant
damping ration ((), attached to the cylinder. The simulations are performed by
varying the reduced velocity for a set of fixed mass-damping ({\alpha} = m*()
values ranging between 0 to 1. The blockage ratio (b = D/H) is varied from 0.25
to 0.5 by changing the channel height. The quasi-periodic initial branch found
for the unconfined cylinder shrinks with the increasing blockage. The extracted
power is found to increase rapidly with the blockage. For maximum blockage (b =
0.2), the maximum flow power extracted by the cylinder is an order of magnitude
larger as compared to what it would extract in an open domain with free stream
velocity equal to the channel mean velocity. The optimal mass-damping
({\alpha}c ) for extracting maximum power is found to lie between 0.2 to 0.3.
An expression is derived to predict the maximum extracted power from the

critical slowing down and fractal characteristics. From this study, lag-1

predict the transition well-before the tipping point. The warning time,
obtained using AC and $H$, reduces with an increase in the rate of change of

fast rates, the warning time may be too short to perform any control action.
Furthermore, we report the observation of a hyperexponential scaling relation
between the AC and the variance of fluctuations during such dynamic Hopf

It is
widely known that any real number $\alpha \in \Bigl[0, \frac{\lfloor \beta

development in series of the form $\alpha = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty x_n\beta^{-n}$,
where $x = (x_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is a sequence taking values into the alphabet
$\{0,\; ...\; ,\; \lfloor \beta \rfloor\}$. The so called $\beta$-shift,
denoted by $\Sigma_\beta$, is given as the set of sequences such that all their
iterates by the shift map are less than or equal to the quasi-greedy
$\beta$-expansion of $1$. Fixing a H\""older continuous potential $A$, we show
an explicit expression for the main eigenfunction of the Ruelle operator
$\psi_A$, in order to obtain a natural extension to the bilateral $\beta$-shift
of its corresponding Gibbs state $\mu_A$. Our main goal here is to prove a
first level large deviations principle for the family $(\mu_{tA})_{t>1}$ with a
rate function $I$ attaining its maximum value on the union of the supports of
all the maximizing measures of $A$. The above is proved through a technique
using the representation of $\Sigma_\beta$ and its bilateral extension
$\widehat{\Sigma_\beta}$ in terms of the quasi-greedy $\beta$-expansion of $1$
and the so called involution kernel associated to the potential $A$.

minimum-norm interpolating classifiers (MNIC). The MNIC is the function of
smallest Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space norm that perfectly interpolates a
label pattern on a finite data set. We derive a mistake bound for MNIC and a
regularized variant that holds for all data sets. This bound follows from
elementary properties of matrix inverses. Under the assumption that the data is
independently and identically distributed, the mistake bound implies that MNIC
generalizes at a rate proportional to the norm of the interpolating solution
and inversely proportional to the number of data points. This rate matches
similar rates derived for margin classifiers and perceptrons. We derive several
plausible generative models where the norm of the interpolating classifier is
bounded or grows at a rate sublinear in $n$. We also show that as long as the
population class conditional distributions are sufficiently separable in total
variation, then MNIC generalizes with a fast rate.

analysis. In particular, it is challenging to infer stochastic dynamics given
incomplete data. We propose an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that
iterates between alternating two steps: E-step restores missing data points,
while M-step infers an underlying network model of restored data. Using
synthetic data generated by a kinetic Ising model, we confirm that the
algorithm works for restoring missing data points as well as inferring the
underlying model. At the initial iteration of the EM algorithm, the model
inference shows better model-data consistency with observed data points than
with missing data points. As we keep iterating, however, missing data points
show better model-data consistency. We find that demanding equal consistency of
observed and missing data points provides an effective stopping criterion for
the iteration to prevent overshooting the most accurate model inference. Armed
with this EM algorithm with this stopping criterion, we infer missing data
points and an underlying network from a time-series data of real neuronal
activities. Our method recovers collective properties of neuronal activities,
such as time correlations and firing statistics, which have previously never
been optimized to fit.

of robotics. As modular robots, they can show robustness to individual failure
and reconfigurability; as soft robots, they can deform and undergo large shape
changes in order to adapt to their environment, and have inherent human safety.
However, for sensing and communication these robots also combine the challenges
of both: they require solutions that are scalable (low cost and complexity) and
efficient (low power) to enable collectives of large numbers of robots, and
these solutions must also be able to interface with the high extension ratio
elastic bodies of soft robots. In this work, we seek to address these
challenges using acoustic signals produced by piezoelectric surface transducers
that are cheap, simple, and low power, and that not only integrate with but
also leverage the elastic robot skins for signal transmission. Importantly, to
further increase scalability, the transducers exhibit multi-functionality made
possible by a relatively flat frequency response across the audible and
ultrasonic ranges. With minimal hardware, they enable directional contact-based
communication, audible-range communication at a distance, and exteroceptive
sensing. We demonstrate a subset of the decentralized collective behaviors
these functions make possible with multi-robot hardware implementations. The
use of acoustic waves in this domain is shown to provide distinct advantages
over existing solutions.

networks where each location has links to a large number of potential

epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where we select a representative
subset of edges based on some measure of their importance. Recently an approach
was proposed using an algorithm based on the effective resistance of the edges.
We explore how effective resistance is correlated with the probability that an
edge transmits disease in the SI model. We find that in some cases these two
notions of edge importance are well correlated, making effective resistance a
computationally efficient proxy for the importance of an edge to epidemic
spread. In other cases, the correlation is weaker, and we discuss situations in
which effective resistance is not a good proxy for epidemic importance.

examine the occurance of mixing in the stars. While the object HD 30443 might
have experienced an extra mixing process that usually occurs after red giant

show any evidence of having undergone any such mixing process. The higher

misinformation in the first place, and their assessments may also provide
useful guidance to friends aiming to assess those posts themselves. In support
of lightweight assessment, we first develop a taxonomy of the reasons why
people believe a news claim is or is not true; this taxonomy yields a checklist
that can be used at posting time. We conduct evaluations to demonstrate that
the checklist is an accurate and comprehensive encapsulation of people's
free-response rationales. In a second experiment, we study the effects of three
behavioral nudges -- 1) checkboxes indicating whether headings are accurate, 2)
tagging reasons (from our taxonomy) that a post is accurate via a checklist and
3) providing free-text rationales for why a headline is or is not accurate --
on people's intention of sharing the headline on social media. From an
experiment with 1668 participants, we find that both providing accuracy
assessment and rationale reduce the sharing of false content. They also reduce
the sharing of true content, but to a lesser degree that yields an overall
decrease in the fraction of shared content that is false. Our findings have
implications for designing social media and news sharing platforms that draw
from richer signals of content credibility contributed by users. In addition,
our validated taxonomy can be used by platforms and researchers as a way to
gather rationales in an easier fashion than free-response.

that Responsible AI should be made the Norm rather than an Exception. It does
so by utilizing the guiding principles of: (1) alleviating friction in existing
workflows, (2) empowering stakeholders to get buy-in, and (3) conducting an
effective translation of abstract standards into actionable engineering
practices. After providing some overarching comments on the document from the
NSCAI, the report dives into the primary contribution of an actionable
framework to help operationalize the ideas presented in the document from the
NSCAI. The framework consists of: (1) a learning, knowledge, and information
exchange (LKIE), (2) the Three Ways of Responsible AI, (3) an
empirically-driven risk-prioritization matrix, and (4) achieving the right
level of complexity. All components reinforce each other to move from
principles to practice in service of making Responsible AI the norm rather than

Because interstellar minor bodies are moving much faster, they hit planets
harder and more often than in the local Galaxy. I estimate the rates for
Chicxulub-scale impacts on an Earth-size planet in elliptical galaxies as a
potential habitability constraint on intelligent life. Around most stars in a
normal elliptical galaxy, these planets receive only ~0.01 -- 0.1 Gyr$^{-1}$,
although hazardous rates may be common in certain compact early-type galaxies
and red nuggets. About 5% of the stellar mass is in a region where the rate is
>10 Gyr$^{-1}$, large enough to dominate the mass extinction rate. This
suggests that elliptical galaxies have an exclusion zone of order one hundred
parsecs in radius around their centers for the evolution of intelligent life.

accuracy with data privacy. This can be done using a combination of

these tools require different representations and switching between them is
time-consuming and expensive. Recent research suggests that ReLU is responsible
for most of the communication bandwidth. ReLU is usually applied at each pixel

operations. Specifically, the ReLU decision of one activation can be used by
others, and we explore different ways to group activations and different ways
to determine the ReLU for such a group of activations. Experiments on several

orders of magnitude and, as a result, cut the communication bandwidth by more

isotropic eikonal equation, there has been tremendous progress on the topic
addressing an array of challenges including improvement of the solution
accuracy, incorporation of surface topography, adding more accurate physics by
accounting for anisotropy/attenuation in the medium, and speeding up
computations using multiple CPUs and GPUs. Despite these advances, there is no
mechanism in these algorithms to carry on information gained by solving one
problem to the next. Moreover, these approaches may breakdown for certain
complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods to
estimate the solution. Therefore, we seek an alternate approach to address the
challenge in a holistic manner, i.e., a method that not only makes it simpler
to incorporate topography, allow accounting for any level of complexity in
physics, benefiting from computational speedup due to the availability of
multiple CPUs or GPUs, but also able to transfer knowledge gained from solving
one problem to the next. We develop an algorithm based on the emerging paradigm
of physics-informed neural network to solve various forms of the eikonal

speed up computations by utilizing information gained from prior solutions. We
also propose a two-stage optimization scheme to expedite the training process
in presence of sharper heterogeneity in the velocity model. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how the proposed approach makes it simpler to incorporate
additional physics and other features in contrast to conventional methods that
took years and often decades to make these advances. Such an approach not only
makes the implementation of eikonal solvers much simpler but also puts us on a
much faster path to progress.

systems are applied in areas where the decisions directly influence the lives
of humans. It is especially noisy and uncertain observations close to the
decision boundary which results in predictions which cannot necessarily be
explained that may foster mistrust among end-users. This drew attention to AI
methods for which the outcomes can be explained. Bayesian networks are
probabilistic graphical models that can be used as a tool to manage
uncertainty. The probabilistic framework of a Bayesian network allows for
explainability in the model, reasoning and evidence. The use of these methods
is mostly ad hoc and not as well organised as explainability methods in the

Bayesian networks. We extend the existing categorisation of explainability in

explanations obtained from the explainability methods are illustrated by means
of a simple medical diagnostic scenario. The taxonomy introduced in this paper
has the potential not only to encourage end-users to efficiently communicate

importantly, why certain predictions were made.

proposed to overcome common limitations shared by conventional reduced order
models (ROMs) - built, e.g., through proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) -
when applied to nonlinear time-dependent parametrized partial differential
equations (PDEs). These might be related to (i) the need to deal with
projections onto high dimensional linear approximating trial manifolds, (ii)
expensive hyper-reduction strategies, or (iii) the intrinsic difficulty to
handle physical complexity with a linear superimposition of modes. All these
aspects are avoided when employing DL-ROMs, which learn in a non-intrusive way
both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics, by relying on deep
(e.g., feedforward, convolutional, autoencoder) neural networks. Although
extremely efficient at testing time, when evaluating the PDE solution for any
new testing-parameter instance, DL-ROMs require an expensive training stage,
because of the extremely large number of network parameters to be estimated. In
this paper we propose a possible way to avoid an expensive training stage of
DL-ROMs, by (i) performing a prior dimensionality reduction through POD, and
(ii) relying on a multi-fidelity pretraining stage, where different physical
models can be efficiently combined. The proposed POD-DL-ROM is tested on
several (both scalar and vector, linear and nonlinear) time-dependent
parametrized PDEs (such as, e.g., linear advection-diffusion-reaction,
nonlinear diffusion-reaction, nonlinear elastodynamics, and Navier-Stokes

cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Instead of mining honestly, pools can be
incentivized to infiltrate their own miners into other pools. These
infiltrators report partial solutions but withhold full solutions, share block
rewards but make no contribution to block mining. The block withholding attack
among mining pools can be modeled as a non-cooperative game called ""the miner's
dilemm"", which reduces effective mining power in the system and leads to
potential systemic instability in the blockchain. However, existing literature
on the game-theoretic properties of this attack only gives a preliminary
analysis, e.g., an upper bound of 3 for the pure price of anarchy (PPoA) in
this game, with two pools involved and no miner betraying. Pure price of
anarchy is a measurement of how much mining power is wasted in the miner's
dilemma game. Further tightening its upper bound will bring us more insight
into the structure of this game, so as to design mechanisms to reduce the
systemic loss caused by mutual attacks. In this paper, we give a tight bound of
(1, 2] for the pure price of anarchy. Moreover, we show the tight bound holds
in a more general setting, in which infiltrators may betray.We also prove the
existence and uniqueness of pure Nash equilibrium in this setting. Inspired by
experiments on the game among three mining pools, we conjecture that similar
results hold in the N-player miner's dilemma game (N>=2).

showing that despite the proliferation of various GNNs, in fact, their proposed

Our proposed unified optimization framework, summarizing the commonalities
between several of the most representative GNNs, not only provides a
macroscopic view on surveying the relations between different GNNs, but also
further opens up new opportunities for flexibly designing new GNNs. With the
proposed framework, we discover that existing works usually utilize naive graph
convolutional kernels for feature fitting function, and we further develop two
novel objective functions considering adjustable graph kernels showing low-pass

convergence proofs and expressive power comparisons for the proposed models.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that the proposed GNNs

constrain their origin. From our 54 sq. deg. deep narrow-band [OIII] survey of
M31, we identify planetary nebulae (PNe) in the M31 disc and six major
inner-halo substructures - the Giant Stream, North East Shelf, G1-Clump,
Northern Clump, Western Shelf and Stream-D. We measure PNLF parameters from
cumulative fits and statistically compare the PNLFs in each substructure and
the disc. We link the PNLF parameters and those for the Large Magellanic Cloud
to published metallicities and age measurements for their parent SPs. The
absolute magnitudes of the PNLF bright cut-off ($M^{*}$) for these
sub-populations span a significant magnitude range, despite having similar
distance and line-of-sight extinction. $M^{*}$ for the Giant Stream, W-shelf
and Stream-D PNLFs are fainter than those predicted by PN evolution models for
the metallicity of the parent SPs. The faint-end slope of the PNLF increases
linearly with decreasing fraction of stellar mass younger than 5 Gyr across the
M31 regions and the LMC. From their PNLFs, the Giant Stream and NE-shelf are
consistent with being stellar debris from an infalling satellite, while the G1
Clump appears to be linked with the pre-merger disc. The SPs of the
substructures are consistent with those predicted by simulations of a single
massive merger event that took place 2--3 Gyr ago in M31. Stream-D has an
unrelated, distinct, origin. Furthermore, this study provides independent
evidence that the faint-end of the PNLF is preferentially populated by PNe
evolved from older stars.

Furthermore, our framework also demonstrated the relative ease of attack

among the most investigated quantum algorithms of recent times, with potential
applications including the solution of computationally intractable differential
equations and speed-ups in machine learning. A fundamental parameter governing
the efficiency of QLS solvers is $\kappa$, the condition number of the
coefficient matrix $A$, as it has been known since the inception of the QLS
problem that for worst-case instances the runtime scales at least linearly in
$\kappa$ [Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd, PRL 103, 150502 (2009)]. However, for the
case of positive-definite matrices classical algorithms can solve linear
systems with a runtime scaling as $\sqrt{\kappa}$, a quadratic improvement
compared to the the indefinite case. It is then natural to ask whether QLS
solvers may hold an analogous improvement. In this work we answer the question
in the negative, showing that solving a QLS entails a runtime linear in
$\kappa$ also when $A$ is positive definite. We then identify broad classes of
positive-definite QLS where this lower bound can be circumvented and present
two new quantum algorithms featuring a quadratic speed-up in $\kappa$: the
first is based on efficiently implementing a matrix-block-encoding of $A^{-1}$,
the second constructs a decomposition of the form $A = L L^\dagger$ to
precondition the system. These methods are widely applicable and both allow to

trilayer (1-3L) WS$_2$, WSe$_2$ and WTe$_2$ using a complementary suite of
experiments and theoretical calculations. High-quality 1L WS$_2$ has the
highest Young's modulus (302.4+-24.1 GPa) and strength (47.0+-8.6 GPa) of the
entire family, overpassing those of 1L WSe$_2$ (258.6+-38.3 and 38.0+-6.0 GPa,
respectively) and WTe$_2$ (149.1+-9.4 and 6.4+-3.3 GPa, respectively). However,
the elasticity and strength of WS$_2$ decrease most dramatically with increased
thickness among the three materials. We interpret the phenomenon by the
different tendencies for interlayer sliding in equilibrium state and under
in-plane strain and out-of-plane compression conditions in the indentation
process, revealed by finite element method (FEM) and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations including van der Waals (vdW) interactions. We also
demonstrate that the mechanical properties of the high-quality 1-3L WS$_2$ and
WSe$_2$ are largely stable in the air for up to 20 weeks. Intriguingly, the
1-3L WSe$_2$ shows increased modulus and strength values with aging in the air.
This is ascribed to oxygen doping, which reinforces the structure. The present
study will facilitate the design and use of 2D tungsten dichalcogenides in
applications, such as strain engineering and flexible field-effect transistors
(FETs).

and avoid exposing private information. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections),
including the version originally designed by Google (GQUIC) and the version
standardized by IETF (IQUIC), as alternatives to the traditional HTTP,
demonstrate their unique transmission characteristics: based on UDP for
encrypted resource transmitting, accelerating web page rendering. However,
existing encrypted transmission schemes based on TCP are vulnerable to website
fingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing adversaries to infer the users' visited
websites by eavesdropping on the transmission channel. Whether GQUIC and IQUIC
can effectively resist such attacks is worth investigating. In this paper, we
study the vulnerabilities of GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS to WFP attacks from the
perspective of traffic analysis. Extensive experiments show that, in the early
traffic scenario, GQUIC is the most vulnerable to WFP attacks among GQUIC,
IQUIC, and HTTPS, while IQUIC is more vulnerable than HTTPS, but the
vulnerability of the three protocols is similar in the normal full traffic
scenario. Features transferring analysis shows that most features are
transferable between protocols when on normal full traffic scenario. However,
combining with the qualitative analysis of latent feature representation, we
find that the transferring is inefficient when on early traffic, as GQUIC,
IQUIC, and HTTPS show the significantly different magnitude of variation in the
traffic distribution on early traffic. By upgrading the one-time WFP attacks to
multiple WFP Top-a attacks, we find that the attack accuracy on GQUIC and IQUIC
reach 95.4% and 95.5%, respectively, with only 40 packets and just using simple
features, whereas reach only 60.7% when on HTTPS. We also demonstrate that the
vulnerability of IQUIC is only slightly dependent on the network environment.

to their important role in diverse fields of science and engineering. In the
literature of manifold-valued data analysis up till now, however, only a few
works have been carried out concerning the robustness of estimation against
noises, outliers, and other sources of perturbations. In this regard, we
introduce a novel extrinsic framework for analyzing manifold valued data in a
robust manner. First, by extending the notion of the geometric median, we
propose a new robust location parameter on manifolds, so-called the extrinsic
median. A robust extrinsic regression method is also developed by incorporating
the conditional extrinsic median into the classical local polynomial regression
method. We present the Weiszfeld's algorithm for implementing the proposed
methods. The promising performance of our approach against existing methods is

strong baselines on two ad-hoc benchmarks. We also experimentally compare our

proportional to the mass of $u/d$ quark. Stable Borel region can be found, and
for this reason, the uncertainties caused by the QCD sum rule parameters are
small. The leading logarithmic corrections are also considered, which turn out

quintessence model, i.e. a scalar-tensor gravity model with a scalar field
potential serving as dark energy, by using the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data, together with the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and
redshift-space distortion (RSD) data. As an example, we consider the model with
a Brans-Dicke kinetic term $\frac{\omega(\phi)}{\phi} \phi_{;\mu} \phi^{;\mu} $
and a quadratic scalar potential $V (\phi) = A + B (\phi - \phi_0) +
\frac{C}{2} (\phi - \phi_0)^2$, which reduces to general relativity (GR) in the
limit $\omega(\phi) \to \infty$, and the cosmological constant in the limit
$B=C=0$. In such a model the scalar field typically rolls down the potential
and oscillates around the minimum of $V (\phi)$. We find that the model
parameter estimate for the CMB+BAO+RSD data set is given by $\lg \alpha = -3.6
_{-0.54}^{+0.66}~ (68\%)$, corresponding to $ 3.8 \times 10^5 < \omega_0 < 9.5
\times 10^7~ (68\%)$, and $\lg C = 4.9 \pm 1.4~ (68\%) $. However, the GR
$\Lambda$CDM model can fit the data almost as good as this extended
quintessence model, and is favored by the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
The variation of the gravitational constant since the epoch of Recombination is
constrained to be $0.97 < G_{\rm rec}/G_0 < 1.03~ (1 \sigma)$. In light of
recent report that the CMB data favors a closed universe, we consider the case
with non-flat geometry in our fit, and find that the mean value of $\Omega_k$
shifts a little bit from $-0.049$ to $-0.036$, and the parameters in our model
are not degenerate with $\Omega_k$.

1) In the meta-learning stage, the model acquires a knowledge base from a set

recognize unseen classes from very few examples. Inspired by the compositional
representation of objects in humans, we train a neural network architecture
that explicitly represents objects as a dictionary of shared components and
their spatial composition. In particular, during meta-learning, we train a
knowledge base that consists of a dictionary of component representations and a
dictionary of component activation maps that encode common spatial activation
patterns of components. The elements of both dictionaries are shared among the
training classes. During meta-testing, the representation of unseen classes is
learned using the component representations and the component activation maps
from the knowledge base. Finally, an attention mechanism is used to strengthen
those components that are most important for each category. We demonstrate the

detection network in the future. In this work, we make a forecast for the
cosmological parameter estimation with the standard siren observation from the
LISA-Taiji network. We simulate the standard siren data based on a scenario
with configuration angle of $40^{\circ}$ between LISA and Taiji. Three models
for the population of massive black hole binary (MBHB), i.e., pop III, Q3d, and
Q3nod, are considered to predict the events of MBHB mergers. We find that,
based on the LISA-Taiji network, the number of electromagnetic (EM)
counterparts detected is almost doubled compared with the case of single Taiji
mission. Therefore, the LISA-Taiji network's standard siren observation could
provide much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters. For example,
solely using the standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network, the constraint
precision of $H_0$ could reach $1.3\%$. Moreover, combined with the CMB data,
the GW-EM observation based on the LISA-Taiji network could also tightly
constrain the equation of state of dark energy, e.g., the constraint precision
of $w$ reaches about $4\%$, which is comparable with the result of CMB+BAO+SN.
It is concluded that the GW standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network will
become a useful cosmological probe in understanding the nature of dark energy
in the future.

equilibrium. With the help of the causal ordering algorithm, one can construct
graphical representations of dynamical systems that represent the causal
relations between the variables and the conditional independences in the
equilibrium distribution. We apply these tools to formulate sufficient
graphical conditions for identifying perfect adaptation from a set of
first-order differential equations. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions
to test for the presence of perfect adaptation in experimental equilibrium

this, as such data exists even for very low-resource languages. However,
previous work has only found minor benefits from using typological information.
Our hypothesis is that a model trained in a cross-lingual setting will pick up
on typological cues from the input data, thus overshadowing the utility of
explicitly using such features. We verify this hypothesis by blinding a model
to typological information, and investigate how cross-lingual sharing and
performance is impacted. Our model is based on a cross-lingual architecture in
which the latent weights governing the sharing between languages is learnt
during training. We show that (i) preventing this model from exploiting
typology severely reduces performance, while a control experiment reaffirms
that (ii) encouraging sharing according to typology somewhat improves

performed as the final step of the cavity surface treatment; the cavities are
heated in a vacuum furnace for 3 h, followed by high-pressure rinsing and
radio-frequency measurement. This method is simpler and potentially more
reliable than previously reported heat-treatment methods, and it is therefore,
easier to apply to the SRF cavities. We find that the quality factor is
increased after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 300C to 400C, while
strong decreasing the quality factor at high accelerating field is observed
after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 600C to 800C. We find
significant differences in the surface resistance for various processing
temperatures.

information from the atom of interest and its environment to estimate the
possibility. The models were then used to establish recommendation systems,
which can suggest a list of atoms for an environment within a structure. The
center atom of that environment was then replaced with the various recommended
atoms to generate new structures. Based on these recommendations, we also
propose a method of dissimilarity measurement between the atoms and, through
hierarchical cluster analysis and visualization using the multidimensional

In
particular, we revise its ground state energy and the superfluid neutron
pairing gap, and analyze their evolution from the weak to the strong coupling
regime. The calculations of the energy and the pairing gap are performed,
respectively, within the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approach of nuclear matter
and the BCS theory using the chiral nucleon-nucleon interaction of Entem and
Machleidt at N$^3$LO and the Argonne V18 phenomenological potential. Results
for the energy are also shown for a simple Gaussian potential with a strength
and range adjusted to reproduce the $^1S_0$ neutron-neutron scattering length
and effective range. Our results are compared with those of quantum Monte Carlo
calculations for neutron matter and cold atoms. The Tan contact parameter in
neutron matter is also calculated finding a reasonable agreement with
experimental data with ultra-cold atoms only at very low densities. We find
that low-density neutron matter exhibits a behavior close to that of a Fermi
gas at the unitary limit, although, this limit is actually never reached. We
also review the properties (energy, effective mass and quasiparticle residue)
of a spin-down neutron impurity immersed in a low-density free Fermi gas of
spin-up neutrons already studied by the author in a recent work where it was
shown that these properties are very close to those of an attractive Fermi

  Based on the Gaussian Field Theory",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents a novel method for obtaining the probability wave of
breaking ($P_b$) of deep water, dominant wind-sea waves (that is, waves made of
the energy within $\pm$30\% of the peak wave frequency) derived from Gaussian
wave field theory. For a given input wave spectrum we demonstrate how it is
possible to derive a joint probability density function between wave phase
speed ($c$) and horizontal orbital velocity at wave crest ($u$) from which a
model for $P_b$ can be obtained. A non-linear kinematic wave breaking criterion
consistent with the Gaussian framework is further proposed. Our model would
allow, therefore, for application of the classical wave breaking criterion
(that is, wave breaking occurs if $u/c > 1$) in spectral wave models which, to
the authors' knowledge, has not been done to date. Our results show that the
proposed theoretical model has errors in the same order of magnitude as six
other historical models when assessed using three field datasets. With
optimization of the proposed model's single free parameter, it can become the
best performing model for specific datasets. Although our results are
promising, additional, more complete wave breaking datasets collected in the
field are needed to comprehensively assess the present model, especially in
regards to the dependence on phenomena such as direct wind forcing, long wave
modulation and wave directionality.

cutting through the dust cavity around MM1B and aligned in the

the CM2 shock and the maser motion. The complicated proper motions in MM1-W1

design a user-study in which listeners are asked to compare pairs of lists of

compare participants' ratings with results obtained through computational
models built using audio tracks' features and artist attributes. We find that

Moving Bodies""} and the birth of special relativity, it is understood that the
theory was basically coded within Maxwell's equations. The celebrated
mass-energy equivalence relation, $E=mc^2$, is derived by Einstein using
thought experiments involving the kinematics of the emission of light
(electromagnetic energy) and the relativity principle. Text book derivations
often follow paths similar to Einstein's, or the analysis of the kinematics of
particle collisions interpreted from the perspective of different inertial
frames. All the same, in such derivations the direct dynamical link with
hypothetical fundamental fields describing matter (e.g. Maxwell theory or
other) is overshadowed by the use of powerful symmetry arguments, kinematics,
and the relativity principle.
  Here we show that the formula can be derived directly form the dynamical
equations of a massless matter model confined in a box (which can be thought of
as a toy model of a composite particle). The only assumptions in the derivation
are that the field equations hold and the energy-momentum tensor admits a
universal interpretation in arbitrary coordinate systems. The mass-energy
equivalence relation follows from the inertia or (taking the equivalence
principle for granted) weight of confined field radiation. The present
derivation offers an interesting pedagogical perspective on the formula
providing a simple toy model on the origin of mass and a natural bridge to the
foundations of general relativity.

Piezo1-induced membrane footprint generation and gating response, and the
budding of membranes by protein coats during endocytosis. For each problem, the
full 3D membrane deformation is captured, potential symmetry-breaking
deformation paths identified, and various case studies of boundary and load

the outer electron orbits and atomic radius of metal atom are two important
factors that affect the conversion. For the phase transition to occur, the
metal atom needs to have enough empty d orbitals, and the radius of the metal
atom is in the range of 0.136-0.159 nm. Through further analysis, we find that
the p orbitals of carbon atoms and d orbital of metal atom in SHBG will be
strongly hybridized, thereby promoting the conversion. The results supply

semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It
raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by
explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely
explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing

Remarkably, the emission direction of this micro-lighthouse is continuously

transition metal oxides (TMO) had triggerred umpteen discourses due to the
indubitable impact of TMO in reducing the contact resistances and restraining
the Fermi-level pinning for the metal-TMDC contacts. In the present work, we
focus on the unresolved tumults of large-area TMDC/TMO interfaces, grown by
adopting different techniques. Here, on a pulsed laser deposited (PLD) MoS2
thin film, a layer of TiO2 is grown by using both atomic layer deposition (ALD)
and PLD. These two different techniques emanate TiO2 layers with different
crystalline properties, thicknesses and interfacial morphologies, subsequently
influencing the electronic and optical properties of the interfaces. In
addition, they manifest a boost in the extent of p-type doping with increasing
thickness of TiO2, as emerged after analyzing the core-level shifts of the
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Density functional analysis of the
MoS2/Anatase-TiO2 interfaces, for pristine and in presence of a wide range of
interfacial defects, could explain the interdependence of doping and the
terminating atomic-surface of TiO2 on MoS2. The optical properties of the
interface, encompassing the photoluminescence, transient absorption and z-scan
two-photon absorption indicate the presence of defect-induced localized mid-gap
levels in MoS2/TiO2 (PLD), resulting quenched exciton signals. On the contrary,
the relatively defect-free interface in MoS2/TiO2 (ALD) demonstrates a clear
presence of both A and B excitons of MoS2. From the investigation of optical
properties, we indicate that MoS2/TiO2 (PLD) interface may act as a promising
saturable absorber. Moreover, MoS2/TiO2 (PLD) interface had resulted a better
photo-transport. A potential application of MoS2/TiO2 (PLD) is demonstrated by
the fabrication of a p-type photo-transistor with the ionic-gel top gate.

topological insulating phase and intrinsic ferromagnetism) in two-dimensional
(2D) materials is much worthy of intensive study. In this work, the
piezoelectric properties of 2D topological insulators InXO (X=Se and Te) from
monolayer InX (X=Se and Te) with double-side oxygen functionalization are
studied by density functional theory (DFT). The large piezoelectric strain
coefficients (e.g. $d_{11}$=-13.02 pm/V for InSeO and $d_{11}$=-9.64 pm/V for
InTeO) are predicted, which are comparable and even higher than ones of many
other familiar 2D materials. Moreover, we propose two strategies to enhance
piezoelectric response of monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te). Firstly, the biaxial
strain (0.94-1.06) is applied, and the $d_{11}$ (absolute value) is increased
by 53\%/56\% for monolayer InSeO/InTeO at 1.06 strain, which is due to
increased $e_{11}$ (absolute value) and reduced $C_{11}-C_{12}$. In considered
strain range, InXO (X=Se and Te) monolayers are always 2D topological
insulators, which confirm the coexistence of piezoelectricity and nontrivial
band topology. Secondly, a Janus monolayer $\mathrm{In_2SeTeO_2}$ is designed
by replacing the top Se/Te atomic layer in monolayer InSeO/InTeO with Te/Se
atoms, which is dynamically and mechanically stable. More excitingly, Janus
monolayer $\mathrm{In_2SeTeO_2}$ is also a 2D topological insulator with
sizeable bulk gap up to 0.158 eV, confirming the coexistence of intrinsic
piezoelectricity and topological nature. The calculated $d_{11}$ is -9.9 pm/V,
which is in the middle of ones of InSeO and InTeO monolayers.

at identifying automatically lung parenchyma and lobes. Next, we combined such
segmentation network with classification networks for COVID-19 identification
and lesion categorization. We compare the obtained classification results with
those obtained by three expert radiologists on a dataset consisting of 162 CT
scans. Results showed a sensitivity of 90\% and a specificity of 93.5% for
COVID-19 detection, outperforming those yielded by the expert radiologists, and
an average lesion categorization accuracy of over 84%. Results also show that a
significant role is played by prior lung and lobe segmentation that allowed us
to enhance performance by over 20 percent points. The interpretation of the
trained AI models, moreover, reveals that the most significant areas for
supporting the decision on COVID-19 identification are consistent with the
lesions clinically associated to the virus, i.e., crazy paving, consolidation
and ground glass. This means that the artificial models are able to
discriminate a positive patient from a negative one (both controls and patients
with interstitial pneumonia tested negative to COVID) by evaluating the
presence of those lesions into CT scans. Finally, the AI models are integrated
into a user-friendly GUI to support AI explainability for radiologists, which

optimization method developed by mimicking social behaviour observed in nature.
Its ability to optimize is not specifically implemented but emerges in the
global level from local interactions. In its canonical version, there are three
factors that govern a particle's trajectory: 1) inertia from its previous
displacement; 2) attraction to its best experience; and 3) attraction to a
given neighbour's best experience. The importance given to each of these
factors is regulated by three coefficients: 1) the inertia; 2) the
individuality; and 3) the sociality weights. Their settings rule the trajectory
of the particle when pulled by these two attractors. Different speeds and forms
of convergence of a particle towards its attractor(s) take place for different
settings of the coefficients. A more general formulation is presented aiming
for a better control of the embedded randomness. Guidelines to select the
coefficients' settings to obtain the desired behaviour are offered. The
convergence speed of the algorithm also depends on the speed of spread of
information within the swarm. The latter is governed by the structure of the
neighbourhood, whose study is beyond the scope of this paper. The objective
here is to help understand the core of the PSO paradigm from the bottom up by
offering some insight into the form of the particles' trajectories, and to
provide some guidelines as to how to decide upon the settings of the
coefficients in the particles' velocity update equation in the proposed
formulation to obtain the type of behaviour desired for the problem at hand.
General-purpose settings are also suggested. The relationship between the
proposed formulation and both the classical and constricted PSO formulations
are also provided.

suitably-weighted individual galaxies, we reconstruct the star-formation
history of the Universe, which we find to be in reasonable agreement with
previous studies. Dividing the galaxies by their present-day stellar mass, we
demonstrate the downsizing phenomenon, whereby the more massive galaxies hosted
the most star-formation at earlier times. Further dividing the galaxy sample by
colour and morphology, we find that a galaxy's present-day colour tells us more
about its historical contribution to the cosmic star formation history than its
current morphology. We show that downsizing effects are greatest among galaxies
currently in the blue cloud, but that the level of downsizing in galaxies of
different morphologies depends quite sensitively on the morphological
classification used, due largely to the difficulty in classifying the smaller
low-mass galaxies from their ground-based images. Nevertheless, we find
agreement that among galaxies with stellar masses
$M_{\star}>6\times10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$, downsizing is most significant in
spirals. However, there are complicating factors. For example, for more massive
galaxies, we find that colour and morphology are predictors of the past star
formation over a longer timescale than in less massive systems. Presumably this
effect is reflecting the longer period of evolution required to alter these
larger galaxies' physical properties, but shows that conclusions based on any
single property don't tell the full story.

In the general case, finding BNE is known to be computationally hard. Previous

such PDEs explicitly, calculating pointwise best-responses in strategy space,
or iteratively solving restricted subgames. In this study, we present a generic

represents strategies as neural networks and applies policy iteration based on
gradient dynamics in self-play. Most auctions are ex-post nondifferentiable, so
gradients may be unavailable or misleading, and we rely on suitable

dynamics cannot guarantee convergence to NE in general, we observe fast and
robust convergence to approximate BNE in a wide variety of auctions and present
a sufficient condition for convergence

particle-based measurement techniques for experimental analysis of fluid flows.
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique is widely used to identify flow
parameters from time-consecutive snapshots of particles injected into the
fluid. The computation is performed as post-processing of the experimental data
via proximity measure between particles in frames of reference. However, the
post-processing step becomes problematic as the motility and density of the
particles increases, since the data emerges in extreme rates and volumes.
Moreover, existing algorithms for PIV either provide sparse estimations of the
flow or require large computational time frame preventing from on-line use. The
goal of this manuscript is therefore to develop an accurate on-line algorithm
for estimation of the fine-grained velocity field from PIV data. As the data
constitutes a pair of images, we employ computer vision methods to solve the
problem. In this work, we introduce a convolutional neural network adapted to
the problem, namely Volumetric Correspondence Network (VCN) which was recently
proposed for the end-to-end optical flow estimation in computer vision. The
network is thoroughly trained and tested on a dataset containing both synthetic
and real flow data. Experimental results are analyzed and compared to that of
conventional methods as well as other recently introduced methods based on
neural networks. Our analysis indicates that the proposed approach provides
improved efficiency also keeping accuracy on par with other state-of-the-art
methods in the field. We also verify through a-posteriori tests that our newly
constructed VCN schemes are reproducing well physically relevant statistics of
velocity and velocity gradients.

radar-communication (RadCom) system, we propose two transmission techniques
respectively based on separated and shared antenna deployments. Both techniques
are designed to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) and the probing power at
target's location under average power constraints at the antennas such that the
system can simultaneously communicate with downlink users and detect the target
within the same frequency band. Based on a Weighted Minimized Mean Square
Errors (WMMSE) method, the separated deployment transmission is designed via
semidefinite programming (SDP) while the shared deployment problem is solved by
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. Numerical results show that the
shared deployment outperforms the separated deployment in radar beamforming.
The tradeoffs between WSR and probing power at target are compared among both
proposed transmissions and two practically simpler dual-function
implementations i.e., time division and frequency division. Results show that
although the separated deployment enables spectrum sharing, it experiences a
performance loss compared with frequency division, while the shared deployment
outperforms both and surpasses time division in certain conditions.

dialogue state annotations, which are expensive to acquire in large scale. In
call centers, for tasks like managing bookings or subscriptions, the user goal
can be associated with actions (e.g.~API calls) issued by customer service
agents. These action logs are available in large volumes and can be utilized
for learning dialogue states. However, unlike turn-level annotations, such
logged actions are only available sparsely across the dialogue, providing only
a form of weak supervision for DST models. To efficiently learn DST with sparse
labels, we extend a state-of-the-art encoder-decoder model. The model learns a
slot-aware representation of dialogue history, which focuses on relevant turns
to guide the decoder. We present results on two public multi-domain DST
datasets (MultiWOZ and Schema Guided Dialogue) in both settings i.e. training
with turn-level and with sparse supervision. The proposed approach improves
over baseline in both settings. More importantly, our model trained with sparse
supervision is competitive in performance to fully supervised baselines, while
being more data and cost efficient.

train an agent to converge to a fixed policy that is as close to optimal as
possible for a single fixed reward function. If different agent behaviour is
required in the future, an agent trained in this way must normally be either
fully or partially retrained, wasting valuable time and resources. In this
study, we leverage multi-objective reinforcement learning to create tunable
agents, i.e. agents that can adopt a range of different behaviours according to
the designer's preferences, without the need for retraining. We apply this
technique to sequential social dilemmas, settings where there is inherent
tension between individual and collective rationality. Learning a single fixed
policy in such settings leaves one at a significant disadvantage if the
opponents' strategies change after learning is complete. In our work, we
demonstrate empirically that the tunable agents framework allows easy adaption
between cooperative and competitive behaviours in sequential social dilemmas
without the need for retraining, allowing a single trained agent model to be
adjusted to cater for a wide range of behaviours and opponent strategies.

overcomes the long-established complexity of controlling the buckling in

frequency of the driving force applied to the resonator in the nonlinear
regime. The experimental characteristic parameters of the chaotic regime,
namely the Poincar\'e sections and Lyapunov exponents, are directly comparable
to simulations for different configurations. These results confirm that this

opinions and attitudes expressed by users. While interactions in social media
such as Twitter occur in many natural languages, research on stance detection
(the position or attitude expressed with respect to a specific topic) within
the Natural Language Processing field has largely been done for English.
Although some efforts have recently been made to develop annotated data in
other languages, there is a telling lack of resources to facilitate
multilingual and crosslingual research on stance detection. This is partially
due to the fact that manually annotating a corpus of social media texts is a
difficult, slow and costly process. Furthermore, as stance is a highly domain-
and topic-specific phenomenon, the need for annotated data is specially
demanding. As a result, most of the manually labeled resources are hindered by
their relatively small size and skewed class distribution. This paper presents
a method to obtain multilingual datasets for stance detection in Twitter.
Instead of manually annotating on a per tweet basis, we leverage user-based
information to semi-automatically label large amounts of tweets. Empirical
monolingual and cross-lingual experimentation and qualitative analysis show
that our method helps to overcome the aforementioned difficulties to build
large, balanced and multilingual labeled corpora. We believe that our method
can be easily adapted to easily generate labeled social media data for other
Natural Language Processing tasks and domains.

solving vision tasks recently, e.g., the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image
classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with
fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global
relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs
when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is
because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the
important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels,
leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone
design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets
and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new
Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-ViT), which incorporates 1) a
layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize
the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one
Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding
tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient
backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN
architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the
parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than
3.0\% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms
ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly
training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with comparable size to ResNet50
(21.5M parameters) can achieve 83.3\% top1 accuracy in image resolution

points using the proposed inception layers and then aligned by feature
transform. These local features are aggregated using the global average pooling
layer to obtain the global features. Finally, feed the concatenated local and

We perform an exhaustive experimental analysis of the PIG-Net architecture on
two state-of-the-art datasets, namely, ShapeNet [1] and PartNet [2]. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our network by performing ablation study.

infectious diseases, including Legionnaire's disease, gastroenteritis-causing

most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes
may exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and
stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of
microorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in
public restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19,
especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot
traffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of
aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by
flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that
the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets
in the size range 0.3$\mu m$ to 3$\mu m$, which can reach heights of at least
1.52m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them
completely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps
between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol
levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol
levels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted
during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate
ventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help
prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of
airborne disease transmission.

brute-force state augmentation baseline where the state is concatenated to the

Markov policies, we show they are sub-optimal in general. Consequently, we
devise a non-stationary Q-learning style model-based algorithm that solves
delayed execution tasks without resorting to state-augmentation. Experiments on
tabular, physical, and Atari domains reveal that it converges quickly to high
performance even for substantial delays, while standard approaches that either

cold Bose gas, can experience strong interactions mediated by the many-body
environment and form bipolaron bound states. Here we present a detailed study
of heavy polarons in a one-dimensional Bose gas by formulating a
non-perturbative theory and complementing it with exact numerical simulations.
We develop an analytic approach for weak boson-boson interactions and
arbitrarily strong impurity-boson couplings. Our approach is based on a
mean-field theory that accounts for deformations of the superfluid by the
impurities and in this way minimizes quantum fluctuations. The mean-field
equations are solved exactly in Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation leading to
an analytic expression for the interaction potential of heavy polarons which is
found to be in excellent agreement with quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) results. In
the strong-coupling limit the potential substantially deviates from the
exponential form valid for weak coupling and has a linear shape at short
distances. Taking into account the leading-order Born-Huang corrections we
calculate bipolaron binding energies for impurity-boson mass ratios as low as 3
and find excellent agreement with QMC results.

perturbations are found to be associated with enhancement of He I 10830 A
absorption in a moss region, which is connected to loops with million-degree
plasma. FFT analysis to the perturbations gives a kind of spectrum similar to
that of Doppler velocity: a number of discrete periods around 5 minutes. The
amplitudes of the magnetic perturbations are found to be proportional to
magnetic field strength over these sub-areas. In addition, magnetic
perturbations lag behind a quarter of cycle in phase with respect to the p-mode
Doppler velocity. We show that the relationships can be well explained with an
MHD solution for the magneto-acoustic oscillations in high-\b{eta} plasma.
Observational analysis also shows that, for the two regions with the stronger

findings show that the magnetic perturbations are actually magneto-acoustic
oscillations on the solar surface, the photosphere, powered by p-mode
oscillations. The findings may provide a new diagnostic tool for exploring the
relationship between magneto-acoustic oscillations and the heating of solar
upper atmosphere, as well as their role in helioseismology.

between two sub-steps in particle tracking, namely the localization of
particles in single images and the linking of the extracted particle positions

localization technique to detect particles and two linking algorithms, which
apply either frame-by-frame linking or linear assignment problem solving.
Beyond that, we offer helpful tools to preprocess images automatically as well
as estimate parameters required for the localization algorithm by utilizing
machine learning. As an extra, we have implemented a technique to estimate the
current spatial orientation of Janus particles within the x-y-plane. Our
framework is readily extendable and easy-to-use as we offer a graphical user
interface and a command-line tool. Various output options, such as data frames

be over-emphasized, in view of their damaging potential. In the last decades,
advanced models for representing fluid-elastic coupling have therefore been
developed by the community of the domain. Those models are nowadays embedded in
the methodologies that are used on a regular basis by both steam generators
providers and operators, in order to prevent the risk of a tube failure with
adequate safety margins. From an R&D point of view however, the need still
remains for more advanced models of fluid-elastic coupling, in order to fully
decipher the physics underlying the observed phenomena. As a consequence, new
experimental flow-coupling coefficients are also required to specifically feed
and validate those more sophisticated models. Recent experiments performed at
CEA-Saclay suggest that the fluid stiffness and damping coefficients depend on
further dimensionless parameters beyond the reduced velocity.
  In this work, the problem of data reduction is first revisited, in the light
of dimensional analysis. For single-phase flows, it is underlined that the
flow-coupling coefficients depend at least on two dimensionless parameters,
namely the Reynolds number $Re$ and the Stokes number $Sk$. Therefore, reducing
the experimental data in terms of the compound dimensionless quantity
$V_r=Re/Sk$ necessarily leads to impoverish results, hence the data dispersion.
In a second step, experimental data are presented using the dimensionless
numbers $Re$ and $Sk$. We report experiments, for a 3x5 square tube bundle
subjected to water transverse flow. The bundle is rigid, except for the central
tube which is mounted on a flexible suspension allowing for translation motions
in the lift direction.

Reinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing
Android malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies,
namely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement
learning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in
the adversary's shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models
with the goal of maximizing fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to
the Android application and ensuring that the app's functionality and behavior
do not change. We achieved an average fooling rate of 44.21% and 53.20% across
all the eight detection models with a maximum of five modifications using a
single policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest
fooling rate of 86.09% with five changes was attained against the decision
tree-based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an
adversarial defense strategy that reduces the average fooling rate by threefold
to 15.22% against a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of
the detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants
(metamorphic) of malware. The experimental analysis shows that our proposed
Android malware detection system using reinforcement learning is more robust

simultaneously in the near infrared (NIR) and far infrared (FIR) wavelengths

the properties of the dust grains and the strength of the radiation field. We
present computations of dust emission and scattered light of a quiescent
molecular cloud LDN1512. We construct radiative transfer models for LDN1512
that include an anisotropic radiation field and a three-dimensional cloud
model. We are able to reproduce the observed FIR observations, with a radiation
field derived from the DIRBE observations, with all of the tested dust models.
However, with the same density distribution and the assumed radiation field,
the models fail to reproduce the observed NIR scattering in all cases except
for models that take into account dust evolution via coagulation and mantle
formation. We find that the column densities derived from our radiative
transfer modelling can differ by a factor of up to two, compared to the column
densities derived from the observations with modified blackbody fits. The
discrepancy in the column densities is likely caused because of temperature
difference between a modified blackbody fit and the real spectra.
  We show that the observed dust emission can be reproduced with several
different assumptions about the properties of the dust grains. However, in
order to reproduce the observed scattered surface brightness dust evolution
must be taken into account.

answer is yes, and it has been suggested that the computer science principle of

that there cannot in general be shortcuts to predict the behavior of agents,
explaining why deterministic agents often appear to act freely. In this paper,
we introduce a variant of computational irreducibility that intends to capture
more accurately aspects of actual (as opposed to apparent) free agency:
computational sourcehood, i.e. the phenomenon that the successful prediction of
a process' behavior must typically involve an almost-exact representation of
the relevant features of that process, regardless of the time it takes to
arrive at the prediction. We argue that this can be understood as saying that
the process itself is the source of its actions, and we conjecture that many
computational processes have this property. The main contribution of this paper
is technical: we analyze whether and how a sensible formal definition of
computational sourcehood is possible. While we do not answer the question
completely, we show how it is related to finding a particular simulation
preorder on Turing machines, we uncover concrete stumbling blocks towards
constructing such a definition, and demonstrate that structure-preserving (as
opposed to merely simple or efficient) functions between levels of simulation
play a crucial role.

experiments beating the SQL are performed on the sensors which are well
isolated under extreme conditions. However, it has not been realized in
solid-state spin systems at ambient conditions, owing to its intrinsic
complexity for the preparation and survival of pure and entangled quantum
states. Here we show a full interferometer sequence beating the SQL by
employing a hybrid multi-spin system, namely the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect
in diamond. The interferometer sequence starts from a deterministic and joint
initialization, undergoes entanglement and disentanglement of multiple spins,
and ends up with projective measurement. In particular, the deterministic and
joint initialization of NV negative state, NV electron spin, and two nuclear
spins is realized at room temperature for the first time. By means of optimal
control, non-local gates are implemented with an estimated fidelity above the
threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation. With these techniques
combined, we achieve two-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 1.79 \pm
0.06 dB beyond the SQL and three-spin 2.77 \pm 0.10 dB. Moreover, the
deviations from the HL induced by experimental imperfections are completely
accountable. The techniques used here are of fundamental importance for quantum
sensing and computing, and naturally applicable to other solid-state spin

moving groups allow to probe this population, since discs are expected to have
been brighter early on. This paper considers the population of F~stars in the
23~Myr-old BPMG where we find that 9/12 targets possess discs. We also analyse
archival ALMA data to derive radii for 4 of the discs, presenting the first
image of the 63au radius disc of HD~164249. Comparing the BPMG results to disc
samples from $\sim45$~Myr and $\sim150$~Myr-old moving~groups, and to discs
found around field stars, we find the disc incidence rate in young
moving~groups is comparable to that of the BPMG and significantly higher than
that of field~stars. The BPMG discs tend to be smaller than those around
field~stars. However, this difference is not statistically significant due to
the small number of targets. Yet, by analysing the fractional luminosity vs
disc radius parameter space we find that the fractional luminosities in the
populations considered drop by two orders of magnitude within the first
100~Myr. This is much faster than expected by collisional evolution, implying a
decay equivalent to $1/\text{age}^2$. We attribute this depletion to embedded
planets which would be around 170~$M_\text{earth}$ to cause a depletion on the
appropriate timescale. However, we cannot rule out that different birth
environments of nearby young clusters result in brighter debris discs than the
progenitors of field~stars which likely formed in a more dense environment.

  the Wild","17 pages, 26 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Predicting future frames of video sequences is challenging due to the complex
and stochastic nature of the problem. Video prediction methods based on
variational auto-encoders (VAEs) have been a great success, but they require
the training data to contain multiple possible futures for an observed video
sequence. This is hard to be fulfilled when videos are captured in the wild
where any given observation only has a determinate future. As a result,
training a vanilla VAE model with these videos inevitably causes posterior
collapse. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel VAE structure, dabbed
VAE-in-VAE or VAE$^2$. The key idea is to explicitly introduce stochasticity
into the VAE. We treat part of the observed video sequence as a random
transition state that bridges its past and future, and maximize the likelihood
of a Markov Chain over the video sequence under all possible transition states.
A tractable lower bound is proposed for this intractable objective function and
an end-to-end optimization algorithm is designed accordingly. VAE$^2$ can
mitigate the posterior collapse problem to a large extent, as it breaks the
direct dependence between future and observation and does not directly regress
the determinate future provided by the training data. We carry out experiments
on a large-scale dataset called Cityscapes, which contains videos collected
from a number of urban cities. Results show that VAE$^2$ is capable of
predicting diverse futures and is more resistant to posterior collapse than the
other state-of-the-art VAE-based approaches. We believe that VAE$^2$ is also
applicable to other stochastic sequence prediction problems where training data
are lack of stochasticity.

This paper proposes a unit-modulus over-the-air computation (UMAirComp)
framework to facilitate efficient edge federated learning, which simultaneously
uploads local model parameters and updates global model parameters via analog
beamforming. The proposed framework avoids sophisticated baseband signal
processing, leading to low communication delays and implementation costs.
Training loss bounds of UMAirComp FL systems are derived and two low-complexity
large-scale optimization algorithms, termed penalty alternating minimization
(PAM) and accelerated gradient projection (AGP), are proposed to minimize the
nonconvex nonsmooth loss bound. Simulation results show that the proposed
UMAirComp framework with PAM algorithm achieves a smaller mean square error of
model parameters' estimation, training loss, and test error compared with other
benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed UMAirComp framework with AGP
algorithm achieves satisfactory performance while reduces the computational
complexity by orders of magnitude compared with existing optimization
algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the implementation of UMAirComp in a
vehicle-to-everything autonomous driving simulation platform. It is found that
autonomous driving tasks are more sensitive to model parameter errors than
other tasks since the neural networks for autonomous driving contain sparser

softness reduces the ability of the system to phase-separate and the system
exhibit a delayed transition. After phase separation, the system state
properties can be explained by a single relevant lengthscale, the effective
inter-particle distance. We estimate this lengthscale analytically and use it
to rescale the state properties at dense phase for systems with different
interaction softness. Using this lengthscale, we provide a scaling relation for
the time taken to phase separate which shows a high sensitivity to the
interaction softness.

the entire ULIRG sample, which implies that ULIRGs have common radiative
processes regardless of the presence of optical AGNs, and thus AGNs might
equally contribute to the radio emission of every ULIRG. Although their spectra
are mainly explained by starbursts and/or merger activity, some individual
sources suggest contributions from AGNs. IRAS 00188$-$0856, whose optical
morphology is not disturbed, shows a large nonthermal fraction and a spectral
break at high frequency, which can be explained by synchrotron ageing of
nonthermal plasma emitted from AGNs. In addition, we find 100-kpc scale
extended emission associated with IRAS 01004$-$2237. The two-sided morphology

a learnable tokenizer. This allows our approach to perform multimodal fusion in
the language space, thus eliminating the need for ad-hoc cross-modal fusion
modules. To address the non-differentiability of tokenization on continuous
inputs (e.g., video or audio), we utilize a relaxation scheme that enables
end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike prior encoder-only models, our network
includes an autoregressive decoder to generate open-ended text from the
multimodal embeddings fused by the language encoder. This renders our approach
fully generative and makes it directly applicable to different ""video+$x$ to

remarkably effective: experiments demonstrate that our approach based on a

system. Following prior work, we study systems enduring a loss of control
authority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators
producing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time
readings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still
reach a target after a loss of control authority. However, after a malfunction
a resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to
its initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new
concept of quantitative resilience. We define this metric as the maximal ratio
of the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and
malfunctioning systems. Na\""ive computation of quantitative resilience directly
from the definition is a time-consuming task as it requires solving four
nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical
contribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute
quantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on three novel geometric
results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear
optimization problem. We illustrate our method on two numerical examples: an
opinion dynamics scenario and a trajectory controller for low-thrust
spacecrafts.

cell walls in Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$ cells, all intersected by Zr-rich platelets,
makes them some of the best performing high-temperature permanent magnets.
Plentiful research has been performed to tailor the microstructure at the
nanoscale, but due to its complexity many questions remain unanswered about the
effect of the individual phases on the magnetic performance at different
temperatures. Here, we explore this mechanism effect for three different
Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)$_z$ alloys by deploying high-resolution magnetic imaging via
in-situ transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional chemical
analysis using atom probe tomography. We show that their microstructures differ
in terms of SmCo$_5$ cell-wall and Z-phase size and density, as well as the Cu
concentration in the cell walls, and demonstrate how these features influence
the magnetic domain size and density and thus form different magnetic textures.
Moreover, we illustrate that the dominant coercivity mechanism at room
temperature is domain-wall pinning and show that magnets with a denser
cell-wall network, a steeper Cu gradient across the cell-wall boundary, and
thinner Z-phase platelets have a higher coercivity. We also show that the
coercivity mechanism at high temperatures is domain-wall nucleation at the cell
walls. Increasing the Cu concentration inside the cell walls decreases the
transition temperature between pinning and nucleation, significantly decreasing
the coercivity with increasing temperature. We therefore provide a detailed
explanation of how the microstructure on the atomic to nanoscale directly
affects the magnetic performance and provide detailed guidelines for an
improved design of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)$_z$ magnets.

modifying the electronic structure of their low dimensional constituents, for
example through doping, and studying the resulting collective bulk behaviour.
Insertion of electron donors or acceptors between graphitic layers is an
attractive method to reversibly increase charge carrier concentra-tion without
disruption of the sp$2$-conjugated system. This work demonstrates FeCl$_{3}$
intercalation into fibres made up of collapsed (flattened) carbon nanotubes.
The bundles of collapsed CNTs, similar to crystallites of graphitic
nanoribbons, host elongated layered FeCl$_{3}$ crystals of hundreds of $nm$
long, much longer than previous reports on graphitic materials and directly
observable by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.
Intercalated CNT fibres remain stable after months of exposure to ambient
conditions, partly due to the spontaneous formation of passivating monolayers
of FeClO at the crystal edge, preventing both desorption of intercalant and
further hydrolysis. Raman spectroscopy shows substantial electron transfer from
the CNTs to FeCl$_{3}$, a well-known acceptor, as observed by G band upshifts
as large as $25 cm^{-1}$. After resolving Raman features for the inner and
outer layers of the collapsed CNTs, strain and dynamic effect contributions of
charge transfer to the Raman upshift could be decoupled, giving a Fermi level
downshift of $- 0.72 eV$ and a large average free carrier concentration of
$5.3X10^{13}$ $cm^{-2}$ ($0.014$ electrons per carbon atom) in the intercalated
system. Four-probe resistivity measurements show an increase in conductivity by
a factor of six upon intercalation

non-colluding) adversary.
  Previous work in this area has been limited to just one specific activation
function: ReLU, rendering the approach impractical for many use-cases. For the
first time, we provide fast and verifiable protocols for all common activation
functions and optimize them for running in a secret-shared manner. The ability
to quickly, verifiably, and robustly compute exponentiation, softmax, sigmoid,

reducing developer effort and complexity of code. In recent times, ReLU has
been found to converge much faster and be more computationally efficient as
compared to non-linear functions like sigmoid or tanh. However, we argue that
it would be remiss not to extend the mechanism to non-linear functions such as
the logistic sigmoid, tanh, and softmax that are fundamental due to their
ability to express outputs as probabilities and their universal approximation
property. Their contribution in RNNs and a few recent advancements also makes
them more relevant.

inaccurate. In this paper, in order to adjust for autocorrelated errors, we
propose to learn the autocorrelation coefficient jointly with the model

  Text","Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Social media became popular and percolated almost all aspects of our daily
lives. While online posting proves very convenient for individual users, it
also fosters fast-spreading of various rumors. The rapid and wide percolation
of rumors can cause persistent adverse or detrimental impacts. Therefore,
researchers invest great efforts on reducing the negative impacts of rumors.
Towards this end, the rumor classification system aims to detect, track, and
verify rumors in social media. Such systems typically include four components:
(i) a rumor detector, (ii) a rumor tracker, (iii) a stance classifier, and (iv)
a veracity classifier. In order to improve the state-of-the-art in rumor
detection, tracking, and verification, we propose VRoC, a tweet-level
variational autoencoder-based rumor classification system. VRoC consists of a
co-train engine that trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) and rumor
classification components. The co-train engine helps the VAEs to tune their
latent representations to be classifier-friendly. We also show that VRoC is
able to classify unseen rumors with high levels of accuracy. For the PHEME
dataset, VRoC consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques, on
both observed and unobserved rumors, by up to 26.9%, in terms of macro-F1
scores.

the Boltzmann equation serves as the foundation of the lattice BGK (LBGK)
method developed in recent years. The description of the collision as a uniform
relaxation process of the distribution function towards its equilibrium is, in
many scenarios, simplistic. Based on a previous series of papers, we present a
collision model formulated as independent relaxations of the irreducible
components of the Hermit coefficients in the reference frame moving with the
fluid. These components, corresponding to the irreducible representation of the
rotation group, are the minimum tensor components that can be separately
relaxed without violating rotation symmetry. For the 2nd, 3rd and 4th moments
respectively, two, two and three independent relaxation rates can exist, giving
rise to the shear and bulk viscosity, thermal diffusivity and some high-order
relaxation process not explicitly manifested in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier
equations. Using the binomial transform, the Hermite coefficients are evaluated
in the absolute frame to avoid the numerical dissipation introduced by
interpolation. Extensive numerical verification is also provided.

are suffering from a problem that the information which their query/key/value

LSTM to obtain query/key/value and verified its effectiveness. (ii) We pointed
out 'inter-container' leakage problem, which happens in datasets where
questions are sometimes served together. To solve this problem, we showed
special indexing/masking techniques that are useful when using RNN-variants and
Transformer. (iii) We found additional hand-crafted features are effective to
overcome the limits of Transformer, which can never consider the samples older

experimental technologies that generates multi-scale biomedical big data. Link
prediction is increasingly used especially in bipartite biomedical networks to
identify hidden biological interactions and relationshipts between key entities
such as compounds, targets, gene and diseases. We propose a Graph Neural
Networks (GNN) method, namely Graph Pair based Link Prediction model (GPLP),
for predicting biomedical network links simply based on their topological
interaction information. In GPLP, 1-hop subgraphs extracted from known network
interaction matrix is learnt to predict missing links. To evaluate our method,
three heterogeneous biomedical networks were used, i.e. Drug-Target Interaction
network (DTI), Compound-Protein Interaction network (CPI) from NIH Tox21, and
Compound-Virus Inhibition network (CVI). Our proposed GPLP method significantly
outperforms over the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, different network
incompleteness is analysed with our devised protocol, and we also design an
effective approach to improve the model robustness towards incomplete networks.
Our method demonstrates the potential applications in other biomedical
networks.

differential-algebraic systems of equations (DAEs), as well as methods for
deriving governing equations for analytic characterization which is currently
limited to very small systems as it is carried out by hand. Analytic solutions
to the system and analytic characterization through governing equations provide
insights into the behaviors of DAEs as well as the parametric regions of
operation for each potential behavior. For each system (DAEs), and choice of
dependent variable, there is a corresponding governing equation which is
univariate ODE or PDE that is typically higher order than the constitutive
equations of the system. We first introduce a direct formulation for
representing systems of linear DAEs. Unlike state space formulations, our
formulation follows very directly from the system of constitutive equations
without the need for introducing state variables or singular matrices. Using
this formulation for the system of constitutive equations (DAEs), we develop
methods for deriving analytic expressions for the full solution (complementary
and particular) for all dependent variables of systems that consist of constant
coefficient ordinary-DAEs and special cases of partial-DAEs. We also develop
methods for deriving the governing equation for a chosen dependent variable for
the constant coefficient ordinary-DAEs and partial-DAEs as well as special
cases of variable coefficient DAEs. The methods can be automated with symbolic
coding environments thereby allowing for dealing with systems of any size while
retaining analytic nature. This is relevant for interpretable modeling,
analytic characterization and estimation, and engineering design in which the
objective is to tune parameter values to achieve specific behavior. Such
insights cannot directly be obtained using numerical simulations.

commonly referred to as Volumetric Water Content (VWC) and is used for
determining the field capacity of any soil. It is an important parameter
accounting for ensuring proper irrigation at plantation sites for farming as
well as for afforestation activities. The current work is an extension to
already going on research in the area of wireless underground sensor networks
(WUSNs). Sensor nodes equipped with Decagon 5TM volumetric water content (VWC)
and temperature sensor are deployed underground to understand the properties of
soil for agricultural activities. The major hindrances in the deployment of
such networks over a large field are the cost of VWC sensors and the
credibility of the data being collected by these sensors. In this paper, we
analyze the use of low-cost moisture and temperature sensors that can either be
used to estimate the VWC values and field capacity or cross-validate the data
of expensive VWC sensors before the actual deployment. Machine learning
algorithms, namely Neural Networks and Random Forests are investigated for
predicting the VWC value from low-cost moisture sensors. Several field
experiments are carried out to examine the proposed hypothesis. The results
showed that low-cost moisture sensors can assist in estimating the VWC and
field capacity with a minor trade-off.

fulfilling a specific trading order, either liquidation or acquirement, for a
given instrument. Towards effective execution strategy, recent years have
witnessed the shift from the analytical view with model-based market
assumptions to model-free perspective, i.e., reinforcement learning, due to its
nature of sequential decision optimization. However, the noisy and yet
imperfect market information that can be leveraged by the policy has made it
quite challenging to build up sample efficient reinforcement learning methods
to achieve effective order execution. In this paper, we propose a novel
universal trading policy optimization framework to bridge the gap between the
noisy yet imperfect market states and the optimal action sequences for order
execution. Particularly, this framework leverages a policy distillation method
that can better guide the learning of the common policy towards practically
optimal execution by an oracle teacher with perfect information to approximate
the optimal trading strategy. The extensive experiments have shown significant
improvements of our method over various strong baselines, with reasonable
trading actions.
