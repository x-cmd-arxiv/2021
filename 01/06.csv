  differential properties","66 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the classical problem of determining the stationary distribution
of the semimartingale reflected Brownian motion (SRBM) in a two-dimensional
wedge. Under standard assumptions on the parameters of the model (opening of
the wedge, angles of the reflections, drift), we study the algebraic and
differential nature of the Laplace transform of this stationary distribution.
We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for this Laplace transform to be
rational, algebraic, differentially finite or more generally differentially
algebraic. These conditions are explicit linear dependencies between the angles
of the model.
  A complicated integral expression for this Laplace transform has recently
been obtained by two authors of this paper. In the differentially algebraic
case, we provide a simple, explicit integral-free expression in terms of a
hypergeometric function. It specializes to earlier expressions in several
classical cases: the skew-symmetric case, the orthogonal reflections case and
the sum-of-exponential densities case (corresponding to the so-called
Dieker-Moriarty conditions on the parameters). This paper thus closes, in a
sense, the quest of all ``simple'' cases.
  To prove these results, we start from a functional equation that the Laplace
transform satisfies, to which we apply tools from diverse horizons. To
establish differential algebraicity, a key ingredient is Tutte's invariant
approach, which originates in enumerative combinatorics. It allows us to
express the Laplace transform (or its square) as a rational function of a
certain canonical invariant, a hypergeometric function in our context. To
establish differential transcendence, we turn the functional equation into a
difference equation and apply Galoisian results on the nature of the solutions
to such equations.

the effects of using polymers of different lengths. We measure the variation of

characterized by different scaling properties of the free energy with respect
to the polymer lengths and the channel diameter, $D$. We propose a regime map
in which the state of the system is determined by the values of the quantities
$N_2/N_1$ and $\lambda/(N_1+N_2)D^{-\beta}$, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the

of $F(\lambda)$ in each regime is in reasonable agreement with predictions
using a simple theoretical model. In addition, we use MC dynamics simulations
to study the segregation dynamics of initially overlapping polymers by
measurement of the incremental mean first-passage time with respect to
$\lambda$. For systems characterized by a wide range of $\lambda$ in which a
short polymer is nested within a longer one, the segregation dynamics are close

determines its position by obtaining sequential time-of-arrival (TOA) or
pseudorange measurements from signals broadcast by multiple synchronized base
stations (BSs). The existing localization method using sequential pseudorange
measurements and a linear clock drift model for the TDPBS, namely LSPM-D, does
not compensate the position displacement caused by the UD movement and will
result in position error. In this paper, depending on the knowledge of the UD
velocity, we develop a set of optimal localization methods for different cases.
First, for known UD velocity, we develop the optimal localization method,
namely LSPM-KVD, to compensate the movement-caused position error. We show that
the LSPM-D is a special case of the LSPM-KVD when the UD is stationary with
zero velocity. Second, for the case with unknown UD velocity, we develop a
maximum likelihood (ML) method to jointly estimate the UD position and
velocity, namely LSPM-UVD. Third, in the case that we have prior distribution
information of the UD velocity, we present a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimator for localization, namely LSPM-PVD. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower
bound (CRLB) for all three estimators and analyze their localization error
performance. We show that the position error of the LSPM-KVD increases as the
assumed known velocity deviates from the true value. As expected, the LSPM-KVD
has the smallest position error while the LSPM-PVD and the LSPM-UVD are more
robust when the prior knowledge of the UD velocity is limited. Numerical
results verify the theoretical analysis on the optimality and the positioning
accuracy of the proposed methods.

through behavioral repetition, it can trigger behavior automatically in the
same environment. Given the reciprocal relationship between habit and behavior,
changing lifestyle behaviors (e.g., toothbrushing) is largely a task of
breaking old habits and creating new and healthy ones. Thus, representing
users' habit strengths can be very useful for behavior change support systems
(BCSS), for example, to predict behavior or to decide when an intervention
reaches its intended effect. However, habit strength is not directly observable
and existing self-report measures are taxing for users. In this paper, built on
recent computational models of habit formation, we propose a method to enable
intelligent systems to compute habit strength based on observable behavior. The
hypothesized advantage of using computed habit strength for behavior prediction
was tested using data from two intervention studies, where we trained
participants to brush their teeth twice a day for three weeks and monitored
their behaviors using accelerometers. Through hierarchical cross-validation, we
found that for the task of predicting future brushing behavior, computed habit
strength clearly outperformed self-reported habit strength (in both studies)
and was also superior to models based on past behavior frequency (in the larger
second study). Our findings provide initial support for our theory-based
approach of modeling user habits and encourages the use of habit computation to
deliver personalized and adaptive interventions.

the mass and dynamical state of clusters. We used the dynamical information
derived from the X-ray data to assess the role of mergers in the origin of
radio halos. We studied the distribution of clusters in the radio power-mass
diagram and the role of dynamics on the radio luminosity and emissivity of
radio halos. We measured the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the
cluster mass and we compared it with the expectations of turbulent acceleration
models. We found that more than the 90% of radio halos are in merging clusters
and that their radio power correlates with the mass of the host clusters. The
correlation shows a large dispersion. Interestingly, we showed that cluster
dynamics contributes significantly to this dispersion with more disturbed
clusters being more radio luminous. Clusters without radio halos are generally
relaxed and the upper limits to their diffuse emission lie below the
correlation. We showed that the radio emissivity of clusters exhibits an
apparent bimodality, with the emissivity of radio halos being at least 5 times
larger than the non-emission associated with more relaxed clusters. We found
that the fraction of radio halos drops from ~70% in high mass clusters to ~35%
in the lower mass systems of the sample and we showed that this result is in
good agreement with the expectations from turbulent re-acceleration models.

aperture of $R_{X,500}$ (X-ray estimate of $R_{500}$) centered on the Brightest

losses from background subtraction, we recover $\sim$20% of the ICL flux,
approximately four times our estimate of the typical background at the same
isophotal level ($\sim$ 5%). We find that the ICL makes up about $\sim$ 24% of
the total cluster stellar mass on average ($\sim$ 41% including the flux
contained in the BCG within 50 kpc); this value is well-matched with other
observational studies and semi-analytic/numerical simulations, but is
significantly smaller than results from recent hydrodynamical simulations (even
when measured in an observationally consistent way). We find no evidence for
any links between the amount of ICL flux with cluster mass, but find a growth
rate of $2-4$ for the ICL between $0.1 < z < 0.5$. We conclude that the ICL is
the dominant evolutionary component of stellar mass in clusters from $z \sim

specifically investigate the interplay of atomic position disorder, multiple

qualitative arguments and present numerical evidence that such a system

closed systems, this system is intrinsically open. However, as dissipation
originates from transport of energy to the system boundaries and the subsequent
radiative loss, the lack of transport in the MBL phase makes the waveguide QED
system look essentially closed and makes applicable the notions of MBL.
Conversely, we show that if the system is initially in a delocalized phase due
to a large excitation density, rapid initial dissipation can leave the system
unable to efficiently transport energy at later times, resulting in a dynamical
transition to an MBL phase. These phenomena can be feasibly realized in
state-of-the-art experimental setups.

strata of $k$-differentials was known for holomorphic differentials,
meromorphic differentials and quadratic differentials with at worst simple
poles by Kontsevich--Zorich, Boissy and Lanneau, respectively. Built on their
work we develop new techniques to study connected components of the strata of
$k$-differentials for general $k$. As an application, we give a complete
classification of connected components of the strata of quadratic differentials
with arbitrary poles. Moreover, we distinguish certain components of the strata
of $k$-differentials by generalizing the hyperelliptic structure and spin
parity for higher $k$. We also describe an approach to determine explicitly
parities of $k$-differentials in genus zero and one, which inspires an amusing
conjecture in number theory. A key viewpoint we use is the notion of
multi-scale $k$-differentials introduced by
Bainbridge--Chen--Gendron--Grushevsky--M\""oller for $k = 1$ and extended by
Costantini--M\""oller--Zachhuber for all $k$.

localised excitations that propagate with almost constant velocity and which
interact cleanly with little to no radiation. We achieve this via a reduction
of these complex systems to more familiar effective chiral field-theories using
perturbation techniques and the Fredholm alternative. As a specific platform,
we consider the generalised multicomponent Nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger Equations
(MNLS) with arbitrary interaction coefficients. This non-integrable system
reduces to uncoupled Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, one for each sound
speed of the system. This reduction then enables us to exploit the
multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation which in turn leads to the
construction of soliton-like profiles for the original non-integrable system.
We demonstrate that this powerful technique leads to the coherent evolution of
excitations with minimal radiative loss in arbitrary non-integrable systems.
These constructed coherent objects for non-integrable systems bear remarkably
close resemblance to true solitons of integrable models. Although we use the
ubiquitous MNLS system as a platform, our findings are a major step forward
towards constructing excitations in generic continuum non-integrable systems.

opinion, new technologies are also adopted by older adults. Creating virtual
environments tailored to the needs and capabilities of older adults requires
intense research on the behaviour of these participants in the most common

achieving the impression of presence. Presence is, in turn, necessary to obtain
appropriate training, persuasive and therapeutic effects. A virtual agent (a
humanoid representation of an algorithm or artificial intelligence) is often an
element of the virtual environment interface. Maintaining an appropriate
distance to the agent is, therefore, a key parameter for the creator of the VR
experience. Older (65+) participants maintain greater distance towards an agent
(a young white male) than younger ones (25-35). It may be caused by differences
in the level of arousal, but also cultural norms. As a consequence, VR
developers are advised to use algorithms that maintain the agent at the
appropriate distance, depending on the user's age.

mineralised tissues, particularly large bone defects, using minimally invasive
approaches. Regenerative bone scaffolds should ideally mimic aspects of the
tissue's ECM over multiple length scales and enable surgical handling and
fixation during implantation in vivo. Leveraging the knowledge gained with
bioactive self-assembling peptides (SAPs) and SAP-enriched electrospun fibres,
we presented a cell free approach for promoting mineralisation via apatite
deposition and crystal growth, in vitro, of SAP-enriched nonwoven scaffolds.
The nonwoven scaffold was made by electrospinning poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
(PCL) in the presence of either peptide P11-4 (Ac-QQRFEWEFEQQ-Am) or P11-8
(Ac-QQRFOWOFEQQ-Am), in light of the polymer's fibre forming capability and its
hydrolytic degradability as well as the well-known apatite nucleating
capability of SAPs. The 11-residue family of peptides (P11-X) has the ability
to self-assemble into beta-sheet ordered structures at the nano-scale and to
generate hydrogels at the macroscopic scale, some of which are capable of
promoting biomineralisation due to their apatite-nucleating capability. Both
variants of SAP-enriched nonwoven used in this study were proven to be
biocompatible with murine fibroblasts and supported nucleation and growth of
apatite minerals in simulated body fluid (SBF) in vitro. The fibrous nonwoven
provided a structurally robust scaffold, with the capability to control SAP
release behaviour. Up to 75% of P11-4 and 45% of P11-8 were retained in the
fibres after 7-day incubation in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. The encapsulation
of SAP in a nonwoven system with apatite-forming as well as localised and
long-term SAP delivery capabilities is appealing as a potential means of
achieving cost-effective bone repair therapy for critical size defects.

down into two main steps: an initial pose estimation step, followed by a
refinement procedure to correctly register the object and its observation. In
this paper, we propose a new method for 6D pose estimation refinement from RGB
images. To achieve high accuracy of the final estimate, the observation and a
rendered model need to be aligned. Our main insight is that after the initial
pose estimate, it is important to pay attention to distinct spatial features of
the object in order to improve the estimation accuracy during alignment.
Furthermore, parts of the object that are occluded in the image should be given
less weight during the alignment process. Most state-of-the-art refinement
approaches do not allow for this fine-grained reasoning and can not fully
leverage the structure of the problem. In contrast, we propose a novel neural
network architecture built around a spatial attention mechanism that identifies
and leverages information about spatial details during pose refinement. We
experimentally show that this approach learns to attend to salient spatial
features and learns to ignore occluded parts of the object, leading to better
pose estimation across datasets. We conduct experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for 6D pose estimation (LineMOD and Occlusion LineMOD) and outperform
previous state-of-the-art methods.

of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-flat connections and adjoint Reidemeister torsions
of a three manifold can be packaged together to produce a $(2+1)$-topological
quantum field theory, which is essentially equivalent to a modular tensor

study this program mathematically, and provide strong support for the
feasibility of such a program. The program produces an algorithm to generate
the potential modular $T$-matrix and the quantum dimensions of a candidate
modular data. The modular $S$-matrix follows from essentially a trial-and-error

the program based on our computations. Our main result is a mathematical
construction of a premodular category from each Seifert fibered space with
three singular fibers and a family of torus bundles over the circle with
Thurston SOL geometry. The premodular categories from Seifert fibered spaces
are related to Temperley-Lieb-Jones categories and the ones from torus bundles

have been proposed in the literature and used to encode belief change
operations in rich and expressive semantic frameworks. While the connections of
AGM-like operations and their encoding in dynamic doxastic logics have been
studied before by the work of Segerberg, most works on the area of Dynamic
Epistemic Logics (DEL) have not, to our knowledge, attempted to use those
logics as tools to investigate mathematical properties of belief change
operators. This work investigates how Dynamic Preference Logic, a logic in the
DEL family, can be used to study properties of dynamic belief change operators,
focusing on well-known postulates of iterated belief change.

challenges for robust manipulation, as they enable reliable grasps along with
the ability to obtain high-resolution sensory feedback on contact geometry and
forces. Although they are simple in construction, their utility has been
limited due to size constraints introduced by enclosed custom IR/depth imaging
sensors to directly measure surface deformations. Towards mitigating this
limitation, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art monocular depth
estimation to infer dense internal (tactile) depth maps directly from the
internal single small IR imaging sensor. Through real-world experiments, we
show that deep networks typically used for long-range depth estimation (1-100m)
can be effectively trained for precise predictions at a much shorter range
(1-100mm) inside a mostly textureless deformable fluid-filled sensor. We
propose a simple supervised learning process to train an object-agnostic
network requiring less than 10 random poses in contact for less than 10 seconds
for a small set of diverse objects (mug, wine glass, box, and fingers in our
experiments). We show that our approach is sample-efficient, accurate, and
generalizes across different objects and sensor configurations unseen at
training time. Finally, we discuss the implications of our approach for the
design of soft visuotactile sensors and grippers.

braids, which are generalizations of the Burau representation whose
coefficients live in a more general group ring than the one of Laurent
polynomials. This same work established that the $L^2$-Burau map of a braid at
the group of the braid closure yields the $L^2$-Alexander torsion of the braid
closure in question, as a variant of the well-known Burau-Alexander formula.
  In the present paper, we generalize the previous result to $L^2$-Burau maps
defined over all quotients of the group of the braid closure. The link
invariants we obtain are twisted $L^2$-Alexander torsions of the braid closure,
and recover more topological information, such as the hyperbolic volumes of
Dehn fillings. The proof needs us to first generalize several fundamental
formulas for $L^2$-torsions, which have their own independent interest.
  We then discuss how likely we are to generalize this process to yet more
groups. In particular, a detailed study of the influence of Markov moves on
$L^2$-Burau maps and two explicit counter-examples to Markov invariance suggest
that twisted $L^2$-Alexander torsions of links are the only link invariants we
can hope to build from $L^2$-Burau maps with the present approach.

the South Pole Telescope. This analysis uses observations of a 1500 deg$^2$
region at 95, 150, and 220 GHz taken over a four month period in 2018. We
report binned values of the $EE$ and $TE$ power spectra over the angular
multipole range $300 \le \ell < 3000$, using the multifrequency data to
construct six semi-independent estimates of each power spectrum and their
minimum-variance combination. These measurements improve upon the previous
results of SPTpol across the multipole ranges $300 \le \ell \le 1400$ for $EE$
and $300 \le \ell \le 1700$ for $TE$, resulting in constraints on cosmological
parameters comparable to those from other current leading ground-based
experiments. We find that the SPT-3G dataset is well-fit by a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model with parameter constraints consistent with those from Planck
and SPTpol data. From SPT-3G data alone, we find $H_0 = 68.8 \pm 1.5
\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.789 \pm 0.016$, with a
gravitational lensing amplitude consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction
($A_L = 0.98 \pm 0.12$). We combine the SPT-3G and the Planck datasets and
obtain joint constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model. The volume of the 68%
confidence region in six-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM parameter space is reduced by
a factor of 1.5 compared to Planck-only constraints, with only slight shifts in
central values. We note that the results presented here are obtained from data
collected during just half of a typical observing season with only part of the
focal plane operable, and that the active detector count has since nearly
doubled for observations made with SPT-3G after 2018.

estimate of the Sommerfeld coefficient, and supports the interpretation of
non-compensated Fermi pockets seen in ARPES in terms of surface electron
doping. More stringently, our modeling matches well the experimental interband

of COVID-19 cases, remains paramount as an intervention tool to curb the spread
of COVID-19 both at local and national levels. However, the speed at which the
pandemic struck and the response was rolled out, the widespread impact on
healthcare infrastructure, the lack of sufficient preparation within the public
health system, and the complexity of the crisis led to utter confusion among
test-takers. Invasion of privacy remains a crucial concern. The user experience
of test takers remains low. User friction affects user behavior and discourages
participation in testing programs. Test efficacy has been overstated. Test
results are poorly understood resulting in inappropriate follow-up
recommendations. Herein, we review the current landscape of COVID-19 testing,
identify four key challenges, and discuss the consequences of the failure to
address these challenges. The current infrastructure around testing and
information propagation is highly privacy-invasive and does not leverage
scalable digital components. In this work, we discuss challenges complicating
the existing covid-19 testing ecosystem and highlight the need to improve the
testing experience for the user and reduce privacy invasions. Digital tools
will play a critical role in resolving these challenges.

essential understanding star cluster formation and evolution during their
earliest stages. In this work we analyze the stellar and gas kinematics of the
young massive star cluster Westerlund 2 (Wd2) using data from the integral
field unit MUSE and complement them with proper motions from the Gaia DR2. The
mean gas radial velocity of $15.9\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ agrees with the
assumption that Wd2 is the result of a cloud-cloud collision. The gas motions
show the expansion of the HII region, driven by the radiation from the many OB
stars in the cluster center. The velocity profile of the cluster member stars
reveal an increasing velocity dispersion with decreasing stellar mass and that
the low-mass stars show five distinct velocity groups. Based on their spatial
correlation with the cluster's two clumps, we concluded that this is the
imprint of the initial cloud collapse that formed Wd2. A thorough analysis of
the dynamical state of Wd2, which determines a dynamical mass range of $M_{\rm
dyn,Wd2} = (7.5 \pm 1.9)\cdot10^4 - (4.4 \pm 1.1)\cdot10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and
exceeds the photometric mass by at least a factor of two leads to the
conclusion that Wd2 is not massive enough to remain gravitationally bound.
Additionally we also identify 22 runaway candidates with peculiar velocities
between 30 and $546\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$.

irreducible submodules in the arithmetical and Noetherian modules over a
commutative ring. The relationship among the families of strongly irreducible
submodules, irreducible submodules, prime submodules and primal submodules is
proved. Also, several new characterizations of the arithmetical modules are
given. In the case when $R$ is Noetherian and $M$ is finitely generated,
several characterizations of strongly irreducible submodules are included.
Among other things, it is shown that when $N$ is a submodule of $M$ such that
$N:_RM$ is not a prime ideal, then $N$ is strongly irreducible if and only if
there exist submodule $L$ of $M$ and prime ideal $\frak p$ of $R$ such that $N$
is $\frak p$-primary, $N\subsetneqq L\subseteq \frak pM$ and for all submodules
$K$ of $M$ either $K\subseteq N$ or $L_{\frak p}\subseteq K_{\frak p}$. In
addition, we show that a submodule $N$ of $M$ is strongly irreducible if and
only if $N$ is primary, $M_{\frak p}$ is arithmetical and $N=(\frak pM)^{(n)}$
for some integer $n>1$, where $\frak p=\Rad(N:_RM)$ with $\frak p\not\in
\Ass_RR/\Ann_R(M)$ and $\frak pM\nsubseteq N$. As a consequence we deduce that
if $R$ is integral domain and $M$ is torsion-free, then there exists a strongly
irreducible submodule $N$ of $M$ such that $N:_RM$ is not prime ideal if and
only if there is a prime ideal $\frak p$ of $R$ with $\frak pM\nsubseteq N$ and
$M_{\frak p}$ is an arithmetical $R_{\frak p}$-module.

around the homogeneous Couette flow for a 2D isentropic compressible fluid in
the domain $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{R}$. In the inviscid case there is a
generic Lyapunov type instability for the density and the irrotational
component of the velocity field. More precisely, we prove that their $L^2$ norm
grows as $t^{1/2}$ and this confirms previous observations in the physics
literature. Instead, the solenoidal component of the velocity field experience
inviscid damping, meaning that it decays to zero even in the absence of
viscosity. For a viscous compressible fluid, we show that the perturbations may
have a transient growth of order $\nu^{-1/6}$ (with $\nu^{-1}$ being
proportional to the Reynolds number) on a time-scale $\nu^{-1/3}$, after which
it decays exponentially fast. This phenomenon is also called enhanced
dissipation and our result appears to be the first to detect this mechanism for
a compressible fluid, where an exponential decay for the density is not a

upcoming film? In this paper, we explored a vast array of film data in an
attempt to develop a model that could predict the expected return of an
upcoming film. The approach to this development is as follows: First, we began
with the MovieLens dataset having common movie attributes along with genome
tags per each film. Genome tags give insight into what particular
characteristics of the film are most salient. We then included additional
features regarding film content, cast/crew, audience perception, budget, and
earnings from TMDB, IMDB, and Metacritic websites. Next, we performed
exploratory data analysis and engineered a wide range of new features capturing
historical information for the available features. Thereafter, we used singular

features (ex. genome tags). Finally, we built a Random Forest Classifier and
performed hyper-parameter tuning to optimize for model accuracy. A future
application of our model could be seen in the film industry, allowing
production companies to better predict the expected return of their projects
based on their envisioned outline for their production procedure, thereby
allowing them to revise their plan in an attempt to achieve optimal returns.

underlying many brain functions, such as memory and attention. Among numerous
theoretical and computational modeling studies, gamma oscillations have been
found in biologically realistic spiking network models of the primary visual
cortex. However, due to its high dimensionality and strong nonlinearity, it is
generally difficult to perform detailed theoretical analysis of the emergent
gamma dynamics. Here we propose a suite of Markovian model reduction methods
with varying levels of complexity and applied it to spiking network models
exhibiting heterogeneous dynamical regimes, ranging from homogeneous firing to
strong synchrony in the gamma band. The reduced models not only successfully
reproduce gamma band oscillations in the full model, but also exhibit the same
dynamical features as we vary parameters. Most remarkably, the invariant
measure of the coarse-grained Markov process reveals a two-dimensional surface
in state space upon which the gamma dynamics mainly resides. Our results
suggest that the statistical features of gamma oscillations strongly depend on
the subthreshold neuronal distributions. Because of the generality of the
Markovian assumptions, our dimensional reduction methods offer a powerful
toolbox for theoretical examinations of many other complex cortical
spatio-temporal behaviors observed in both neurophysiological experiments and
numerical simulations.

The model is an extension to reactive flows of the recently proposed

for the Stefan--Maxwell diffusion is enhanced to accommodate a source term
accounting the change of the mixture composition due to chemical reaction.
Second, by including the heat of formation in the energy equation, the
thermodynamic consistency of the underlying compressible lattice Boltzmann
model for momentum and energy allows a realization of the energy and
temperature change due to chemical reactions. This obviates the need for ad-hoc
modelling with source terms for temperature or heat. Both parts remain
consistently coupled through mixture composition, momentum, pressure, energy

According to the LVC parameter estimation, at least one of these progenitors
falls into the so-called pair-instability supernova mass gap. This raises the
important question of how and when these progenitors formed. In this paper we
use an accretion model with super-Eddington mass accretion rate obtained from
General Relativity hydrodynamics simulations to analyse the scenario wherein
the GW190521 original progenitors (OPs) formed at lower masses (and spins) and
grew to their estimated LVC parameters by relativistic accretion. We consider
that the environment wherein the binary is immersed has density gradients as
well as a dependence on the Mach number of the gas. Taking the LVC parameter
estimation at $z=0.82$ as the endpoint of the accretion evolution, we estimate
the initial masses and spins of the OPs at three different red-shifts $z=100, \
50$, and $20$. We found three distinct possible types of OPs: $(i)$ $10^{-4}
M_{\odot} - 3 M_{\odot}$ almost non-rotating (with Kerr spin parameter
$a_{\star}< 10^{-2}$) primordial BHs; $(ii)$ $3 M_{\odot} - 40M_{\odot}$ slowly
rotating ($ 10^{-2} < a_{\star} < 0.5$) stellar mass BHs; $(iii)$ $40M_{\odot}
- 70M_{\odot}$ BHs with a moderate spin parameter $a_{\star}\sim 0.5$, which
could originate from the collapse of high mass Pop III stars. The mass spread
is due to varying the density gradient and the relativistic Mach number of the
cosmic plasma; the variation of the masses due to the origin at different
red-shifts, on the other hand, is negligible, $\sim 2\%$ ...

that, at $1.37\leq z\leq2.61$, the variation of mass-metallicity relation with

support the hypothesis that, at the early stages of cluster formation, owing to
efficient gas cooling, galaxies residing in overdensities host a higher
fraction of pristine gas with prominent primordial gas accretion, which lowers
their gas-phase metallicity compared to their coeval field galaxies. However,
as the Universe evolves to lower redshifts ($z\lesssim2$), shock-heated gas in
overdensities cannot cool down efficiently, and galaxies become metal-rich
rapidly due to the suppression of pristine gas inflow and re-accretion of
metal-enriched outflows in overdensities.

matter under extraordinary conditions of density and temperature that are
difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. In recent years, neutron star
observations have begun to yield novel insights into the nature of strongly
interacting matter in the high-density regime where current theoretical models
are challenged. At the same time, chiral effective field theory has developed
into a powerful framework to study nuclear matter properties with quantified
uncertainties in the moderate-density regime for modeling neutron stars. In
this article, we review recent developments in chiral effective field theory
and focus on many-body perturbation theory as a computationally efficient tool
for calculating the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter. We also
demonstrate how effective field theory enables statistically meaningful
comparisons between nuclear theory predictions, nuclear experiments, and
observational constraints on the nuclear equation of state.

and general problem. However, dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the
case of large displacements or homogeneous regions. For most applications and
down-stream tasks, such as pose estimation, image manipulation, or 3D

  In this work, we aim to estimate a dense flow field relating two images,
coupled with a robust pixel-wise confidence map indicating the reliability and
accuracy of the prediction. We develop a flexible probabilistic approach that
jointly learns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we
parametrize the predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model,
ensuring better modelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers.
Moreover, we develop an architecture and training strategy tailored for robust
and generalizable uncertainty prediction in the context of self-supervised
training. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging
geometric matching and optical flow datasets. We further validate the

established in 1989 by Aizenman and Wehr, states that first-order phase
transitions of low-dimensional spin systems are `rounded' by the addition of a
quenched random field to the quantity undergoing the transition. The phenomenon
applies to a wide class of spin systems in dimensions $d\le 2$ and to spin
systems possessing a continuous symmetry in dimensions $d\le 4$.
  This work provides quantitative estimates for the Imry--Ma phenomenon: In a
cubic domain of side length $L$, we study the effect of the boundary conditions
on the spatial and thermal average of the quantity coupled to the random field.
We show that the boundary effect diminishes at least as fast as an inverse
power of $\log\log L$ for general two-dimensional spin systems and for
four-dimensional spin systems with continuous symmetry, and at least as fast as
an inverse power of $L$ for two- and three-dimensional spin systems with

factor, typically assumed to be independent of the local environment. In Paper
I, we presented an improved, local density-dependent model for the sub-grid gas
clumping. Here we extend this using an empirical stochastic model based on the
results from high-resolution numerical simulations which fully resolve all
relevant fluctuations. Our model reproduces well both the mean density-clumping
relation and its scatter. We applied our stochastic model, along with the mean
clumping one and the Paper I deterministic model, to create a large-volume
realisation of the clumping field, and used these in radiative transfer
simulations of cosmic reionization. Our results show that the simplistic mean
clumping model delays reionization compared to local density-dependent models,
despite producing fewer recombinations overall. This is due to the very
different spatial distribution of clumping, resulting in much higher
photoionization rates in the latter cases. The mean clumping model produces
smaller HII regions throughout most of the reionization, but those percolate
faster at late times. It also causes a significant delay in the 21-cm
fluctuations peak and yields lower non-Gaussianity and many fewer bright pixels
in the PDF distribution. The stochastic density-dependent model shows
relatively minor differences from the deterministic one, mostly concentrated
around overlap, where it significantly suppresses the 21-cm fluctuations, and
at the bright tail of the 21-cm PDFs, where it produces noticeably more bright

members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling
behavior near the IQHT has been vigorously studied in experiments and numerical
simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin down the
precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details and
thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, M.
Zirnbauer\citep{Zirnbauer2019} [Nucl. Phys. B \textbf{941}, 458 (2019)] has
conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition, in which linear terms
in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow in the fixed point's
vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we provide numerical
evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations of various network
models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality, we show that
the finite-size scaling of the disorder averaged longitudinal Landauer
conductance is consistent with its recently predicted fixed-point value and a
third-order expansion of RG beta functions. In the future, our numerical
findings can be checked with analytical results from the conformal field
theory. Away from criticality we describe a mechanism that could account for
the emergence of an \emph{effective} critical exponents $\nu_\mathrm{eff}$,
which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We further
support this idea by numerical determination of $\nu_\mathrm{eff}$ in suitably
chosen models.

form of a complex Hadamard matrix, which possesses combinatorial gauge symmetry
-- a local $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry involving permutations and shifts by $\pm
2\pi/3$ of the superconducting phases. The sign of the star potential resulting
from the Josephson energy is inverted in this physical realization, leading to
a massive degeneracy in the non-zero flux sectors. A dimerization pattern
encoded in the capacitances of the array lifts up these degeneracies, resulting
in a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topologically ordered state. Moreover, this dimerization
pattern leads to a larger effective vison gap as compared to the canonical case
with the usual (uninverted) star term. We further show that our model maps to a
quantum three-state Potts model under a duality transformation. We argue, using
a combination of bosonization and mean field theory, that altering the
dimerization pattern of the capacitances leads to a transition from the
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological phase into a quantum XY-ordered phase. Our work
highlights that combinatorial gauge symmetry can serve as a design principle to
build quantum double models using systems with realistic interactions.

(TIC 395171208, BD+47 3521A), TOI-1478 b (TIC 409794137), and TOI-1601 b (TIC
139375960) -- based on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS). The five planets were identified from the full frame images and were
confirmed through a series of photometric and spectroscopic follow-up
observations by the $TESS$ Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) Working Group.
The planets are all Jovian size (R$_{\rm P}$ = 1.01-1.77 R$_{\rm J}$) and have
masses that range from 0.85 to 6.33 M$_{\rm J}$. The host stars of these
systems have F and G spectral types (5595 $\le$ T$_{\rm eff}$ $\le$ 6460 K) and
are all relatively bright (9 $<V<$ 10.8, 8.2 $<K<$ 9.3) making them well-suited
for future detailed characterization efforts. Three of the systems in our
sample (TOI-640 b, TOI-1333 b, and TOI-1601 b) orbit subgiant host stars (log
g$_*$ $<$4.1). TOI-640 b is one of only three known hot Jupiters to have a
highly inflated radius (R$_{\rm P}$ > 1.7R$_{\rm J}$, possibly a result of its
host star's evolution) and resides on an orbit with a period longer than 5
days. TOI-628 b is the most massive hot Jupiter discovered to date by $TESS$
with a measured mass of $6.31^{+0.28}_{-0.30}$ M$_{\rm J}$ and a statistically
significant, non-zero orbital eccentricity of e = $0.074^{+0.021}_{-0.022}$.
This planet would not have had enough time to circularize through tidal forces
from our analysis, suggesting that it might be remnant eccentricity from its
migration. The longest period planet in this sample, TOI-1478 b (P = 10.18
days), is a warm Jupiter in a circular orbit around a near-Solar analogue.
NASA's $TESS$ mission is continuing to increase the sample of
well-characterized hot and warm Jupiters, complementing its primary mission
goals.

data from XIS and PIN onboard \emph{Suzaku}. From spectral fits of these
sources with a single continuum model including a powerlaw and high energy
cut-off, cyclotron lines (where required), we studied the correlation between
various spectral parameters. Among 39 sources we studied, 16 are those where
the existence of a cyclotron line is known in literature, and 29 need a cutoff
energy. Among these 29 sources, 18 have cutoff energy bunched in a range of
3-10 keV while for 11 sources, it spreads over 12-25 keV. This bi-modal
behaviour is not based on the specific nature of the systems being a Be XRB or
supergiant HMXB, nor on different beaming patterns characterizing their X-ray
emission (as inferred from simultaneous study of their pulse profiles). The
broadband coverage of \emph{Suzaku} also shows that the cutoff energies
saturate for higher values of cyclotron line energies - consistent with
previous works in literature - for both the groups and the width of the
cyclotron line show a weak correlation with the cyclotron line energy. We also
find an anticorrelation with luminosity for both spectral index and folding
energy, respectively. Unlike previous works, we did not detect any
anticorrelation between X-ray luminosity and EW of K$\alpha$ lines. Finally, we
show that the EW and flux of the iron K$\alpha$ line are smaller in SFXTs than
classical NS-HMXBs. We discuss these findings in terms of different properties
of stellar winds and accretion mechanisms.

state-of-the-art dust coagulation models, understand their dependence on disk
parameters and the fragmentation threshold velocity, and the impact of those on
the planetary growth by pebble accretion. We use a one-dimensional dust
evolution model including dust growth and fragmentation to calculate realistic
pebble sizes and mass flux. We use this information to integrate the growth of
planetary embryos placed at various locations in the protoplanetary disk.
Pebble flux strongly depends on disk properties, such as its size and
turbulence level, as well as on the dust aggregates fragmentation threshold. We
find that dust fragmentation may be beneficial to planetary growth in multiple
ways. First of all, it prevents the solids from growing to very large sizes,
for which the efficiency of pebble accretion drops. What is more, small pebbles
are depleted at a slower rate, providing a long-lasting pebble flux. As the
full coagulation models are computationally expensive, we provide a simple
method of estimating pebble sizes and flux in any protoplanetary disk model
without substructure and with any fragmentation threshold velocity.

to be 2+/-1%, and the occurrence rate of clusters with runaway cooling in their

the number of new groups and clusters predicted to be found with eROSITA, the
population of clusters that appear to be point sources (due to a central QSO or

However, the large-scale morphology of CHIPS1911+4455 is highly asymmetric,
pointing to a more dynamically active and turbulent cluster. Furthermore, the
Hubble images reveal a massive, filamentary starburst near the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG). We measure the star formation rate for the BCG to be
140--190 Msun/yr, which is one of the highest rates measured in a central
cluster galaxy to date. One possible scenario for CHIPS1911+4455 is that the
cool core was displaced during a major merger and rapidly cooled, with cool,
star-forming gas raining back toward the core. This unique system is an
excellent case study for high-redshift clusters, where such phenomena are
proving to be more common. Further studies of such systems will drastically
improve our understanding of the relation between cluster mergers and cooling,

of elastic and inelastic energy loss suffered by the jet multi-prong collection
of color charges that are resolved by medium interactions. Hence, quenching
effects depend on the fluctuations of the jet substructure that are probed by
the cone size dependence of the spectrum. In this letter, we present the first
complete, analytic calculation of the inclusive $R$-dependent jet spectrum in
PbPb collisions at LHC energies, including resummation of energy loss effects
from hard, vacuum-like emissions occurring in the medium and modeling of soft
energy flow and recovery at the jet cone. Both the geometry of the collision
and the local medium properties, such as the temperature and fluid velocity,
are given by a hydrodynamic evolution of the medium, leaving only the coupling
constant in the medium as a free parameter. The calculation yields a good
description of the centrality and $p_T$ dependence of jet suppression for
$R=0.4$ together with a mild cone size dependence, which is in agreement with
recent experimental results. Gauging the theoretical uncertainties, we find
that the largest sensitivity resides in the leading logarithmic approximation
of the phase space of resolved splittings, which can be improved
systematically, while non-perturbative modeling of the soft-gluon sector is of
relatively minor importance up to large cone sizes.

Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) can be utilised to realise nonwoven fibrous
barrier-like structures through free surface electrospinning (FSE). Human
periosteum and induced membrane (IM) samples informed the development of an FSE
membrane to support platelet lysate (PL) absorption, multipotential stromal

IM, periosteum presented a more mature vascular system with a significantly
larger blood vessel diameter. The electrospun membrane (PCL3%-E) exhibited
randomly configured nanoscale fibres that were successfully customised to
introduce pores of increased diameter, without compromising tensile properties.
Additional to the PL absorption and release capabilities needed for MSC
attraction and growth, PCL3%-E also provided a favourable surface for the

backpropagation, image classification, convolutional networks and autoencoders.
The second part is about advanced techniques like reinforcement learning (for
discovering control strategies), recurrent neural networks (for analyzing time

the third lecture, we discuss first recent applications to quantum physics,
with an emphasis on quantum information processing machines. Finally, the
fourth lecture is devoted to the promise of using quantum effects to accelerate

aggressive regularization. Conventional regularization methods, such as Dropout
or weight decay, do not leverage the structures of the network's inputs and
hidden states. As a result, these conventional methods are less effective than
methods that leverage the structures, such as SpatialDropout and DropBlock,
which randomly drop the values at certain contiguous areas in the hidden states
and setting them to zero. Although the locations of dropout areas random, the
patterns of SpatialDropout and DropBlock are manually designed and fixed. Here
we propose to learn the dropout patterns. In our method, a controller learns to
generate a dropout pattern at every channel and layer of a target network, such
as a ConvNet or a Transformer. The target network is then trained with the
dropout pattern, and its resulting validation performance is used as a signal
for the controller to learn from. We show that this method works well for both
image recognition on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, as well as language modeling on
Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. The learned dropout patterns also transfers to
different tasks and datasets, such as from language model on Penn Treebank to
Engligh-French translation on WMT 2014. Our code will be available.

  Prior studies have considered Probabilistic Per-packet Real-time
Communications (PPRC) guarantees for single-cell, single-channel networks with

complexities such as inter-cell interference and multiple communication

  Towards ensuring PPRC in multi-cell, multi-channel wireless networks, we
propose a real-time scheduling algorithm based on
\emph{local-deadline-partition (LDP)}. The LDP algorithm is suitable for
distributed implementation, and it ensures probabilistic per-packet real-time
guarantee for multi-cell, multi-channel networks with general deadline
constraints. We also address the associated challenge of the schedulability
test of PPRC traffic. In particular, we propose the concept of \emph{feasible

PPRC traffic.
  We propose a distributed algorithm for the schedulability test, and the
algorithm includes a procedure for finding the minimum sum work density of
feasible sets which is of interest by itself. We also identify a necessary
condition for the schedulability of PPRC traffic, and use numerical studies to
understand a lower bound on the approximation ratio of the LDP algorithm.
  We experimentally study the properties of the LDP algorithm and observe that
the PPRC traffic supportable by the LDP algorithm is significantly higher than
that of a state-of-the-art algorithm.

the assumption that low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) models admit
""similar"" low-rank kernel representations. Low-rank MF methods have
traditionally attempted to exploit low-rank representations of linear kernels,
which are kernel functions of the form $K(u,v) = v^T u$ for vectors $u$ and
$v$. However, such linear kernels may not be able to capture low-rank behavior,
and they may admit LF and HF kernels that are not similar. Such a situation
renders a naive approach to low-rank MF procedures ineffective. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach for the selection of a near-optimal kernel function
for use in low-rank MF methods. The proposed framework is a two-step strategy
wherein: (1) hyperparameters of a library of kernel functions are optimized,
and (2) a particular combination of the optimized kernels is selected, through
either a convex mixture (Additive Kernels) or through a data-driven
optimization (Adaptive Kernels). The two resulting methods for this generalized
framework both utilize only the available inexpensive low-fidelity data and
thus no evaluation of high-fidelity simulation model is needed until a kernel
is chosen. These proposed approaches are tested on five non-trivial problems
including multi-fidelity surrogate modeling for one- and two-species molecular
systems, gravitational many-body problem, associating polymer networks,
plasmonic nano-particle arrays, and an incompressible flow in channels with
stenosis. The results for these numerical experiments demonstrate the numerical
stability efficiency of both proposed kernel function selection procedures, as
well as high accuracy of their resultant predictive models for estimation of
quantities of interest. Comparisons against standard linear kernel procedures
also demonstrate increased accuracy of the optimized kernel approaches.

  Methods: PSI Gantry 1 treated patients until December 2018. We optimized the
beamline parameters to transport the 250 MeV beam extracted from the PSI COMET
accelerator to the treatment room, maximizing the transmission of beam
intensity to the sample. We characterized a dose monitor on the gantry to
ensure good control of the dose, delivered in spot-scanning mode. We
characterized the beam for different dose rates and field sizes for
transmission irradiations. We explored scanning possibilities in order to
enable conformal irradiations or transmission irradiations of large targets
(with transverse scanning). Results: We achieved a transmission of 86 % from
the cyclotron to the treatment room. We reached a peak dose rate of 9000 Gy/s
at 3 mm water equivalent depth, along the central axis of a single pencil beam.
Field sizes of up to 5x5 mm$^{2}$ were achieved for single spot FLASH
irradiations. Fast transverse scanning allowed to cover a field of 16x1.2
cm$^{2}$. With the use of a nozzle-mounted range shifter we are able to span
depths in water ranging from 19.6 to 37.9 cm. Various dose levels were
delivered with a precision within less than 1 %. Conclusions: We have realized
a proton FLASH irradiation setup able to investigate continuously a wide dose
rate spectrum, from 1 to 9000 Gy/s in a single spot irradiation as well as in
the pencil beam scanning mode. As such, we have developed a versatile test

this problem's solution. Firstly, releasing an application across the XR
spectrum could contribute in discovering its most suitable reality. Moreover,
an application could be more immersive within a particular reality, depending
on its context. Furthermore, its availability increases to a broader range of
users. For instance, if an application is released both in Virtual and
Augmented Reality, it is accessible to users that may lack the possession of a
VR headset, but not of a mobile AR device. The question that arises at this
point, would be ""Is it possible for a full s/w application stack to be

be quite difficult, depending on the architecture and application
implementation. Most companies nowadays support only one reality, due to their
lack of UI/UX software architecture or resources to support the complete XR

any XR project into different realities such as Augmented or Virtual. It also
reduces the development time while increasing the XR availability of 3D

classification of crystal systems, mechanical elasticity, electronic band gap,

interpret the model performance by perturbing the physically meaningful input

spatial symmetry of the 3D diffraction patterns, which reflects crystalline
symmetry operations, is more important than the diffraction intensities
contained within for the model to make a successful classification. Our work
showcases the potential of using statistical learning models to help understand
materials physics, rather than performing predictive and generative tasks as in
most materials informatics research. We also argue that learning the crystal

Recently released photo-realistic simulators such as Habitat allow for the
training of networks that output control actions directly from perception:
agents use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to regress directly from the
camera image to a control output in an end-to-end fashion. This is
data-inefficient and can take several days to train on a GPU. Our paper tries
to overcome this problem by separating the training of the perception and
control neural nets and increasing the path complexity gradually using a
curriculum approach. Specifically, a pre-trained twin Variational AutoEncoder
(VAE) is used to compress RGBD (RGB & depth) sensing from an environment into a
latent embedding, which is then used to train a DRL-based control policy. A*, a
traditional path-planner is used as a guide for the policy and the distance
between start and target locations is incrementally increased along the A*
route, as training progresses. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
approach, both in terms of increased performance and decreased training times

improving the training of direct-perception based DRL navigation policies is

stability properties as time integration schemes, but high-order IRK methods
are not commonly used in practice with large-scale numerical PDEs because of
the difficulty of solving the stage equations. This paper introduces a
theoretical and algorithmic framework for solving the nonlinear equations that
arise from IRK methods (and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in time)
applied to nonlinear numerical PDEs, including PDEs with algebraic constraints.
Several new linearizations of the nonlinear IRK equations are developed,
offering faster and more robust convergence than the often-considered
simplified Newton, as well as an effective preconditioner for the true Jacobian
if exact Newton iterations are desired. Inverting these linearizations requires
solving a set of block 2x2 systems. Under quite general assumptions, it is
proven that the preconditioned 2x2 operator's condition number is bounded by a
small constant close to one, independent of the spatial discretization, spatial
mesh, and time step, and with only weak dependence on the number of stages or
integration accuracy. Moreover, the new method is built using the same
preconditioners needed for backward Euler-type time stepping schemes, so can be
readily added to existing codes. The new methods are applied to several
challenging fluid flow problems, including the compressible Euler and Navier
Stokes equations, and the vorticity-streamfunction formulation of the
incompressible Euler and Navier Stokes equations. Up to 10th-order accuracy is
demonstrated using Gauss IRK, while in all cases 4th-order Gauss IRK requires
roughly half the number of preconditioner applications as required by standard

of reionization (EoR) in an upgraded model including three subtle effects of
Ly-a radiation: Ly-a heating, CMB heating (mediated by Ly-a photons), and
multiple scattering of Ly-a photons. Taking these effects into account we
explore a wide range of astrophysical models and quantify the impact of these
processes on the global 21-cm signal and its power spectrum at observable
scales and redshifts. We find that, in agreement with the literature, Ly-a and
CMB heating raise the gas temperature by up to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ degrees in
models with weak X-ray heating and, thus, suppress the predicted 21-cm signals.
Varying the astrophysical parameters over broad ranges, we find that in the
upgraded model the absorption trough of the global signal reaches a lowest
floor of $-165$ mK at redshifts $z\approx 15-19$. This is in contrast with the
predictions for a pure adiabatically cooling Universe, for which the deepest
possible absorption is a monotonically decreasing function of cosmic time and
is $-178$ mK at $z = 19$ and $-216$ mK at $z=15$, dropping to even lower values
at lower redshifts (e.g. $-264$ mK at $z = 10$). With the Ly-a and CMB heating
included we also observe a strong suppression in the low-redshift power
spectra, with the maximum possible power (evaluated over the ensemble of
models) attenuated by a factor of $6.6$ at $z=9$ and $k = 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.
Finally, we find that at high redshifts corresponding to cosmic dawn, the
heating terms have a subdominant effect while multiple scattering of Ly-a
photons is important, leading to an amplification of the power spectrum by a
factor of $\sim 2-5$.

have been studied extensively. In Toral's model $N$ players are arranged in a
circle. The players play either game $A$ or game $B$. In game $A$, a randomly
chosen player wins or loses one unit according to the toss of a fair coin. In
game $B$, which depends on parameters $p_0,p_1,p_2\in[0,1]$, a randomly chosen
player, player $x$ say, wins or loses one unit according to the toss of a
$p_m$-coin, where $m\in\{0,1,2\}$ is the number of nearest neighbors of player
$x$ who won their most recent game. In this paper, we replace game $A$ by a
spatially dependent game, which we call game $A'$, introduced by Xie et
al.~(2011). In game $A'$, two nearest neighbors are chosen at random, and one
pays one unit to the other based on the toss of a fair coin. Game $A'$ is fair,
so we say that the Parrondo effect occurs if game $B$ is losing or fair and the
game $C'$, determined by a random or periodic sequence of games $A'$ and $B$,

of the mean profit per game played from game $C'$. This requires ergodicity of
an associated interacting particle system (not necessarily a spin system), for

regarding the dynamics of the hydrated excess proton (aka <q>hydronium</q>
cation solvated in water). It has been suggested by these experiments that the
hydrated excess proton has an anisotropy reorientation timescale of 2.5 ps,
which can be viewed as being somewhat long lived. Through the use of both the
reactive molecular dynamics Multistate-Empirical Valence Bond method and
Experiment Directed Simulation Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics we show that
timescales of the same magnitude are obtained that correspond to proton
transport, while also involving structural reorientations of the hydrated
proton structure that correspond to the so-called <q>special pair dance</q>.
The latter is a process predicted by prior computational studies in which the
central hydrated hydronium in a distorted Eigen cation
(H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) structure continually switches special
pair partners with its strongly hydrogen-bonded neighboring water molecules.
These dynamics are further characterized through the time-evolution of
instantaneous normal modes. It is concluded that the hydrated excess proton has
a spectral signature unique from the other protons in the hydrated proton
complex. However, the results call into question the use of a static picture
based on a simple effective one dimensional potential well to describe the
hydrated excess proton in water. Instead, they more conclusively point to a
distorted and dynamic Eigen cation as the most prevalent hydrated proton
species in acid solutions of dilute to moderate concentrations.

the scattering medium (diffuser) are inserted into a highly multimode

the phase variations are low. Thus, round trip loss within the laser cavity is
minimized, thereby overcoming most of the scattering effects. The method is
exploited to image objects through scattering media whose diffusion angle is
lower than the numerical aperture of the laser cavity. As our method is based
on optical feedback inside a laser cavity, it can deal with temporal variations
that occur on timescales as short as several cavity round trips, with an upper

dominates. We show that for a sample with rotational symmetry breaking, a DC

turn induces a first order transition in the valley polarization. We emphasize
that the inter-valley scattering plays a central role since it is the channel
for exchanging electrons between the two valleys. We further estimate the
valley density difference in the TBG/h-BN system with a microscopic model, and

despite recent algorithmic developments, their complexity prevents their direct
use on large scale datasets. To overcome this challenge, a common workaround is
to compute these distances on minibatches i.e. to average the outcome of
several smaller optimal transport problems. We propose in this paper an
extended analysis of this practice, which effects were previously studied in
restricted cases. We first consider a large variety of Optimal Transport
kernels. We notably argue that the minibatch strategy comes with appealing
properties such as unbiased estimators, gradients and a concentration bound
around the expectation, but also with limits: the minibatch OT is not a
distance. To recover some of the lost distance axioms, we introduce a debiased
minibatch OT function and study its statistical and optimisation properties.
Along with this theoretical analysis, we also conduct empirical experiments on
gradient flows, generative adversarial networks (GANs) or color transfer that

act to deform the liquid free surface, inducing a flow in the pool. These

companion paper ""Symplectic quantization I"" is generalized here to the case of
space-time quantum fluctuations. Symplectic quantization considers an explicit
dependence of the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ on an additional time variable,
named ""proper time"" at variance with the coordinate time of relativity. The
physical meaning of proper time is to label the sequence of $g_{\mu\nu}$
quantum fluctuations at a given point of the four-dimensional space-time
continuum. For this reason symplectic quantization necessarily incorporates a
new degree of freedom, the derivative $\dot{g}_{\mu\nu}$ of the metric field
with respect to proper time, corresponding to the conjugated momentum
$\pi_{\mu\nu}$. Symplectic quantization describes the quantum fluctuations of
gravity by means of the symplectic dynamics generated by a generalized action
functional $\mathcal{A}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}] =
\mathcal{K}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}] - S[g_{\mu\nu}]$, playing formally the
role of a Hamilton function, where $S[g_{\mu\nu}]$ is the Einstein-Hilbert
action and $\mathcal{K}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}]$ is a new term including the
kinetic degrees of freedom of the field. Such an action allows us to define a
pseudo-microcanonical ensemble for the quantum fluctuations of $g_{\mu\nu}$,
built on the conservation of the generalized action
$\mathcal{A}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}]$ rather than of energy. $S[g_{\mu\nu}]$
plays the role of a potential term along the symplectic action-preserving
dynamics: its fluctuations are the quantum fluctuations of $g_{\mu\nu}$. It is
shown how symplectic quantization maps to the path-integral approach to
gravity. By doing so we explain how the integration over the conjugated
momentum field $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ gives rise to a cosmological constant term in the
path-integral.

of the scalar metric perturbations. We show that such a mechanism can naturally
arise in supergravity models where an axion-like field, whose potential is
generated by monodromy, drives large field inflation. In this class of models
one generally expects instanton-like corrections to the superpotential. We
show, by deriving the equations of motion in models of supergravity with a
stabilizer, that such corrections generate an interaction between the inflaton
and its superpartner. This inflaton-inflatino interaction term is rapidly
oscillating, and can lead to copious production of fermions during inflation,
filling the Fermi sphere up to momenta much larger than the Hubble parameter.
In their turn, those fermions source inflaton fluctuations, increasing their
amplitude, and effectively lowering the tensor-to-scalar ratio for the model,
as discussed in [1, 2]. This allows, in particular, to bring the model where
the inflaton potential is quadratic (plus negligibly small instanton
corrections) to agree with all existing observations.

Lead Observatory (HALO) or its planned upgrade HALO-1kt to a galactic
core-collapse supernova. We pay particular attention to the time dependence of
the reaction rates. All reaction rates decrease as the neutrino luminosity
exponentially drops during the cooling period but the ratio of one-neutron (1n)
to two-neutron (2n) event rates in HALO is independent of this overall
decrease. Nevertheless, we find that this ratio still changes with time due to
the changing character of neutrino flavor transformations with the evolving
conditions in the supernova. In the case of inverted hierarchy, this is caused
by the fact that the spectral splits become less and less sharp with the
decreasing luminosity. In the case of normal hierarchy, it is caused by the
passage of the shock wave through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance
region. However, in both cases, we find that the change in the ratio of 1n to
2n event rates is limited to a few percent.

outcome of binary evolutionary scenarios. However only a few percent of PNe in
the Milky Way are known to host binary systems. The high precision repeated
observing and long time baseline of Gaia make it well suited to detect new
close binaries through photometric variability.
  Aims: We aim to find new close binary central stars of PNe (CSPNe) using data
from the Gaia mission, building towards a statistically significant sample of
post common envelope, close binary CSPNe.
  Methods: As the vast majority of Gaia sources do not have published epoch
photometry, we use the uncertainty in the mean photometry as a proxy for
determining the variability of our CSPN sample in the second Gaia data release.
We derive a quantity that expresses the significance of the variability, and
consider what is necessary to build a clean sample of genuine variable sources.
  Results: Our selection recovers a large fraction of the known close binary
CSPN population, while other CSPNe lying in the same region of the parameter
space likely represent low-hanging fruit for ground-based confirmatory followup
observations. Gaia epoch photometry for four of the newly identified variable
sources confirms that the variability is genuine and consistent with binarity

Recent findings show that MYSO accretion bursts cause flares of these masers.
Thus, maser monitoring can be used to identify such bursts. Burst-induced SED
changes provide valuable information on a very intense phase of high-mass star
formation. In mid-January 2019, a maser flare of the MYSO G358.93-0.03 was
reported. ALMA and SMA imaging resolved the core of the star forming region and
proved the association of the masers with the brightest continuum source MM1.
However, no significant flux rise of the (sub)mm dust continuum was found.
Thus, we performed NIR imaging with GROND and IFU spectroscopy with FIFI-LS
aboard SOFIA to detect possible counterparts to the (sub)mm sources, and
compare their photometry to archival measurements. The comparison of pre-burst
and burst SEDs is of crucial importance to judge whether a luminosity increase
due to the burst is present and if it triggered the maser flare. The FIR fluxes
of MM1 measured with FIFI-LS exceed those from Herschel significantly, which
clearly confirms the presence of an accretion burst. The second epoch data,
taken about 16 months later, still show increased fluxes. Our RT modeling
yielded major burst parameters and suggests that the MYSO features a
circumstellar disk which might be transient. From the multi-epoch SEDs,
conclusions on heating and cooling time-scales could be drawn. Circumstances of
the burst-induced maser relocation have been explored. The verification of the
accretion burst from G358 is another confirmation that Class II methanol maser
flares represent an alert for such events. The few events known to date already
indicate that there is a broad range in burst strength and duration as well as
environmental characteristics. The G358 event is the shortest and least
luminous MYSO accretion burst so far.

for robotic systems, but they also introduce challenges in formally analyzing
those systems' safety properties. In particular, this work focuses on
estimating the forward reachable set of closed-loop systems with NN
controllers. Recent work provides bounds on these reachable sets, yet the
computationally efficient approaches provide overly conservative bounds (thus
cannot be used to verify useful properties), whereas tighter methods are too
intensive for online computation. This work bridges the gap by formulating a
convex optimization problem for reachability analysis for closed-loop systems
with NN controllers. While the solutions are less tight than prior semidefinite
program-based methods, they are substantially faster to compute, and some of
the available computation time can be used to refine the bounds through input
set partitioning, which more than overcomes the tightness gap. The proposed
framework further considers systems with measurement and process noise, thus
being applicable to realistic systems with uncertainty. Finally, numerical
comparisons show $10\times$ reduction in conservatism in $\frac{1}{2}$ of the
computation time compared to the state-of-the-art, and the ability to handle
various sources of uncertainty is highlighted on a quadrotor model.

which multiple forecasters make predictions about one or more events and
compete for a single prize. We have two objectives: (1) to incentivize
forecasters to report truthfully and (2) to award the prize to the most
accurate forecaster. Proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting if all
forecasters are paid according to their scores. However, incentives become
distorted if only the best-scoring forecaster wins a prize, since forecasters
can often increase their probability of having the highest score by reporting
more extreme beliefs. In this paper, we introduce two novel forecasting
competition mechanisms. Our first mechanism is incentive compatible and
guaranteed to select the most accurate forecaster with probability higher than
any other forecaster. Moreover, we show that in the standard single-event,
two-forecaster setting and under mild technical conditions, no other
incentive-compatible mechanism selects the most accurate forecaster with higher
probability. Our second mechanism is incentive compatible when forecasters'
beliefs are such that information about one event does not lead to belief
updates on other events, and it selects the best forecaster with probability
approaching 1 as the number of events grows. Our notion of incentive
compatibility is more general than previous definitions of dominant strategy
incentive compatibility in that it allows for reports to be correlated with the
event outcomes. Moreover, our mechanisms are easy to implement and can be
generalized to the related problems of outputting a ranking over forecasters
and hiring a forecaster with high accuracy on future events.

us to identify some other tidal features, which extend from the cluster toward
the opposite direction to the Milky Way center. These cluster structural
features arise from stellar density maps built using MS stars, once the cluster

also performed $N$-body simulations in order to help us to understand the

presenceof long trailing and leading tails mostly parallel to the direction of
the cluster velocity vector. We found that the cluster has lost most of its
mass by tidal disruption during its perigalactic passages, that lasted nearly
20 Myr each. Hence, a decrease in the density of escaping stars near the

These are key intermediates, ubiquitous in many relevant photophysical

dynamics in such systems. Deciphering the details of biexciton correlations is,
thus, of utmost importance to understand the optical processes in these

been only scant direct evidence of bound biexcitons, limiting the insights that

of special interest as a dark matter candidate, as it both has particle physics
motivations, and may give rise to notable differences in the structures on
highly non-linear scales due to the manifestation of quantum-physical wave
effects on macroscopic scales, which could address a number of contentious
small-scale tensions in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using a
spectral technique, we here discuss simulations of such fuzzy dark matter
(FDM), including the full non-linear wave dynamics, with a comparatively large
dynamic range and for larger box sizes than considered previously. While the
impact of suppressed small-scale power in the initial conditions associated
with FDM has been studied before, the characteristic FDM dynamics are often
neglected; in our simulations, we instead show the impact of the full
non-linear dynamics on physical observables. We focus on the evolution of the
matter power spectrum, give first results for the FDM halo mass function
directly based on full FDM simulations, and discuss the computational
challenges associated with the FDM equations. FDM shows a pronounced
suppression of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which
can be understood as a damping effect due to 'quantum pressure'. In certain
regimes, however, the FDM power can exceed that of CDM, which may be
interpreted as a reflection of order-unity density fluctuations occurring in
FDM. In the halo mass function, FDM shows a significant abundance reduction
below a characteristic mass scale only. This could in principle alleviate the
need to invoke very strong feedback processes in small galaxies to reconcile
$\Lambda$CDM with the observed galaxy luminosity function, but detailed studies
that also include baryons will be needed to ultimately judge the viability of
FDM.

derive the condition of irreducibility for projective Reps of anti-unitary

construct a hermitian Hamiltonian matrix which commutes with the representation

feature selection by Kendall's-tau rank correlation coefficient followed by
classification using a support vector machine. As a reference method, we
compare our results with cross-correlation, which is typically used in the
literature as a standard measure of functional connectivity. Within a
cross-validation scheme of 100 different training/test (90%/10%) data splits,

sub-populations has been scarcely studied. The present study aims to explore
machine learning (ML) models to identify in-hospital mortality markers for
women and men in ACS sub-populations collected from a public database of
electronic health records (EHR). Methods: We extracted 1,299 patients with
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 2,820 patients with
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from the Medical Information
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. We trained and validated
mortality prediction models and used an interpretability technique to identify
sex-specific markers for each sub-population. Results: The models based on
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) achieved the highest performance: area
under the curve (AUC) = 0.94 (95\% CI:0.84-0.96) for STEMI and AUC = 0.94 (95\%
CI:0.80-0.90) for NSTEMI. For STEMI, the top markers in women are chronic
kidney failure, high heart rate, and age over 70 years. For men, the top
markers are acute kidney failure, high troponin T levels, and age over 75
years. However, for NSTEMI, the top markers in women are low troponin levels,
high urea levels, and age over 80 years. For men, the top markers are high
heart rate, creatinine levels, and age over 70 years. Conclusions: Our results
show possible significant and coherent sex-specific risk markers of different
ACS sub-populations by interpreting ML mortality models trained on EHRs.
Differences are observed in the identified risk markers between women and men,
highlighting the importance of considering sex-specific markers in implementing
more appropriate treatment strategies and better clinical outcomes.

However, there are application scenarios where the rules are not globally

words, non-resolvable conflicts can only occur on graphs that are considered as
""garbage"". In this paper, we introduce the notion of confluence up to garbage

transformation, providing a sufficient condition for confluence up to garbage
by non-garbage critical pair analysis. We apply our results in two case studies

vehicles - depth sensing LiDAR and radiance sensing cameras. We compare the
performance (average precision) of a ResNet for vehicle detection in complex,
daytime, driving scenes when the input is a depth map (D = d(x,y)), a radiance
image (L = r(x,y)), or both [D,L]. (1) When the spatial sampling resolution of
the depth map and radiance image are equal to typical camera resolutions, a
ResNet detects vehicles at higher average precision from depth than radiance.
(2) As the spatial sampling of the depth map declines to the range of current
LiDAR devices, the ResNet average precision is higher for radiance than depth.
(3) For a hybrid system that combines a depth map and radiance image, the
average precision is higher than using depth or radiance alone. We established
these observations in simulation and then confirmed them using realworld data.
The advantage of combining depth and radiance can be explained by noting that
the two type of information have complementary weaknesses. The radiance data
are limited by dynamic range and motion blur. The LiDAR data have relatively
low spatial resolution. The ResNet combines the two data sources effectively to
improve overall vehicle detection.

linear polarization from dust grains aligned to a magnetic field can reveal
information about the magnetic field's direction, but not its strength. On the

by Zeeman splitting offer a direct measure of the line-of-sight magnetic field
strength in disks. We present upper limits on the net toroidal and vertical

condition says that for any $a,b\in R$ there exist $u,v\in R$ such that
$au=bv$, where $u\ne0$ or $v\ne0$. It always holds whenever $G$ is amenable.
Recently it was shown that for R.\,Thompson's group $F$ the converse is also
true. So the famous amenability problem for $F$ is equivalent to the question
on the Ore condition for the group ring of the same group.
  It is easy to see that the problem on the Ore condition for $K[F]$ is
equivalent to the same property for the monoid ring $K[M]$, where $M$ is the
monoid of positive elements of $F$. In this paper we reduce the problem to the
case when $a$, $b$ are homogeneous elements of the same degree in the monoid
ring. We study the case of degree $1$ and find solutions of the Ore equation.
For the case of degree $2$, we study the case of linear combinations of
monomials from $S=\{x_0^2,x_0x_1,x_0x_2,x_1^2,x_1x_2\}$. This set is not
doubling, that is, there are nonempty finite subsets $X\subset M\subset F$ such
that $|SX| < 2|X|$. As a consequence, the Ore condition holds for linear
combinations of these monomials. We give an estimate for the degree of $u$, $v$
in the above equation.
  The case of monomials of higher degree is open as well as the case of degree
$2$ for monomials on $x_0,x_1,...,x_m$, where $m\ge3$. Recall that negative
answer to any of these questions will immediately imply non-amenability of $F$.

Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation with the goal to understand the effects
the control process has on the dynamics and on the stationary state of the
resulting stochastic growth kinetics. In linear control, the intrinsic
non-linearity of the system is maintained at all times. In our protocol, the
control is applied to only a small number $n_c$ of Fourier modes. The
stationary-state roughness is obtained analytically in the small-$n_c$ regime
with weak non-linear coupling wherein the controlled growth process is found to
result in Edwards--Wilkinson dynamics. Furthermore, when the non-linear KPZ
coupling is strong, we discern a regime where the controlled dynamics shows
scaling in accordance to the KPZ universality class. We perform a detailed
numerical analysis to investigate the controlled dynamics subject to weak as
well as strong non-linearity. A first-order perturbation theory calculation
supports the simulation results in the weak non-linear regime. For strong
non-linearity, we find a temporal crossover between KPZ and dispersive growth
regimes, with the crossover time scaling with the number $n_c$ of controlled
Fourier modes. We observe that the height distribution is positively skewed,
indicating that as a consequence of the linear control, the surface morphology
displays fewer and smaller hills than in the uncontrolled growth process, and
that the inherent size-dependent stationary-state roughness provides an upper
limit for the roughness of the controlled system.

such as hydrology, it is a customary practice to regionalize - to divide a
large spatial domain into multiple regions and study each region separately -
instead of fitting a single model on the entire data (also known as
unification). Traditional wisdom in these fields suggests that models built for
each region separately will have higher performance because of homogeneity
within each region. However, by partitioning the training data, each model has
access to fewer data points and cannot learn from commonalities between
regions. Here, through two hydrologic examples (soil moisture and streamflow),
we argue that unification can often significantly outperform regionalization in
the era of big data and deep learning (DL). Common DL architectures, even
without bespoke customization, can automatically build models that benefit from
regional commonality while accurately learning region-specific differences. We
highlight an effect we call data synergy, where the results of the DL models
improved when data were pooled together from characteristically different
regions. In fact, the performance of the DL models benefited from more diverse
rather than more homogeneous training data. We hypothesize that DL models
automatically adjust their internal representations to identify commonalities
while also providing sufficient discriminatory information to the model. The
results here advocate for pooling together larger datasets, and suggest the
academic community should place greater emphasis on data sharing and
compilation.

detection of an onset of instability is a hard technical challenge, which needs
to be addressed to build safer and more energy-efficient gas turbine engines
powering aerospace and energy industries. The instabilities arising in
combustion chambers of engines are mathematically too complex to model. To
address this issue in a data-driven manner instead, we propose a novel deep
learning architecture called 3D convolutional selective autoencoder (3D-CSAE)
to detect the evolution of self-excited oscillations using spatiotemporal data,
i.e., hi-speed videos taken from a swirl-stabilized combustor (laboratory
surrogate of gas turbine engine combustor). 3D-CSAE consists of filters to
learn, in a hierarchical fashion, the complex visual and dynamic features
related to combustion instability. We train the 3D-CSAE on frames of videos
obtained from a limited set of operating conditions. We select the 3D-CSAE
hyper-parameters that are effective for characterizing hierarchical and
multiscale instability structure evolution by utilizing the dynamic information
available in the video. The proposed model clearly shows performance
improvement in detecting the precursors of instability. The machine
learning-driven results are verified with physics-based off-line measures.
Advanced active control mechanisms can directly leverage the proposed online
detection capability of 3D-CSAE to mitigate the adverse effects of combustion
instabilities on the engine operating under various stringent requirements and

in deep RL by using experience obtained in past tasks for a new task to be
solved.
  However, most meta-RL methods require partially or fully on-policy data,
i.e., they cannot reuse the data collected by past policies, which hinders the
improvement of sample efficiency.
  To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel off-policy meta-RL method,
embedding learning and evaluation of uncertainty (ELUE).
  An ELUE agent is characterized by the learning of a feature embedding space
shared among tasks.
  It learns a belief model over the embedding space and a belief-conditional
policy and Q-function.
  Then, for a new task, it collects data by the pretrained policy, and updates
its belief based on the belief model.
  Thanks to the belief update, the performance can be improved with a small
amount of data.
  In addition, it updates the parameters of the neural networks to adjust the
pretrained relationships when there are enough data.
  We demonstrate that ELUE outperforms state-of-the-art meta RL methods through
experiments on meta-RL benchmarks.

Assuming the offset being a proxy for the velocity vector of a galaxy, as
expected from ram pressure stripping, this excess indicates that ram pressure
stripping occurs most effectively during the first passage of an infalling
galaxy, leading to the quenching of its star formation. We also find that,
outside the virial region, the continuum-normalized H$\alpha$ line flux for
infalling galaxies with large offsets are on average lower than those with
small or no measurable offset, further supporting ram pressure as a dominant
quenching mechanism during the initial infall stages.

scattered light, which traces the disk surface, millimeter dust emission, which
probes the disk midplane, as well as molecular emission. The two leading
explanations for spirals are wakes generated by a massive planet and the
density waves excited by disk self-gravity. We use stratified 3D hydrodynamic
shearing-box simulations including dust particles and disk self-gravity to
investigate how gas and dust spirals in a self-gravitating disk depend on the
simulation size, the cooling efficiency, and the aerodynamics properties of
particles. We find that opening angles of spirals are universal ($\sim10^o$),
and not significantly affected by the size of the computational domain, the
cooling time, or the particle size. In simulations with the biggest domain, the
spirals in the gaseous disk become slightly more open with a higher cooling
efficiency. Small dust follows the gaseous spirals very well, while
intermediate-sized dust with dimensionless stopping time $(\mathrm{St})$ close
to 1 concentrates to the spirals more and shows stronger spirals. However,
large dust with $\mathrm{St} > 1$ also shows spirals, which is different from
some previous simulations. We identify that this is due to the gravity from the
gas to the dust component. We show that when $\mathrm{St} \gtrsim Q$, the
gravitational force from the gaseous spirals to the dust particles becomes
stronger than the particles' aerodynamic drag force, so that the gas
significantly affects these large particles through gravitational interaction.
This has important implications for both spiral observations and planetesimal

onto the central young star, especially at early stages (e.g. HL Tau),
indicating moderate disk turbulence. However, recent ALMA observations suggest
that dust is highly settled, implying weak turbulence. Motivated by such
tension, we carry out 3D stratified local simulations of self-gravitating
disks, focusing on settling of dust particles in actively accreting disks. We
find that gravitationally unstable disks can have moderately high accretion
rates while maintaining a relatively thin dust disk for two reasons. First,
accretion stress from the self-gravitating spirals (self-gravity stress) can be
stronger than the stress from turbulence (Reynolds stress) by a factor of 5-20.
Second, the strong gravity from the gas to the dust decreases the dust scale
height by another factor of $\sim 2$. Furthermore, the turbulence is slightly
anisotropic, producing a larger Reynolds stress than the vertical dust
diffusion coefficient. Thus, gravitoturbulent disks have unusually high
vertical Schmidt numbers ($Sc_z$) if we scale the total accretion stress with
the vertical diffusion coefficient (e.g. $Sc_z\sim$ 10-100). The reduction of
the dust scale height by the gas gravity, should also operate in
gravitationally stable disks ($Q>$1). Gravitational forces between particles
become more relevant for the concentration of intermediate dust sizes, forming
dense clouds of dust. After comparing with HL Tau observations, our results
suggest that self-gravity and gravity among different disk components could be
crucial for solving the conflict between the protoplanetary disk accretion and
dust settling, at least at the early stages.

quantum mechanics as deterministic. These interpretations only suggest that the

mechanics cannot predict the future with certainty, the quantum mechanical
world must be deterministic, and the value observed by the observer is
determined. I examine the following two cases: (1) the wave-function completely

both energy harvesting (EH) and information transfer. A non-linear energy
harvester with a hybrid SWIPT scheme is adopted in which both power-splitting

the spectral efficiency of the existing wireless systems. In MBM, multiple
radio frequency (RF) mirrors are placed near the transmit antenna(s) and are
switched ON/OFF to create different channel fade realizations. In such systems,
additional information is conveyed through the ON/OFF status of RF mirrors
along with conventional modulation symbols. A challenging task at the receiver
is to detect the transmitted information symbols and extract the additional
information from the channel fade realization used for transmission. In this
paper, we consider a massive MIMO (mMIMO) system where each user relies on MBM
for transmitting information to the base station, and investigate the problem
of symbol detection at the base station. First, we propose a mirror activation
pattern (MAP) selection based modified iterative sequential detection
algorithm. With the proposed algorithm, the most favorable MAP is selected,
followed by the detection of symbol corresponding to the selected MAP. Each
solution is subjected to the reliability check before getting the update. Next,
we introduce a $K$ favorable MAP search based iterative interference
cancellation (KMAP-IIC) algorithm. In particular, a selection rule is
introduced in KMAP-IIC for deciding the set of favorable MAPs over which
iterative interference cancellation is performed, followed by a greedy update
scheme for detecting the MBM symbols corresponding to each user. Simulation
results show that the proposed detection algorithms exhibit superior
performance-complexity trade-off over the existing detection techniques in
MBM-mMIMO systems.

perform a generalized Rashba coupling approximation to obtain a solvable
Hamiltonian by keeping the nearest-mixing terms of Laudau states, which is
reformulated in the similar form to that with only Rashba coupling. Each Landau
state becomes a new displaced-Fock state with a displacement shift instead of
the original Harmonic oscillator Fock state, yielding eigenstates in closed
form. Analytical energies are consistent with numerical ones in a wide range of
coupling strength even for a strong Zeeman splitting. In the presence of an
electric field, the spin conductance and the charge conductance obtained
analytically are in good agreements with the numerical results. As the
component of the Dresselhaus coupling increases, we find that the spin Hall
conductance exhibits a pronounced resonant peak at a larger value of the
inverse of the magnetic field. Meanwhile, the charge conductance exhibits a
series of plateaus as well as a jump at the resonant magnetic field. Our method
provides an easy-to-implement analytical treatment to two-dimensional electron

modulation of the two-particle interaction. For both types of models, we find
that the single-particle band gaps are renormalized by the interaction in

  consequences",,,,,"math.AP q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In unicellular organisms such as bacteria and in most viruses, mutations
mainly occur during reproduction. Thus, genotypes with a high birth rate should
have a higher mutation rate. However, standard models of asexual adaptation
such as the 'replicator-mutator equation' often neglect this effect. In this
study, we investigate the emergence of a positive dependence between the birth
rate and the mutation rate in models of asexual adaptation and the consequences
of this dependence. We show that it emerges naturally at the population scale,
based on a large population limit of a stochastic timecontinuous
individual-based model with elementary assumptions. We derive a
reaction-diffusion framework that describes the evolutionary trajectories and
steady states in the presence of this dependence. When this model is coupled
with a phenotype to fitness landscape with two optima, one for birth, the other
one for survival, a new trade-off arises in the population. Compared to the
standard approach with a constant mutation rate, the symmetry between birth and
survival is broken. Our analytical results and numerical simulations show that
the trajectories of mean phenotype, mean fitness and the stationary phenotype
distribution are in sharp contrast with those displayed for the standard model.
Here, we obtain trajectories of adaptation where the mean phenotype of the
population is initially attracted by the birth optimum, but eventually
converges to the survival optimum, following a hook-shaped curve which
illustrates the antagonistic effects of mutation on adaptation.

does not resort to implicitization.
  Most importantly, we perform all computations in the parameter space and not
in the implicit space. When the parametrization involves polynomials of degree
at most $d$ and maximum bitsize of coefficients $\tau$, then the worst case bit
complexity of PTOPO is $
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}_B(nd^6+nd^5\tau+d^4(n^2+n\tau)+d^3(n^2\tau+
n^3)+n^3d^2\tau)$. This bound matches the current record bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}_B(d^6+d^5\tau)$ for the problem of computing the topology
of a plane algebraic curve given in implicit form. For plane and space curves,
if $N = \max\{d, \tau \}$, the complexity of PTOPO becomes
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}_B(N^6)$, which improves the state-of-the-art result, due
to Alc\'azar and D\'iaz-Toca [CAGD'10], by a factor of $N^{10}$. In the same
time complexity, we obtain a graph whose straight-line embedding is isotopic to

construction, increases the bound to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}_B(N^7)$. For curves
of general dimension, we can also distinguish between ordinary and non-ordinary
real singularities and determine their multiplicities in the same expected
complexity of PTOPO by employing the algorithm of Blasco and P\'erez-D\'iaz

individual photons. In turn, Rydberg interactions enable single photons to
alter the optical response of the array within a potentially large blockade
radius $R_b$, which can effectively punch a large ""hole"" for subsequent
photons. We show that such a system enables a coherent photon-photon gate or
switch, with an error scaling $\sim R_b^{-4}$ that is significantly better than

$A=14.381\pm0.004$ and $B=-2.72\pm0.04$ compare well with previous studies. In
our analysis, we find that the bigger sunspots (with area $>$400~$\mu$Hem)
rotate slower than the smaller ones. At the same time, we do not find any
variation in the rotation rates between activity extremes, i.e solar maxima and
minima. Lastly, we employ our tracking algorithm on the Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI) data and compare the MDI results with our KoSO values.

which upper complexity bounds can be achieved by the PG-approach, and we
complement these with conditional lower bounds (in the sense of the

that we can achieve optimal (or near optimal) algorithms with the PG-approach,

simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flow up to $\Rey_\tau\approx 1000$. For
the wavenumber-frequency spectra of the total wall pressure fluctuations, a
valley-like behavior of contour lines in the sub-convective region is found,
which may be linked to the Kraichnan-Phillips theorem. For the decomposition of
the wall pressure spectra, it is commonly assumed in previous studies that the
cross spectral density (CSD) between the rapid and slow components of the wall
pressure fluctuations can be neglected. Yet no experimental or numerical
evidence is available for either confirming or disproving this assumption. In
this paper, we use DNS data to quantitatively evaluate this assumption.
Emphasizes are put on the error in decibel scale caused by neglecting the CSD
between the rapid and slow components of the wall pressure fluctuations. It is
found that this assumption is approximately accurate for one- and
two-dimensional spectra, but causes a large magnitude of error in the
three-dimensional wavenumber-frequency spectra. An error of 5dB is observed in
the sub-convective region and such a large error is observed for a wide range
of Reynolds numbers ($180\le\Rey_\tau\le 1000$). The analyses show that the
assumption of neglecting the CSD needs to be applied carefully at the scales
falling in the sub-convective region.

primitives with secure multiparty computation efficiently. It conceals secret

booking details, access token information, and user and vehicle identities. It
also provides user accountability in case of disputes. Besides, we provide
semantic security analysis and prove that HERMES meets its security and privacy
requirements. Last but not least, we demonstrate that HERMES is efficient and,
in contrast to SePCAR, scales to a large number of users and vehicles, making
it practical for real-world deployments. We build our evaluations with two
different multiparty computation protocols: HtMAC-MiMC and CBC-MAC-AES. Our
results demonstrate that HERMES with HtMAC-MiMC requires only approx 1,83 ms

Assuming all the iterates $f^n$ are analytic in a neighborhood of its bov, this
article proves that the number of Herman rings of a particular period is finite
and every Julia component intersects the boundaries of at most finitely many
Herman rings. Further, if the bov is the only limit point of the critical
values then it is shown that $f$ has infinitely many repelling fixed points. If
a repelling periodic point of period $p$ is on the boundary of a $p$-periodic
rotation domain then the periodic point is shown to be on the boundary of
infinitely many Fatou components. Under additional assumptions on the critical
points, a sufficient condition is found for a Julia component to be singleton.
As a consequence, it is proved that if the boundary of a wandering domain $W$
accumulates at some point of the plane under the iteration of $f$ then each
limit of $f^n$ on $W$ is either a parabolic periodic point or in the
$\omega$-limit set of recurrent critical points. Using the same ideas, the

changepoint techniques for time series data. Due to their importance in
inferential matters, changepoint research on correlated data has accelerated
recently. Unfortunately, small perturbations in model assumptions can
drastically alter changepoint conclusions; for example, heavy positive
correlation in a time series can be misattributed to a mean shift should
correlation be ignored. This paper considers both single and multiple
changepoint techniques. The paper begins by examining cumulative sum (CUSUM)
and likelihood ratio tests and their variants for the single changepoint
problem; here, various statistics, boundary cropping scenarios, and scaling
methods (e.g., scaling to an extreme value or Brownian Bridge limit) are
compared. A recently developed test based on summing squared CUSUM statistics
over all times is shown to have realistic Type I errors and superior detection
power. The paper then turns to the multiple changepoint setting. Here,
penalized likelihoods drive the discourse, with AIC, BIC, mBIC, and MDL
penalties being considered. Binary and wild binary segmentation techniques are
also compared. We introduce a new distance metric specifically designed to
compare two multiple changepoint segmentations. Algorithmic and computational
concerns are discussed and simulations are provided to support all conclusions.
In the end, the multiple changepoint setting admits no clear methodological
winner, performance depending on the particular scenario. Nonetheless, some
practical guidance will emerge.

strongly inflexible. The existence of simply-connected inflexible manifolds was
established by Arkowitz and Lupton. However, the existence of simply-connected
strongly inflexible manifolds is still an open question. We provide an

and the surrounding coronal magnetic-field topology, which determines the
trajectory and morphology of the event and can even lead to sympathetic
eruptions from multiple sources. In this paper, we report on a numerical
simulation of a new type of coupled eruption, in which a coronal jet initiated
by a large pseudostreamer filament eruption triggers a streamer-blowout coronal
mass ejection (CME) from the neighboring helmet streamer. Our configuration has
a large opposite-polarity region positioned between the polar coronal hole and
a small equatorial coronal hole, forming a pseudostreamer flanked by the
coronal holes and the helmet streamer. Further out, the pseudostreamer stalk
takes the shape of an extended arc in the heliosphere. We energize the system
by applying photospheric shear along a section of the polarity inversion line
within the pseudostreamer. The resulting sheared-arcade filament channel
develops a flux rope that eventually erupts as a classic coronal-hole-type jet.
However, the enhanced breakout reconnection above the channel as the jet is
launched progresses into the neighboring helmet streamer, partially launching
the jet along closed helmet streamer field lines and blowing out the streamer
top to produce a classic bubble-like CME. This CME is strongly deflected from
the jet's initial trajectory and contains a mixture of open and closed magnetic
field lines. We present the detailed dynamics of this new type of coupled
eruption, its underlying mechanisms and the implications of this work for the
interpretation of in-situ and remote-sensing observations.

(post-AGB) binaries. Due to the orbital motion of the binary, the jet causes
variable absorption in the Balmer profiles. In previous work, we have developed
spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer models to reproduce the observed Balmer
line variability and derive the spatio-kinematic structure of the jet and its
mass-loss rate. Here, we apply our jet model to five post-AGB binaries with
distinct H{\alpha} line variability and diverse orbital properties. Our models
fit the H{\alpha} line variations very well. We estimate jet mass-loss rates
between 10-8 Mdot yr-1 and 10-4 Mdot yr-1 , from which we deduce accretion
rates onto the companion between 10-7 Mdot yr-1 and 10-3 Mdot yr-1 . These
accretion rates are somewhat higher than can be comfortably explained with
reasonable sources of accretion, but we argue that the circumbinary disc in
these systems is most-likely the source feeding the accretion, although
accretion from the post-AGB star cannot be ruled out. The diversity of the
variability in the five objects is due to their wide ejection cones combined
with a range of viewing angles, rather than inherent differences between the
objects. The nature of the observations does not let us easily distinguish
which jet launching model (stellar jet, disc wind, or X-wind) should be
favoured. In conclusion, we show that our jet model includes the physical
parameters to successfully reproduce the H{\alpha} line variations and retrieve
the structure and mass-loss rates of the jet for all five objects that are
representative of the diverse sample of Galactic post-AGB binaries.

connectivity are considered to be multi-layered, while traditional machine
learning based on individual models not only are limited in performance, but
also fail to extract multi-dimensional and multi-layered information from brain
network. Methods: In this study, inspired by multi-layer brain network
structure, we propose a new method namely Weighted Ensemble-model and Network
Analysis, which combines the machine learning and graph theory for improved
fluid intelligence prediction. Firstly, functional connectivity analysis and
graphical theory were jointly employed. The functional connectivity and
graphical indices computed using the preprocessed fMRI data were then all fed
into auto-encoder parallelly for feature extraction to predict the fluid
intelligence. In order to improve the performance, tree regression and ridge
regression model were automatically stacked and fused with weighted values.
Finally, layers of auto-encoder were visualized to better illustrate the
connectome patterns, followed by the evaluation of the performance to justify
the mechanism of brain functions. Results: Our proposed methods achieved best
performance with 3.85 mean absolute deviation, 0.66 correlation coefficient and
0.42 R-squared coefficient, outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. It is
also worth noting that, the optimization of the biological pattern extraction

method not only outperforming the state-of-the-art reports, but also able to

problem because of the safety and efficiency constraints required for

optimal collision-free paths for each agent of the MRS, they search the
composite space of all the agents and therefore, suffer from exponential
increase in computation with the number of robots. On the other hand,
prioritized approaches provide a practical solution to applications with large
number of robots, especially when path computation time and collision avoidance
take precedence over guaranteed globally optimal solution. While most
centrally-planned algorithms use static prioritization, a dynamic
prioritization algorithm, PD*, is proposed that employs a novel metric, called
freedom index, to decide the priority order of the robots at each time step.
This allows the PD* algorithm to simultaneously plan the next step for all
robots while ensuring collision-free operation in obstacle ridden environments.
Extensive simulations were performed to test and compare the performance of the
proposed PD* scheme with other state-of-the-art algorithms. It was found that
PD* improves upon the computational time by 25% while providing solutions of
similar path lengths. Increase in efficiency was particularly prominent in
scenarios with large number of robots and/or higher obstacle densities, where
the probability of collisions is higher, suggesting the suitability of PD* in
solving such problems.

respectively without studying the inter-relationship between them, which

utilizes an improved Hierarchical Online In-stance Matching (iHOIM) loss to
explicitly model the inter-relationship between object detection and Re-ID. Our
novel iHOIM loss function unifies the objectives of the two sub-tasks and
encourages better detection performance and feature learning even in extremely

predicted by a motion model, as region proposals for subsequent object
detection, where the intuition is that detection results and motion predictions

environments. Previous observations of mid-infrared rotational lines of OH
suggest that these lines may be used to probe the photodissociation of water.
In this work, cross sections for the photodissociation of H$_2$O resolving the
state of the OH fragment are collected and incorporated in a new molecular
excitation code called GROSBETA, which includes radiative pumping, collisional
(de)excitation, and prompt emission (i.e., following the production of OH in
excited states). We find that the OH rotational line intensities in the range
9-16$\mu$m, covering rotational transitions with $N_{up}=18$ to 45, are
proportional to the column density of H$_2$O photodissociated per second by
photons in the range 114-143nm and do not depend on other local properties.
Provided an independent measurement of the column density of water is
available, the strength of the local UV radiation field can be deduced with
good accuracy. In contrast, the OH lines at longer far-infrared wavelengths are
primarily produced by IR radiative pumping and collisions. Our model
successfully reproduces the OH mid-IR lines in the $10-16\mu$m range observed
by Spitzer toward the tip of the HH 211 bow-shock and shows that the jet shock
irradiates its surroundings, exposing H$_2$O to a UV photon flux that is about
$5 \times 10^3$ times larger than the standard interstellar radiation field. We
also find that chemical pumping by the reaction H$_2$ + O may supplement the
excitation of lines in the range $16-30\mu$m. The mid-infrared lines of OH
constitute a powerful diagnostic for inferring the photodissociation rate of
water and thus the UV field water is exposed to. Future JWST-MIRI observations
will be able to map the photodestruction rate of H$_2$O in various dense and

understanding the ecological role of toothed whales is to characterize their

It is therefore of interest to measure or estimate the rate of buzzing to

prey capture attempts directly from accelerometer data, and thus be able to
estimate food consumption without the need for the more demanding acoustic
data. We develop 3 automated buzz detection methods based on accelerometer and
depth data solely. We use a dataset from 5 narwhals instrumented in East
Greenland in 2018 to train, validate and test a logistic regression model and
the machine learning algorithms random forest and deep learning, using the
buzzes detected from acoustic data as the ground truth. The deep learning
algorithm performed best among the tested methods. We conclude that reliable
buzz detectors can be derived from high-frequency-sampling, back-mounted
accelerometer tags, thus providing an alternative tool for studies of foraging
ecology of marine mammals in their natural environments. We also compare buzz
detection with certain movement patterns, such as sudden changes in
acceleration (jerks), found in other marine mammal species for estimating prey
capture. We find that narwhals do not seem to make big jerks when foraging and
conclude that their hunting patterns in that respect differ from other marine

Recent studies have focused on learning such physics-informed neural networks
through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants, yet they face the
difficulty of obtaining an accurate solution due to optimization challenges. In
the context of solving differential equations, we are faced with the problem of
finding globally optimum parameters of the network, instead of being concerned
with out-of-sample generalization. SGD, which searches along a single gradient
direction, is prone to become trapped in local optima, so it may not be the
best approach here. In contrast, neuroevolution carries out a parallel
exploration of diverse solutions with the goal of circumventing local optima.
It could potentially find more accurate solutions with better optimized neural
networks. However, neuroevolution can be slow, raising tractability issues in
practice. With that in mind, a novel and computationally efficient transfer
neuroevolution algorithm is proposed in this paper. Our method is capable of
exploiting relevant experiential priors when solving a new problem, with
adaptation to protect against the risk of negative transfer. The algorithm is
applied on a variety of differential equations to empirically demonstrate that
transfer neuroevolution can indeed achieve better accuracy and faster
convergence than SGD. The experimental outcomes thus establish transfer
neuroevolution as a noteworthy approach for solving differential equations, one
that has never been studied in the past. Our work expands the resource of

points, each with some value. Dynamic variants allow points to be added or
removed, one at a time. To support more powerful updates, we introduce the Grid
Range class of data structure problems over integer arrays in one or more
dimensions. These problems allow range updates (such as filling all cells in a
range with a constant) and queries (such as finding the sum or maximum of
values in a range). In this work, we consider these operations along with
updates that replace each cell in a range with the minimum, maximum, or sum of
its existing value, and a constant. In one dimension, it is known that segment
trees can be leveraged to facilitate any $n$ of these operations in
$\tilde{O}(n)$ time overall. Other than a few specific cases, until now, higher
dimensional variants have been largely unexplored.
  We show that no truly subquadratic time algorithm can support certain pairs
of these updates simultaneously without falsifying several popular conjectures.
On the positive side, we show that truly subquadratic algorithms can be
obtained for variants induced by other subsets. We provide two approaches to
designing such algorithms that can be generalised to online and higher
dimensional settings. First, we give almost-tight $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time
algorithms for single-update variants where the update operation distributes

framework for reducing to instances with a special geometry. Using this, we
show that $O(m^{3/2-\epsilon})$ time algorithms for counting paths and walks of
length 2 and 3 between vertex pairs in sparse graphs imply truly subquadratic

a single thermodynamic state point. We recently introduced a Maximum Caliber
(MaxCal) approach for dynamical reweighting. Our approach mapped these
trajectories to a Markovian description on the configurational coordinates, and
reweighted path probabilities as a function of external forces. Trajectory
probabilities can be dynamically reweighted both from and to equilibrium or
non-equilibrium steady states. As the system's dimensionality increases, an
exhaustive description of the microtrajectories becomes prohibitive--even with
a Markovian assumption. Instead we reduce the dimensionality of the
configurational space to collective variables (CVs). Going from configurational
to CV space, we define local entropy productions derived from configurationally
averaged mean forces. The entropy production is shown to be a suitable
constraint on MaxCal for non-equilibrium steady states expressed as a function
of CVs. We test the reweighting procedure on two systems: a particle subject to
a two-dimensional potential and a coarse-grained peptide. Our CV-based MaxCal
approach expands dynamical reweighting to larger systems, for both static and
dynamical properties, and across a large range of driving forces.

several hundred atomic and molecular species, and make them freely available on

essential for early warning and rapid response. While recently multiple deep
learning approaches for fast assessment of earthquakes have been proposed, they
usually rely on either seismic records from a single station or from a fixed
set of seismic stations. Here we introduce a new model for real-time magnitude
and location estimation using the attention based transformer networks. Our
approach incorporates waveforms from a dynamically varying set of stations and
outperforms deep learning baselines in both magnitude and location estimation
performance. Furthermore, it outperforms a classical magnitude estimation
algorithm considerably and shows promising performance in comparison to a
classical localization algorithm. In this work, we furthermore conduct a
comprehensive study of the requirements on training data, the training
procedures and the typical failure modes using three diverse and large scale
data sets. Our analysis gives several key insights. First, we can precisely
pinpoint the effect of large training data; for example, a four times larger
training set reduces the required time for real time assessment by a factor of
four. Second, the basic model systematically underestimates large magnitude
events. This issue can be mitigated by incorporating events from other regions
into the training through transfer learning. Third, location estimation is
highly precise in areas with sufficient training data, but is strongly degraded
for events outside the training distribution. Our analysis suggests that these
characteristics are not only present for our model, but for most deep learning
models for fast assessment published so far. They result from the black box
modeling and their mitigation will likely require imposing physics derived
constraints on the neural network.

planet. We then discovered a weak magnetic field at its surface using
spectropolarimetry. Aims and Methods: We followed up our investigations on
Pollux first using ESPaDOnS at CFHT and then Narval at TBL to obtain Stokes I
and Stokes V spectra to study their variations for a duration of 4.25 years,
that is, for more than two periods of about 590 d of the RV variations. We used
the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) profiles to measure the longitudinal
magnetic field and to perform a Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) investigation.
Results: The longitudinal magnetic field of Pollux is found to vary with a
sinusoidal behavior and a period similar to that of the RV variations. From the
ZDI investigation a rotation period of Pollux is determined to be equal to
660+/-15 days and possibly different than the period of variations of the RV.
As to the magnetic topology, the poloidal component is dominant and almost
purely dipolar with an inclination of 10.5{\deg} of the dipole with respect to
the rotation axis. The mean strength of the surface magnetic field is 0.44 G.
Conclusions: As to the origin of the magnetic field of Pollux, we favor the
hypothesis that it is maintained through contemporaneous dynamo action. Pollux
appears as the representative of a class of slowly rotating and weakly magnetic
G-K red giants. To explain the sinusoidal RV variations of Pollux, two
scenarios are proposed. If the RV period is different from the rotation period,
the observed periodic RV variations are due to the hosted planet and the
contribution of Pollux magnetic activity is not significantly detected. In the
peculiar case in which the two periods are equal, we cannot discard the
possibility that the activity of Pollux could explain the total RV variations
and that the planet hypothesis would appear unnecessary.

leading to an overall spin current similar to the spin Seebeck effect.

proposed for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with experience replay. In
contrast to traditional experience replay mechanism in DRL, the proposed deep
reinforcement learning with quantum-inspired experience replay (DRL-QER)
adaptively chooses experiences from the replay buffer according to the
complexity and the replayed times of each experience (also called transition),
to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. In DRL-QER,
transitions are first formulated in quantum representations, and then the
preparation operation and the depreciation operation are performed on the
transitions. In this progress, the preparation operation reflects the
relationship between the temporal difference errors (TD-errors) and the
importance of the experiences, while the depreciation operation is taken into
account to ensure the diversity of the transitions. The experimental results on
Atari 2600 games show that DRL-QER outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such

a particular spatial partitioning of the system of interest, can effectively
ascertain whether or not the data set is compatible with a separable state.
When compatibility is disproved, the approach produces the optimal entanglement
witness for the quantum data at hand. Our approach is based on mapping
separable states onto equilibrium classical field theories on a lattice; and on
mapping the compatibility problem onto an inverse statistical problem, whose
solution is reached in polynomial time whenever the classical field theory does
not describe a glassy system. Our results pave the way for systematic

Subsequently, the ensemble average is taken to regress the final position of
fingertips. Since the whole pipeline uses a single network, it is significantly

outperforms the existing fingertip detection approaches including the Direct

field-theoretically in terms of an order parameter (concentration or density
field) obeying dissipative or conservative equilibrium dynamics and
(non-)symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. The tracer, which represents,
e.g., a colloidal particle, interacts with the fluid by locally modifying its
chemical potential or its correlations. The coupling between tracer and fluid
gives rise to a nonlinear and non-Markovian tracer dynamics, which is
investigated here analytically and via numerical simulations for a

governed by a fluctuation-induced (Casimir) potential, a spatially dependent
mobility, and a spatially dependent (multiplicative) noise, the characteristics
of which depend on the interaction and the boundary conditions. The
steady-state distribution of the tracer is typically inhomogeneous. Notably,

For the purpose of this study, we use SINFONI (H+K-band) and NACO ($L'$- and
$M'$-band) data-sets between 2002 and 2018 with additional COMIC/ADONIS+RASOIR
($L'$-band) data of 1999. By analyzing the line maps of SINFONI, we identify a
velocity of $\sim 200$ km/s from the tip to the tail. Furthermore, a
combination of the multiwavelength data of NACO and SINFONI in the $H$-, $K$-,
$L'$-, and $M'$-band results in a two-component black-body fit that implies
that X7 is a dust-enshrouded stellar object. The observed ongoing elongation
and orientation of X7 in the Br$\gamma$ line maps and the NACO $L'$-band
continuum indicate a wind arising at the position of Sgr~A* or at the IRS16
complex. Observations after 2010 show that the dust and the gas shell seems to
be decoupled in projection from its stellar source S50. The data also implies
that the tail of X7 gets thermally heated up due to the presence of S50. The
gas emission at the tip is excited because of the related forward scattering
(Mie-scattering), which will continue to influence the shape of X7 in the near
future. In addition, we find excited [FeIII] lines, which underline together
with the recently analyzed dusty sources and the Br$\gamma$-bar the uniqueness
of this source.

fundamental constants ($h$, $N_A$, $e$) and realizing a quasi-quantum mass in
the 2019 newly revised International System of Units, relies on the perfection
of Maxwell's equations and the symmetry they describe between Lorentz's force
and Faraday's induction, a principle and a symmetry stunningly demonstrated in
the weighing and velocity modes of Kibble balances to within $1\times10^{-8}$,
with nothing but imperfect wires and magnets. However, recent advances in the
understanding of the current effect in Kibble balances reveal a troubling
paradox. A diamagnetic effect, a force that does not cancel between mass-on and
mass-off measurement, is challenging balance maker's assumptions of symmetry at
levels that are almost two orders of magnitude larger than the reported
uncertainties. The diamagnetic effect, if it exists, shows up in weighing mode
without a readily apparent reciprocal effect in the velocity mode, begging
questions about systematic errors at the very foundation of the new measurement
system. The hypothetical force is caused by the coil current changing the
magnetic field, producing an unaccounted force that is systematically modulated
with the weighing current. Here we show that this diamagnetic force exists, but
the additional force does not change the equivalence between weighing and
velocity measurements. We reveal the unexpected way that symmetry is preserved
and show that for typical materials and geometries the total relative effect on
the measurement is $\approx 1\times10^{-9}$.

representation learning where a feature representation of data is learned by
solving a pseudo classification problem from unlabelled data. However, it is
not straightforward to understand what representation contrastive learning
yields. In addition, contrastive learning is often based on the maximum
likelihood estimation, which tends to be vulnerable to the contamination by
outliers. To promote the understanding to contrastive learning, this paper
first theoretically shows a connection to maximization of mutual information
(MI). Our result indicates that density ratio estimation is necessary and
sufficient for maximization of MI under some conditions. Thus, contrastive
learning related to density ratio estimation as done in popular objective
functions can be interpreted as maximizing MI. Next, with the density ratio, we
establish new recovery conditions for the latent source components in nonlinear
independent component analysis (ICA). In contrast with existing work, the
established conditions include a novel insight for the dimensionality of data,
which is clearly supported by numerical experiments. Furthermore, inspired by
nonlinear ICA, we propose a novel framework to estimate a nonlinear subspace
for lower-dimensional latent source components, and some theoretical conditions
for the subspace estimation are established with the density ratio. Then, we
propose a practical method through outlier-robust density ratio estimation,
which can be seen as performing maximization of MI, nonlinear ICA or nonlinear
subspace estimation. Moreover, a sample-efficient nonlinear ICA method is also
proposed. We theoretically investigate outlier-robustness of the proposed
methods. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed methods is numerically
demonstrated in nonlinear ICA and through application to linear classification.

data and can usually be estimated from the histograms corresponding to the
conviction times that are sentenced in a given population. We obtain a
transport equation, typically known as the McKendrick equation, the homogenous
version of which is included in population models with age structures. Using
this equation, we compute the inmate population and entry/exit rates in
equilibrium, which are the values to consider in the design of a penitentiary
system. With data from the Chilean penitentiary system, we illustrate how to
perform these computations. In classifying the inmate population into two
groups of sentence lengths (short and long), we incorporate the SIS
(susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemiological model, which considers the
entry of infective individuals. We show that a failure to consider the
structure of the sentence lengths -- as is common in epidemiological models
developed for inmate populations -- for prevalences of new inmates below a
certain threshold induces an underestimation of the prevalence in the prison
population at steady state. The threshold depends on the basic reproduction
number associated with the nonstructured SIS model with no entry of new
inmates. We illustrate our findings with analytical and numerical examples for
different distributions of sentencing lengths.

that is based on the number of goals scored. Goals, however, involve a high
element of chance and thus past results often do not reflect the performances
of the teams. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that accounting
for other match events such as shots at goal can provide a better indication of
the relative strengths of two teams than the number of goals scored. Forecast
models based on this information have been shown to be successful in
outperforming those based purely on match results. A notable weakness, however,
is that this approach does not take into account differences in the probability
of shot success among teams. A team that is more likely to score from a shot
will need fewer shots to win a match, on average. In this paper, we propose a
simple parametric model to predict the probability of a team scoring, given it
has taken a shot at goal. We show that the resulting forecasts are able to
outperform a model assuming an equal probability of shot success among all
teams. We then show that the model can be combined with predictions of the
number of shots achieved by each team, and can increase the skill of forecasts
of both the match outcome and of whether the total number of goals in a match
will exceed 2.5. We assess the performance of the forecasts alongside two
betting strategies and find mixed evidence for improved performance.

typical case in which the logging policy factorizes over the slots of the

the criterion by which to evaluate estimators, and we analyze the family of
'additive' estimators that includes the pseudoinverse (PI) estimator of
Swaminathan et al.\ (2017; arXiv:1605.04812). Using a control variate approach,
we identify a new estimator in this family that is guaranteed to have lower
risk than PI in the above class of problems. In particular, we show that the
risk improvement over PI grows linearly with the number of slots, and linearly
with the gap between the arithmetic and the harmonic mean of a set of
slot-level divergences between the logging and the target policy. In the
typical case of a uniform logging policy and a deterministic target policy,
each divergence corresponds to slot size, showing that maximal gains can be
obtained for slate problems with diverse numbers of actions per slot.

industries. Since manufacturing industries are shown to be the main source of

to proxy for space-time variation in industrial pollution. Since male embryos
are more vulnerable to external stressors like pollution during prenatal
development, they will face higher likelihood of fetal death. Therefore, we
proxy infant mortality with different measures of gender ratio. We show that
the upswing in industrial pollution during late nineteenth century and early
twentieth century has led to an increase in infant mortality. The results are
consistent and robust across different scenarios, measures for our proxies, and
aggregation levels. We find that infants and more specifically male infants had
paid the price of pollution during upswing in industrial growth at the dawn of

expelled during breathing. The spatial dissemination of droplets varies
according to their initial velocity. After a short literature review, our goal
was to determine the velocity of the exhaled air during vocal exercises.
Methods A propylene glycol cloud produced by 2 e-cigarettes' users allowed
visualization of the exhaled air emitted during vocal exercises. Airflow
velocities were measured during the first 200 ms of a long exhalation, a
sustained vowel /a/ and varied vocal exercises. For the long exhalation and the
sustained vowel /a/, the decrease of airflow velocity was measured until 3 s.
Results were compared with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study using
boundary conditions consistent with our experimental study. Results Regarding
the production of vowels, higher velocities were found in loud and whispered
voices than in normal voice. Voiced consonants like /3/ or /v/ generated higher
velocities than vowels. Some voiceless consonants, e.g., /t/ generated high
velocities, but long exhalation had the highest velocities. Semi-occluded vocal
tract exercises generated faster airflow velocities than loud speech, with a
decreased velocity during voicing. The initial velocity quickly decreased as
was shown during a long exhalation or a sustained vowel /a/. Velocities were
consistent with the CFD data. Conclusion Initial velocity of the exhaled air is
a key factor influencing droplets trajectory. Our study revealed that vocal
exercises produce a slower airflow than long exhalation. Speech therapy should,
therefore, not be associated with an increased risk of contamination when
implementing standard recommendations.

"2101.10814","Arya Tanmay Gupta","Arya Tanmay Gupta","Spread and defend infection in graphs",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.DM math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The spread of an infection, a contagion, meme, emotion, message and various
other spreadable objects have been discussed in several works. Burning and
firefighting have been discussed in particular on static graphs. Graph burning
simulates the notion of the spread of ""fire"" throughout a graph (plus, one
unburned node burned at each time-step); graph firefighting simulates the
defending of nodes by placing firefighters on the nodes which have not been
already burned while the fire is being spread (started by only a single fire
source).
  This article studies a combination of firefighting and burning on a graph
class which is a variation (generalization) of temporal graphs. Nodes can be
infected from ""outside"" a network. We present a notion of both upgrading (of
unburned nodes, similar to firefighting) and repairing (of infected nodes). The
nodes which are burned, firefighted, or repaired are chosen probabilistically.
So a variable amount of nodes are allowed to be infected, upgraded and repaired
in each time step.
  In the model presented in this article, both burning and firefighting proceed
concurrently, we introduce such a system to enable the community to study the
notion of spread of an infection and the notion of upgrade/repair against each
other. The graph class that we study (on which, these processes are simulated)
is a variation of temporal graph class in which at each time-step,
probabilistically, a communication takes place (iff an edge exists in that time
step). In addition, a node can be ""worn out"" and thus can be removed from the
network, and a new healthy node can be added to the network as well. This class
of graphs enables systems with high complexity to be able to be simulated and
studied.

  references. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1907.08768,
  arXiv:1810.06061",,,,"math.AT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Let us consider the prime field of two elements, $\mathbb F_2\equiv \mathbb
Z_2.$ It is well-known that the classical ""hit problem"" for a module over the
mod 2 Steenrod algebra $\mathscr A$ is an interesting and important open
problem of Algebraic topology, which asks a minimal set of generators for the
polynomial algebra $\mathcal P_m:=\mathbb F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m]$, regarded
as a connected unstable $\mathscr A$-module on $m$ variables $x_1, \ldots,
x_m,$ each of degree 1. The algebra $\mathcal P_m$ is the $\mathbb
F_2$-cohomology of the product of $m$ copies of the Eilenberg-MacLan complex
$K(\mathbb F_2, 1).$ Although the hit problem has been thoroughly studied for
more than 3 decades, solving it remains a mystery for $m\geq 5.$ Our intent in
this work is of studying the hit problem of five variables. More precisely, we
develop our previous work [Commun. Korean Math. Soc. 35 (2020), 371-399] on the
hit problem for $\mathscr A$-module $\mathcal P_5$ in a degree of the generic
form $n_t:=5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t,$ for any non-negative integer $t.$ An efficient
approach to solve this problem had been presented. Two applications of this
study are to determine the dimension of $\mathcal P_6$ in the generic degree
$5(2^{t+4}-1) + n_1.2^{t+4}$ for all $t > 0$ and to describe the modular
representations of the general linear group of rank 5 over $\mathbb F_2.$ As a
corollary, the cohomological ""transfer"", defined by William Singer [Math. Z.
202 (1989), 493-523], is an isomorphism in bidegree $(5, 5+n_0).$ Singer's
transfer is one of the relatively efficient tools to approach the structure of
mod-2 cohomology of the Steenrod algebra.

The first one is weakly projective with respect to the nonnegative real
Diophantine arithmetic
$\mathbf{R_+}=(\mathbb{R}_+,+,\times,\leq_{\mathbb{R}_+})$, the second one is
weakly projective with respect to the real Diophantine arithmetic
$\mathbf{R}=(\mathbb{R},+,\times,\leq_{\mathbb{R}})$, while the third one is

$\overline{\mathbf{R}}=(\overline{\mathbb{R}},+,\times,\leq_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}})$.
In addition, we have that every $\mathbf{A}_M$ and every $\mathbf{B}_M$ are a
complete totally ordered semiring, while every $\mathbf{A}_{-M,M}$ is not. We
show that the projection of any series of elements of $\mathbb{R}_+$ converges
in $\mathbf{A}_M$, for any $M \geq 1$, and that the projection of any
non-oscillating series series of elements of $\mathbb{R}$ converges in
$\mathbf{A}_{-M,M}$, for any $M \geq 1$, and in $\mathbf{B}_M$, for all $M >

version of the paradox of the heap.

i.e. constituents of baryons and mesons. Interaction of matters is
phenomenologically described by gauge theory of strong, electromagnetic, weak
and gravitational interactions. In electro-weak theory, left handed leptons
${l}_L$ and neutrino ${\mathcal \nu}_L$, right handed leptons ${l}_R$ and left
handed quarks $u_L, d_L$ and right handed quarks $u_R, d_R$ follow $SU(2)\times
U(1)$ symmetry. Charge of leptons and quarks define hypercharge $Y$, and via
Higgs mechanism $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry forms $U(1)_{em}$ symmetry. In
order to describe Hadron dynamics properly, embedding of 4-dimensional space to
5-dimensional space was tried in lattice simulations, and in light front
holographic QCD (LFHQCD) approach in which conformally symmetric light-front
dynamics without ghost are embedded in $AdS_5$, and a parameter that fixes a
mass scale was chosen from the Principle of Maximum Conformality. Coulomb or
Landau gauge fixed Faddeev-Popov Yang-Mills field equation is known to have the
Gribov ambiguity, and tunneling between vacua between different topological
structures was proposed by van Baal and collaborators. The symmetry of three
colors can be assigned three vectors of quaternion ${\bf H}$, whose
multiplication on $2\times 2$ matrices of Dirac spinors on ${\bf S}^3$ induces
transformations. Instantons or sphalerons whose presence is expected from
conformal equivalence of ${\bf S}^3\times {\bf R}$ to ${\bf R}^4$ are reviewed.
An extension of the dynamics embedded in complex projective space is also
discussed.

Hamilton formulation of mechanics, as elements of rotation groups in the
symplectic vector spaces. Quaternions were used in the solution of
4-dimensional Dirac equation in QED, and also in solutions of Yang-Mills

quaternions are formulated in Clifford Algebra, how it is used in explaining
rotation group in symplectic vector space and parallel transformation in
holonomic dynamics. When a dynamical system has hysteresis, pre-symplectic
manifolds and nonholonomic dynamics appear. Quaternions represent rotation of
3-dimensional sphere ${\bf S}^3$. Artin's generalized quaternions and
