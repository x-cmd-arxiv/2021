  Spike Sequences","Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data)",,,,"q-bio.GN cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  With the rapid global spread of COVID-19, more and more data related to this
virus is becoming available, including genomic sequence data. The total number
of genomic sequences that are publicly available on platforms such as GISAID is
currently several million, and is increasing with every day. The availability
of such \emph{Big Data} creates a new opportunity for researchers to study this
virus in detail. This is particularly important with all of the dynamics of the
COVID-19 variants which emerge and circulate. This rich data source will give
us insights on the best ways to perform genomic surveillance for this and
future pandemic threats, with the ultimate goal of mitigating or eliminating
such threats. Analyzing and processing the several million genomic sequences is
a challenging task. Although traditional methods for sequence classification
are proven to be effective, they are not designed to deal with these specific
types of genomic sequences. Moreover, most of the existing methods also face
the issue of scalability. Previous studies which were tailored to coronavirus
genomic data proposed to use spike sequences (corresponding to a subsequence of
the genome), rather than using the complete genomic sequence, to perform
different machine learning (ML) tasks such as classification and clustering.
However, those methods suffer from scalability issues. In this paper, we
propose an approach called Spike2Vec, an efficient and scalable feature vector
representation for each spike sequence that can be used for downstream ML
tasks. Through experiments, we show that Spike2Vec is not only scalable on
several million spike sequences, but also outperforms the baseline models in
terms of prediction accuracy, F1 score, etc.

  Decoupling","16 Figures, 5 Tables",,"10.1145/3466752.3480059",,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The fidelity of applications on near-term quantum computers is limited by
hardware errors. In addition to errors that occur during gate and measurement
operations, a qubit is susceptible to idling errors, which occur when the qubit
is idle and not actively undergoing any operations. To mitigate idling errors,
prior works in the quantum devices community have proposed Dynamical Decoupling
(DD), that reduces stray noise on idle qubits by continuously executing a
specific sequence of single-qubit operations that effectively behave as an
identity gate. Unfortunately, existing DD protocols have been primarily studied
for individual qubits and their efficacy at the application-level is not yet
fully understood.
  Our experiments show that naively enabling DD for every idle qubit does not
necessarily improve fidelity. While DD reduces the idling error-rates for some
qubits, it increases the overall error-rate for others due to the additional
operations of the DD protocol. Furthermore, idling errors are program-specific
and the set of qubits that benefit from DD changes with each program. To enable
robust use of DD, we propose Adaptive Dynamical Decoupling (ADAPT), a software
framework that estimates the efficacy of DD for each qubit combination and
judiciously applies DD only to the subset of qubits that provide the most
benefit. ADAPT employs a Decoy Circuit, which is structurally similar to the
original program but with a known solution, to identify the DD sequence that
maximizes the fidelity. To avoid the exponential search of all possible DD
combinations, ADAPT employs a localized algorithm that has linear complexity in
the number of qubits. Our experiments on IBM quantum machines (with 16-27
qubits) show that ADAPT improves the application fidelity by 1.86x on average
and up-to 5.73x compared to no DD and by 1.2x compared to DD on all qubits.

to infer the correct answer even if a program is run for thousands of trials.
On current machines, qubit measurements tend to be the most error-prone
operations (with an average error-rate of 4%) and often limit the size of
quantum programs that can be run reliably on these systems. As quantum programs
create and manipulate correlated states, all the program qubits are measured in
each trial and thus, the severity of measurement errors increases with the
program size. The fidelity of quantum programs can be improved by reducing the
number of measurement operations.
  We present JigSaw, a framework that reduces the impact of measurement errors
by running a program in two modes. First, running the entire program and
measuring all the qubits for half of the trials to produce a global (albeit
noisy) histogram. Second, running additional copies of the program and
measuring only a subset of qubits in each copy, for the remaining trials, to
produce localized (higher fidelity) histograms over the measured qubits. JigSaw
then employs a Bayesian post-processing step, whereby the histograms produced
by the subset measurements are used to update the global histogram. Our
evaluations using three different IBM quantum computers with 27 and 65 qubits
show that JigSaw improves the success rate on average by 3.6x and up-to 8.4x.
Our analysis shows that the storage and time complexity of JigSaw scales
linearly with the number of qubits and trials, making JigSaw applicable to

Remarkably, the dipolar interaction of sufficient strength drives the magnetic

$A^{}_r\leq4.0$, resulting in an enhancement in the hysteresis loop area. On
the other hand, the ferromagnetic coupling gets increased with $h^{}_d$ in

LIGP from inducing points to replicates, afford efficient computation in terms

an explanation and objectively evaluating explainability are not trivial tasks.
This paper presents a new model-agnostic metric to measure the Degree of
Explainability of information in an objective way. We exploit a specific
theoretical model from Ordinary Language Philosophy called the Achinstein's
Theory of Explanations, implemented with an algorithm relying on deep language
models for knowledge graph extraction and information retrieval. To understand
whether this metric can measure explainability, we devised a few experiments
and user studies involving more than 190 participants, evaluating two realistic
systems for healthcare and finance using famous AI technology, including
Artificial Neural Networks and TreeSHAP. The results we obtained are
statistically significant (with P values lower than .01), suggesting that our
proposed metric for measuring the Degree of Explainability is robust in several
scenarios, and it aligns with concrete expectations.

traditional scale out environments, such as independent scaling of compute and
memory resources. They also provide an independent failure model, where
computations or the compute nodes they run on may fail independently of the
disaggregated memory; thus, data that's resident in the disaggregated memory is
unaffected by the compute failure. Blind application of traditional techniques
for resilience (e.g., checkpoints or data replication) does not take advantage
of these architectures. To demonstrate the potential benefit of these
architectures for resilience, we develop Memory-Oriented Distributed Computing
(MODC), a framework for programming disaggregated architectures that borrows
and adapts ideas from task-based programming models, concurrent programming
techniques, and lock-free data structures. This framework includes a task-based
application programming model and a runtime system that provides scheduling,
coordination, and fault tolerance mechanisms. We present highlights of our MODC

outperforms a checkpoint-based approach in the face of failures.

Instead, the quantization distortion is characterized by the second-order

feasible useful application of near-term quantum computers. Minimizing quantum
computational resources is crucial to achieving this goal. A promising class of
algorithms for this purpose consists of variational quantum eigensolvers
(VQEs). Among these, problem-tailored versions such as ADAPT-VQE that build
variational ans\""atze step by step from a predefined operator pool perform
particularly well in terms of circuit depths and variational parameter counts.
However, this improved performance comes at the expense of an additional
measurement overhead compared to standard VQEs. Here, we show that this
overhead can be reduced to an amount that grows only linearly with the number
$n$ of qubits, instead of quartically as in the original ADAPT-VQE. We do this
by proving that operator pools of size $2n-2$ can represent any state in
Hilbert space if chosen appropriately. We prove that this is the minimal size
of such ""complete"" pools, discuss their algebraic properties, and present
necessary and sufficient conditions for their completeness that allow us to
find such pools efficiently. We further show that, if the simulated problem
possesses symmetries, then complete pools can fail to yield convergent results,
unless the pool is chosen to obey certain symmetry rules. We demonstrate the
performance of such symmetry-adapted complete pools by using them in classical
simulations of ADAPT-VQE for several strongly correlated molecules. Our
findings are relevant for any VQE that uses an ansatz based on Pauli strings.

purpose of promoting children's online safety, finding three major axes of
variation in how key restriction and monitoring features were realised:
granularity, feedback/transparency, and parent-child communications support. To
relate these axes to perceived benefits and problems, we then analysed 3264 app
reviews to identify references to aspects of the each of the axes above, to
understand children's and parents' views of how such dimensions related to
their experiences with these apps. Our findings led towards 1) an understanding
of how parental control apps realise their functionalities differently along
three axes of variation, 2) an analysis of exactly the ways that such variation
influences children's and parents' perceptions, respectively of the usefulness
or effectiveness of these apps, and finally 3) an identification of design
recommendations and opportunities for future apps by contextualising our
findings within existing digital parenting theories.

early detection of impending failure at the disk level aids in reducing system

extracting meaningful attributes associated with operational failure and of
pre-processing the highly imbalanced health statistics data for subsequent

a multi-day look back period to learn the temporal progression of health

superiority of our model under some tightly defined operational constraints.
For example, using a 15 day look back period, our approach can predict the

days before failure. This helps to alert operations maintenance well in-advance

contributing to surgical outcome enhancement and clinical risk reduction.
However, the varying issues in segmenting the different relevant instances make
the designation of a unique network quite challenging. This paper proposes a
semantic segmentation network termed as DeepPyram that can achieve superior
performance in segmenting relevant objects in cataract surgery videos with
varying issues. This superiority mainly originates from three modules: (i)
Pyramid View Fusion, which provides a varying-angle global view of the
surrounding region centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional
feature map; (ii) Deformable Pyramid Reception, which enables a wide deformable
receptive field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of
interest; and (iii) Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale
semantic feature maps. These modules can effectively boost semantic
segmentation performance, especially in the case of transparency,
deformability, scalability, and blunt edges in objects. The proposed approach
is evaluated using four datasets of cataract surgery for objects with different
contextual features and compared with thirteen state-of-the-art segmentation
networks. The experimental results confirm that DeepPyram outperforms the rival
approaches without imposing additional trainable parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study further proves the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

shared mobility, and electric vehicles, provide the most intriguing opportunity
for enabling users to better monitor transportation network conditions and make
better decisions for improving safety and transportation efficiency. However,
before connectivity and automation are deployed en masse, a thorough evaluation
of CAVs is required-ranging from numerical simulation to real-world public
roads. Assessment of the performance of CAVs in scaled testbeds has recently
gained momentum due to the flexibility they offer to conduct quick, repeatable
experiments that could go one step beyond simulation. This article introduces
the Information and Decision Science Lab's Scaled Smart City (IDS$^3$C), a 1:25
research and educational scaled robotic testbed that is capable of replicating
different real-world urban traffic scenarios. IDS$^3$C was designed to
investigate the effect of emerging mobility systems on safety and
transportation efficiency. On the educational front, IDS$^3$C can be used for
(a) training and educating graduate students by exposing them to a balanced mix
of theory and practice, (b) integrating the research outcomes into existing
courses, (c) involving undergraduate students in research, (d) creating
interactive educational demos, and (e) reaching out to high-school students. In
our exposition, we also present a real-time control framework that can be used
to coordinate CAVs at traffic scenarios such as crossing signal-free
intersections, merging at roadways and roundabouts, cruising in congested
traffic, passing through speed reduction zones, and lane-merging or passing
maneuvers. Finally, we provide a tutorial for applying our framework in
coordinating robotic CAVs to a multi-lane roundabout scenario and a
transportation corridor in IDS$^3$C.

enabling secure offloading of computation to untrusted serves. Though it
provides ideal security, FHE is expensive when executed in software, 4 to 5
orders of magnitude slower than computing on unencrypted data. These overheads
are a major barrier to FHE's widespread adoption. We present F1, the first FHE
accelerator that is programmable, i.e., capable of executing full FHE programs.
F1 builds on an in-depth architectural analysis of the characteristics of FHE
computations that reveals acceleration opportunities. F1 is a wide-vector
processor with novel functional units deeply specialized to FHE primitives,
such as modular arithmetic, number-theoretic transforms, and structured
permutations. This organization provides so much compute throughput that data
movement becomes the bottleneck. Thus, F1 is primarily designed to minimize
data movement. The F1 hardware provides an explicitly managed memory hierarchy
and mechanisms to decouple data movement from execution. A novel compiler
leverages these mechanisms to maximize reuse and schedule off-chip and on-chip
data movement. We evaluate F1 using cycle-accurate simulations and RTL
synthesis. F1 is the first system to accelerate complete FHE programs and
outperforms state-of-the-art software implementations by gmean 5400x and by up
to 17000x. These speedups counter most of FHE's overheads and enable new
applications, like real-time private deep learning in the cloud.

results in premature destruction of red blood cells. Assessment of the severity
of the disease is a challenging task in clinical routine since the causes of
broad variance in SCD manifestation despite the common genetic cause remain
unclear. Identification of the biomarkers that would predict the severity grade
is of importance for prognosis and assessment of responsiveness of patients to
therapy. Detection of the changes in red blood cell (RBC) density through
separation of Percoll density gradient could be such marker as it allows to
resolve intercellular differences and follow the most damaged dense cells prone
to destruction and vaso-occlusion. Quantification of the images obtained from
the distribution of RBCs in Percoll gradient and interpretation of the obtained
is an important prerequisite for establishment of this approach. Here, we
propose a novel approach combining a graph convolutional network, a
convolutional neural network, fast Fourier transform, and recursive feature
elimination to predict the severity of SCD directly from a Percoll image. Two
important but expensive laboratory blood test parameters measurements are used
for training the graph convolutional network. To make the model independent
from such tests during prediction, the two parameters are estimated by a neural
network from the Percoll image directly. On a cohort of 216 subjects, we
achieve a prediction performance that is only slightly below an approach where
the groundtruth laboratory measurements are used. Our proposed method is the
first computational approach for the difficult task of SCD severity prediction.
The two-step approach relies solely on inexpensive and simple blood analysis
tools and can have a significant impact on the patients' survival in
underdeveloped countries where access to medical instruments and doctors is
limited

further extension with a chiral potential and confinement effects (RMF-CC). The
parameters of the latter are controlled by fundamental properties such as the
chiral potential, Lattice-QCD predictions, the quark sub-structure, as well as
empirical properties at nuclear matter saturation. While these models are
calibrated to the same properties at saturation density, they differ in their
predictions as the density increases. We take care of parameter uncertainties
and propagate them to our predictions for symmetric nuclear matter by employing
Bayesian statistics. We show that RMF and RMF-C share common features as the
density increases, while RMF-CC behaves differently. For instance, the scalar
field at $6n_\textrm{sat}$ reaches $\sim 20$ MeV for RMF-CC while it is larger
than $\sim 70$ MeV for RMF and RMF-C. Interestingly, we also show that, by
fixing the $\rho$ coupling constant from the quark structure of the nucleon,
these three models reproduce only half of the empirical symmetry energy.

that false assignments in critical areas, such as health care workers, are more
severe than in the general population. Based on this model, we study the
optimal use of a limited number of tests to minimize the expected cost. More
specifically, we utilize information-theoretic methods to give a lower bound on

However, microbiome compositions typically display substantial cross-sample
heterogeneities in subcommunity compositions -- that is, the variability in the
proportions of microbes in shared subcommunities across samples -- which is not
accounted for in prior analyses. As a result, LDA can produce inference which
is highly sensitive to the specification of the number of subcommunities and
often divides a single subcommunity into multiple artificial ones. To address
this limitation, we incorporate the logistic-tree normal (LTN) model into LDA

defines the subcommunity. Incorporation of auxiliary P\'olya-Gamma variables

models, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then
answer why that is: Sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate
compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.
Higher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher
compression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned
absolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal
embeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding
architectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn compositionality and
cross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings
were originally designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly
useful in multilingual language models.

  Udi Wieder","Omnipredictors","35 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Loss minimization is a dominant paradigm in machine learning, where a
predictor is trained to minimize some loss function that depends on an
uncertain event (e.g., ""will it rain tomorrow?''). Different loss functions
imply different learning algorithms and, at times, very different predictors.
While widespread and appealing, a clear drawback of this approach is that the
loss function may not be known at the time of learning, requiring the algorithm
to use a best-guess loss function. We suggest a rigorous new paradigm for loss
minimization in machine learning where the loss function can be ignored at the
time of learning and only be taken into account when deciding an action.
  We introduce the notion of an (${\mathcal{L}},\mathcal{C}$)-omnipredictor,
which could be used to optimize any loss in a family ${\mathcal{L}}$. Once the
loss function is set, the outputs of the predictor can be post-processed (a
simple univariate data-independent transformation of individual predictions) to
do well compared with any hypothesis from the class $\mathcal{C}$. The post
processing is essentially what one would perform if the outputs of the
predictor were true probabilities of the uncertain events. In a sense,
omnipredictors extract all the predictive power from the class $\mathcal{C}$,
irrespective of the loss function in $\mathcal{L}$.
  We show that such ""loss-oblivious'' learning is feasible through a connection
to multicalibration, a notion introduced in the context of algorithmic
fairness. In addition, we show how multicalibration can be viewed as a solution
concept for agnostic boosting, shedding new light on past results. Finally, we
transfer our insights back to the context of algorithmic fairness by providing
omnipredictors for multi-group loss minimization.

interpreted as time-delay due to reflex motion in a wide-binary formed with an
unseen companion with expected mass larger than 1.05 $M_\odot$. The optical

is much larger than any known sdB long period binary system. That might be due
to the existence of another short period companion to the sdB star. Two optical

progress on this task by pre-trained language models and a multi-submodule
framework. However, zero-shot table, that is, the invisible table in the
training set, is currently the most critical bottleneck restricting the
application of existing approaches to real-world scenarios. Although some work
has utilized auxiliary tasks to help handle zero-shot tables, expensive extra
manual annotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose a new
approach for the zero-shot text-to-SQL task which does not rely on any
additional manual annotations. Our approach consists of two parts. First, we
propose a new model that leverages the abundant information of table content to
help establish the mapping between questions and zero-shot tables. Further, we
propose a simple but efficient meta-learning strategy to train our model. The
strategy utilizes the two-step gradient update to force the model to learn a
generalization ability towards zero-shot tables. We conduct extensive
experiments on a public open-domain text-to-SQL dataset WikiSQL and a
domain-specific dataset ESQL. Compared to existing approaches using the same
pre-trained model, our approach achieves significant improvements on both
datasets. Compared to the larger pre-trained model and the tabular-specific
pre-trained model, our approach is still competitive. More importantly, on the
zero-shot subsets of both the datasets, our approach further increases the
improvements.

By comparing with the fixed frequency, it is found that frequency modulation
has a significant enhancement effect on the number of electrons. Especially
when the frequency is small, appropriate frequency modulation enhances
multiphoton processes in pair creation, thus promoting the pair creation.
However, the number of electrons created by high frequency oscillating combined

evolution. The timing of relatively young, alluvial fan-forming rivers is
especially important, as Mars' Amazonian atmosphere is thought to have been too
thin to consistently support surface liquid water. Previous regional studies
suggested that alluvial fans formed primarily between the Early Hesperian and
the Early Amazonian. In this study, we describe how a combination of a global
impact crater database, a global geologic map, a global alluvial fan database,
and statistical models can be used to estimate the timing of alluvial fan
formation across Mars. Using our global approach and improved statistical
modeling, we find that alluvial fan formation likely persisted into the last
~2.5 Gyr, well into the Amazonian period. However, the data we analyzed was
insufficient to place constraints on the duration of alluvial fan formation.
Going forward, more crater data will enable tighter constraints on the
parameters estimated in our models and thus further inform our understanding of
Mars' climate evolution.

optimal sample complexity) by proving sharp upper and lower bounds on the
sample complexity. In the achievability proof, we demonstrate that probability
of error of the maximum likelihood estimator vanishes for sufficiently large
number of users and items, if all sufficient conditions are satisfied. On the
other hand, the converse (impossibility) proof is based on the genie-aided
maximum likelihood estimator. Under each necessary condition, we present
examples of a genie-aided estimator to prove that the probability of error does
not vanish for sufficiently large number of users and items. One important
consequence of this result is that exploiting the hierarchical structure of
social graphs yields a substantial gain in sample complexity relative to the
one that simply identifies different groups without resorting to the relational
structure across them. More specifically, we analyze the optimal sample
complexity and identify different regimes whose characteristics rely on quality
metrics of side information of the hierarchical similarity graph. Finally, we
present simulation results to corroborate our theoretical findings and show
that the characterized information-theoretic limit can be asymptotically

  Compression","7 pages, 7 figures, color",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stencil computation is an important class of scientific applications that can
be efficiently executed by graphics processing units (GPUs). Out-of-core
approach helps run large scale stencil codes that process data with sizes
larger than the limited capacity of GPU memory. However, the performance of the
GPU-based out-of-core stencil computation is always limited by the data
transfer between the CPU and GPU. Many optimizations have been explored to
reduce such data transfer, but the study on the use of on-the-fly compression
techniques is far from sufficient. In this study, we propose a method that
accelerates the GPU-based out-of-core stencil computation with on-the-fly
compression. We introduce a novel data compression approach that solves the
data dependency between two contiguous decomposed data blocks. We also modify a
widely used GPU-based compression library to support pipelining that overlaps
CPU/GPU data transfer with GPU computation. Experimental results show that the
proposed method achieved a speedup of 1.2x compared the method without
compression. Moreover, although the precision loss involved by compression
increased with the number of time steps, the precision loss was trivial up to
4,320 time steps, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method.

large number of mobile devices to collaboratively learn a model under the
coordination of a central server without sharing their raw data. Despite its
practical efficiency and effectiveness, the iterative on-device learning
process (e.g., local computations and global communications with the server)
incurs a considerable cost in terms of learning time and energy consumption,
which depends crucially on the number of selected clients and the number of
local iterations in each training round. In this paper, we analyze how to
design adaptive FL in mobile edge networks that optimally chooses these
essential control variables to minimize the total cost while ensuring
convergence. We establish the analytical relationship between the total cost
and the control variables with the convergence upper bound. To efficiently
solve the cost minimization problem, we develop a low-cost sampling-based
algorithm to learn the convergence related unknown parameters. We derive
important solution properties that effectively identify the design principles
for different optimization metrics. Practically, we evaluate our theoretical
results both in a simulated environment and on a hardware prototype.
Experimental evidence verifies our derived properties and demonstrates that our
proposed solution achieves near-optimal performance for different optimization
metrics for various datasets and heterogeneous system and statistical settings.

learning (IL) has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). However, existing communication based MAPF
solvers focus on broadcast communication, where an agent broadcasts its message
to all other or predefined agents. It is not only impractical but also leads to
redundant information that could even impair the multi-agent cooperation. A
succinct communication scheme should learn which information is relevant and
influential to each agent's decision making process. To address this problem,
we consider a request-reply scenario and propose Decision Causal Communication
(DCC), a simple yet efficient model to enable agents to select neighbors to
conduct communication during both training and execution. Specifically, a
neighbor is determined as relevant and influential only when the presence of
this neighbor causes the decision adjustment on the central agent. This
judgment is learned only based on agent's local observation and thus suitable
for decentralized execution to handle large scale problems. Empirical
evaluation in obstacle-rich environment indicates the high success rate with
low communication overhead of our method.

enhancing export earnings and promoting employment. However, coastal wetlands

opportunity and peasants income, and destroys the mangroves and coastal

in farmers price and output decisions. This study has aimed to estimate those
external environmental costs through the contingent valuation method. The
calculated environmental cost of shrimp farming is USD 13.66 per acre per year.
Findings suggest that current shrimp production and shrimp price will no longer
be optimal once the external costs are internalized. Thus alternative policy
recommendations have been proposed so that shrimp farming becomes a sustainable

several limitations: 1) its incorrect phase reconstruction degrades the
performance, 2) it limits the magnitude of masks between 0 and 1 while we
observe that 22% of time-frequency bins have ideal ratio mask values of over~1

under-explored. Our proposed system is designed to overcome these. First, we
propose to estimate phases by estimating complex ideal ratio masks (cIRMs)
where we decouple the estimation of cIRMs into magnitude and phase estimations.
Second, we extend the separation method to effectively allow the magnitude of
the mask to be larger than 1. Finally, we propose a residual UNet architecture
with up to 143 layers. Our proposed system achieves a state-of-the-art MSS

The Dam is located on the Karnafuli River at Kaptai in Rangamati District, 65
km upstream from Chittagong. It is an earth-fill or embankment dam with a
reservoir with a water storage capacity of 11,000 skm. Though the Dam's primary
purpose is to generate electricity, it became a reservoir of water used for
fishing and tourism. To find the net benefit value and estimate the
environmental costs and benefits, we considered the environmental net benefit
from 1962 to 1997. We identify the costs of Kaptai Dam, including its
establishment cost, operational costs, the costs of lives that have been lost
due to conflicts, and environmental costs, including loss of biodiversity, loss
of land uses, and loss of human displacements. Also, we assess the benefits of
electricity production, earnings from fisheries production, and gain from
tourism to Kaptai Lake. The findings show that the Dam contributes tremendous
value to Bangladesh. As a source of hydroelectricity, the Kaptai Dam is a
source of clean energy, and its value might have been worthy of this Dam
produced a significant portion of the electricity. However, providing less than
5% of the national demand for electricity followed by various external and
sensitive costs, the Dam hardly contributes to the Bangladesh economy. This
study thus recommends that Bangladesh should look for other sources of clean
energy that have no chances of eco-political conflicts.

models. Specifically, we replace the MLP module in the token-mixing step with a
novel sparse MLP (sMLP) module. For 2D image tokens, sMLP applies 1D MLP along
the axial directions and the parameters are shared among rows or columns. By
sparse connection and weight sharing, sMLP module significantly reduces the
number of model parameters and computational complexity, avoiding the common
over-fitting problem that plagues the performance of MLP-like models. When only
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, the proposed sMLPNet achieves 81.9% top-1
accuracy with only 24M parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and
vision Transformers under the same model size constraint. When scaling up to
66M parameters, sMLPNet achieves 83.4% top-1 accuracy, which is on par with the

events such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in an urban area. The
less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would
help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of
EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow
data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However,
traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn,
modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption
practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and
subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose
EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends
Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in
real time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL
agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not
only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs
in the network. This benefit has been demonstrated through comprehensive
experiments with synthetic and real-world maps. These experiments show that
EMVLight outperforms benchmark transportation engineering techniques and
existing RL-based signal control methods.

propose Ohm-GPU, a new optical network based heterogeneous memory design for
GPUs. Specifically, Ohm-GPU can expand the memory capacity by combing a set of
high-density 3D XPoint and DRAM modules as heterogeneous memory. To prevent
memory channels from throttling throughput of GPU memory system, Ohm-GPU
replaces the electrical lanes in the traditional memory channel with a
high-performance optical network. However, the hybrid memory can introduce
frequent data migrations between DRAM and 3D XPoint, which can unfortunately
occupy the memory channel and increase the optical network traffic. To prevent
the intensive data migrations from blocking normal memory services, Ohm-GPU
revises the existing memory controller and designs a new optical network
infrastructure, which enables the memory channel to serve the data migrations
and memory requests, in parallel. Our evaluation results reveal that Ohm-GPU
can improve the performance by 181% and 27%, compared to a DRAM-based GPU
memory system and the baseline optical network based heterogeneous memory

assumption is that the field is oscillating with Compton frequency and the
Compton wavelength is smaller than the horizon scale. Here, we revisit the

that the same equation for density perturbation known in the non-relativistic

DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,

crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed
algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA
achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10

nano-magnetometry for they can be placed proximate to targets. To study the
intrinsic magnetic properties, zero-field magnetometry is desirable. However,
for shallow NV centers under zero field, the strain near diamond surfaces would
cause level anti-crossing between the spin states, leading to clock transitions
whose frequencies are insensitive to magnetic signals. Furthermore, the charge
noises from the surfaces would induce extra spin decoherence and hence reduce
the magnetic sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that the relatively strong
hyperfine coupling (130 MHz) from a first-shell 13C nuclear spin can provide an
effective bias field to an NV center spin so that the clock-transition
condition is broken and the charge noises are suppressed. The hyperfine bias
enhances the dc magnetic sensitivity by a factor of 22 in our setup. With the
charge noises suppressed by the strong hyperfine field, the ac magnetometry
under zero field also reaches the limit set by decoherence due to the nuclear
spin bath. In addition, the 130 MHz splitting of the NV center spin transitions
allows relaxometry of magnetic noises simultaneously at two well-separated
frequencies (~2.870 +/- 0.065 GHz), providing (low-resolution) spectral
information of high-frequency noises under zero field. The hyperfine-bias
enhanced zero-field magnetometry can be combined with dynamical decoupling to
enhance single-molecule magnetic resonance spectroscopy and to improve the

gradients to the server for aggregation. The server updates its global user
model with the aggregated gradients, and further updates its news model to
infer updated news representations. Since the local gradients may contain
private information, we propose a secure aggregation method to aggregate
gradients in a privacy-preserving way. Experiments on two real-world datasets
show that our method can reduce the computation and communication cost on
clients while keep promising model performance.

calculus to determine convergence for a series of positive terms. Its range of

However, it admits an inconclusive case when the limiting ratio of the terms
equals 1. Several series tests like Raabe's and Gauss' Tests have been proposed
in order to address this case. These tests were also generalized by Kummer
through Kummer's Test. More recently, a Second Ratio Test was constructed that
similarly possessed an inconclusive case. This article will present a survey of
existing series tests. Secondly, it will introduce an extension of Raabe's Test

that the chiral atom-waveguide couplings enable nonreciprocal, reflectionless,

intriguing interference effects to the scattering behaviors, such as
ultra-narrow scattering windows. The chiral giant-atom model exhibits quite

representations for the discretizations of non-local operators such as those

in both memory and operator application makes them particularly suited for
large-scale problems. As a result, there is a need for software that provides

problems to be represented. In this paper, we present high-performance,
distributed-memory GPU-accelerated algorithms and implementations for
matrix-vector multiplication and matrix recompression of hierarchical matrices
in the $\mathcal{H}^2$ format.
  The algorithms are a new module of H2Opus, a performance-oriented package
that supports a broad variety of $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix operations on CPUs and
GPUs. Performance in the distributed GPU setting is achieved by marshaling the
tree data of the hierarchical matrix representation to allow batched kernels to
be executed on the individual GPUs. MPI is used for inter-process
communication. We optimize the communication data volume and hide much of the
communication cost with local compute phases of the algorithms. Results show
near-ideal scalability up to 1024 NVIDIA V100 GPUs on Summit, with performance
exceeding 2.3 Tflop/s/GPU for the matrix-vector multiplication, and 670
Gflops/s/GPU for matrix compression, which involves batched QR and SVD
operations.
  We illustrate the flexibility and efficiency of the library by solving a 2D
variable diffusivity integral fractional diffusion problem with an algebraic
multigrid-preconditioned Krylov solver and demonstrate scalability up to 16M
degrees of freedom problems on 64 GPUs.

so-called sliding-mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law
that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given
sliding surface. Here, dynamics becomes completely independent of the model
parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we
study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural
constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values
only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also non perfectly
known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between
two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient
conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of
time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary
state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is
only apparently confined to the linear setting and allows also to study an
important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to
epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people
and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. For popular
epidemiological models we prove the global convergence of control schemes based
on the introduction of severe restrictions, like lockdowns, to contain
epidemic. This greatly generalizes previous results obtained in the literature
by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.

This information is then encoded and compressed into the channel of the

it works as a receiver, exhibiting a single-channel and replacing the

semimetals. Different from such picture, here we show that, a unique mechanism
of the chiral anomaly exists in Weyl semimetals by injecting a spin current
with parallel spin polarization and flow direction. The existence of such a
chiral anomaly is protected by the topological feature that each Weyl cone can
also be a source or drain of the spin field in the momentum space. It leads to
measurable experimental signals, such as an electric charge current parallel
with an applied magnetic field in the absence of the electric field, and a
sharp peak at certain resonant frequency in the injection current in achiral
Weyl semimetals through the circular photogalvanic effect. Our work shows that
the topological implication of Weyl semimetals goes beyond the link with
relativistic Weyl Fermions, and offers a promising scenario to examine the
interplay between topology and spin.

reduce the false-alarms generated by the downstream classifier by 67.9%, and
also simultaneously boosts its accuracy by 11.3%. This is significant not only
because the gains achieved are unparalleled but also because the features used
were never considered rich enough to train a classifier on; and hence no decent
performance could ever be reported by any malware classification system

DRo mechanism claims a dominant position amongst all known systems that aims to
enhance the classification performance of deep learning models with

the ability of a system to keep some secret information from an intruder. In
discrete-event systems, based on a standard setting in which an intruder has
the complete knowledge of the system's structure, the standard versions of
current-state opacity and initial-state opacity cannot perfectly characterize
high-level privacy requirements. To overcome such a limitation, in this paper
we propose two stronger versions of opacity in partially-observed
discrete-event systems, called \emph{strong current-state opacity} and
\emph{strong initial-state opacity}. Strong current-state opacity describes
that an intruder never makes for sure whether a system is in a secret state at
the current time, that is, if a system satisfies this property, then for each
run of the system ended by a secret state, there exists a non-secret run whose
observation is the same as that of the previous run. Strong initial-state
opacity captures that the visit of a secret state at the initial time cannot be
inferred by an intruder at any instant. Specifically, a system is said to be
strongly initial-state opaque if for each run starting from a secret state,
there exists a non-secret run of the system that has the same observation as
the previous run has. To verify these two properties, we propose two
information structures using a novel concurrent-composition technique, which
has exponential-time complexity
$O(|X|^4|\Sigma_o||\Sigma_{uo}||\Sigma|2^{|X|})$, where $|X|$ (resp.,

existing storage technologies are approaching their theoretical and functional
limits in terms of density and energy consumption, making DNA based storage a
potential solution for the future of data storage. Several studies introduced
DNA based storage systems with high information density (petabytes/gram).
However, DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies yield erroneous outputs.
Algorithmic approaches for correcting these errors depend on reading multiple
copies of each sequence and result in excessive reading costs. The
unprecedented success of Transformers as a deep learning architecture for
language modeling has led to its repurposing for solving a variety of tasks
across various domains. In this work, we propose a novel approach for
single-read reconstruction using an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture
for DNA based data storage. We address the error correction process as a
self-supervised sequence-to-sequence task and use synthetic noise injection to
train the model using only the decoded reads. Our approach exploits the
inherent redundancy of each decoded file to learn its underlying structure. To
demonstrate our proposed approach, we encode text, image and code-script files
to DNA, produce errors with high-fidelity error simulator, and reconstruct the
original files from the noisy reads. Our model achieves lower error rates when
reconstructing the original data from a single read of each DNA strand compared
to state-of-the-art algorithms using 2-3 copies. This is the first
demonstration of using deep learning models for single-read reconstruction in
DNA based storage which allows for the reduction of the overall cost of the
process. We show that this approach is applicable for various domains and can
be generalized to new domains as well.

The contribution of this paper mainly has the following three aspects: 1) A
novel Multi-branch Attention (MA) block. The spatial attention mechanism better
reconstructs high-frequency features, and the channel attention mechanism
treats the features of different channels differently. Multi-branch structure
dramatically improves the representation ability of the model and can be
changed into a single path structure after re-parameterization to speed up the
process of inference. Local Residual Connection allows the low-frequency
information in the nonhomogeneous area to pass through the block without
processing so that the block can focus on detailed features. 2) A lightweight
network structure. We use cascaded MA blocks to extract high-frequency features
step by step, and the Multi-layer attention fusion tail combines the shallow
and deep features of the model to get the residual of the clean image finally.

power in the low multipole moments of the angular power spectrum, C_ell. Their
origin is still debated, however, due to a persistent lack of clarity
concerning the seeding of quantum fluctuations in the early Universe. A likely
explanation for the first of these appears to be a cutoff, k_min=(3.14 +/-
0.36) x 10^{-4} Mpc^{-1}, in the primordial power spectrum, P(k). Our goal in
this paper is twofold: (1) we examine whether the same k_min can also
self-consistently explain the missing power at large angles, and (2) we confirm
that the of this cutoff in P(k) does not adversely affect the remarkable
consistency between the prediction of Planck-LCDM and the Planck measurements
at ell > 30. We use the publicly available code CAMB to calculate the angular
power spectrum, based on a line-of-sight approach. The code is modified
slightly to include the additional parameter (i.e., k_min) characterizing the
primordial power spectrum. In addition to this cutoff, the code optimizes all
of the usual standard-model parameters. In fitting the angular power spectrum,
we find an optimized cutoff, k_min = 2.04^{+1.4}_{-0.79} x 10^{-4} Mpc^{-1},
when using the whole range of ell's, and k_min=3.3^{+1.7}_{-1.3} x 10^{-4}
Mpc^{-1}, when fitting only the range ell < 30, where the Sachs-Wolfe effect is
dominant. These are fully consistent with the value inferred from C(theta),
suggesting that both of these large-angle anomalies may be due to the same
truncation in P(k).

in a series of cranio-facial anomalies, and behavioral and neurocognitive
problems. Current diagnosis of FAS is typically done by identifying a set of
facial characteristics, which are often obtained by manual examination.
Anatomical landmark detection, which provides rich geometric information, is
important to detect the presence of FAS associated facial anomalies. This
imaging application is characterized by large variations in data appearance and
limited availability of labeled data. Current deep learning-based heatmap
regression methods designed for facial landmark detection in natural images
assume availability of large datasets and are therefore not wellsuited for this
application. To address this restriction, we develop a new regularized transfer
learning approach that exploits the knowledge of a network learned on large
facial recognition datasets. In contrast to standard transfer learning which
focuses on adjusting the pre-trained weights, the proposed learning approach
regularizes the model behavior. It explicitly reuses the rich visual semantics
of a domain-similar source model on the target task data as an additional
supervisory signal for regularizing landmark detection optimization.
Specifically, we develop four regularization constraints for the proposed
transfer learning, including constraining the feature outputs from
classification and intermediate layers, as well as matching activation
attention maps in both spatial and channel levels. Experimental evaluation on a
collected clinical imaging dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can
effectively improve model generalizability under limited training samples, and
is advantageous to other approaches in the literature.

base to generate appropriate responses. In real-world scenario, the entity may
not be included by the knowledge base or suffer from the precision of knowledge
retrieval. To deal with this problem, instead of introducing knowledge base as
the input, we force the model to learn a better semantic representation by
predicting the information in the knowledge base, only based on the input
context. Specifically, with the help of a knowledge base, we introduce two
auxiliary training objectives: 1) Interpret Masked Word, which conjectures the
meaning of the masked entity given the context; 2) Hypernym Generation, which
predicts the hypernym of the entity based on the context. Experiment results on
two dialogue corpus verify the effectiveness of our methods under both

ArtiBoost, a lightweight online data enhancement method. ArtiBoost can cover
diverse hand-object poses and camera viewpoints through sampling in a
Composited hand-object Configuration and Viewpoint space (CCV-space) and can
adaptively enrich the current hard-discernable items by loss-feedback and
sample re-weighting. ArtiBoost alternatively performs data exploration and
synthesis within a learning pipeline, and those synthetic data are blended into
real-world source data for training. We apply ArtiBoost on a simple learning

  Hybrid Action Representation","Accepted on ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrete-continuous hybrid action space is a natural setting in many
practical problems, such as robot control and game AI. However, most previous
Reinforcement Learning (RL) works only demonstrate the success in controlling
with either discrete or continuous action space, while seldom take into account
the hybrid action space. One naive way to address hybrid action RL is to
convert the hybrid action space into a unified homogeneous action space by
discretization or continualization, so that conventional RL algorithms can be
applied. However, this ignores the underlying structure of hybrid action space
and also induces the scalability issue and additional approximation
difficulties, thus leading to degenerated results. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Action Representation (HyAR) to learn a compact and decodable latent
representation space for the original hybrid action space. HyAR constructs the
latent space and embeds the dependence between discrete action and continuous
parameter via an embedding table and conditional Variantional Auto-Encoder
(VAE). To further improve the effectiveness, the action representation is
trained to be semantically smooth through unsupervised environmental dynamics
prediction. Finally, the agent then learns its policy with conventional DRL
algorithms in the learned representation space and interacts with the
environment by decoding the hybrid action embeddings to the original action
space. We evaluate HyAR in a variety of environments with discrete-continuous
action space. The results demonstrate the superiority of HyAR when compared
with previous baselines, especially for high-dimensional action spaces.

of smart cities. This task is challenging because of many essential factors,
such as cooperation among neighboring intersections and dynamic traffic
scenarios. First, to facilitate cooperation of traffic signals, existing work
adopts graph neural networks to incorporate the temporal and spatial influences
of the surrounding intersections into the target intersection, where
spatial-temporal information is used separately. However, one drawback of these
methods is that the spatial-temporal correlations are not adequately exploited
to obtain a better control scheme. Second, in a dynamic traffic environment,
the historical state of the intersection is also critical for predicting future
signal switching. Previous work mainly solves this problem using the current
intersection's state, neglecting the fact that traffic flow is continuously
changing both spatially and temporally and does not handle the historical
state.
  In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework named DynSTGAT,
which integrates dynamic historical state into a new spatial-temporal graph
attention network to address the above two problems. More specifically, our
DynSTGAT model employs a novel multi-head graph attention mechanism, which aims
to adequately exploit the joint relations of spatial-temporal information.
Then, to efficiently utilize the historical state information of the
intersection, we design a sequence model with the temporal convolutional
network (TCN) to capture the historical information and further merge it with
the spatial information to improve its performance. Extensive experiments
conducted in the multi-intersection scenario on synthetic data and real-world
data confirm that our method can achieve superior performance in travel time
and throughput against the state-of-the-art methods.

anomaly detections. Recently, the visual attention mechanism has become a
promising way to improve the performance of CNNs for some computer vision
tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Layer-wise External
Attention Network (LEA-Net) for efficient image anomaly detection. The core
idea relies on the integration of unsupervised and supervised anomaly detectors
via the visual attention mechanism. Our strategy is as follows: (i) Prior
knowledge about anomalies is represented as the anomaly map generated by
unsupervised learning of normal instances, (ii) The anomaly map is translated
to an attention map by the external network, (iii) The attention map is then
incorporated into intermediate layers of the anomaly detection network.
Notably, this layer-wise external attention can be applied to any CNN model in
an end-to-end training manner. For a pilot study, we validate LEA-Net on color
anomaly detection tasks. Through extensive experiments on PlantVillage, MVTec
AD, and Cloud datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise visual

existing CNN model, even on imbalanced datasets. Moreover, we show that our
attention mechanism successfully boosts the performance of several CNN models.

provides a linear matrix inequality criterium for dissipativity, via the
Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) inequality. The BRL has many applications, among
others in H-infinity control. Extensions to infinite dimensional systems,
although already present in the work of Yakubovich, have only been studied
systematically in the last few decades. In this context various notions of
stability, observability and controllability exist, and depending on the
hypothesis one may have to allow the KYP-inequality to have unbounded solutions
which forces one to consider the KYP-inequality in a spatial form. In the
present paper we consider the BRL for continuous time, infinite dimensional,
linear well-posed systems. Via an adaptation of Willems' storage function
approach we present a unified way to address both the standard and strict forms
of the BRL. We avoid making use of the Cayley transform and work only in
continuous time. While for the standard bounded real lemma, we obtain analogous
results as there exist for the discrete time case, when treating the strict
case additional conditions are required, at least at this stage. This might be
caused by the fact that the Cayley transform does not preserve exponential
stability, an important property in the strict case, when transferring a
continuous-time system to a discrete-time system.

investigate the influence of dust scattering on the light curves and
polarizations of SNe Ia. A Monte Carlo method is constructed to numerically
solve the process of radiative transfer through the CSM. Three types of
geometric distributions of the CSM are considered: spherical shell,
axisymmetric disk, and axisymmetric shell. We show that both the distance of
the dust from the SN and the geometric distribution of the dust affect the

the hypothetical circumstellar dust may not be reliably constrained based on

ranging from image classification to real-time object detection. As DNN models
become more sophisticated, the computational cost of training these models
becomes a burden. For this reason, outsourcing the training process has been
the go-to option for many DNN users. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of
vulnerability to backdoor attacks. These attacks aim to establish hidden
backdoors in the DNN so that it performs well on clean samples, but outputs a
particular target label when a trigger is applied to the input. Existing
backdoor attacks either generate triggers in the spatial domain or naively
poison frequencies in the Fourier domain. In this work, we propose a pipeline
based on Fourier heatmaps to generate a spatially dynamic and invisible
backdoor attack in the frequency domain. The proposed attack is extensively
evaluated on various datasets and network architectures. Unlike most existing
backdoor attacks, the proposed attack can achieve high attack success rates
with low poisoning rates and little to no drop in performance while remaining
imperceptible to the human eye. Moreover, we show that the models poisoned by
our attack are resistant to various state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses, so we
contribute two possible defenses that can evade the attack.

  In this work, we establish the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of
the multiparameter persistent Betti numbers in growing domains. Our asymptotic
results are established for a general framework encompassing both the marked

leads to high variance. Several attempts have been made to improve the
bias-variance trade-off using auxiliary information. In particular, document
modeling-based methods have improved the model's accuracy by using textual data
such as reviews, abstracts, and storylines when the user-to-item rating matrix
is sparse. However, such models are insufficient to learn optimal
representation for users and items. User-based and item-based collaborative
filtering, owing to their efficiency and interpretability, have been long used
for building recommender systems. They create a profile for each user and item
respectively as their historically interacted items and the users who
interacted with the target item.
  This work combines these two approaches with document context-aware
recommender systems by considering users' opinions on these items. Another
advantage of our model is that it supports online personalization. If a user
has new interactions, it needs to refresh the user and item history
representation vectors instead of updating model parameters. The proposed
algorithm is implemented and tested on three real-world datasets that
demonstrate our model's effectiveness over the baseline methods.

cycle-averaged stresses. Using ideas from the Wyart and Cates modeling

this molecular picture does not hold for architecturally semiflexible block

Moreover, the semiflexible bottlebrush widens the regime for cylinder
morphology that is associated with the volume fraction of the end blocks

flavors, where quantum and thermal fluctuations are suppressed, two distinct
regimes in the $(T,\mu)$ phase diagram, characterized by qualitatively
different behavior of the two-point functions of the condensate fields. More
surprisingly, at $N_\mathrm{f}=2$, where fluctuations are no longer suppressed,
the model still behaves similarly to the $N_\mathrm{f}\to\infty$ model and we
conclude that the chiral spiral leaves its footprints even on systems with a
small number of flavors. For example, at low temperature the two-point
functions are still dominated by chiral spirals with pitches proportional to
the inverse chemical potential, although in contrast to large-$N_\mathrm{f}$
their amplitudes decrease with distance. We argue that these results should not
be interpreted as the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry, which is
forbidden in two dimensions. Finally, using Dyson-Schwinger equations we
calculate the decay of the U$_A$(1)-invariant fermion four-point function in
search for a BKT phase at zero temperature.

natural language understanding. Recent neural approaches to event temporal

However, embeddings in the Euclidean space cannot capture richer asymmetric
relations such as event temporal relations. We thus propose to embed events
into hyperbolic spaces, which are intrinsically oriented at modeling
hierarchical structures. We introduce two approaches to encode events and their
temporal relations in hyperbolic spaces. One approach leverages hyperbolic
embeddings to directly infer event relations through simple geometrical
operations. In the second one, we devise an end-to-end architecture composed of
hyperbolic neural units tailored for the temporal relation extraction task.
Thorough experimental assessments on widely used datasets have shown the
benefits of revisiting the tasks on a different geometrical space, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance on several standard metrics. Finally, the ablation
study and several qualitative analyses highlighted the rich event semantics

scale confining geometries and in the presence of very small-scale surface
roughness. Here we consider an intermediate case of how a simple microswimmer,
the tangential spherical squirmer, behaves adjacent to singly- and
doubly-periodic sinusoidal surface topographies that spatially oscillate with
an amplitude that is an order of magnitude less than the swimmer size and
wavelengths within an order of magnitude of this scale. The nearest neighbour
regularised Stokeslet method is used for numerical explorations after
validating its accuracy for a spherical tangential squirmer that swims stably
near a flat surface. The same squirmer is then introduced to the different
surface topographies. The key governing factor in the resulting swimming
behaviour is the size of the squirmer relative to the surface topography
wavelength. When the squirmer is much larger, or much smaller, than the surface
topography wavelength then directional guidance is not observed. Once the
squirmer size is on the scale of the topography wavelength limited guidance is
possible, often with local capture in the topography troughs. However, complex
dynamics can also emerge, especially when the initial configuration is not
close to alignment along topography troughs or above topography crests. In
contrast to sensitivity in alignment and the topography wavelength, reductions
in the amplitude of the surface topography or variations in the shape of the
periodic surface topography do not have extensive impacts on the squirmer
behaviour. Our findings more generally highlight that detailed numerical
explorations are necessary to determine how surface topographies may interact
with a given swimmer that swims stably near a flat surface and whether surface
topographies may be designed to provide such swimmers with directional
guidance.

information contained in visual data can be divided into person information

The main challenge stems from the fact that optimal link scheduling involves

NP-hard. In practical schedulers, centralized and distributed greedy heuristics
are commonly used to approximately solve the MWIS problem. However, most of
these greedy heuristics ignore important topological information of the
wireless network. To overcome this limitation, we propose fast heuristics based
on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that can be implemented in centralized
and distributed manners. Our centralized heuristic is based on tree search
guided by a GCN and 1-step rollout. In our distributed MWIS solver, a GCN
generates topology-aware node embeddings that are combined with per-link
utilities before invoking a distributed greedy solver. Moreover, a novel
reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train the GCN in a
non-differentiable pipeline. Test results on medium-sized wireless networks
show that our centralized heuristic can reach a near-optimal solution quickly,
and our distributed heuristic based on a shallow GCN can reduce by nearly half
the suboptimality gap of the distributed greedy solver with minimal increase in
complexity. The proposed schedulers also exhibit good generalizability across

privacy-focused exchange of information between doctors, patients, and
pharmacies through verifiable credentials with a token-based, anonymized

information into an image, is used in fields such as property rights

techniques, but it still has two drawbacks: it is vulnerable to cropping and is
hard to train. We found that the causes of vulnerability to cropping is not the
loss of information on the edge, but the movement of watermark position. By
explicitly introducing the perturbation of cropping into the training, the
cropping resistance is significantly improved. For the problem of difficult
training, we introduce instance normalization to solve the vanishing gradient,
set losses' weights as learnable parameters to reduce the number of

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2006.12392",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Insects, such as fruit flies and honey bees, can solve simple associative
learning tasks and learn abstract concepts such as ""sameness"" and ""difference"",
which is viewed as a higher-order cognitive function and typically thought to
depend on top-down neocortical processing. Empirical research with fruit flies
strongly supports that a randomized representational architecture is used in
olfactory processing in insect brains. Based on these results, we propose a
Randomly Weighted Feature Network (RWFN) that incorporates randomly drawn,
untrained weights in an encoder that uses an adapted linear model as a decoder.
The randomized projections between input neurons and higher-order processing
centers in the input brain is mimicked in RWFN by a single-hidden-layer neural
network that specially structures latent representations in the hidden layer
using random Fourier features that better represent complex relationships
between inputs using kernel approximation. Because of this special
representation, RWFNs can effectively learn the degree of relationship among
inputs by training only a linear decoder model. We compare the performance of
RWFNs to LTNs for Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) tasks that have been used
as a representative example of how LTNs utilize reasoning over first-order
logic to surpass the performance of solely data-driven methods. We demonstrate
that compared to LTNs, RWFNs can achieve better or similar performance for both
object classification and detection of the part-of relations between objects in
SII tasks while using much far fewer learnable parameters (1:62 ratio) and a
faster learning process (1:2 ratio of running speed). Furthermore, we show that
because the randomized weights do not depend on the data, several decoders can
share a single randomized encoder, giving RWFNs a unique economy of spatial
scale for simultaneous classification tasks.

are under a high amount of stress due to continuous deadlines and, often,
over-commitment. Objective. This study investigates the effects of a
neuroplasticity practice, a specific breathing practice, on the attention
awareness, well-being, perceived productivity, and self-efficacy of computer
workers. Method. We created a questionnaire mainly from existing, validated
scales as entry and exit survey for data points for comparison before and after
the intervention. The intervention was a 12-week program with a weekly live
session that included a talk on a well-being topic and a facilitated group
breathing session. During the intervention period, we solicited one daily
journal note and one weekly well-being rating. We replicated the intervention
in a similarly structured 8-week program. The data was analyzed using a
Bayesian multi-level model for the quantitative part and thematic analysis for
the qualitative part. Results. The intervention showed improvements in
participants' experienced inner states despite an ongoing pandemic and intense
outer circumstances for most. Over the course of the study, we found an
improvement in the participants' ratings of how often they found themselves in
good spirits as well as in a calm and relaxed state. We also aggregate a large
number of deep inner reflections and growth processes that may not have
surfaced for the participants without deliberate engagement in such a program.
Conclusion. The data indicates usefulness and effectiveness of an intervention
for computer workers in terms of increasing well-being and resilience. Everyone
needs a way to deliberately relax, unplug, and recover. Breathing practice is a
simple way to do so, and the results call for establishing a larger body of
work to make this common practice.

rates of coherent transponders are increased to 100 Gbaud and beyond,
maintaining a high SPRR in a cost-effective manner becomes more and more
challenging. One potential approach for solving this problem is to leverage the
concept of single-ended coherent receiver (SER) where single-ended PDs are used
instead of the balanced PDs. In this case, the resulting SSBI should be
mitigated in the digital domain. In this paper, we show that SSBI can be
effectively mitigated using various low-complexity techniques, such as the
direct filed reconstruction (DFR), clipped iterative SSBI cancellation (CIC)
and gradient decent (GD). In addition, we present a self-calibration technique
for SERs which can be extended for characterizing the optical-to-electrical
