some variation of the patterns between images. We demonstrate this new method

enables addressing different levels of deep features. On the other hand,
attention mechanism promotes the decoder in the UNet structure to focus on the

individualized decision making. Given data with individual covariates,
treatment assignments and outcomes, researchers can search for the optimal
individualized treatment rule (ITR) that maximizes the expected outcome.
Existing methods typically require initial estimation of some nuisance models.
The double robustness property that can protect from misspecification of either
the treatment-free effect or the propensity score has been widely advocated.
However, when model misspecification exists, a doubly robust estimate can be
consistent but may suffer from downgraded efficiency. Other than potential
misspecified nuisance models, most existing methods do not account for the
potential problem when the variance of outcome is heterogeneous among
covariates and treatment. We observe that such heteroscedasticity can greatly
affect the estimation efficiency of the optimal ITR. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the consequences of misspecified treatment-free effect and
heteroscedasticity can be unified as a covariate-treatment dependent variance
of residuals. To improve efficiency of the estimated ITR, we propose an
Efficient Learning (E-Learning) framework for finding an optimal ITR in the
multi-armed treatment setting. We show that the proposed E-Learning is optimal
among a regular class of semiparametric estimates that can allow treatment-free
effect misspecification. In our simulation study, E-Learning demonstrates its
effectiveness if one of or both misspecified treatment-free effect and
heteroscedasticity exist. Our analysis of a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)

Motivated by the connection to risk measures in finance, which is formalized in
this framework, we also derive closed-form formulas for mean-tail-dose and
demonstrate its capability of reducing extreme dose values in tail

head-and-neck patient case show that the direct optimization of dose-volume
histogram metrics produced marginally better results than or outperformed
conventional planning objectives in terms of clinical goal fulfilment, control
of low- and high-dose tails of target distributions and general plan quality
defined by a pre-specified evaluation measure. The proposed framework
eliminates the disconnect between optimization functions and evaluation metrics
and may thus reduce the need for repetitive user interaction associated with
conventional treatment planning. The method also has the potential of enhancing
plan optimization in other settings such as multicriteria optimization and

This nature brings challenges to introducing commonsense in general text

continuing pre-training over the commonsense corpus. However, it will cause
catastrophic forgetting to the downstream task due to the domain discrepancy.
In addition, previous methods of directly using textual descriptions as extra

similar to the standard Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy's spectra, with the
presence of multi-phase absorption structure composed of three phases, whose

causal inference because they can balance all potential confounding on average.
However, they may suffer from unbalanced covariates for realized treatment
assignments. Rerandomization, a design that rerandomizes the treatment
assignment until a prespecified covariate balance criterion is met, has
recently got attention due to its easy implementation, improved covariate
balance and more efficient inference. Researchers have then suggested to use
the treatment assignments that minimize the covariate imbalance, namely the
optimally balanced design. This has caused again the long-time controversy
between two philosophies for designing experiments: randomization versus
optimal and thus almost deterministic designs. Existing literature argued that
rerandomization with overly balanced observed covariates can lead to highly
imbalanced unobserved covariates, making it vulnerable to model
misspecification. On the contrary, rerandomization with properly balanced
covariates can provide robust inference for treatment effects while sacrificing
some efficiency compared to the ideally optimal design. In this paper, we show
it is possible that, by making the covariate imbalance diminishing at a proper
rate as the sample size increases, rerandomization can achieve its ideally
optimal precision that one can expect with perfectly balanced covariates, while
still maintaining its robustness. We further investigate conditions on the
number of covariates for achieving the desired optimality. Our results rely on
a more delicate asymptotic analysis for rerandomization. The derived theory for
rerandomization provides a deeper understanding of its large-sample property
and can better guide its practical implementation. Furthermore, it also helps
reconcile the controversy between randomized and optimal designs in an
asymptotic sense.

Susceptibility data in small fields of about 1~T reveal an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) order for $H \perp c$, whereas for $H \parallel c$ the data are
reminiscent of a field-induced ferromagnetic (FM) structure. At low
temperatures and for $H \perp c$, the field-dependent magnetization and AC
susceptibility data evidence a metamagnetic transition at $H^+ = 5$~T, which is
absent for $H \parallel c$. We assign this to a transition from a planar
cycloidal spin structure at low fields to a planar fan-like arrangement above
$H^+$. A fully FM polarized state is obtained above the saturation field of
$H_{\perp S} = 23.7$~T at 2~K with a magnetization of $M_s = 2.8$~$\mu_{\rm
B}{\rm /Cr}$. For $H \parallel c$, $M(H)$ monotonously increases and saturates
at the same $M_s$ value at $H_{\parallel S} = 25.1$~T at 4.2~K. Above $T_N $,
the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat indicate signatures of two
dimensional (2D) frustration related to the presence of planar ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We found a pronounced nearly
isotropic maximum in both properties at about $T^* = 45$~K, which is a clear
fingerprint of short-range correlations and emergent spin fluctuations.
Calculations based on a planar 2D Heisenberg model support our experimental
findings and suggest a predominant FM exchange among nearest and AFM exchange
among third-nearest neighbors. Only a minor contribution might be assigned to
the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction possible related to the
non-centrosymmetric polar space group $R3m$. Due to these competing
interactions, the magnetism in AgCrSe$_{2}$, in contrast to the oxygen based
delafossites, can be tuned by relatively small, experimentally accessible,
magnetic fields, allowing us to establish the complete anisotropic magnetic
$H-T$ phase diagram in detail.

of improvement in old-age mortality not captured by existing models. In this
paper we show how the concept of frailty can be used to model both changing
rates of improvement and the deceleration of mortality at old ages, also seen
in data.
  We present a ""fragilization"" method by which frailty can be added to standard
mortality models. The aim is to improve the modeling and forecasting of old-age
mortality while preserving the structure of the original model and the
underlying stochastic processes. Estimation is based on a general
pseudo-likelihood approach which allows the use of essentially any frailty
distribution and mortality model. We also consider a class of generalized
stochastic frailty models with both frailty and non-frailty terms, and we
describe how these models can be estimated by the EM-algorithm.

approach for estimating the effective reproduction number based on death counts

hierarchical model incorporates splines to estimate reproduction numbers
flexibly over time while adjusting for varying effective infection fatality
rates. The approach also provides estimates of dark figures regarding
undetected infections over time. Results for Germany illustrate that estimated
reproduction numbers based on death counts are often similar to classical
estimates based on confirmed cases. However, considering death counts proves to
be more robust against shifts in testing policies: during the second wave of
infections, classical estimation of the reproduction number suggests a
flattening/ decreasing trend of infections following the ""lockdown light"" in
November 2020, while our results indicate that true numbers of infections
continued to rise until the ""second lockdown"" in December 2020. This
observation is associated with more stringent testing criteria introduced
concurrently with the ""lockdown light"", which is reflected in subsequently
increasing dark figures of infections estimated by our model. These findings
illustrate that the retrospective viewpoint can provide additional insights
regarding the course of the pandemic. In light of progressive vaccinations,
shifting the focus from modelling confirmed cases to reported deaths with the
possibility to incorporate effective infection fatality rates might be of
increasing relevance for the future surveillance of the pandemic.

then consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games

$r$-approximation with $O(\log{n})$ space. On the other hand, via our
communication lower bound we show that every streaming algorithm in the

$\Omega(n^{1-2/t})$ quantum space. This generalizes the seminal work of
Kapralov, Khanna, Sudan (SODA'15), and expand to the quantum setting results

an encoding of $x$ into a codeword in such a way that one can recover an
arbitrary $x_i$ (with probability at least $1/r+\varepsilon$) by making a few
queries to a corrupted codeword. The main question here is the trade-off
between $N$ and $n$. Via hypercontractivity, we give an exponential lower bound
$N= 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^4 n/r^4)}$ for $2$-query (possibly non-linear)
$\mathsf{LDC}$s over $\mathbb{Z}_r$ and using the non-commutative Khintchine
inequality we improved our bound to $N= 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^2 n/r^2)}$.

the mixing effect of an electric field on the states of the two diatomic

superconductors (SC) and soft ferromagnetic materials (SFM), is root for
progressing onto the application of SC-SFM metastructures in scenarios such as
magnetic cloaking, magnetic shielding, and power transmission systems. However,
in the latter some intriguing and yet unexplained phenomena occurred, such as a
noticeable rise in the SC energy losses, and a local but not isotropic
deformation of its magnetic flux density. These phenomena, which are in
apparent contradiction with the most fundamental theory of electromagnetism for
superconductivity, i.e., the critical state theory (CST), have remained
unexplained for about 20 years, given place to the acceptance of the
controversial and yet paradigmatic existence of the so-called overcritical
current densities. Therefore, aimed to resolve these long-standing problems, we
extended the CST by incorporating a semi-analytical model for cylindrical
monocore SC-SFM heterostructures, setting the standards for its validation with
a variational approach of multipole functionals for the magnetic coupling
between Sc and SFM materials. It is accompanied by a comprehensive numerical
study for SFM sheaths of arbitrary dimensions and magnetic relative
permeabilities $\mu_{r}$, ranging from $\mu_{r}=5$ (NiZn ferrites) to
$\mu_{r}=350000$ (pure Iron), showing how the AC-losses of the SC-SFM
metastructure radically changes as a function of the SC and the SFM radius for
$\mu_{r} \geq 100$. Our numerical technique and simulations revealed also a
good qualitative agreement with the magneto optical imaging observations that
were questioning the CST validness, proving therefore that the reported
phenomena for self-field SC-SFM heterostructures can be understood without
including the ansatz of overcritical currents.

observed for eigenstates close to the critical energy of the excited-state

crossing is accompanied by a superposition of the pair of classical
trajectories in the Husimi functions of eigenstates. This superposition yields
an enhancement of dynamical tunneling, which is observed by considering initial
Bloch states that evolve partially into the partner region of the paired
classical trajectories, thus breaking the quantum-classical correspondence in
the evolution of observables.

hyperparameters are known, which does not apply in general. To mitigate this,
we introduce robust Gaussian process uniform error bounds in settings with

the model error of a Gaussian process with arbitrary hyperparameters. We do not
require to know any bounds for the hyperparameters a priori, which is an
assumption commonly found in related work. Instead, we are able to derive
bounds from data in an intuitive fashion. We additionally employ the proposed
technique to derive performance guarantees for a class of learning-based

majority display a compact radio morphology and are consistent with either
low-power compact radio sources (""FR0"" galaxies) or ""radio-quiet quasars"". They

layered phase, and the second from the layered phase to a sublattice-ordered
phase. In the layered phase, the system breaks up into disjoint slabs of
thickness two along one spontaneously chosen cartesian direction. Plates with
normals perpendicular to this layering direction are preferentially contained
entirely within these slabs, while plates straddling two successive slabs have
a lower density. Additionally the symmetry between the three types of plates is
spontaneously broken, as plates with normal along the layering direction have a
lower density than the other two types of plates. Intriguingly, the occupied
slabs exhibit two-dimensional power-law columnar order even in the presence of
a nonzero density of vacancies. In contrast, inter-slab correlations of the

separation between the slabs. In the sublattice-ordered phase, there is
two-fold ($Z_2$) breaking of lattice translation symmetry along all three

good proxies for the global shapes of galaxies and we find that, ignoring
central cores, propols and Sersic profiles are indistinguishable within
observational errors (within 5 % over 5 orders of magnitude in surface
density). The range of physically meaningful polytropes yields Sersic indexes
between 0.4 and 6. The code has been systematically applied to ~750 galaxies

types and stellar masses (7 < log (Mstar/Msun) < 12). The propol fits are
systematically better than Sersic profiles when log(Mstar/Msun) < 9 and
systematically worst when log(Mstar/Msun) > 10. Although with large scatter,
the observed polytropic indexes increase with increasing mass and tend to
cluster around m=5. For the most massive galaxies, propols are very good at
reproducing their central parts, but they do not handle well cores and

such plate. We consider the general case with fugacities $s_\mu$ for `$\mu$
plates', whose normal is the $\mu$ direction ($\mu = x,y,z$). At and close to
the isotropic point, we find, consistent with previous work, a phase with
long-range sublattice order. When two of the fugacities $s_{\rm \mu_1}$ and
$s_{\mu_2}$ are comparable, and the third fugacity $s_{\mu_{3}}$ is much
smaller, we find a spontaneously-layered phase. In this phase, the system
breaks up into disjoint slabs of width two stacked along the $\mu_3$ axis.
$\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ plates are preferentially contained entirely within these
slabs, while plates straddling two successive slabs have a lower density. In
the opposite limit, with $\mu_3 \gg \mu_1 \sim \mu_2$, we find a phase with
long-range columnar order, corresponding to simultaneous $Z_2$ symmetry
breaking of lattice translation symmetry in directions $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. The
spontaneously-layered phases display critical behaviour, with power-law decay
of correlations in the $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ directions when the slabs are
stacked in the $\mu_3$ direction, and represent examples of `floating phases'
discussed earlier in the context of coupled Luttinger liquids and
quasi-two-dimensional classical systems. We ascribe this remarkable behaviour
to the constrained motion of defects in this phase, and develop a
coarse-grained effective field theoretical understanding of the stability of
power-law order in this unusual three-dimensional floating phase.

  Selection and the Discovery of Bursty H{\alpha} Emitters","Accepted at MNRAS, 18 pages, 15 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stab2566",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emission line galaxies provide a crucial tool for the study of galaxy
formation and evolution, providing a means to trace a galaxy's star formation
history or metal enrichment, and to identify galaxies at a range of stellar
masses. In this paper we present a study of emission line galaxies in the
SHARDS Frontier Fields medium-band survey. Through detailed flux calibrations
we combine the first results of the SHARDS-FF survey with existing Hubble
Frontier Field data to select 1,098 candidate emission line galaxies from the
Hubble Frontier Filed clusters Abell 370 and MACS J1149.5+2223. Furthermore, we
implement this deep medium-band imaging to update photometric redshift
estimates and stellar population parameters and discover 38 predominantly
low-mass H{\alpha} emitters at redshifts 0.24 < z < 0.46. Overall, 27 of these
sources have corresponding UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope which allows
us to distinguish these sources and investigate the burstiness of their star
formation histories. We find that more than 50% of our sample show an
enhancement in H{\alpha} over UV, suggesting recent bursts in star formation on
time scales of a few, to tens of megayears. We investigate these sources and
find that they are typically low-mass disky galaxies with normal sizes. Their
structures and star formation suggest that they are not undergoing mergers but
are bursting due to alternative causes, such as gas accretion.

relative to the former, and is observed for the first time. The ratio of
branching fractions of the two decays is measured, and the $C\!P$ asymmetry of
the suppressed mode, which is sensitive to the CKM angle $\gamma$, is also
reported.

equivalence class under translation, rotation and scaling, its ""form"" its
equivalence class under translation and rotation while scale is preserved. We
extend generalized additive regression to models for such shapes/forms as
responses respecting the resulting quotient geometry by employing the squared
geodesic distance as loss function and a geodesic response function to map the
additive predictor to the shape/form space. For fitting the model, we propose a
Riemannian $L_2$-Boosting algorithm well suited for a potentially large number
of possibly parameter-intensive model terms, which also yields automated model
selection. We provide novel intuitively interpretable visualizations for (even
non-linear) covariate effects in the shape/form space via suitable
tensor-product factorization. The usefulness of the proposed framework is
illustrated in an analysis of 1) astragalus shapes of wild and domesticated
sheep and 2) cell forms generated in a biophysical model, as well as 3) in a

Silva","ERA: Entity Relationship Aware Video Summarization with Wasserstein GAN","8 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video summarization aims to simplify large scale video browsing by generating
concise, short summaries that diver from but well represent the original video.
Due to the scarcity of video annotations, recent progress for video
summarization concentrates on unsupervised methods, among which the GAN based
methods are most prevalent. This type of methods includes a summarizer and a
discriminator. The summarized video from the summarizer will be assumed as the
final output, only if the video reconstructed from this summary cannot be
discriminated from the original one by the discriminator. The primary problems
of this GAN based methods are two folds. First, the summarized video in this
way is a subset of original video with low redundancy and contains high
priority events/entities. This summarization criterion is not enough. Second,
the training of the GAN framework is not stable. This paper proposes a novel
Entity relationship Aware video summarization method (ERA) to address the above
problems. To be more specific, we introduce an Adversarial Spatio Temporal
network to construct the relationship among entities, which we think should
also be given high priority in the summarization. The GAN training problem is
solved by introducing the Wasserstein GAN and two newly proposed video
patch/score sum losses. In addition, the score sum loss can also relieve the
model sensitivity to the varying video lengths, which is an inherent problem
for most current video analysis tasks. Our method substantially lifts the
performance on the target benchmark datasets and exceeds the current
leaderboard Rank 1 state of the art CSNet (2.1% F1 score increase on TVSum and
3.1% F1 score increase on SumMe). We hope our straightforward yet effective
approach will shed some light on the future research of unsupervised video
summarization.

twists the spacetime via a vector gravitomagnetic (frame-dragging) field, which
remains undetected in cosmology. This vector field induces an additional
gravitational lensing effect; at the same time, the momentum field sources the
kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. The common origin of these two effects
allows us to probe the gravitomagnetic signal via their cross-correlations. In
this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting the gravitomagnetic field
in $\Lambda$CDM by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with
the CMB temperature map, which is imprinted with the kSZ signal. This approach
allows us to extract the gravitomagnetic effect because the cross correlation
between the standard Newtonian contribution to the weak-lensing convergence
field, $\kappa_\Phi$, and the kSZ effect is expected to vanish. We study the
cross correlations with a suite of large-volume Newtonian $N$-body simulations
and a small-volume, high-resolution, general-relativistic counterpart. We show
that insufficient simulation resolution can introduce significant spurious
correlations between $\kappa_\Phi$ and kSZ. From the high-resolution
simulation, we find that the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
kSZ-gravitomagnetic convergence field can reach almost 15 (30) at
$\ell\simeq5000$ ($10^4$) for the lensing source redshift $z_s=0.83$, if only
cosmic variance is considered. We make forecast for next-generation lensing

and CMB-S4, and find that, for $z_s=1.4$, the cumulative SNR can exceed 5 (9)
at $\ell\simeq5000$ ($10^4$), indicating that the cosmological gravitomagnetic

increase the detection significance for small departures from General

We devise a method (the ""TopN"" test) to evaluate the scatter in the halo

cModel photometry or aperture luminosity within R<30 kpc is a poor proxy of
halo mass. In contrast, the stellar mass of the outer envelope is an excellent
halo mass proxy. The stellar mass within R=[50,100] kpc, M*[50,100], has
performance comparable to the state-of-the-art richness-based cluster finders
at $\log{M_{\rm vir}/M_{\odot}}>14.0$ and could be a better halo mass tracer at
lower halo masses. Finally, using N-body simulations, we find that the lensing
profiles of massive halos selected by M*[50,100] are consistent with the
expectation for a sample without projection or mis-centering effects. On the
other hand, Richness-selected clusters display an excess at R~1 Mpc in their
lensing profiles, which may suggest a more significant impact from selection
biases. These results suggest that Mstar-based tracers have distinct advantages
in identifying massive halos, which could open up new avenues for cluster

only of the order of a hundred. The ongoing ESA mission Gaia has already
collected its nominal 5 yr of mission data and might operate up to 10 yr.
  Aims: Using detailed simulations, we estimate the number of BDs that could be
discovered by Gaia astrometry, radial velocity, and photometric transits around
main sequence (V) and subgiants (IV) FGK host stars for a 5 and 10-yr mission.
  Methods: Using a robust $\Delta \chi^2$ statistic we analyse the BD companion
detectability from the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy population synthesis model
complemented by Gaia DR2 data for the bright end, using the latest Gaia
performance and scanning law, and literature-based BD-parameter distributions.
  Results: We report here reliable detection numbers ($\Delta \chi^2$>50) for a
5-yr [10-yr] mission. Astrometry alone yields 28,000-42,000 [45,000-55,000]

<10 d. Systems with at least 3 photometric transits (S/N>3) are expected for
720-1100 [1400-2300] BDs, averaging at 4-5 [5-6] transits per source. Overlap
of astrometric and radial velocity detection yield 370-410 [870-950]
candidates, transit and radial velocity 17-27 [35-56], and transit and
astrometric detection 1-3 [4-6].
  Conclusions: Though above numbers have +/- 50% uncertainty due to the
uncertain occurrence rate and period distribution of BDs around FGK host stars,
Gaia detections will number in the tens-of-thousands, enlarging the current
sample by at least two orders of magnitude, allowing to investigate the BD
fraction and orbital architectures as a function of host stellar parameters in
greater detail than every before.

was possibly accompanied by a high-energy neutrino. Previous interpretations
have focused on continued injection by a central engine as the source of energy
for radio emission. We show that continuous energy injection is unnecessary;
the radio data can be explained by a single ejection of plasma that supplies
all the energy needed. To support this assertion, we analyze the synchrotron
self-absorbed spectra in terms of the equipartition model. Similar to previous
analyses, we find that the energy in the radio-emitting region increases
approximately $\propto t^{0.7}$ and the lengthscale of this region grows
$\propto t$ at a rate $\simeq0.06c$. This event resembles the earliest stage of
a supernova remnant: because the ejected mass is much greater than the shocked
external mass, its velocity remains unchanged, while the energy in shocked gas
grows with time. The radio-emitting material gains energy from the outflow, not
continuing energy injection by the central object. Although energy injection
from an accreting BH cannot be completely excluded, the energy injection rate
is very different from the fallback luminosity, and maintaining constant
outflow velocity requires fine-tuning demanding further physical explanation.
If the neutrino association is real, the energy injection needed is much
greater than for the radio emission, suggesting that the detected neutrino did
not arise from the radio-emitting region.

visibilities in each band. Using our simple models and assumed dust temperature

not be optically thick enough for dust self-scattering to be efficient. We also
find the higher sensitivity 233 GHz data show substructure in the disk for the

  of Dwarf Galaxies, edited by Yanbin Yang and Behnam Javanmardi, in Galaxies",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driven by increasingly complete observational knowledge of systems of
satellite galaxies, mutual spatial alignments and relations in velocities among
satellites belonging to a common host have become a productive field of
research. Numerous studies have investigated different types of such
phase-space correlations, and were met with varying degrees of attention by the
community. The Planes of Satellite Galaxies issue is maybe the best-known
example, with a rich field of research literature and an ongoing, controversial
debate on how much of a challenge it poses to the LCDM model of cosmology.
Another type of correlation, the apparent excess of close pairs of dwarf
galaxies, has received considerably less attention despite its reported tension
with LCDM expectations. With the expansion of proper motion measurements,
largely driven by Gaia, other peculiar phase-space correlations were uncovered
among the Milky Way satellites. Examples are the tangential velocity excess of
satellites compared to cosmological expectations, and the unexpected preference
of satellites to be close to pericenter. At the same time, other kinds of
correlations have been found to be more in line with cosmological expectations,
specifically lopsided satellite galaxy systems and the accretion of groups of
satellite galaxies. The latter has mostly been studied in cosmological
simulations thus far, but offers the potential to address some of the other
issues by providing a way to produce correlations among the orbits of a group's
satellite galaxy members. This review is the first to provide an introduction
to the highly active field of phase-space correlations among satellite galaxy
systems. It summarizes existing, recent research and highlights
interdependencies between the different, currently almost exclusively
individually considered types of correlations. Future prospects are also
briefly discussed. (abridged)

relies on the interplay of multiple physical processes. Nonetheless, it
represents a crucial stage for our understanding of the Universe, and in
particular of the conditions leading to the formation of key molecules (e.g.
water) on comets and planets. Herschel observations demonstrated that stars
form out of gaseous filamentary structures in which the main constituent is
molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Depending on its nuclear spin H$_2$ can be found in
two forms: `ortho' with parallel spins and `para' where the spins are
anti-parallel. The relative ratio among these isomers, i.e. the ortho-to-para
ratio (OPR), plays a crucial role in a variety of processes related to the
thermodynamics of star-forming gas and to the fundamental chemistry affecting
the deuteration of water in molecular clouds, commonly used to determine the
origin of water in Solar System's bodies. Here, for the first time, we assess
the evolution of the OPR starting from the warm neutral medium, by means of
state-of-the-art three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of
turbulent molecular clouds. Our results show that star-forming clouds exhibit a
low OPR ($\ll 0.1$) already at moderate densities ($\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$). We
also constrain the cosmic rays ionisation rate, finding that $10^{-16}\,\rm
s^{-1}$ is the lower limit required to explain the observations of diffuse
clouds. Our results represent a step forward in the understanding of the star
and planet formation process providing a robust determination of the chemical
initial conditions for both theoretical and observational studies.

Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE) and a large sample from MaNGA

distribution of gas metallicity gradients as a function of stellar mass, for
local cluster and field galaxies. Overall, metallicity profiles steepen with
increasing stellar mass up to $10^{10.3}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and flatten out at
higher masses. Combining the results from the metallicity profiles and the
stellar mass surface density gradients, we propose that the observed steepening
is a consequence of local metal enrichment due to in-situ star formation during
the inside-out formation of disk galaxies. The metallicity gradient-stellar
mass relation is characterized by a rather large scatter, especially for
$10^{9.8}<{\rm M_\star/M_\odot}<10^{10.5}$, and we demonstrate that metallicity
gradients anti-correlate with the galaxy gas fraction. Focusing on the galaxy
environment, at any given stellar mass, cluster galaxies have systematically
flatter metallicity profiles than their field counterparts. Many
sub-populations coexist in clusters: galaxies with shallower metallicity
profiles appear to have fallen into their present host halo sooner and have
experienced the environmental effects for a longer time than cluster galaxies
with steeper metallicity profiles. Recent galaxy infallers, like galaxies
currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, show metallicity gradients more
similar to those of field galaxies, suggesting they have not felt the effect of
the cluster yet.

massive, large star-forming galaxies at z~0.67-2.45 using both ionized and

a bulge, a thick, turbulent disk, and a NFW dark matter halo, using code that
fully forward models the kinematics, including all observational and
instrumental effects. We explore the parameter space using Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling, including priors based on stellar and gas masses and
disk sizes. We fit the full sample using extracted 1D kinematic profiles. For a
subset of 14 well-resolved galaxies, we also fit the 2D kinematics. The MCMC
approach robustly confirms the results from least-squares fitting presented in
Paper I (Genzel et al. 2020): the sample galaxies tend to be baryon-rich on
galactic scales (within one effective radius). The 1D and 2D MCMC results are
also in good agreement for the subset, demonstrating that much of the galaxy
dynamical information is captured along the major axis. The 2D kinematics are
more affected by the presence of non-circular motions, which we illustrate by
constructing a toy model with constant inflow for one galaxy that exhibits
residual signatures consistent with radial motions. This analysis, together
with results from Paper I and other studies, strengthens the finding that
massive, star-forming galaxies at z~1-2 are baryon-dominated on galactic
scales, with lower dark matter fractions towards higher baryonic surface
densities. Finally, we present details of the kinematic fitting code used in

Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe filled with a (free) massless
scalar field and an arbitrary perfect fluid. For positive energy density in the
scalar and fluid, each classical solution has a singularity and expands to
infinite volume. When quantising we view the cosmological dynamics in
relational terms, using one degree of freedom as a clock for the others. Three
natural candidates for this clock are the volume, a time variable conjugate to
the perfect fluid, and the scalar field. We have previously shown that
requiring unitary evolution in the ""fluid"" time leads to a boundary condition
at the singularity and generic singularity resolution, while in the volume time
semiclassical states follow the classical singular trajectories. Here we
analyse the third option of using the scalar field as a clock, finding further
dramatic differences to the previous cases: the boundary condition arising from
unitarity is now at infinity. Rather than singularity resolution, this theory
features a quantum recollapse of the universe at large volume, as was shown in
a similar context by Paw{\l}owski and Ashtekar. We illustrate the properties of
the theory analytically and numerically, showing that the ways in which the
different quantum theories do or do not depart from classical behaviour
directly arise from demanding unitarity with respect to different clocks. We
argue that using a Dirac quantisation would not resolve the issue. Our results
further illustrate the problem of time in quantum gravity.

abundances beyond the observational errors. Stars with strongly enhanced in
[N/Fe] abundance ratios populate the cluster, and are anti-correlated with
[C/Fe], trends that are considered a signal of the multiple-population
phenomenon in this cluster. We detect an apparent intrinsic star-to-star spread
($\gtrsim 0.27$ dex) in the slow neutron-capture process element (s-element) Ce
II. Moreover, the [Ce/Fe] abundance ratio exhibits a likely correlation with
[N/Fe], and a somewhat weaker correlation with [Al/Fe]. If confirmed, NGC 6380
could be the first high-metallicity globular cluster where a N-Ce correlation
is detected. Furthermore, this correlation suggests that Ce may also be an
element involved in the multiple-population phenomenon. Currently, a consensus
interpretation for the origin of the this apparent N-Ce correlation in
high-metallicity clusters is lacking. We tentatively suggest that it could be
reproduced by different channels - low-mass asymptotic giant-branch stars in
the high-metallicity regime or fast-rotating massive stars (""spinstars""), due
to the rotational mixing. It may also be the cumulative effect of several
pollution events including the occurrence of peculiar stars. Our findings
should guide stellar nucleosynthesis models, in order to understand the reasons
for its apparent exclusivity in relatively high-metallicity globular clusters.

HI observations exist for NGC 3252, the host of FRB 181030A, M81, the host of
FRB 200120E, and the Milky Way, the host of FRB 200428. I report three
observables: i) all three FRB hosts are interacting galaxies; ii) the Hi
spectra of both FRB hosts with such data available are highly asymmetric,
several standard deviations above the general population of galaxies; iii) two
FRB hosts have normal atomic gas properties and one is strongly deficient in
atomic gas. This indicates that nearby and repeating FRBs are connected with a
recent enhancement of star formation due to interaction. This supports fast FRB
channels, for example a massive star with a short delay time so that
interaction signatures giving rise to the birth of the progenitor are still
visible. Long gamma-ray burst (GRB) and broad-lined type Ic supernova (SN)
hosts exhibit much more symmetric spectra, even though they were claimed to
experience gas inflow from the intergalactic medium. The difference can be
explained by the interactions experienced by FRB hosts being more disruptive
than these gas inflows, or by the mass effect, with GRB/SN hosts at lower
masses having less organized gas motions, so with HI lines closer to a
symmetrical Gaussian. This also suggests that the emission mechanisms of FRBs

galaxies, and dark matter halos is still a matter of intense debate. Present
theoretical models suffer from large uncertainties and degeneracies, for
example, between the fraction of accreting sources and their characteristic
accretion rate. In recent work we showed that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
clustering represents a powerful tool to break degeneracies when analysed in
terms of mean BH mass, and that AGN bias at fixed stellar mass is largely
independent of most of the input parameters, such as the AGN duty cycle and the
mean scaling between BH mass and host galaxy stellar mass. In this paper we
take advantage of our improved semi-empirical methodology and recent clustering
data derived from large AGN samples at $z \sim 1.2$, demonstrate that the AGN
bias as a function of host galaxy stellar mass is a crucial diagnostic of the
BH--galaxy connection, and is highly dependent on the scatter around the BH
mass--galaxy mass scaling relation and on the relative fraction of satellite
and central active BHs. Current data at $z \sim 1.2$ favour relatively high

the rest-frame FIR emission. We present high-resolution ALMA Band 7
observations of eight X-ray selected AGN at z~2 from the SUPER sample,
targeting the rest-frame ~260 um continuum at ~2 kpc (0.2'') resolution. We
detected 6 out of 8 targets with S/N>10 in the ALMA maps, with continuum flux
densities F = 0.27-2.58 mJy and FIR half-light radii Re = 0.8-2.1 kpc. The FIR
Re of our sample are comparable to other AGN and star-forming galaxies at a
similar redshift from the literature. However, we find that the mean FIR size
in X-ray AGN (Re = 1.16+/- 0.11 kpc) is slightly smaller than in non-AGN (Re =
1.69+/-0.13 kpc). From SED fitting, we find that the main contribution to the
260 um flux density is dust heated by star formation, with < 4% contribution
from AGN-heated dust and < 1% from synchrotron emission. The majority of our
sample show different morphologies for the FIR (mostly due to reprocessed
stellar emission) and the ionised gas emission (H$\alpha$ and [OIII], mostly
due to AGN emission). This could be due to the different locations of dust and
ionised gas, the different sources of the emission (stars and AGN), or the
effect of dust obscuration. We are unable to identify any residual H$\alpha$
emission, above that dominated by AGN, that could be attributed to star
formation. Under the assumption that the FIR emission is a reliable tracer of
obscured star formation, we find that the obscured star formation activity in
these AGN host galaxies is not clearly affected by the ionised outflows.
However, we cannot rule out that star formation suppression is happening on
smaller spatial scales than the ones we probe with our observations (< 2 kpc)
or on different timescales.

Through this operation we attained measurements of the detection efficiency as
a function of signal strength, enabling future population analysis using this

noisy input states to produce high-fidelity resource states that are used to

resource cost of magic state distillation can be reduced by improving the
fidelity of the raw input states. To this end, we propose an initialization
protocol that offers a quadratic improvement in the error rate of the input
magic states in architectures with biased noise. This is achieved by preparing
an error-detecting code which detects the dominant errors that occur during
state preparation. We obtain this advantage by exploiting the native gate
operations of an underlying qubit architecture that experiences biases in its
noise profile. We perform simulations to analyze the performance of our
protocol with the XZZX surface code. Even at modest physical parameters with a
two-qubit gate error rate of $0.7\%$ and total probability of dominant errors
in the gate $O(10^3)$ larger compared to that of non-dominant errors, we find
that our preparation scheme delivers magic states with logical error rate
$O(10^{-8})$ after a single round of the standard 15-to-1 distillation
protocol; two orders of magnitude lower than using conventional state
preparation. Our approach therefore promises considerable savings in overheads
with near-term technology.

static and spherically-symmetric solutions of a Horndeski subclass which
includes a massless scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Einstein tensor.
Such theory possesses second-order field equations and admits an exact black

The qualitative features of the ringdown waveform depend solely on the ratio of
the two available parameters of spacetime, namely the black hole mass $m$ and
the non-minimal coupling strength $\ell_\eta$. Finally, we demonstrate the
gravitational-wave ringdown transitions between three distinct patterns as the
ratio $m/\ell_\eta$ increases; a state which is dominated by photon-sphere
excitations and maintains a typical quasinormal ringdown, an intermediate
long-lived state which exhibits gravitational-wave echoes and, finally, a state

(2021) for calculating the rate $D_R$ at which energy is exchanged between fast
tides and convection. In this previous work, $D_R$ (which is proportional to
the gradient of the convective velocity) was assumed to be positive in order to
dissipate the tidal energy. Here we argue that, even if energy is
intermittently transferred from convection to the tides, it must ultimately
return to the convective flow and transported efficiently to the stellar
surface on the convective timescale. This is consistent with, but much less
restrictive than, enforcing $D_R>0$. Our principle result is a calculation of
the circularization timescale of late-type binaries, taking into account the
full time evolution of the stellar structure. We find that circularization is
very efficient during the PMS phase, inefficient during the MS, and once again
efficient when the star approaches the RGB. These results are in much better
agreement with observations than earlier theories. We also apply our formalism
to hot Jupiters, and find that tidal dissipation in a Jupiter mass planet
yields a circularization timescale of 1 Gyr for an orbital period of 3 d, also
in good overall agreement with observations. The approach here is novel, and
the apparent success of the theory in resolving longstanding timescale puzzles

galaxies, resulting in emission line flux ratios that can be significantly
different from those produced by HII regions. Comparing the emission of

integrated spectra of more distant galaxies, it has been recently claimed that
the DIG can also deeply affect the emission of bright, star-forming galaxies,

in previous work. Indeed, aperture effects on the spectroscopy of nearby HII
regions are largely responsible for the observed difference: when spectra of
local HII regions are extracted using large enough apertures while still
avoiding the DIG, the observed line ratios are the same as in more distant
galaxies. This result is highly relevant for the use of strong-line methods to
measure metallicity.

Rev. Lett. 120,
067003 (2018)], considerable research efforts have been dedicated to the study
of Cooper pairing order parameters constrained (or obstructed) by the
nontrivial normal-state band topology at Fermi surfaces in 3D systems. In the
current work, we generalize the topologically obstructed pairings between Chern
states (like the monopole Cooper pairing) by proposing Euler obstructed Cooper
pairing in 3D systems. The Euler obstructed Cooper pairing widely exists
between two Fermi surfaces with nontrivial band topology characterized by
nonzero Euler numbers; such Fermi surfaces can exist in 3D PT-protected
spinless-Dirac/nodal-line semimetals with negligible spin-orbit coupling, where
PT is the space-time inversion symmetry. An Euler obstructed pairing channel
must have pairing nodes on the pairing-relevant Fermi surfaces, and the total
winding number of the pairing nodes is determined by the sum or difference of
the Euler numbers on the Fermi surfaces. In particular, we find that when the
normal state is time-reversal invariant and the pairing is weak, a
sufficiently-dominant Euler obstructed pairing channel with zero total momentum
leads to nodal superconductivity. If the Fermi surface splitting is small, the
resultant nodal superconductor hosts hinge Majorana zero modes. The possible
dominance of the Euler obstructed pairing channel near the superconducting
transition and the robustness of the hinge Majorana zero modes against disorder
are explicitly demonstrated using effective or tight-binding models. Our work
presents the first class of higher-order nodal superconductivity originating
from the topologically obstructed Cooper pairing.

instead. They are naturally related to the \emph{fidelity} and thus it is
possible to interpret the learning process with the help of quantum information
tools. In particular, we use a support vector machine (with a quantum kernel)
to predict and characterize second order quantum phase transitions. We explain

the fidelity) is used. The general theory is tested in the Ising chain in
transverse field. We show that for small-sized systems, the algorithm gives
accurate results, even when trained away from criticality. Besides, for larger

critical exponent $\nu$. Finally, we present two algorithms, one based on
fidelity and one based on the fidelity per site, to classify the phases of

anti-correlation between the inner disk water luminosity and outer dust disk
radius, we aim here at investigating the dynamics of icy solids that drift from
the outer disk and sublimate their ice inside the snow line, enriching the
water vapor that is observed in the IR. We use a volatile-inclusive disk
evolution model to explore a range of conditions (gap location, particle size,
disk mass, and alpha-viscosity) under which gaps in the outer disk efficiently
block the inward drift of icy solids. We find that inner-disk vapor enrichment
is highly sensitive to the location of a disk gap, yielding for each particle
size a radial ""sweet spot"" that reduces the inner-disk vapor enrichment to a
minimum. For pebbles of 1-10 mm in size, which carry the most mass, this sweet
spot is at 7-15 au, suggesting that inner gaps may have a key role in reducing
ice delivery to the inner disk and may not allow the formation of Earths and
super-Earths. This highlights the importance of observationally determining the
presence and properties of inner gaps in disks. Finally, we argue that the
inner water vapor abundance can be used as a proxy for estimating the pebble
drift efficiency and mass-flux entering the inner disk.

evaluation in image classification. Manually annotating images is arduous and
expensive, especially for multi-labeled images. A recent trend for conducting
such laboursome annotation tasks is through crowdsourcing, where images are
annotated by volunteers or paid workers online (e.g., workers of Amazon
Mechanical Turk) from scratch. However, the quality of crowdsourcing image
annotations cannot be guaranteed, and incompleteness and incorrectness are two
major concerns for crowdsourcing annotations. To address such concerns, we have
a rethinking of crowdsourcing annotations: Our simple hypothesis is that if the
annotators only partially annotate multi-label images with salient labels they
are confident in, there will be fewer annotation errors and annotators will
spend less time on uncertain labels. As a pleasant surprise, with the same
annotation budget, we show a multi-label image classifier supervised by images
with salient annotations can outperform models supervised by fully annotated
images. Our method contributions are 2-fold: An active learning way is proposed
to acquire salient labels for multi-label images; and a novel Adaptive
Temperature Associated Model (ATAM) specifically using partial annotations is
proposed for multi-label image classification. We conduct experiments on
practical crowdsourcing data, the Open Street Map (OSM) dataset and benchmark
dataset COCO 2014. When compared with state-of-the-art classification methods
trained on fully annotated images, the proposed ATAM can achieve higher
accuracy. The proposed idea is promising for crowdsourcing data annotation. Our

Traditionally, surrogate models require that all training data conform to the

prohibiting the reuse of historical data. In response, this paper proposes
Graph-based Surrogate Models (GSMs) for trusses. The GSM can accurately predict
displacement fields from static loads given the structure's geometry as input,
enabling training across multiple parametrizations. GSMs build upon recent
advancements in geometric deep learning which have led to the ability to learn
on undirected graphs: a natural representation for trusses. To further promote
flexible surrogate models, the paper explores transfer learning within the

Probability Weighting, Marginal Structural Models and Structural Nested Models.
To estimate treatment effects from observational data, these methods posit a
(pooled) logistic regression model for the treatment and/or censoring
probabilities and estimate these first. These methods are all based on unbiased
estimating equations. First, we provide a general formula for the variance of
the parameter of interest psi when the nuisance parameter theta is estimated in
a first step, using the Partition Inverse Formula. Then, we present 4 results
for estimators psi-hat based on unbiased estimating equations including a
nuisance parameter theta which is estimated by solving (partial) score
equations, if psi does not depend on theta. This regularly happens in causal
inference if theta describes the treatment probabilities, in settings with
missing data where theta describes the missingness probabilities, and settings
with measurement error where theta describes the measurement error
distribution. 1. Counter-intuitively, the limiting variance of psi-hat is
typically smaller when theta is estimated, compared to if a known theta were
plugged in. 2. If estimating theta is ignored, the resulting sandwich estimator
for the variance of psi-hat is conservative. 3. A consistent estimator for the
variance of psi-hat can provide results fast: no bootstrap. 4. If psi-hat with
the true theta plugged in is efficient, the limiting variance of psi-hat does
not depend on whether theta is estimated. To illustrate we use observational

adaptation (MSDA) aims at learning a predictor for an unlabeled domain by
assigning weak knowledge from a bag of source models. However, most works
conduct domain adaptation leveraging only the extracted features and reducing

propose to embed Multi-Source version of DomaIn Alignment Layers (MS-DIAL) at
different levels of the predictor. These layers are designed to match the
feature distributions between different domains and can be easily applied to
various MSDA methods. To show the robustness of our approach, we conducted an

follows the power-law with a disorder-dependent exponent. Due to the
energetically favorable positions, the domain boundary roughens which modifies
the correlation function and structure factor to a non-Porod behavior. The
correlation function and structure factor provide clear evidence that the
superuniversality does not hold in our system. The role of annealed disorder on
the non-equilibrium aging dynamics is studied qualitatively by computing the
two-time order parameter autocorrelation function. The decay of the correlation
function slows down significantly with the disorder. This quantity exhibits
scaling laws with respect to the ratio of the domain length at the observation

range of material platforms, inspiring the development of simple
phenomenological models such as the four-level model to elucidate the universal
properties of laser cooling under various operating conditions. However, these
models usually require the input of full absorption spectra that must be
provided experimentally or by additional complicated atomic modeling. In this
letter, we propose that a four-level model, when extended to admit effective
energy levels adaptive to the pumping photon energy, can accurately predict the
cooling efficiency as a function of temperature and pumping frequency using
only few inputs such as the absorption coefficient measured at a single
frequency and temperature. Our model exploits the quasi-equilibrium properties
of the excitation of rare-earth ions for the determination of the effective
four energy levels. The model is validated against published experimental
results for a span of materials including ytterbium/thulium-doped glass and
crystals. With the verified model, we derive explicit expressions for the
optimal frequency and the operating bandwidth of pumping laser. Our model
significantly simplifies the modeling process of laser cooling, and is expected
to stimulate further development of optical refrigeration.

composed of four integrated modules: a simulated bridge inspection developed in

in-task feedback to trainees to assist their learning, and a post-study

The study demonstrated that TASBID, as a tool for the early-stage training, can

fatal crash risks earlier is also critical because it will improve the
reliability of crash anticipation. Yet, annotated image data for training a
reliable AI model for the early visual perception of crash risks are not
abundant. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System contains big data of fatal
crashes. It is a reliable data source for learning the relationship between
driving scene characteristics and fatal crashes to compensate for the
limitation of CV. Therefore, this paper develops a data analytics model, named
scenario-wise, Spatio-temporal attention guidance, from fatal crash report
data, which can estimate the relevance of detected objects to fatal crashes
from their environment and context information. First, the paper identifies
five sparse variables that allow for decomposing the 5-year fatal crash dataset
to develop scenario-wise attention guidance. Then, exploratory analysis of
location- and time-related variables of the crash report data suggests reducing
fatal crashes to spatially defined groups. The group's temporal pattern is an
indicator of the similarity of fatal crashes in the group. Hierarchical
clustering and K-means clustering merge the spatially defined groups into six
clusters according to the similarity of their temporal patterns. After that,
association rule mining discovers the statistical relationship between the
temporal information of driving scenes with crash features, for each cluster.
The paper shows how the developed attention guidance supports the design and
implementation of a preliminary CV model that can identify objects of a
possibility to involve in fatal crashes from their environment and context

formalize this task, we introduce the ""data selection"" problem: finding a
lower-dimensional statistic - such as a subset of variables - that is well fit
by a given parametric model of interest. A fully Bayesian approach to data
selection would be to parametrically model the value of the statistic,
nonparametrically model the remaining ""background"" components of the data, and
perform standard Bayesian model selection for the choice of statistic. However,
fitting a nonparametric model to high-dimensional data tends to be highly

kernelized Stein discrepancy in place of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The
Stein volume criterion does not require one to fit or even specify a
nonparametric background model, making it straightforward to compute - in many
cases it is as simple as fitting the parametric model of interest with an
alternative objective function. We prove that the Stein volume criterion is
consistent for both data selection and model selection, and we establish

characterize these features by extracting the halo mass-dependent statistics of
five DM halo properties -- velocity dispersion, NFW concentration, density- and

covariances between realizations with and without galaxy formation, we find
systematic deviations across all mass-scales, with maximum deviations of 25% at

gains, and firing thresholds in neuronal networks. We show that with an
adequate separation of the timescales for the coupling strength and firing
threshold dynamics, near criticality (SOqC) can be reached and sustained even
in the presence of significant external input. The firing thresholds adapt to
and cancel the inputs ($h$ decreases towards zero). Similar mechanisms can be
proposed for the couplings and local thresholds in spin systems and cellular
automata, which could lead to applications in earthquake, forest fire, stellar
flare, voting, and epidemic modeling.

guidance using corresponding landmarks in the images. However, the benefits
thereof are largely understudied, especially due to the lack of automatic
landmark detection methods for three-dimensional (3D) medical images.
  Approach: We present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), called
DCNN-Match, that learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D images in a
self-supervised manner. We trained DCNN-Match on pairs of Computed Tomography
(CT) scans containing simulated deformations. We explored five variants of
DCNN-Match that use different loss functions and assessed their effect on the
spatial density of predicted landmarks and the associated matching errors. We
also tested DCNN-Match variants in combination with the open-source
registration software Elastix to assess the impact of predicted landmarks in
providing additional guidance to DIR.
  Results: We tested our approach on lower-abdominal CT scans from cervical
cancer patients: 121 pairs containing simulated deformations and 11 pairs
demonstrating clinical deformations. The results showed significant improvement
in DIR performance when landmark correspondences predicted by DCNN-Match were
used in the case of simulated (p = $0e^0$) as well as clinical deformations (p
= 0.030). We also observed that the spatial density of the automatic landmarks
with respect to the underlying deformation affect the extent of improvement in
DIR. Finally, DCNN-Match was found to generalize to Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) scans without requiring retraining, indicating easy applicability to
other datasets.
  Conclusions: DCNN-Match learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D
medical images in a self-supervised manner, which can improve DIR performance.

detection pipeline for seismic monitoring in Costa Rica. Using Kabre
supercomputer from the Costa Rica High Technology Center, we applied OKSP to
the day before and the first 5 days following the Puerto Armuelles, M6.5,
earthquake that occurred on 26 June, 2019, along the Costa Rica-Panama border
and found 1100 more earthquakes previously unidentified by the Volcanological

earthquakes with magnitudes below 1.0 occurred a day to hours prior to the
mainshock, shedding light about the rupture initiation and earthquake

observations show that for the study period, the model was 100% exhaustive and
82% precise, resulting in an F1 score of 0.90. This effort represents the very

Bunch-Davies vacuum at early times, any given diagram contributing to a
boundary correlator in dS can be expressed as a linear combination of Witten
diagrams for the corresponding process in EAdS, where the relative coefficients
are fixed by consistent on-shell factorisation in dS. These coefficients are
given by certain sinusoidal factors which account for the change in coefficient
of the contact sub-diagrams from EAdS to dS, which we argue encode
(perturbative) unitary time evolution in dS. dS boundary correlators with
Bunch-Davies initial conditions thus perturbatively have the same singularity
structure as their Euclidean AdS counterparts and the identities between them
allow to directly import the wealth of techniques, results and understanding
from AdS to dS. This includes the Conformal Partial Wave expansion and, by
going from single-valued Witten diagrams in EAdS to Lorentzian AdS, the
Froissart-Gribov inversion formula. We give a few (among the many possible)

screening, but the main focus is on detecting active inputs not in the computer
model itself but rather on the discrepancy function that is introduced to
account for model inadequacy when linking the computer model with field
observations. We contend this is an important problem as it informs the modeler
which are the inputs that are potentially being mishandled in the model, but
also along which directions it may be less recommendable to use the model for
prediction. The methodology is Bayesian and is inspired by the continuous spike
and slab prior popularized by the literature on Bayesian variable selection. In
our approach, and in contrast with previous proposals, a single MCMC sample
from the full model allows us to compute the posterior probabilities of all the
competing models, resulting in a methodology that is computationally very fast.
The approach hinges on the ability to obtain posterior inclusion probabilities
of the inputs, which are very intuitive and easy to interpret quantities, as
the basis for selecting active inputs. For that reason, we name the methodology
PIPS -- posterior inclusion probability screening.

schemes induces some noise, which, if too large, will destroy the plaintext.
Therefore, the bootstrapping technique that re-encrypts a ciphertext and
reduces the noise level remains the only known way of building FHE schemes for
arbitrary unbounded computations. The bootstrapping step is also the major
efficiency bottleneck in current FHE schemes. A promising direction towards
improving concrete efficiency is to exploit the bootstrapping process to
perform useful computation while reducing the noise at the same time.
  We show a bootstrapping algorithm, which embeds a lookup table and evaluates
arbitrary functions of the plaintext while reducing the noise. Depending on the
choice of parameters, the resulting homomorphic encryption scheme may be either
an exact FHE or homomorphic encryption for approximate arithmetic. Since we can
evaluate arbitrary functions over the plaintext space, we can use the natural
homomorphism of Regev encryption to compute affine functions without
bootstrapping almost for free. Consequently, our algorithms are particularly
suitable for circuits with many additions and scalar multiplication gates. We
achieve record speeds for such circuits. For example, in the exact FHE setting,
we achieve a speedup of a factor of over 3000x over state-of-the-art methods.
Effectively, we bring the evaluation time from weeks or days down to a few
hours or minutes. Furthermore, we note that the speedup gets more significant
with the size of the affine function.
  We provide a tight error analysis and show several parameter sets for our
bootstrapping. Finally, we implement our algorithm and provide extensive tests.
We demonstrate our algorithms by evaluating different neural networks in
several parameter and accuracy settings.

from a next galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) could, in principle, reveal
if neutrino mass ordering is normal or inverted. One of the possible ways to
identify the mass ordering is through the observation of the modulations that
appear in the spectrum when neutrinos travel through the Earth before they
arrive at the detector. These features in the neutrino spectrum depend on two
factors, the average neutrino energies, and the difference between the primary
neutrino fluxes of electron and other flavors produced inside the supernova.
However, recent studies indicate that the Earth matter effect for CCSN
neutrinos is expected to be rather small and difficult to be observed by
currently operating or planned neutrino detectors mainly because of the
similarity of average energies and fluxes between electron and other flavors of
neutrinos, unless the distance to CCSN is significantly smaller than the
typically expected one, $\sim 10$ kpc. Here, we are looking towards the
possibility if the non-standard neutrino properties such as decay of neutrinos
can enhance the Earth matter effect. In this work we show that invisible
neutrino decay can potentially enhance significantly the Earth matter effect
for both $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ channels at the same time for both mass
orderings, even if the neutrino spectra between electron and other flavors of
neutrinos are very similar, which is a different feature not expected for CCSN
neutrinos with standard oscillation without the decay effect.

each person to enable future mixed reality applications. To do this, we recover
a dense 3D reconstruction and camera information via structure-from-motion and
multi-view stereo. These are then used in a new two-stage fitting process to
recover the 3D head shape by iteratively fitting a 3D morphable model of the

person's head, using both traditional facial landmarks and scalp features
extracted from the head's segmentation mask. Our approach recovers consistent
geometry for varying head shapes, from videos taken by different people, with
different smartphones, and in a variety of environments from living rooms to

two-dimensional quasar-host decomposition of the Hyper Suprime-Cam images and
spectral energy distribution fitting. To quantify sample-selection biases and
measurement uncertainties on the mass terms, a mock quasar sample is
constructed to jointly constrain the redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$
relation and its intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_\mu$) through forward modeling. We
find that the level of evolution is degenerate with $\sigma_\mu$, such that
both positive mild evolution (i.e, $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ increases with redshift)
with a small $\sigma_\mu$, and negative mild evolution with a larger
$\sigma_\mu$ are consistent with our data. The posterior distribution of
$\sigma_\mu$ enables us to put a strong constraint on the intrinsic scatter of
the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relation, which has a best inference of
$0.25_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$ dex, consistent with the local value. The redshift
evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relation relative to the local relation is
constrained to be $(1+z)^{0.12_{-0.27}^{+0.28}}$, in agreement with no
significant evolution since $z\sim0.8$. The tight and non-evolving $M_{\rm
BH}-M_*$ relation is suggestive of a coupling through AGN feedback or/and a
common gas supply at work, thus restricting the mass ratio of galaxies and
their black holes to a limited range. Given the considerable stellar disk
component, the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm bulge}$ relation may evolve as previously
seen at higher redshifts.

reduction is required by some real-time applications; beyond this, dampers have
the potential to solve the burstiness cascade problem of deterministic networks
in a scalable way, as they can be stateless. Dampers exist in several variants:
some apply only to earliest-deadline-first schedulers, whereas others can be
associated with any packet schedulers; some enforce FIFO ordering whereas some
others do not. Existing analyses of dampers are specific to some
implementations and some network configurations; also, they assume ideal,
non-realistic clocks. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of all existing

residual jitter bounds of networks with dampers of any kind. We show that
non-FIFO dampers may cause reordering due to clock non-idealities and that the
combination of FIFO dampers with non-FIFO network elements may very negatively
affect the performance bounds. Our results can be used to analyze timing
properties and burstiness increase in any time-sensitive network, as we

experimentation to evaluate the performance of networks, infrastructure, and
security controls, by modelling and simulating the communication packets and

Specifically for security applications, these tools can be used to consistently
simulate malicious activity on the network and test the components designed to
detect and mitigate malicious activities, in a highly reliable and customisable
way. However, despite the promising features, most of these tools have some
problems that can undermine the correctness of experiments. The accuracy of the
simulation results depends strongly on the performance and reliability of the
used generator. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the performance and
accuracy of three of the most reviewed network traffic generators in
literature, namely Cisco TRex, Ostinato and Genesids. Mainly, the comparative
experiments examine the strengths and limitations of these tools, which can
help the research community to choose the most suitable one to assess the

motion blur, diverse variations in camera-object pose over time,and
preservation of temporal consistency. We parse the problem into three steps.
First, the text in all frames is normalized to a frontal pose using a

reference frame using a state-of-art still-image text replacement method.
Finally, the new text is transferred from the reference to remaining frames
using a novel learned image transformation network that captures lighting and
blur effects in a temporally consistent manner. Results on synthetic and

further boost the performance, we propose another novel auxiliary task, coined
Spatial Sound Super-Resolution, to increase the directional resolution of

withstand the specific attack used in training, and the models often remain
vulnerable to other input variations. Moreover, these methods often degrade
performance of the model on clean images and do not generalize to out-of-domain
samples. In this paper we present Generative Adversarial Training, an approach
to simultaneously improve the model's generalization to the test set and
out-of-domain samples as well as its robustness to unseen adversarial attacks.
Instead of altering a low-level pre-defined aspect of images, we generate a
spectrum of low-level, mid-level and high-level changes using generative models
with a disentangled latent space. Adversarial training with these examples
enable the model to withstand a wide range of attacks by observing a variety of

owner aims to (i) have privacy guarantees for the database entries, (ii) have
liability guarantees (via fingerprinting) in case of unauthorized sharing of
its database by the recipients, and (iii) provide a high quality (utility)
database to the recipients. We observe that sharing a relational database with
privacy and liability guarantees are orthogonal objectives. The former can be
achieved by injecting noise into the database to prevent inference of the
original data values, whereas, the latter can be achieved by hiding unique
marks inside the database to trace malicious parties (data recipients) who
redistribute the data without the authorization. We achieve these two
objectives simultaneously by proposing a novel entry-level
differentially-private fingerprinting mechanism for relational databases.
  At a high level, the proposed mechanism fulfills the privacy and liability
requirements by leveraging the randomization nature that is intrinsic to
fingerprinting and achieves desired entry-level privacy guarantees. To be more
specific, we devise a bit-level random response scheme to achieve differential
privacy guarantee for arbitrary data entries when sharing the entire database,
and then, based on this, we develop an $\epsilon$-entry-level
differentially-private fingerprinting mechanism. Next, we theoretically analyze
the relationships between privacy guarantee, fingerprint robustness, and
database utility by deriving closed form expressions. The outcome of this
analysis allows us to bound the privacy leakage caused by attribute inference
attack and characterize the privacy-utility coupling and privacy-fingerprint
robustness coupling. Furthermore, we also propose a SVT-based solution to

including a submodel for state-dependent missingness reduces bias when data is
MNAR and state-dependent, whilst not reducing accuracy when data is missing at
random (MAR). When missingness depends on time but not the hidden states, a
model which only allows for state-dependent missingness is biased, whilst a
model that allows for both state- and time-dependent missingness is not.
Overall, these results show that modelling missingness as state-dependent, and

Center of Iran, and Central Bank of Iran. The results show that Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capital increased by 2 percent annually during this time,
however this indicator has had a huge fluctuation over time. In addition, the
economic growth of Iran and oil revenue have close relationship with each
other. In fact, whenever oil crises happen, great fluctuation in growth rate
and other indicators happened subsequently. Even though the shares of other
sectors like industry and services in GDP have increased over time, the oil
sector still plays a key role in the economic growth of Iran. Moreover, growth
accounting analysis shows contribution of capital plays a significant role in
economic growth of Iran. Furthermore, based on growth accounting framework the
steady state of effective capital is 4.27 for Iran's economy.

downstream tasks, including document ranking. The multilingual versions of such
pretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many
languages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such
joint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the
models under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of
performance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the
performance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In
the monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is
easier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.
However, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different
languages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate
query terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,
in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This
property is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur
in both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed
Attention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge,
such as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like
architecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models.
By encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with
MAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge
and the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR
task.

a probabilistic guarantee. Then, by applying a reward shaping technique, we
develop a modular policy-gradient architecture exploiting the benefits of the

learned controllers; (3) by incorporating Gaussian Processes (GPs) to estimate
the uncertain dynamic systems, we synthesize a model-based safe exploration

that generalize systems with high-order relative degrees; (4) to further
improve the efficiency of exploration, we utilize the properties of LTL

designed based on an energetic variational formulation, in which the reaction
part is reformulated in terms of the reaction trajectory, and both the reaction
and diffusion parts dissipate the same free energy. At the reaction stage, the
reaction trajectory equation is approximated by a second-order Crank-Nicolson
type method. The unique solvability, positivity-preserving, and
energy-stability are established based on a convexity analysis. In the
diffusion stage, an exact integrator is applied if the diffusion coefficients
are constant, and a Crank-Nicolson type scheme is applied if the diffusion
process becomes nonlinear. In either case, both the positivity-preserving
property and energy stability could be theoretically established. Moreover, a
combination of the numerical algorithms at both stages by the Strang splitting
approach leads to a second-order accurate, structure-preserving scheme for the
original reaction-diffusion system. Numerical experiments are presented, which

relatively limited effort has been put into finding thermally conductive
polymers using machine learning, mainly due to the lack of polymer thermal
conductivity databases with reasonable data volume. In this work, we combine
high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning to
explore polymers with relatively high thermal conductivity (> 0.300 W/m-K). We
first randomly select 365 polymers from the existing PolyInfo database and
calculate their thermal conductivity using MD simulations. The data are then
employed to train a machine learning regression model to quantify the
structure-thermal conductivity relation, which is further leveraged to screen
polymer candidates in the PolyInfo database with thermal conductivity > 0.300
W/m-K. 133 polymers with MD-calculated thermal conductivity above this
threshold are eventually identified. Polymers with a wide range of thermal
conductivity values are selected for re-calculation under different simulation
conditions, and those polymers found with thermal conductivity above 0.300
W/m-K are mostly calculated to maintain values above this threshold despite
fluctuation in the exact values. A classification model is also constructed,
and similar results were obtained compared to the regression model in
predicting polymers with thermal conductivity above or below 0.300 W/m-K. The
strategy and results from this work may contribute to automating the design of

is parameterized in terms of a thermal gyrofrequency or, equivalently, a

By solving an extended Israel-Stewart-like system for the dissipative
quantities that enforces algebraic constraints via stiff-relaxation, we are
able to cast all first-order dissipative terms in flux-divergence form. This
allows us to apply traditional high-resolution shock capturing methods to the
equations, making the system suitable for the numerical study of highly
turbulent flows. We present several numerical tests to assess the robustness of
our numerical scheme in flat spacetime. The 14-moment closure can seamlessly
interpolate between the highly collisional limit found in neutron star mergers,
and the highly anisotropic limit of relativistic Braginskii
magnetohydrodynamics appropriate for weakly collisional plasmas in black-hole

transformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological
effects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the

draw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature

of light curve solution parameters of contact binaries. Our simulation is
realized by the Monte Carlo algorithm and Wilson-Devinney code. This method can
obtain the systematic and random error simultaneously. Within our 48 models,
the systematic errors are smaller than the random errors in most case.
According to the numerical calculations, it is found that the relative errors
of photometric mass ratios are less than 1% for totally eclipsing contact
binaries, while they are generally between 10% and 20% for partly eclipsing
ones. The effect of third light on the errors of photometric solution is also
investigated. With a third light, these errors are close to 10% for totally
eclipsing contact binaries. Specially, it is better to set the third light to
zero in flux if that light is very faint (e.g., less than 1% contribution in
luminosity), because such faint third light will bring big errors to the light
curve solutions.

yet challenging technique in many potential computer vision applications. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-generation feature interaction learning
(CFIL) framework for robust kinship verification. Particularly, an effective
collaborative weighting strategy is constructed to explore the characteristics
of cross-generation relations by corporately extracting features of both
parents and children image pairs. Specifically, we take parents and children as
a whole to extract the expressive local and non-local features. Different from
the traditional works measuring similarity by distance, we interpolate the
similarity calculations as the interior auxiliary weights into the deep CNN
architecture to learn the whole and natural features. These similarity weights
not only involve corresponding single points but also excavate the multiple
relationships cross points, where local and non-local features are calculated
by using these two kinds of distance measurements. Importantly, instead of
separately conducting similarity computation and feature extraction, we
integrate similarity learning and feature extraction into one unified learning
process. The integrated representations deduced from local and non-local
features can comprehensively express the informative semantics embedded in
images and preserve abundant correlation knowledge from image pairs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed model
compared to some state-of-the-art kinship verification methods.

Most of previous FSL approaches resort to the meta-learning paradigm, where the
model accumulates inductive bias through learning many training tasks so as to
solve a new unseen few-shot task. In contrast, we propose a simple approach to
exploit unlabeled data accompanying the few-shot task for improving few-shot
performance. Firstly, we propose a Dependency Maximization method based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator, which maximizes the
statistical dependency between the embedded feature of those unlabeled data and
their label predictions, together with the supervised loss over the support
set. We then use the obtained model to infer the pseudo-labels for those
unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose anInstance Discriminant Analysis to
evaluate the credibility of each pseudo-labeled example and select the most
faithful ones into an augmented support set to retrain the model as in the
first step. We iterate the above process until the pseudo-labels for the
unlabeled data becomes stable. Following the standard transductive and
semi-supervised FSL setting, our experiments show that the proposed method

Frobenius-Ehresmann structures. These structures are compared with Cartan
geometries in positive characteristic, as well as with higher-dimensional
generalizations of dormant indigenous bundles. In particular, we investigate
the conditions under which these geometric structures are equivalent to each
other. Also, we consider the classification problem of Frobenius-Ehresmann
structures on algebraic curves. The latter half of the present paper discusses
the deformation theory of indigenous bundles in the algebraic setting. The
tangent and obstruction spaces of various deformation functors are computed in
terms of the hypercohomology groups of certain complexes. As a consequence, we
formulate and prove the Ehresmann-Weil-Thurston principle for
Frobenius-Ehresmann structures. This fact asserts that deformations of a
variety equipped with a Frobenius-Ehresmann structure are completely determined
by their monodromy crystals.

Another main reason that contributes to this slow deployment is the lack of

participants pinpoint the specific issues related to these factors as
participants could review the pattern of their moods and emotions from past

recent years. The general setting consists of two phases: (1) Pre-train a
feature extraction model (FEM) with base data (has large amounts of labeled
samples). (2) Use the FEM to extract the features of novel data (with few
labeled samples and totally different categories from base data), then classify
them with the to-be-designed classifier. The adaptability of pre-trained FEM to
novel data determines the accuracy of novel features, thereby affecting the
final classification performances. To this end, how to appraise the pre-trained
FEM is the most crucial focus in the FSC community. It sounds like traditional
Class Activate Mapping (CAM) based methods can achieve this by overlaying
weighted feature maps. However, due to the particularity of FSC (e.g., there is
no backpropagation when using the pre-trained FEM to extract novel features),
we cannot activate the feature map with the novel classes. To address this
challenge, we propose a simple, flexible method, dubbed as Class-Irrelevant
Mapping (CIM). Specifically, first, we introduce dictionary learning theory and
view the channels of the feature map as the bases in a dictionary. Then we
utilize the feature map to fit the feature vector of an image to achieve the
corresponding channel weights. Finally, we overlap the weighted feature map for
visualization to appraise the ability of pre-trained FEM on novel data. For
fair use of CIM in evaluating different models, we propose a new measurement
index, called Feature Localization Accuracy (FLA). In experiments, we first
compare our CIM with CAM in regular tasks and achieve outstanding performances.
Next, we use our CIM to appraise several classical FSC frameworks without
considering the classification results and discuss them.

orbital parameters of BaBb and AB are relatively well constrained, this is not
the case for AaAb. A full characterisation of this quadruple system can provide
insights on the formation of such a complex system.
  The goal of this work is to determine the orbit of the AaAb subsystem and
refine the orbital solution of BaBb using multi-epoch interferometric
observations with the VLTI/PIONIER and radial velocities.
  The PIONIER observations provide relative astrometric positions and flux
ratios for both AaAa and BaBb subsystems. Combining the astrometric points with
radial velocity measurements, we determine the orbital parameters of both
subsystems.
  We refined the orbital solution of BaBb and derived, for the first time, the
full orbital solution of AaAb. We confirmed the polar configuration of the
circumbinary disk around BaBb. From our solutions, we also inferred the
dynamical masses of AaAb ($M_{Aa} = 0.93 \pm 0.09$ and $M_{Ab} = 0.29 \pm 0.02$
M$_{\odot}$). We also revisited the parameters of the AB outer orbit.
  Using the N-body simulation, we show that the system should be dynamically
stable over thousands of orbital periods and that it made preliminary
predictions for the transit of the disk in front of AaAb which is estimated to
start around 2026. We discuss the lack of a disk around AaAb, which can be
explained by the larger X-ray luminosity of AaAb, promoting faster
photo-evaporation of the disk. High-resolution infrared spectroscopic
observations would provide radial velocities of Aa and Ab (blended lines in
contemporary observations), which would allow us to calculate the dynamical
masses of Aa and Ab independently of the parallax of BaBb.

consistent with the existing findings using the geometric-optics arguments. For
the Schwarzschild black holes, we demonstrate the results numerically by
considering a transient spherical light source. Also, for the Kerr spacetimes,
we point out a potential difference between the resulting light echoes using
the geometric-optics approach and those obtained by the black hole perturbation
theory. Possible astrophysical implications of the present study are addressed.

a speed of about 430 km/s in the CME's lateral direction. One can identify the
separation process of the EUV wave from the CME bubble. The reflection effect
of the on-disk counterpart of this EUV wave was also observed when it
interacted with a remote active region. Six minutes after the first appearance
of the EUV wave, a large-scale quasi-periodic EUV train with a period of about
120 seconds appeared inside the CME bubble, which emanated from the flare
epicenter and propagated outward at an average speed up to 1100 km/s. In
addition, another narrow quasi-periodic EUV wave train was observed along a
closed-loop system connecting two adjacent active regions, which also emanated
from the flare epicenter, propagated at a speed of about475 km/s and with a

fast-mode magnetosonic waves, in which the large-scale dome-shaped EUV wave
ahead of the CME bubble was driven by the expansion of the CME bubble, while
the large-scale quasi-periodic EUV train within the CME bubble and the narrow
quasi-periodic EUV wave train along the closed-loop system were excited by the

based on the theory of fractional-dimension spaces. This extended version -
Relativistic Fractional-Dimension Gravity (RFDG) - is based on other existing
theories in the literature and might be useful for astrophysical and
cosmological applications.
  In particular, we review the mathematical theory for spaces with non-integer
dimensions and its connections with the non-relativistic NFDG. The
Euler-Lagrange equations for scalar fields can also be extended to spaces with
fractional dimensions, by adding an appropriate weight factor, and then can be
used to generalize the Laplacian operator for rectangular, spherical, and
cylindrical coordinates. In addition, the same weight factor can be added to
the standard Hilbert action in order to obtain the field equations, following
methods used for scalar-tensor models of gravity, multi-scale spacetimes, and
fractional gravity theories.
  We then apply the field equations to standard cosmology and to the
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. Using a suitable weight
$v_{t}\left(t\right)$, depending on the synchronous time $t$ and on a single
time-dimension parameter $\alpha _{t}$, we extend the Friedmann equations to
the RFDG case. This allows for the computation of the scale factor
$a\left(t\right)$ for different values of the fractional time-dimension $\alpha
_{t}$ and the comparison with standard cosmology results. Future additional
work on the subject, including studies of the cosmological late-time
acceleration, type Ia supernovae data, and related dark energy theory will be
needed to establish this model as a relativistic alternative theory of gravity.

and avoid the previously mentioned limitations simultaneously is critical.
Thanks to the recent success of graph contrastive learning, we leverage it to
learn embeddings of user behavior patterns adaptively instead of assigning a

Within the framework of loop quantum gravity, the quantum parameters in the GOP
model depend on the minimal area gap and the size of the discretization of the
physical states. In this model, a spacelike transition surface takes place of
the classical singularity. By means of coordinate transformations, we first
extend the metric to the white hole region, and find that the geometric
structure of the quantum black hole is similar to the wormhole structure, and
the radius of the most quantum region is equal to the wormhole radius. In
addition, we show that the energy conditions are violated not only at throat,
but also at horizons and the spatial infinities. In order to show how the
quantum effects affect the spacetimes, we calculate the Ricci and Kretschmann
scalars at different places. It turns out that, as expected, the most quantum
region is at the throat. Finally, we consider the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of
massless scalar field perturbations, electromagnetic field perturbations, and
axial gravitational perturbations. QNMs in the Eikonal limits are also
considered. As anticipated, the spectrum of QNMs deviates from that of the
classical case due to quantum effects. Interestingly, our results show that the
quasinormal frequencies of the perturbations share the same qualitative
tendency while setting quantum parameters with various values in this effective

Quanvolution and QNN can be used to create an end-to-end QML model for image

  potential high-Tc superconductor","Submitted for publication",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Very recently carbon-rich NaC6 with sodalite-like structure has been
predicted to show superconducting transition temperature above 100 K at
relatively low applied (compared to high-Tc hydrides) hydrostatic pressures. We
have investigated the pressure dependent structural, elastic, electronic,
superconducting state, and optoelectronic properties of NaC6 in this study.
Some important thermophysical properties have also been explored. The elastic
properties along with Poisson's and Pugh's ratios and optoelectronic parameters
are investigated for the first time. NaC6 was found to be structurally stable
only at high pressures at and above 40 GPa, in agreement with previous study.
The compound is highly ductile and the chemical bonding is predominantly
metallic in nature. The Debye temperature shows strong pressure dependence. The
Gruneisen parameter also exhibits significant pressure dependence. The
electronic band structure reveals metallic character and consists of highly
dispersive and almost flat bands crossing the Fermi level. Both the electronic
density of states at the Fermi level and repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential
increase gradually with increasing pressure in the range 40 GPa to 70 Gpa. The
degree of dispersion in the E(k) curves depend weakly on pressure both in the
valence and conduction bands. The optical parameters spectra, studied for the
first time, correspond well with the electronic band structure. NaC6 absorbs
and reflects electromagnetic radiation quite efficiently in the mid-ultraviolet
region. Superconducting transition temperatures of NaC6 have been estimated at
different pressures and compared with previously reported values. The effects
of various parameters on Tc have been discussed in details.

  Education",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Medical students will almost inevitably encounter powerful medical AI systems
early in their careers. Yet, contemporary medical education does not adequately
equip students with the basic clinical proficiency in medical AI needed to use
these tools safely and effectively. Education reform is urgently needed, but
not easily implemented, largely due to an already jam-packed medical curricula.
In this article, we propose an education reform framework as an effective and
efficient solution, which we call the Embedded AI Ethics Education Framework.
Unlike other calls for education reform to accommodate AI teaching that are
more radical in scope, our framework is modest and incremental. It leverages
existing bioethics or medical ethics curricula to develop and deliver content
on the ethical issues associated with medical AI, especially the harms of
technology misuse, disuse, and abuse that affect the risk-benefit analyses at
the heart of healthcare. In doing so, the framework provides a simple tool for
going beyond the ""What?"" and the ""Why?"" of medical AI ethics education, to
answer the ""How?"", giving universities, course directors, and/or professors a
broad road-map for equipping their students with the necessary clinical
proficiency in medical AI.

  Maximization",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing unsupervised document hashing methods are mostly established on
generative models. Due to the difficulties of capturing long dependency
structures, these methods rarely model the raw documents directly, but instead
to model the features extracted from them (e.g. bag-of-words (BOW), TFIDF). In
this paper, we propose to learn hash codes from BERT embeddings after observing
their tremendous successes on downstream tasks. As a first try, we modify
existing generative hashing models to accommodate the BERT embeddings. However,
little improvement is observed over the codes learned from the old BOW or TFIDF
features. We attribute this to the reconstruction requirement in the generative
hashing, which will enforce irrelevant information that is abundant in the BERT
embeddings also compressed into the codes. To remedy this issue, a new
unsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual
information (MI) maximization principle. Specifically, the method first
constructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks
to maximize their mutual information. Experimental results on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate hash codes
that outperform existing ones learned from BOW features by a substantial
margin.

different types of nodes and connections. Heterogeneous graph neural network
model aims to embed nodes or subgraphs into low-dimensional vector space for
various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, etc.
Although several models were proposed recently, they either only aggregate
information from the same type of neighbors, or just indiscriminately treat
homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors in the same way. Based on these
observations, we propose a new heterogeneous graph neural network model named
HMSG to comprehensively capture structural, semantic and attribute information
from both homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. Specifically, we first
decompose the heterogeneous graph into multiple metapath-based homogeneous and
heterogeneous subgraphs, and each subgraph associates specific semantic and
structural information. Then message aggregation methods are applied to each
subgraph independently, so that information can be learned in a more targeted
and efficient manner. Through a type-specific attribute transformation, node
attributes can also be transferred among different types of nodes. Finally, we
fuse information from subgraphs together to get the complete representation.
Extensive experiments on several datasets for node classification, node
clustering and link prediction tasks show that HMSG achieves the best
performance in all evaluation metrics than state-of-the-art baselines.

This type of inverse and ill-posed problems arises in a variety of real-world

accordance with the weak solvability result for the forward problem, we focus
on the inverse problem with high-order Sobolev-Gevrey smoothness and with
Sobolev measurements. As expected from the well-known results for the linear
case, we prove that this nonlinear spectral regularization possesses a
logarithmic rate of convergence in a high-order Sobolev norm. The proof can be
done by the verification of variational source condition; this way validates
such a fine strategy in the framework of inverse problems for nonlinear partial
differential equations. Ultimately, we study a semi-discrete version of the
regularization method for a class of reaction-diffusion problems with
non-degenerate nonlinearity. The convergence of this iterative scheme is also
investigated.

and the differences among these models are discussed in details. We find that
new physics effects appearing in the renormalized $hZZ$ vertex almost govern
the behavior of $\Delta R^{hZ}$, and it takes a negative value in most cases.
The possible size of $\Delta R^{hZ}$ reaches several percent under the
theoretical and experimental bounds. We also analyze the deviation $\Delta
R^{hZ}_{XY}$ in the total cross section times decay branching ratios of the
discovered Higgs boson by utilizing the $\texttt{H-COUP}$ program. It is found
that the four types of 2HDMs can be discriminated by analyzing the correlation
between $\Delta R^{hZ}_{\tau\tau}$ and $\Delta R^{hZ}_{bb}$ and those between
$\Delta R^{hZ}_{\tau\tau}$ and $\Delta R^{hZ}_{cc}$. Furthermore, the HSM and
the IDM can be discriminated from the 2HDMs by measuring $\Delta R^{hZ}_{WW}$.
These signatures can be tested by precision measurements at future Higgs
factories such as the International Linear Collider.

  tactical and operational levels: Which one matters most?",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Simulating a process of crowd evacuation using an agent-based
model requires modellers to specify values of a whole range of parameters each
determining certain aspects of evacuee behaviour. While potential sensitivity
of simulation outputs to each single parameter is undoubted, one critical
question is that to which class of parameters such numerical models are most
sensitive when estimating evacuation times? The question is of significance
given that available data and resources for calibration are limited and
priorities often need to be made. Methods: Here, we employ a simulation model
of evacuation comprised of multiple integrated layers. After providing an
overview of the calibration procedure for key parameters, we perform extensive
sensitivity analyses in complex simulated spaces with large crowds to answer
the above question. Findings: Our analyses showed that, once parameters are
contrasted on a consistent and comparable scale, estimates of simulated
evacuation time are, by far margins, most sensitive to the value of mechanical
movement parameters at locomotion layer, those that determine the discharge
rate at bottlenecks. The next most critical set of parameters were those that
determine the rate of direction choice adaptation followed by those that
determine the effect of inter-individual interactions on direction choices.
Conclusions: These results suggest that, in order to produce realistic
evacuation times using simulation, the most critical aspect is, by far,
perfecting the simulated flowrates at bottlenecks. Implications: This
highlights the crucial need for furthering the accuracy of existing empirical
estimates for exit capacity; and developing more rigorous calibration methods
for parameters that determine flowrates at bottlenecks. If a model does not
produce bottleneck flowrates accurately, efforts to refine other aspects of
simulation might be in vain.

localization technique that can work on a fully hybrid IoUT network where the
nodes can communicate using either optical, magnetic induction, and acoustic
technologies. These technologies are already used for communication in the
underwater environment; however, lacking localization solutions. Optical and
magnetic induction communication achieves higher data rates for short
communication. On the contrary, acoustic waves provide a low data rate for
long-range underwater communication. The proposed method collectively uses
optical, magnetic induction, and acoustic communication-based ranging to
estimate the underwater sensor nodes' final locations. Moreover, we also
analyze the proposed scheme by deriving the hybrid Cramer Rao lower bound

developed for main sequence stars in the range of 6400 K < $T_{\rm eff}$ <
20000 K with log$g$ > 3.44. The MTGR allows the simple estimation of the masses
of stars from their effective temperatures and surface gravities. It can be
used for solar metallicity and can be rescaled for any metallicity within -1.00
< [Fe/H] < 0.7. The effect of alpha-enhanced compositions can also be
considered with the help of correction terms.
  It is aimed to develop an MTGR that can estimate the masses of main-sequence
stars from their atmospheric parameters. One advantage of an MTGR over the
classical mass-luminosity relations is that its mass estimation is based on
parameters that can be obtained by purely spectroscopic methods and, therefore,
the interstellar extinction or reddening do not have to be known. The use of
surface gravity ($g$) also relates an MTGR with stellar evolution and provides
a more reliable mass estimation.
  A synthetical MTGR is obtained from theoretical isochrones using a
Levenberg-Marquardt chi-square minimization algorithm. The validity of the MTGR
is then checked by testing over 278 binary components with precise absolute
masses. Very good agreement has been obtained between the absolute masses of
278 binary star components and their masses estimated from the MTGR. A
mathematical expression is also given to calculate the propagated uncertainties
of the MTGR masses.
  For the typical uncertainties in atmospheric parameters and metallicity, the
typical uncertainties in the masses estimated from the MTGR mostly remain
around 5-9%. The fact that this uncertainty level is only on average about
three times as large as that of the absolute masses indicates that the MTGR is
a very powerful tool for stellar mass estimation. A computer code, mtgr.pro,
written in GDL/IDL is also provided for the relation.

approaches to expanding encapsulated key size, and optimized implementation
coding. We focus on Kyber (now in the Round-3 finalist of NIST PQC

  By careful analysis, we first observe that the algorithmic design of Kyber
and Aigis can be optimized by the mechanism of asymmetric key consensus with
noise (AKCN) proposed in \cite{JZ16,JZ19}. Specifically, the decryption process
can be simplified with AKCN, leading to a both faster and less error-prone
decryption process. Moreover, the AKCN-based optimized version has perfect
compatibility with the deployment of Kyber/Aigis in reality, as they can run on
the same parameters, the same public key, and the same encryption process.
  We make a systematic study of the variants of NTT proposed in recent years
for extending its applicability scope, make concrete analysis of their exact
computational complexity, and in particular show their equivalence. We then
present a new variant named hybrid-NTT (H-NTT), combining the advantages of
existing NTT methods, and derive its optimality in computational complexity.
The H-NTT technique not only has larger applicability scope but also allows for
modular and unified implementation codes of NTT operations even with varying
module dimensions.
  We analyze and compare the different approaches to expand the size of key to
be encapsulated (specifically, 512-bit key for dimension of 1024), and conclude
with the most economic approach. To mitigate the compatibility issue in

  Inference Approach",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prescriptive process monitoring is a family of techniques to optimize the
performance of a business process by triggering interventions at runtime.
Existing prescriptive process monitoring techniques assume that the number of
interventions that may be triggered is unbounded. In practice, though, specific
interventions consume resources with finite capacity. For example, in a loan
origination process, an intervention may consist of preparing an alternative
loan offer to increase the applicant's chances of taking a loan. This
intervention requires a certain amount of time from a credit officer, and thus,
it is not possible to trigger this intervention in all cases. This paper
proposes a prescriptive process monitoring technique that triggers
interventions to optimize a cost function under fixed resource constraints. The
proposed technique relies on predictive modeling to identify cases that are
likely to lead to a negative outcome, in combination with causal inference to
estimate the effect of an intervention on the outcome of the case. These
outputs are then used to allocate resources to interventions to maximize a cost
function. A preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that the proposed
approach produces a higher net gain than a purely predictive (non-causal)
baseline.

outbursts has been a problem for several decades. It is still not clear yet
what controls the spectral evolution of these objects from the hard to the soft
states and then back to the hard states at the end of the outburst, tracing the
well-known hysteresis cycle in the hardness-intensity diagram. Moreover, the
link between the spectral states and the presence/absence of radio emission is
still highly debated. In a series of papers, we developed a model composed of a
truncated outer standard accretion disk (SAD, from the solution of Shakura and
Sunyaev) and an inner jet emitting disk (JED). In this paradigm, the JED plays
the role of the hot corona while simultaneously explaining the presence of a
radio jet. Our goal is to apply for the first time direct fitting procedures of
the JED-SAD model to the hard states of four outbursts of GX 339-4 observed
during the 2000-2010 decade by RXTE, combined with simultaneous or quasi
simultaneous ATCA observations. We built JED-SAD model tables usable in Xspec
as well as a reflection model table based on the Xillver model. We apply our
model to the 452 hard state observations obtained with RXTE/PCA. We were able
to correctly fit the X-ray spectra and simultaneously reproduce the radio flux.
We show that the functional dependency of the radio emission on the model
parameters (mainly the accretion rate and the transition radius between the JED
and the SAD) is similar between all the rising phases of the different
outbursts of GX 339-4. But it is significantly different from the functional
dependency obtained in the decaying phases. This result strongly suggests a
change in the radiative and/or dynamical properties of the ejection between the
beginning and the end of the outburst. We discuss possible scenarios that could
explain these differences.

leave open where the inclusion is proper. In this paper, we resolve this open
problem and show $ALG= \mathbb{R}_\text{LCRN} \subsetneqq
\mathbb{R}_\text{RTCRN}$. However, their definition of real-time computation is
fragile in the sense that it is sensitive to perturbations in initial
conditions. To resolve this flaw, we further require a CRN to withstand these
perturbations. In doing so, we arrive at a discrete model of memory. This
approach has several benefits. First, a bounded CRN may compute values
approximately in finite time. Second, a CRN can tolerate small perturbations of
its species' concentrations. Third, taking a measurement of a CRN's state only
requires precision proportional to the exactness of these approximations.
Lastly, if a CRN requires only finite memory, this model and Turing machines
are equivalent under real-time simulations.

of petaelectronvolts (PeV) and beyond at astrophysical particle accelerators
called 'PeVatrons' inside our Galaxy. Although a characteristic feature of a
PeVatron is expected to be a hard gamma-ray energy spectrum that extends beyond
100 teraelectronvolts (TeV) without a cutoff, none of the currently known
sources exhibits such a spectrum due to the low maximum energy of accelerated
cosmic rays or insufficient detector sensitivity around 100 TeV. Here we report
the observation of gamma-ray emission from the supernova remnant G106.3+2.7
above 10 TeV. This work provides flux data points up to and above 100 TeV and
indicates that the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission above 10 TeV is well
correlated with a molecular cloud rather than the pulsar PSR J2229+6114.
Regarding the gamma-ray emission mechanism of G106.3+2.7, this morphological
feature appears to favor a hadronic origin via the {\pi}0 decay caused by
accelerated relativistic protons over a leptonic one via the inverse-Compton
scattering by relativistic electrons. Furthermore, we point out that an X-ray

information to firmly establish the hadronic scenario as the mechanism of

response from the human activity recognition research community. This paper
proposes an activity recognition method. The knowledge model is in the form of
ontology, the state-of-the-art in knowledge representation and reasoning. The
ontology starts with probabilistic information about subjects' low-level
activities and location and then is populated with the assertion axioms learned
from data or defined by the user. Unlike methods that choose only the most
probable candidate from sensor readings, the proposed method keeps multiple
candidates with the known degree of confidence for each one and involves them
in decision making. Using this method, the system is more flexible to deal with
unreliable readings from sensors, and the final recognition rate is improved.
Besides, to resolve the scalability problem, a system is designed and
implemented to do reasoning and storing in a relational database management
system. Numerical evaluation and conceptual benchmarking prove the proposed

to set up a cosmological N-body simulation. In this work, we revisit the
numerical convergence of pre-initial conditions on dark matter halo properties
using a set of simulations which only differs in initial particle loads, i.e.
grid, glass, and the newly introduced capacity constrained Voronoi tessellation
(CCVT). We find that the median halo properties agree fairly well (i.e. within
a convergence level of a few per cent) among simulations running from different
initial loads. We also notice that for some individual haloes cross-matched
among different simulations, the relative difference of their properties
sometimes can be several tens of per cent. By looking at the evolution history
of these poorly converged haloes, we find that they are usually merging haloes
or haloes have experienced recent merger events, and their merging processes in
different simulations are out-of-sync, making the convergence of halo
properties become poor temporarily. We show that, comparing to the simulation
starting with an anisotropic grid load, the simulation with an isotropic CCVT
load converges slightly better to the simulation with a glass load, which is
also isotropic. Among simulations with different pre-initial conditions, haloes
in higher density environments tend to have their properties converged slightly
better. Our results confirm that CCVT loads behave as well as the widely used
grid and glass loads at small scales, and for the first time we quantify the
convergence of two independent isotropic particle loads (i.e. glass and CCVT)

the general hypercube has advantages in solving the mismatch problems in P2P

As a result, blockchains constructed by the proposed topology can reach the CAP

important topic in solar physics. Spectroscopic observation is an effective way
to explore the plasma properties, but the spectral observations of eruptive
prominences are rare. In this paper we will introduce an eruptive polar crown
prominence with spectral observations from the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS), and try to explain some phenomena that are rarely reported
in previous works. The eruptive prominence experiences a slow-rise and
fast-rise phase, while the line-of-sight motions of the prominence plasma could
be divided into three periods: two hours before the fast-rise phase, opposite
Doppler shifts are found at the two sides of the prominence axis;then, red
shifts dominate the prominence gradually; in the fast-rise phase, the
prominence gets to be blue-shifted. During the second period, a faint component
appears in Mg II k window with a narrow line width and a large red shift. A
faint region is also found in AIA 304-angstrom images along the prominence
spine, and the faint region gets darker during the expansion of the spine. We
propose that the opposite Doppler shifts in the first period are a feature of
the polar crown prominence that we studied. The red shifts in the second period
are possibly due to mass drainage during the elevation of the prominence spine,
which could accelerate the eruption in return. The blue shifts in the third
period are due to that the prominence erupts toward the observer. We suggest
that the faint component appears due to the decreasing of the plasma density,
and the latter results from the expansion of the prominence spine.

Pareto-optimal designs, which can reduce the storage overhead of the DNN by
~30MB for a quality loss of less than 0.5%. To enable low-cost embedded DNNs,

  one-dimensional photonic crystal at normal incidence",,,,,"physics.optics physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One-dimensional photonic crystals (1D PC) represent a class of periodic
optical material, composed of alternating media with different dielectric
constants along one direction. The most important property of 1D PCs is their
photonic band-gap. However, multiple reflective bands are rarely reported in
this research area. In this paper we demonstrate the tunability of multiple
reflective bands in conventional 1D PC structure and 1D PC heterostructure. For
both two types of 1D PC construction, positions of multiple reflective bands
can be regulated under certain principles. In addition, structural color is
revealed by transforming reflection spectra into CIE coordinates. It is
indicated that the CIE coordinate shifts caused by multiple reflective bands
behave quite different compared to those caused by one major photonic band-gap.
The two approaches reported in this work may provide insights for the
application of 1D PC in areas such as displays, sensors, and decoration.

segmentation. The performance of 3D CNNs is greatly influenced by the dataset
while the public airway datasets are mainly clean CT scans with coarse
annotation, thus difficult to be generalized to noisy CT scans (e.g. COVID-19
CT scans). In this work, we proposed a new dual-stream network to address the
variability between the clean domain and noisy domain, which utilizes the clean
CT scans and a small amount of labeled noisy CT scans for airway segmentation.
We designed two different encoders to extract the transferable clean features
and the unique noisy features separately, followed by two independent decoders.
Further on, the transferable features are refined by the channel-wise feature
recalibration and Signed Distance Map (SDM) regression. The feature
recalibration module emphasizes critical features and the SDM pays more
attention to the bronchi, which is beneficial to extracting the transferable
topological features robust to the coarse labels. Extensive experimental
results demonstrated the obvious improvement brought by our proposed method.
Compared to other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, our method
accurately segmented more bronchi in the noisy CT scans.

latency-critical services under memory pressure in a multi-tenant system. We
address memory pressure for latency-critical services via fast memory

analyze the default memory management mechanism provided by GNU/Linux system

mechanism in user space that adaptively reserves memory for latency-critical

implement Hermes in GNU C Library. Experimental result shows that Hermes
reduces the average and the $99^{th}$ percentile memory allocation latency by
up to 54.4% and 62.4% for a micro benchmark, respectively. For two real-world

is that the dimensionless gyration radius ($k$) should be smaller than the

that their evolutionary states are similar with those of normal W UMa contact

One of the largest of these is the class of Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) which

Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs). Although a few deflagration studies have
been carried out, the full diversity of the class is not captured yet. We
therefore present a parameter study of single-spot ignited deflagrations with
varying ignition locations, central densities, metallicities and compositions.
We also explore a rigidly rotating progenitor and carry out 3D hydrodynamic
simulations, nuclear network calculations and radiative transfer. The new
models extend the range in brightness covered by previous studies to the lower
end. Our explosions produce $^{56}$Ni masses from $5.8 \times 10^{-3}$ to $9.2
\times 10^{-2}\,M_\odot$. In spite of the wide exploration of the parameter
space the main characteristics of the models are primarily driven by the mass
of $^{56}$Ni. Secondary parameters have too little impact to explain the
observed trend among faint SNe~Iax. We report kick velocities of the bound
explosion remnants from $6.9$ to $369.8\,$km$\,s^{-1}$. The wide exploration of
the parameter space and viewing-angle effects in the radiative transfer lead to
a significant spread in the synthetic observables. The trends towards the faint
end of the class are, however, not reproduced. This motivates a quantification
of the systematic uncertainties in the modeling procedure and the influence of
the $^{56}$Ni-rich bound remnant. While the pure deflagration scenario remains
a favorable explanation for bright and intermediate luminosity SNe~Iax, the
possibility that SNe~Iax do not consist of a single explosion scenario needs to
be considered.

alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of
user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between
users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with
users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational

messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot

simple butterfly-like molecular motor inside nanopores of various radii filled
with a viscous medium. The medium is modeled with a versatile potential that
may be adjusted to represent a large number of materials. It was found
previously that the motor folding not only increases its displacement but also
creates elementary diffusion processes inside the medium, related to the
opening angle of the motor folding. The presence of these processes changes the
medium dynamics and in turn affects the motor displacement. Therefore we test
the motor displacement with different activations of the medium inside the pore
by varying the motor opening angles. We find that the optima of the motor
displacement oscillate with pore sizes and that the optimal radii depend on the
activation of the medium. These results imply that it is possible to choose the
activation or opening angle that optimizes the motor displacement for a given
pore size. Results also show that the activation decreases strongly the
confinement hindering of the motor motion, in particular for small pores.
Finally, analyzing the distribution probability of the motor position and the
density of elementary motions we find that the motor is mainly located in the
center of the pore. We find spikes in the density of elementary motions when
the motor goes away from the center, suggesting important contributions of the
motor bouncing motions on the pore walls.

A proper estimate of the chromospheric magnetic fields is believed
to improve modelling of both active region and coronal mass ejection evolution.
Aims. We investigate the similarity between the chromospheric magnetic field
inferred from observations and the field obtained from a magnetohydrostatic
(MHS) extrapolation. Methods. Based Fe i 6173 {\AA} and Ca ii 8542 {\AA}
observations of NOAA active region 12723, we employed the spatially-regularised
weak-field approximation (WFA) to derive the vector magnetic field in the
chromosphere from Ca ii, as well as non-LTE inversions of Fe i and Ca ii to
infer a model atmosphere for selected regions. Milne-Eddington inversions of Fe
i serve as photospheric boundary for the MHS model that delivers the
three-dimensional field, gas pressure and density. Results. For the
line-of-sight component, the MHS chromospheric field generally agrees with the
non-LTE inversions and WFA, but tends to be weaker than those when larger in
magnitude than 300 G. The observationally inferred transverse component is
stronger, especially in magnetically weaker regions, yet the qualitative
distribution with height is similar to the MHS results. For either field
component the MHS chromospheric field lacks the fine structure derived from the
inversions. Furthermore, the MHS model does not recover the magnetic imprint
from a set of high fibrils connecting the main polarities. Conclusions. The MHS
extrapolation and WFA provide a qualitatively similar chromospheric field,
where the azimuth of the former is better aligned with Ca ii 8542 {\AA} fibrils
than that of the WFA, especially outside strong-field concentrations. The
amount of structure as well as the transverse field strengths are
underestimated by the MHS extrapolation. This underscores the importance of
considering a chromospheric magnetic field constraint in data-driven modelling
of active regions.

small dimensions only. Here we characterize conditions for classes of reaction
networks for which TFPVs arise by turning off reactions (by setting rate
parameters to zero), or by removing certain species (which relates to the
classical quasi-steady state approach to model reduction). In particular, we
obtain definitive results for the class of complex balanced reaction networks

remote execution of quantum operations while only using classical controls.
This device extends to quantum computing the classical concept of a secure
enclave which isolates a computation from its environment to provide privacy
and tamper-resistance. Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single-qubit
rotations, but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum
computation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More
precisely, attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client
controlling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server
solely using classical communication. We investigate the security of our
QEnclave by modeling it as an ideal functionality named Remote State Rotation.
We show that this resource, similar to previously introduced functionality of
remote state preparation, allows blind delegated quantum computing with perfect
security. Our proof relies on standard tools from delegated quantum computing.
Working in the Abstract Cryptography framework, we show a construction of
remote state preparation from remote state rotation preserving the security. An
immediate consequence is the weakening of the requirements for blind delegated
computation. While previous delegated protocols were relying on a client that
can either generate or measure quantum states, we show that this same
functionality can be achieved with a client that only transforms quantum states
without generating or measuring them.

weather prediction models can be introduced by different sources. These can be
the forcing and boundary conditions, the representation of orography, the
accuracy of the numerical schemes determining the evolution of humidity and
temperature, but large contributions are due to the parametrization of
microphysics and the parametrization of processes in the surface and boundary
layers. These schemes typically contain several tunable parameters that are
either not physical or only crudely known, leading to model errors.
Traditionally, the numerical values of these model parameters are chosen by
manual model tuning. More objectively, they can be estimated from observations
by the augmented state approach during the data assimilation. Alternatively, in
this work, we look at the problem of parameter estimation through an artificial
intelligence lens by training two types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to
estimate several parameters of the one-dimensional modified shallow-water model
as a function of the observations or analysis of the atmospheric state. Through
perfect model experiments, we show that Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and
Bayesian approximations of point estimate neural networks (NNs) are able to
estimate model parameters and their relevant statistics. The estimation of
parameters combined with data assimilation for the state decreases the initial
state errors even when assimilating sparse and noisy observations. The
sensitivity to the number of ensemble members, observation coverage, and neural
network size is shown. Additionally, we use the method of layer-wise relevance
propagation to gain insight into how the ANNs are learning and discover that
they naturally select only a few gridpoints that are subject to strong winds
and rain to make their predictions of chosen parameters.

to host applications at scale. One of their key features is autoscaling, which
automatically adjusts cloud resources (compute, memory, storage) in order to
adapt to the demands of applications. However, the scope of cloud autoscaling
is limited to the datacenter hosting the cloud and it doesn't apply uniformly
to the allocation of network resources. In I/O-constrained or data-in-motion
use cases this can lead to severe performance degradation for the application.
For example, when the load on a cloud service increases and the Wide Area
Network (WAN) connecting the datacenter to the Internet becomes saturated, the
application flows experience an increase in delay and loss. In many cases this
is dealt with overprovisioning network capacity, which introduces additional
costs and inefficiencies.
  On the other hand, thanks to the concept of ""Network as Code"", the WAN
exposes a set of APIs that can be used to dynamically allocate and de-allocate
capacity on-demand. In this paper we propose extending the concept of cloud
autoscaling into the network to address this limitation. This way, applications
running in the cloud can communicate their networking requirements, like
bandwidth or traffic profile, to a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller
or Network as a Service (NaaS) platform. Moreover, we aim to define the
concepts of vertical and horizontal autoscaling applied to networking. We
present a prototype that automatically allocates bandwidth to the underlay
network, according to the requirements of the applications hosted in
Kubernetes. Finally, we discuss open research challenges.

MHD simulations. A model of a gravitationally stratified expanding straight
coronal loop, stretching from photosphere to photosphere, is perturbed at one
footpoint by an acoustic driver with a period of 370 seconds. For this period
acoustic cutoff regions are present below the transition region (TR). About 2%

the driven waves into account, the waves have a propagating nature below and

standing waves cause an oscillation of the TR height. In addition, fast or
leaky sausage body-like waves might have been excited close to the base of the

and rainy images is practical and valuable as acquiring paired real-world data
is almost infeasible. However, without the paired data as the supervision,
learning a SID network is challenging. Moreover, simply using existing unpaired
learning methods (e.g., unpaired adversarial learning and cycle-consistency
constraints) in the SID task is insufficient to learn the underlying
relationship from rainy inputs to clean outputs as there exists significant
domain gap between the rainy and clean images. In this paper, we develop an
effective unpaired SID adversarial framework which explores mutual properties
of the unpaired exemplars by a dual contrastive learning manner in a deep
feature space, named as DCD-GAN. The proposed method mainly consists of two
cooperative branches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive
Guidance Branch (CGB). Specifically, BTB exploits full advantage of the
circulatory architecture of adversarial consistency to generate abundant
exemplar pairs and excavates latent feature distributions between two domains
by equipping it with bidirectional mapping. Simultaneously, CGB implicitly
constrains the embeddings of different exemplars in the deep feature space by
encouraging the similar feature distributions closer while pushing the
dissimilar further away, in order to better facilitate rain removal and help
image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs
favorably against existing unpaired deraining approaches on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, and generates comparable results against several
fully-supervised or semi-supervised models.

relations, has been widely explored in vision tasks. However, when used in
video inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method
still suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch
splitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a
Transformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion
based on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split
divides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the
contrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a
whole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two
modules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and
de-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens
and features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for
more effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in
synthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer,
we elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward
network, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D
structure. And, the sub-patch level feature fusion ability is further enhanced.
In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our proposed FuseFormer
surpasses state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct detailed analysis to
examine its superiority.

in all spheres of society. Though social media provide platforms for expressing
news and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer
volumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and
rumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's
opinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very
important to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to
prevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification
of social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as
it is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous
studies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter.
These approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context
features from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours.
Manually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume
of tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising
sentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the
usual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to
represent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual
meaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by
using various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved
the accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.

questions remain about their nature and the environments in which the emission
takes place. Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt emission have long
been theorized to be able to answer most of these questions. The POLAR detector
was a dedicated GRB polarimeter developed by a Swiss, Chinese and Polish
collaboration. The instrument was launched, together with the second Chinese
Space Lab, the Tiangong-2, in September 2016 after which it took 6 months of
scientific data. During this period POLAR detected 55 GRBs as well as several
pulsars. From the analysis of the GRB polarization catalog we see that the
prompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized. There is, however, the
caveat that within single pulses there are strong hints of an evolving
polarization angle which washes out the polarization degree in the time
integrated analysis. Building on the success of the POLAR mission, the POLAR-2
instrument is currently under development. POLAR-2 is a Swiss, Chinese, Polish

least 50 GRBs per year with a precision equal or higher than the best results
published by POLAR. POLAR-2 thereby aims to make the prompt polarization a
standard observable and produce catalogs of the gamma-ray polarization of GRBs.
Here we will present an overview of the POLAR mission and all its scientific
measurement results. Additionally, we will present an overview of the future

transient events. In this regard, a first generation of dedicated gamma-ray

6 months of operation, the POLAR mission detected 55 GRBs, among which 14 have
been analyzed in detail, reporting a low polarization degree and a hint of a
temporal evolution of the polarization angle. Starting early 2024 and based on
the legacy of the POLAR results, the POLAR-2 instrument will aim to provide a

the GRB polarization thanks to its large and efficient polarimeter. Several

cybersecurity companies and researchers. A fundamental part of such systems is
the sandbox that provides an instrumented and isolated environment (virtualized
or emulated) for any user to upload and run unknown artifacts and identify
potentially malicious behaviors. The provided API and the wealth of information
inthe reports produced by these services have also helped attackers test the
efficacy of numerous techniques to make malware hard to detect.The most common
technique used by malware for evading the analysis system is to monitor the
execution environment, detect the presence of any debugging artifacts, and hide
its malicious behavior if needed. This is usually achieved by looking for
signals suggesting that the execution environment does not belong to a the
native machine, such as specific memory patterns or behavioral traits of
certain CPU instructions.
  In this paper, we show how an attacker can evade detection on such online
services by incorporating a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm into a malware
sample. Specifically, we leverage the asymptotic behavior of the computational
cost of PoW algorithms when they run on some classes of hardware platforms to
effectively detect a non bare-metal environment of the malware sandbox
analyzer. To prove the validity of this intuition, we design and implement the
POW-HOW framework, a tool to automatically implement sandbox detection
strategies and embed a test evasion program into an arbitrary malware sample.
Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed evasion technique is durable,
hard to fingerprint, and reduces existing malware detection rate by a factor of
10. Moreover, we show how bare-metal environments cannot scale with actual
malware submissions rates for consumer services.

basic statistical tools available for scalar and vector data are no longer

the feature of two domains using global structural statistics. The two schemes

neighbors of the graphical structure of samples and performs distribution
adaptation and knowledge adaptation over Grassmann manifold. the former treats

plasma dynamics of multicharged ion tin LPP. Results of simulations for various
laser pulse durations and 75-600 mJ pulse energies with Gaussian and
experimentally taken temporal profiles are discussed. It is found that if the
mass of the target is big enough to provide the plasma flux required (the
considered case) a kind of dynamic quasi-stationary plasma flux is formed. In
this dynamic quasi-stationary plasma flux, an interlayer of relatively cold tin
vapor with mass density of 1-2 g/cm3 is formed between the liquid tin droplet
and low density plasma of the critical layer. Expanding of the tin vapor from
the droplet provides the plasma flux to the critical layer. In critical layer
the plasma is heated up and expands faster. In the simulation results with
spherical liquid tin target, the CE into 2${\pi}$ is of 4% for 30 ns FWHM and
just slightly lower - of 3.67% for 240 ns FWHM for equal laser intensities of

is conditioned by an increasing of radiation re-absorption by expanding plasma
from the target, as more cold plasma is produced with longer pulse. The
calculated direction diagrams of in-band EUV emission permit to optimize a

degradation. The performance difference between the refined and rough

whereby the relationship between the features and the target to be predicted
changes. Mitigating concept drift is an essential part of operationalizing
machine learning models in general, but is of particular importance in
networking's highly dynamic deployment environments. In this paper, we first
characterize concept drift in a large cellular network for a major metropolitan
area in the United States. We find that concept drift occurs across many
important key performance indicators (KPIs), independently of the model,
training set size, and time interval -- thus necessitating practical approaches
to detect, explain, and mitigate it. We then show that frequent model
retraining with newly available data is not sufficient to mitigate concept
drift, and can even degrade model accuracy further. Finally, we develop a new
methodology for concept drift mitigation, Local Error Approximation of Features
(LEAF). LEAF works by detecting drift; explaining the features and time
intervals that contribute the most to drift; and mitigates it using forgetting
and over-sampling. We evaluate LEAF against industry-standard mitigation
approaches (notably, periodic retraining) with more than four years of cellular

present a study of a discretely creased mechanism as a model to investigate the
mechanics of the basic geometric building block of kirigami--the e-cone. We
consider an annular disk with a single radial slit discritised by a series of
radial creases connecting kinematically flat rigid panels. The creases allow
both relative rotation and separation between panels, capturing both bending
and stretching deformations. Admissible equilibrium configurations are obtained
by penalising these deformations using elastic springs with stiffnesses derived
from compatible continuum plate deformations. This provides a tool to study
both inextensible and extensible e-cone configurations due to opening of the
slit and rotation of its lips. This creased model hence offers the possibility
to study the e-cone away from its isometric limit, i.e., for plates with finite
thickness, and explore the full range of post-buckling (far-from-threshold)
behaviour as well as initial buckling (near-threshold) instability. Our local
approach provides a fundamental understanding of kirigami phenomenology,
underpinned by a proper theoretical approach to geometry and mechanics.

(JIT) communication, to support client-server applications with stringent
request-response latency requirement. Of interest is not just the round-trip
delay of the network, but the actual request-response latency experienced by
the application. The JIT framework contains two salient features. At the client
side, the communication layer will 'pull' a request from the client just when
there is an upcoming transmission opportunity from the network. This ensures
that the request contains information that is as fresh as possible (e.g., a
sensor reading obtained just before the transmission opportunity). At the
server side, the network ascertains that the server, after receiving and
processing the request to generate a response (e.g., a control command to be
sent to the client), will have a transmission opportunity at just this time. We
realize the JIT system, including the protocol stack, over a
Time-Division-Multiple-Access (TDMA) network implemented on a System-on-Chip
(SoC) platform. We prove that a TDMA network with a power-of-2 time slots per
superframe is optimal for realizing the server-side JIT function. Our
experimental results validate that JIT networks can yield significantly lower
request-response latency than networks without JIT support can.

enhance our knowledge of strong interactions and deepen the aspects related to
this theory in kinematical regimes so far unexplored. In particular, the high
energies reached in electron-proton and in proton-proton collisions first at
HERA and then at the LHC, allow us to study scattering amplitudes of hard and
semi-hard processes in perturbative QCD. The structure of this thesis can be
considered twofold. On one hand, the possibility to distinguish those channels
where at least two final-state particles are emitted with large separation in
rapidity and with an untagged system, permits to test the BFKL dynamics as
resummation energy logarithms in the $t$-channel. In the BFKL formalism, the
Mueller--Navelet jets process has been one of the most investigated reactions.
With the idea of deepening our understanding of the BFKL approach, a new
channel is proposed: the inclusive production of a light charged hadron and a
jet with high transverse momentum widely separated in rapidity. The importance
of this process relies in the possibility to probe a complementary region to
one analyzed for the Mueller--Navelet jets. Additionally, another reaction is
proposed: the heavy-quark pairs hadroproduction. On the other hand, also the
class of processes featured by the detection of a single forward object in
lepton-proton collision offers the opportunity to develop intriguing
phenomenological studies. In particular, the exclusive leptoproduction of light
vector mesons, $\rho$ and $\phi$, is exhaustively investigated. In this
context, the study of helicity-dependent observables allows us to discriminate
among several unintegrated gluon distribution models, whose original definition
naturally encodes the BFKL-equation evolution dynamics. This kind of parton
density allows us to get access to the hadronic structure at small-$x$.

has been studied. The samples were made under various conditions. Photoelectric
polarization of samples due to the Dember effect has been registered. The
signal was recorded under the conditions of a space charge limited current. The
space charge resulting from the capture of electrons and holes creates a static
electric field that prevents diffusion of released charge carriers. The current
registration in the external circuit stops, despite the continuation of
photoexcitation. This effect was used as a fact of measuring the photocurrent
in the sample volume instead of the parasitic current that is not associated
with the sample. The screen has been chosen to prevent the influence of a
spurious signal. It has been found that charge carriers are released when
excited in the spectral absorption range of localized states of silica. Based
on the Dember effect, the sign of the photoelectric response shows the type of
charge carriers - an electron or a hole is mobile. Thus, a sample containing
aluminum without alkali ions gives a negative signal, which indicates the
diffusion of electrons at 290 K, since aluminum is an effective hole trap. An
oxygen-deficient sample at 290 K provides a positive signal indicating the
diffusion of holes, because the center of oxygen deficiency is an effective
electron trap. This sample at 100 K provides a negative signal due to the
effective self-trapping of holes.

Here, we investigate mesoscopic fluctuations of the secondary ""smile"" gap, that
appears in the quasiclassical spectrum of a chaotic cavity coupled to one or

the energies of Andreev levels and access the distribution of the gap widths.
We mostly concentrate on the universal regime $E_{\mathrm{Th}}\gg\Delta$ with
$E_{\mathrm{Th}}$ being the Thouless energy of the cavity and $\Delta$ being
the superconducting gap. We find that the distribution is determined by an
intermediate energy scale $\Delta_g$ with the value between the level spacing
in the cavity $\delta_s$ and the quasiclassical value of the gap $E_g$. From
our numerics we extrapolate the first two cumulants of the gap distribution in
the limit of large level and channel number. We find that the scaled

single crystals exhibits two main bands - a blue at 3 eV and an UV at 4.75 eV.
Luminescence is excited in the range of optical transparency of stishovite
(below 8.75 eV) and, therefore, is ascribed to defects. A wide range of decay
kinetics under a pulsed excitation is observed. For the blue band besides the
exponential decay with a time constant of about 18 {\mu}s an additional ms
component is revealed. For the UV band besides the fast component with a time
constant of 1-3 ns a component with a decay in tens {\mu}s is obtained. The
main components (18 {\mu}s and 1-3 ns) possess a typical intra-center
transition intensity thermal quenching. The effect of the additional slow
component is related to the presence of OH groups and/or carbon molecular
defects modifying the luminescence center. The additional slow components
exhibit wave-like thermal dependences. Photo-thermally stimulated
creation-destruction of complex comprising host defect - interstitial modifiers

Perfect-Matching-Hamiltonian property (PMH-property): a graph admitting a

the star product operation between two bipartite 2FH-graphs is necessary and
sufficient for a bipartite graph admitting a 3-edge-cut to be 2FH. The same

how one can use star products to obtain graphs (which are not necessarily

complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ and the Heawood graph by using star
products. Here, we show that a cubic graph (not necessarily bipartite) is 2FH

conjecture is equivalent to saying that, apart from the Heawood graph, every
bipartite cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph with girth at least 6 having
the PMH-property admits a perfect matching which can be extended to a
Hamiltonian cycle in exactly one way. Finally, we also give two necessary and

numerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data
insufficiency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making
use of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to
irregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from

the limitation of insufficient data by integrating medical ontology, and to
capture the dependencies between the patient's visits by employing multi-layer

better predictive results than previous state-of-the-art approaches,

still being debated. Dust production in high-redshift galaxies could be
dominated by stellar production or by accretion (dust growth) in the
interstellar medium. Previous studies have shown that these two dust sources
predict different grain size distributions, which lead to significantly
different extinction curves. In this paper, we investigate how the difference
in the extinction curves affects the dust attenuation properties of galaxies by
performing radiative transfer calculations. To examine the major effects of the
dust--stars distribution geometry, we adopt two representative cases in
spherical symmetry: the well-mixed geometry (stars and dust are homogeneously
mixed) and the two-layer geometry (young stars are more concentrated in the
centre). In both cases, we confirm that the attenuation curve can be
drastically steepened by scattering and by different optical depths between
young and old stellar populations, and can be flattened by the existence of
unobscured stellar populations. We can reproduce similar attenuation curves
even with very different extinction curves. Thus, we conclude that it is
difficult to distinguish the dust sources only with attenuation curves.
However, if we include information on dust emission and plot the IRX (infrared
excess)--$\beta$ (ultraviolet spectral slope) relation, different dust sources
predict different positions in the IRX--$\beta$ diagram. A larger $\beta$ is
preferred under a similar IRX if dust growth is the dominant dust source.

meaningful information from a large teacher to a smaller student. Generally, KD
often involves how to define and transfer knowledge. Previous KD methods often
focus on mining various forms of knowledge, for example, feature maps and
refined information. However, the knowledge is derived from the primary
supervised task and thus is highly task-specific. Motivated by the recent
success of self-supervised representation learning, we propose an auxiliary
self-supervision augmented task to guide networks to learn more meaningful
features. Therefore, we can derive soft self-supervision augmented
distributions as richer dark knowledge from this task for KD. Unlike previous
knowledge, this distribution encodes joint knowledge from supervised and
self-supervised feature learning. Beyond knowledge exploration, we propose to
append several auxiliary branches at various hidden layers, to fully take
advantage of hierarchical feature maps. Each auxiliary branch is guided to
learn self-supervision augmented task and distill this distribution from
teacher to student. Overall, we call our KD method as Hierarchical
Self-Supervision Augmented Knowledge Distillation (HSSAKD). Experiments on
standard image classification show that both offline and online HSSAKD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the field of KD. Further transfer experiments
on object detection further verify that HSSAKD can guide the network to learn

of anisotropies as a probe of early universe physics, we consider
cross-correlations with CMB temperature anisotropies. We assess the size of the
signal from inflationary interactions against so-called induced anisotropies.
In order to arrive at realistic estimates, we obtain the projected constraints
on the non-linear primordial parameter $F_{\rm NL}$ for several upcoming
gravitational wave probes in the presence of the astrophysical gravitational
wave background. We further illustrate our findings by considering a concrete
inflationary realisation and use it to underscore a few subtleties in the
phenomenological analysis.

scheduled for upgrade. The time-of-flight (ToF) detector, which is described in
this article, is one of three new detectors that will be installed in the
basket of ND280. The ToF detector has a modular structure. Each module
represents an array of 20 plastic scintillator bars which are stacked in a
plane of 2.4 x 2.2 m2 area. Six modules of similar construction will be
assembled in a cube, thus providing an almost 4pi enclosure for an active
neutrino target and two TPCs. The light emitted by scintillator is absorbed by
arrays of large-area silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs) which are attached to
both ends of every bar. The readout of SiPMs, shaping and analog sum of
individual SiPM signals within the array are performed by a discrete circuit
amplifier. An average time resolution of about 0.14 ns is achieved for a single
bar when measured with cosmic muons. The detector will be installed in the
basket of ND280, where it will be used to veto particle originating outside the
neutrino target, improve the particle identification and provide a cosmic
trigger for calibration of detectors which are enclosed inside it.

Directly training a model with labeled OOS examples yields reasonable

this limited-data problem, previous methods focus on better modeling the
distribution of in-scope (INS) examples. We introduce GOLD as an orthogonal
technique that augments existing data to train better OOS detectors operating
in low-data regimes. GOLD generates pseudo-labeled candidates using samples
from an auxiliary dataset and keeps only the most beneficial candidates for
training through a novel filtering mechanism. In experiments across three
target benchmarks, the top GOLD model outperforms all existing methods on all
key metrics, achieving relative gains of 52.4%, 48.9% and 50.3% against median
baseline performance. We also analyze the unique properties of OOS data to
identify key factors for optimally applying our proposed method.

proposes a charging/discharging algorithm suitable for the power management of

minimize the maintenance cost and the grid dependency while maximizing the use
of photovoltaic (PV) power and the utilization of EVs as energy storage systems

Navigation Satellite System / Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) integrated

inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices. To apply
forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an
untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based
pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU),
which can act as an alternative to the wheeled odometer. Dedicated experiments
have been conducted to verify the feasibility and robustness of the OdoNet. The
results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road
conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet,
while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Thus,
a data-cleaning procedure is added to effectively mitigate the impacts of the
IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the process using only
non-holonomic constraint (NHC), after employing the pseudo-odometer, the
positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74%
for the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be
employed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation, which can
efficiently improve the accuracy and reliability of the positioning in
GNSS-denied environments.

experimental observations. We compare H$_2$O$_2$ production in water
microdroplets condensed from vapor produced via (i) heating water to 50-70
{\deg}C and (ii) ultrasonic humidification (as exploited in the original
report). Water microdroplets condensed after heating do not show any
enhancement in the H$_2$O$_2$ level in comparison to the bulk water, regardless
of droplet size or the substrate wettability. In contrast, those condensed

H$_2$O$_2$ production, not droplet interfacial effects.

using gradient descent and is rendered tractable by using an importance
sampling approach that circumvents frequent re-training of the base models
after each gradient descent step. The degree of randomization in our parametric
Random Subspace is thus automatically tuned through the optimization of the
feature selection probabilities. This is an advantage over the standard Random

hyper-parameter. Furthermore, the optimized feature selection probabilities can
be interpreted as feature importance scores. Our algorithm can also easily
incorporate any differentiable regularization term to impose constraints on
these importance scores.

due to the high exploration effort. In this work, we propose a realistic
simulation environment in which multiple models are built for the dynamics of
the ball and the kinematics of the robot. Instead of training an end-to-end RL
model, a novel policy gradient approach with TD3 backbone is proposed to learn
the racket strokes based on the predicted state of the ball at the hitting
time. In the experiments, we show that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms the existing RL methods in simulation. Furthermore, to cross the
domain from simulation to reality, we adopt an efficient retraining method and
test it in three real scenarios. The resulting success rate is 98% and the
distance error is around 24.9 cm. The total training time is about 1.5 hours.

extensively used in diverse areas of science and engineering. However, most
research concerns improving classical models and developing novel models,
relatively limited attention has been paid to the relationship among diverse
models and the modelling mechanism. The current paper proposes a unified
framework and reconstructs the unified model from an integro-differential
equation perspective. First, we propose a methodological framework that
subsumes various nonlinear grey system models as special cases, providing a
cumulative sum series-orientated modelling paradigm. Then, by introducing an
integral operator, the unified model is reduced to an equivalent
integro-differential equation; on this basis, the structural parameters and
initial value are estimated simultaneously via the integral matching approach.
The modelling procedure comparison further indicates that the integral
matching-based integro-differential equation provides a direct modelling
paradigm. Next, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to compare
the finite sample performance, and the results show that the reduced model has
higher accuracy and robustness to noise. Applications of forecasting the
municipal sewage discharge and water consumption in the Yangtze River Delta of
China further illustrate the effectiveness of the reconstructed nonlinear grey
models.

Foucaud, Heydarshahi and Parreau proved that any twin-free digraph $D$
satisfies $\gamma^{LD}(D)\leq \frac{4n} 5 +1$ but conjectured that this bound
can be lowered to $\frac{2n} 3$. The conjecture is still open. They also proved
that if $D$ is a tournament, i.e. a directed graph where there is one arc

  The main result of this paper is the generalization of this bound to
connected local tournaments, i.e. connected digraphs where the in- and

$\gamma^{LD}(D)\leq \frac{2n} 3$ for all quasi-twin-free digraphs $D$ that

both experimental observations (Dark Matter, neutrino masses) and theoretical
arguments. In the hypothesis that the scale of new physics is considerably
higher than the energies probed at colliders, we can parametrise modified
interactions induced by BSM effects among SM particles in a model-independent
framework, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Searches for
indirect evidence of new physics are conceptually different from the direct
ones that have characterised the first part of the LHC program, and both
experimental and phenomenological studies are needed in order to maximise the
chances of uncovering a BSM signal. In this thesis, several phenomenological
aspects of the SMEFT are discussed, both at present and future colliders. A
characteristic feature of modified interactions is that they can induce
unitarity violating effects which can be exploited to gain sensitivity. In this
direction, a thorough study of the top quark electroweak sector will be
presented, focusing on 2 to 2 scatterings and their embeddings in physical
processes at colliders. This analysis allows us to identify several final
states that have a good potential to explore the SMEFT parameter space and that
could be particularly relevant in a global analysis. One of the key features of
the SMEFT is indeed that deviations from the SM interactions are correlated and
global interpretations are therefore of fundamental importance. A combined
interpretation of the Higgs, top and diboson data from the LHC is here
presented and the interplay between the various datasets discussed. Finally,
the physics potential of a futuristic muon collider will be analysed, focusing
in particular on the prospects to determine the Higgs self-interactions, a task
that is arduous even in proposed 100 TeV proton colliders.

galaxies ($\log{M/\mathrm{M}_\odot}>10.5$) we do not find any significant
excess of transition galaxies in clusters, relative to a comparison field
sample at the same redshift. It is likely that such galaxies were quenched
prior to their accretion in the cluster, in group, filament or protocluster

($9.5<\log{M/\mathrm{M}_\odot}<10.5$) there is a small but significant excess
of transition galaxies in clusters, accounting for an additional $\sim 5-10$

consistent with a scenario in which 20--30 per cent of low-mass, star-forming

slowly declines from $z=1$ to $z=0$. While environmental quenching of these

slowly, in most cases this must end with a rapid ($\tau<1$ Gyr) decline in star

do not scale in an efficient way. To address this, different solutions have
been proposed that build execution schedules in an energy-efficient manner.
Issue time prediction processors are one such solution that use data-flow
dependencies and predefined instruction latencies to predict issue times of
repeated instructions. In this work, we aim to improve their accuracy, and
consequently their performance, in an energy efficient way. We accomplish this
by taking advantage of two key observations. First, memory accesses often take
additional time to arrive than the static, predefined access latency that is
used to describe these systems. Second, we find that these memory access delays
often repeat across iterations of the same code. This, in turn, allows us to
predict the arrival time of these accesses.
  In this work, we introduce a new processor microarchitecture, that replaces a
complex reservation-station-based scheduler with an efficient, scalable
alternative. Our proposed scheduling technique tracks real-time delays of loads
to accurately predict instruction issue times, and uses a reordering mechanism
to prioritize instructions based on that prediction, achieving
close-to-out-of-order processor performance. To accomplish this in an
energy-efficient manner we introduce: (1) an instruction delay learning
mechanism that monitors repeated load instructions and learns their latest
delay, (2) an issue time predictor that uses learned delays and data-flow
dependencies to predict instruction issue times and (3) priority queues that
reorder instructions based on their issue time prediction. Together, our
processor achieves 86.2% of the performance of a traditional out-of-order
processor, higher than previous efficient scheduler proposals, while still
consuming 30% less power.

overcome those challenges, and improve understanding of long-range functional

recognition, designed to model interactions across space and time. We evaluate
this approach using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset on sex

topographic variability of functional organisation, we modelled functional
connectomes using multi-resolution dual-regressed (subject-specific) ICA nodes.
Results show a prediction accuracy of 94.4% for sex classification (an increase
of 6.2% compared to other methods), and an improvement of correlation with
fluid intelligence of 0.325 vs 0.144, relative to a baseline model that encodes

presence of macroscopic quantum coherence. Since such effects may be found in
various types of macroscopic oscillators, we consider the application of the LG
approach to the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and also to more
general bound systems, using a single dichotomic variable $Q$ given by the sign
of the oscillator position. We present a simple method to calculate the
temporal correlation functions appearing in the LG inequalities for any bound
system for which the eigenspectrum is (exactly or numerically) known. We apply
this result to the quantum harmonic oscillator for a variety of experimentally
accessible states, namely energy eigenstates, and superpositions thereof. For
the subspace of states spanned by only the ground state and first excited
state, we readily find substantial regions of parameter space in which the LG
inequalities at two, three and four times can each be independently violated or
satisfied. We also find that the violations persist, although are reduced, when
the sign function defining $Q$ is smeared to reflect experimental imprecision.
For higher energy eigenstates, we find that LG violations diminish, showing the
expected classicalization. With a $Q$ defined using a more general type of
position coarse graining, we find two-time LG violations even in the ground
state. We also show that two-time LG violations in a gaussian state are readily
found if the dichotomic variable at one of the times is taken to be the parity
operator. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we repeat much of the
LG analysis for the Morse potential, finding qualitatively similar physical
results.

introduced as prior knowledge to guide to extract distinguishable features for

detectors (SNSPD) has delivered ex-cellent performance, and their increased
adoption has had a great impact on a range of applications. One of the key
characteristic of SNSPDs is their detection rate, which is typically higher
than other types of free-running single-photondetectors. The maximum achievable
rate is limited by the detector recovery time after a detection, which itself
is linked to the superconducting material properties and to the geometry of the
meandered SNSPD. Arrays of detectors biased individually can be used to solve
this issue, but this approach significantly increases both the thermal load in
the cryo-stat and the need for time processing of the many signals, and this
scales unfavorably with a large number of detectors. One potential scalable
approach to increase the detection rate of individual detectors further is
based on parallelizing smaller meander sections. In this way, a single
detection temporarily disables only one subsection of the whole active area,
thereby leaving the overall detection efficiency mostly unaffected. In practice
however, cross-talk between parallel nanowires typically leads to latching,
which prevents high detection rates. Here we show how this problem can be
avoided through a careful design of the whole SNSPD structure. Using the same
electronic readout as with conventional SNSPDs and a single coaxial line, we
demonstrate detection rates over 200 MHz without any latching, and a
fibre-coupled SDE as high as 77%, and more than 50% average SDE per photon at
50 MHz detection rate under continuous wave illumination.

train the DNN to refine the heuristic scheme, thereby providing higher SE,
using only local information at each AP. Another distributed DNN that exploits

$Sp(4,R)$. With this group, we can give a explicit form for the wavefunction in
any time of the evolution, meanwhile, map this whole time evolution to a
trajectory in a six-dimensional manifold. By introducing a polar coordinate, we
can visualize this six-dimensional manifold in 2d unit disk and reveal the

eigen-energies of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the time evolution of
expectation value of a physical observable such as number operator is proven
closely related to the behavior of the trajectory in this manifold.

the language structure and semantics of general texts. However, those models do
not consider the numerical properties of numbers and cannot perform robustly on
numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement

Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the
mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of
the number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals
into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on
four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The
experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and

writing code that is not only concurrent but also correct.
  Objective: To help these developers, it is necessary to understand
concurrency topics they are interested in, their difficulty in finding answers
for questions in these topics, their sentiment for these topics, and how they
use concurrency tools and techniques to guarantee correctness.
  Method: We conduct a large-scale study on the entirety of Stack Overflow to
understand interests, difficulties, sentiment, and tool usages of concurrency
developers. We discuss the implications of our findings for the practice,
research, and education of concurrent software development, and investigate the
relation of our findings with the findings of the previous work.
  Results: A few findings of our study are: (1) questions that concurrency
developers ask can be grouped into a hierarchy with 27 concurrency topics under
8 major categories, (2) thread safety is among the most popular concurrency
topics and client-server concurrency is among the least popular, (3)
irreproducible behavior is among the most difficult topics and memory
consistency is among the least difficult, (4) data scraping is among the most
positive concurrency topics and irreproducible behavior is among the most
negative, (5) root cause identification has the most number of questions for
usage of data race tools and alternative use has the least.
  Conclusion: The results of our study can not only help concurrency developers
but also concurrency educators and researchers to better decide where to focus
their efforts, by trading off one concurrency topic against another.

advances in video processing to detect and monitor traffic incidents. The
collected data are traditionally forwarded to the traffic management center
(TMC) for in-depth analysis and may thus exacerbate the network paths to the
TMC. To alleviate such bottlenecks, we propose to utilize edge computing by
equipping edge nodes that are close to cameras with computing resources (e.g.
cloudlets). A cloudlet, with limited computing resources as compared to TMC,
provides limited video processing capabilities. In this paper, we focus on two
common traffic monitoring tasks, congestion detection, and speed detection, and
propose a two-tier edge computing based model that takes into account of both
the limited computing capability in cloudlets and the unstable network
condition to the TMC. Our solution utilizes two algorithms for each task, one
implemented at the edge and the other one at the TMC, which are designed with
the consideration of different computing resources. While the TMC provides
strong computation power, the video quality it receives depends on the
underlying network conditions. On the other hand, the edge processes very
high-quality video but with limited computing resources. Our model captures
this trade-off. We evaluate the performance of the proposed two-tier model as
well as the traffic monitoring algorithms via test-bed experiments under
different weather as well as network conditions and show that our proposed
hybrid edge-cloud solution outperforms both the cloud-only and edge-only
solutions.

persistent sources such as pulsars. Significant folded pulsation from both PSR
B0531+21 (the Crab Pulsar) and PSR B1509-58 has been observed. Observations of
the Crab Pulsar with POLAR have previously been used for phase-resolved
spectroscopy of the Crab Pulsar to calibrate the instrumental responses of
POLAR. In this work, we investigate a polarimetric joint-fitting method for
observations of the Crab Pulsar with POLAR. Unlike a GRB observation with
POLAR, the observations of the Crab Pulsar are complicated by multiple
observational datasets during which the polarization plane rotates as well. So
before fitting, we have to correct the modulation curves under different
datasets, by taking into account the rotations of the Crab Pulsar's relative
position in the detctor's local coordinate, and the changes of detector
response in different datasets. Despite these difficulties and the low signal
to background for such sources constraining, polarization measurements were
possible with the POLAR data. We will present the methodology briefly, which
could be applied to any wide FoV polarimeter, and polarization results of the

astrophysical challenges that require multiband observations at millimeter
wavelengths. An example of these is the KIDs Interferometer Spectrum Survey
(KISS), which uses two arrays of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) coupled to
a Martin-Puplett interferometer (MPI). KISS has a wide instantaneous field of
view (1 deg in diameter) and a spectral resolution up to 1.45 GHz in the
120-180 GHz electromagnetic band. The instrument is installed on the 2.25 m
Q-U-I JOint TEnerife telescope in Teide Observatory (Tenerife, Canary Islands),
at an altitude of 2395 m above sea level. Aims. This work presents an original
readout modulation method developed to improve the sky signal reconstruction
accuracy for types of instruments for which a fast sampling frequency is
required both to remove atmospheric fluctuations and to perform full
spectroscopic measurements on each sampled sky position. Methods. We first
demonstrate the feasibility of this technique using simulations. Then, we apply
such a scheme to on-sky calibration. Results. We show that the sky signal can
be reconstructed to better than 0.5% for astrophysical sources, and to better
than 2% for large background variations such as in ""skydip"", in an ideal
noiseless scenario. The readout modulation method is validated by observations
on-sky during the KISS commissioning campaign. Conclusions. We conclude that
accurate photometry can be obtained for future KID-based MPI.

must be credible proof that the vehicles will operate safely. However, finding
a method to validate the vehicles' safe operation is a challenging problem.
While scenario-based test approaches seem to be possible solutions, they
require execution of a large number of test cases. Several test benches,
ranging from actual test vehicles to partly or fully simulated environments,
are available to execute these test cases. Each test bench provides different
elements, which in turn, have different parameters and parameter ranges. The
composition of elements with their specific parameter values at a specific test
bench that is used to execute a test case is referred to as a test bench
configuration. However, selecting the most suitable test bench configuration is
difficult. The selected test bench configuration determines whether the
execution of a specific test case provides sufficiently valid test case results
with respect to the intended purpose, for example, validating a vehicle's safe
operation. The effective and efficient execution of a large number of test
cases requires a method for systematically assigning test cases to the most
suitable test bench configuration. Based on a proposed method for classifying
test bench configurations, we propose and illustrate a method for
systematically assigning test cases to test bench configurations in a
scenario-based test approach for automated vehicles. This assignment method
allows for the effective and efficient execution of a large number of test
cases while generating sufficiently valid test case results.

the next state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, each bench-marking their own
performance against that of their predecessors and of their peers.
Unfortunately, the metric used most frequently to describe a model's
performance, average categorization accuracy, is often used in isolation. As
the number of classes increases, such as in fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC), the amount of information conveyed by average accuracy alone dwindles.
While its most glaring weakness is its failure to describe the model's
performance on a class-by-class basis, average accuracy also fails to describe
how performance may vary from one trained model of the same architecture, on
the same dataset, to another (both averaged across all categories and at the
per-class level). We first demonstrate the magnitude of these variations across
models and across class distributions based on attributes of the data,
comparing results on different visual domains and different per-class image
distributions, including long-tailed distributions and few-shot subsets. We
then analyze the impact various FGVC methods have on overall and per-class
variance. From this analysis, we both highlight the importance of reporting and
comparing methods based on information beyond overall accuracy, as well as
point out techniques that mitigate variance in FGVC results.

quantum materials that are considered as the basis for the new generation of
electronic and photonic devices. Here we develop a general theory of the
electron band structure for such commensurate and incommensurate bilayer carbon
structures within the tight binding approximation. To model the band structure
of commensurate twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), we apply the classic zone
folding theory. The latter leads us to the construction of TBLG Hamiltonians in
the basis of shifted Bloch wave functions (SBWF), which, in contrast to the
usual Bloch functions, have the wave vector q shifted by a set of vectors Q_i.
The dimension of the considered Hamiltonians is equal to 4T, where the factor T
is a number of vertices Q_i of the folded reciprocal space falling into the
original first Brillouin zone of any of the layers. We propose and discuss a
method for choosing a reduced set of SBWFs to construct effective Hamiltonians
that correctly describe the low-energy spectrum of commensurate TBLG. The
flattening of low-energy bands with a decrease in twist angle is discussed. As
we show, this spectrum results from interactions between the lowest-energy
modes of the folded dispersion curves. The effective Hamiltonians for
calculating the low-energy band structure of incommensurate TBLG and
double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) are constructed in a similar way. To
test the developed theory, we calculate the energies of 105 intra-tube optical
transitions in 29 DWCNTs and compare them with previously published and novel
experimental data. We also apply the theory to calculate the energies of
recently discovered inter-tube transitions. Geometrical conditions allowing
this type of transitions are discussed. We show that these transitions occur in
DWCNTs which layers have close chiral angles and the same handedness.

developed a detailed mathematical theory relating stable and unstable fixed

we find that a special type of fixed points, corresponding to core motifs, are
predictive of both static and dynamic attractors. Moreover, the attractors can
be found by choosing initial conditions that are small perturbations of these
fixed points. This motivates us to hypothesize that dynamic attractors of a
network correspond to unstable fixed points supported on core motifs. We tested
this hypothesis on a large family of directed graphs of size $n=5$, and found
remarkable agreement. Furthermore, we discovered that core motifs with similar

classify attractors based on structurally-defined graph families. Our results
suggest that graphical properties of the connectivity can be used to predict a

limited. In this work, we use lung segmentation in chest X-rays as a case study
and propose a contrastive learning framework with temporal correlated medical
images, named CL-TCI, to learn superior encoders for initializing the

datasets show that under two different segmentation backbones, U-Net and
Deeplab-V3, CL-TCI can outperform all baselines that do not incorporate any
temporal correlation in both semi-supervised learning setting and transfer
learning setting with limited annotation. This suggests that information among
temporal correlated medical images can indeed improve contrastive learning
performance. Between the two variations of CL-TCI, CL-TCI adapted from MoCo
outperforms CL-TCI adapted from SimCLR in most settings, indicating that more
contrastive samples can benefit the learning process and help the network learn
high-quality representations.

shown encouraging results in many image generation tasks, how to take advantage
of the self-adversarial cogitation in deep EBMs to boost the performance of
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is still desired.
  Methods: With the successful application of deep learning in a wide range of
MRI reconstruction, a line of emerging research involves formulating an
optimization-based reconstruction method in the space of a generative model.
Leveraging this, a novel regularization strategy is introduced in this article
which takes advantage of self-adversarial cogitation of the deep energy-based
model. More precisely, we advocate for alternative learning a more powerful
energy-based model with maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the deep
energy-based information, represented as image prior. Simultaneously, implicit
inference with Langevin dynamics is a unique property of re-construction. In
contrast to other generative models for reconstruction, the proposed method
utilizes deep energy-based information as the image prior in reconstruction to
improve the quality of image.
  Results: Experiment results that imply the proposed technique can obtain
remarkable performance in terms of high reconstruction accuracy that is
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, and does not suffer from mode
collapse.
  Conclusion: Algorithmically, an iterative approach was presented to
strengthen EBM training with the gradient of energy network. The robustness and
the reproducibility of the algorithm were also experimentally validated. More
importantly, the proposed reconstruction framework can be generalized for most
MRI reconstruction scenarios.

Systems (CPSs) usually rely on numerical simulation of the System Under
Verification (SUV) model under input scenarios of possibly varying duration,
chosen among those satisfying given constraints. Such constraints typically
stem from requirements (or assumptions) on the SUV inputs and its operational
environment as well as from the enforcement of additional conditions aiming at,
e.g., prioritising the (often extremely long) verification activity, by, e.g.,
focusing on scenarios explicitly exercising selected requirements, or avoiding
vacuity in their satisfaction. In this setting, the possibility to efficiently
sample at random (with a known distribution, e.g., uniformly) within, or to
efficiently enumerate (possibly in a uniformly random order) scenarios among
those satisfying the given constraints is a key enabler for the viability of
the verification process, e.g., via simulation-based statistical model
checking. Unfortunately, in case of non-trivial combinations of constraints,
iterative approaches like Markovian random walks in the space of sequences of
inputs in general fail in extracting scenarios according to a given
distribution, and can be very inefficient to produce legal scenarios of
interest. We show how, given a set of constraints on the input scenarios
succinctly defined by finite memory monitors, a data structure (scenario
generator) can be synthesised, from which any-horizon scenarios satisfying the
input constraints can be efficiently extracted by (possibly uniform) random
sampling or (randomised) enumeration. Our approach enables seamless support to
virtually all simulation-based approaches to CPS verification, ranging from
simple random testing to statistical model checking and formal (i.e.,
exhaustive) verification.

to separate the contributions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and host galaxies
in the context of photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) of AGN. We explored
the ability of recovering the fractional contribution in a model-independent
way using the entire set of light curves obtained through different filters and
photometric apertures simultaneously. The method is based on the observed bluer
when brighter phenomenon that is attributed to the superimposition of a
two-component structure; the red host galaxy, which is constant in time, and
the varying blue AGN. We describe the PFVG mathematical formalism and
demonstrate its performance using simulated light curves and available PRM
observations. The new probabilistic approach is able to recover host-galaxy
fluxes to within 1% precision as long as the light curves do not show a
significant contribution from time delays. This represents a significant
improvement with respect to previous applications of the traditional FVG method
to PRM data. The proposed PFVG provides an efficient and accurate way to
separate the AGN and host-galaxy luminosities in PRM monitoring data. The
method will be especially helpful in the case of large upcoming photometric
survey telescopes such as the public optical/near-infrared Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Finally, we have made
the algorithms freely available as part of our Julia PFVG package.

time-consuming, digital lithological mapping (DLM) that utilizes remotely

Generally, DLM has been performed using spectral imaging with the use of
laboratory-generated generic endmember signatures. To that end, this paper
proposes generating a single-target abundance mineral map for DLM, where the
generated map can further be used as a guide for the selection or avoidance of
a field survey. For that, a stochastic cancellation-based methodology was used
to generate a site-specific endemic signature for the mineral in concern to
reduce the inclusive nature otherwise present in DLM. Furthermore, a soil pixel
alignment strategy to visualize the relative purity level of the target mineral
has been introduced in the proposed work. Then, for the method validation,
mapping of limestone deposits in the Jaffna peninsula of Sri Lanka was
conducted as the case study using satellite-based spectral imaging as the
input. It was observed that despite the low signal-to-noise ratio of the input
hyperspectral data the proposed methodology was able to robustly extract the
rich information contained in the input data. Further, a field survey was
conducted to collect soil samples of four sites chosen by the proposed DLM from
the Jaffna peninsula as an algorithm validation and to demonstrate the
application of the proposed solution. The proposed abundance threshold of 0.1
coincided with the industrial standard X-ray diffraction (XRD) threshold of 5%
for the mineral presence. The results of the XRD test validated the use of the
algorithm in the selection of sites to be surveyed, hence could avoid
conducting a costly field survey on the assumption of the existence of a
mineral.

technique for multi-link LiFi scenarios. By considering simplified numerical
calculation, it models the links between multiple optical frontends and
multiple mobile devices much faster than previous approaches. For the first two
diffuse reflections, we replace ray-tracing method by frequency domain channel
modelling technique. For the other higher order diffuse reflections, we use a
well-established model based on the integrating sphere. For validation of our
new approach, we performed distributed 4x2 MIMO channel measurements.
Comparison of simulation and measurement yields a relative mean square error
below 5 percent for the signals with a free line-of-sight. Our new technique
enables efficient modeling of mobile scenarios and analyzing statistical
properties of the LiFi channels.

foundations of quantum physics during the final term of scientific high school
(pre-university year). The Italian Ministry of Education, University and
Research (MIUR) has remarked its importance in the syllabus to address the high
school exit examination (30% of the 5th year physics course) but, due to
limited learning time and intrinsic difficulty, this branch of physics is
neither assimilated nor appreciated as it should. We wish to illustrate six
didactic suggestions focused on learning motivation, emerged during a 17-year
long teaching experience, which could help to tackle the main problems found.
The key reference is the talk ""Why nobody understands quantum mechanics?"" given
in 2013 at the 2nd Rome workshop ""Science Perception"" together with a concise
and evocative poster outlining the history of quanta. Other useful resources
are a 2015 conceptual diagram and four invited lectures held in the years
2010-2017.
