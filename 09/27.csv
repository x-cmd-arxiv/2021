how particle production is affected by the collision geometry in heavy-ion
collisions at the LHC. In these proceedings, we report newly obtained ALICE

collision at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.44$ TeV,
respectively, as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and collision
centrality. Particle spectra and ratios are compared between two different
colliding systems at similar charged-particle multiplicity densities
($\langle{\rm d}N_{\rm ch}/{\rm d}\eta\rangle$), and different initial
eccentricities. We find that in central collisions, spectral shapes of
different particles are driven by their masses. The $p_{\rm T}$-integrated
particle yield ratios follow the same trends with $\langle{\rm d}N_{\rm
ch}/{\rm d}\eta\rangle$ as previously observed in other systems, further
suggesting that at the LHC energies, event hadrochemistry is dominantly driven
by the charged-particle multiplicity density and not the collision system,
geometry or center-of-mass energy.}

heterogeneous dynamics as the temperature drops, their structure shows only
seemingly marginal changes. Understanding the nature of relaxation processes in
this dramatic slowdown is key for understanding the glass transition. Here, we
show by atomistic simulations that the heterogeneous dynamics of glass-forming
liquids strongly correlate with the local residual plastic strengths along soft
directions computed in the initial inherent structures. The correlation
increases with decreasing temperature and is maximum in the vicinity of the
relaxation time. For the lowest temperature investigated, this maximum is
comparable with the best values from the literature dealing with the
structure-property relationship. However, the nonlinear probe of the local
shear resistance in soft directions provides here a real-space picture of
relaxation processes. Our detection method of thermal rearrangements allows us
to investigate the first passage time statistics and to study the scaling
between the activation energy barriers and the residual plastic strengths.
These results shed new light on the nature of relaxations of glassy systems by
emphasizing the analogy between the thermal relaxations in viscous liquids and
the plastic shear transformation in amorphous solids.

to model multi-modal features, in addition to the news titles that are widely

pays little attention to the click decision-making process in designing
multi-modal modeling modules. In this work, inspired by the fact that users
make their click decisions mostly based on the visual impression they perceive
when browsing news, we propose to capture such visual impression information
with visual-semantic modeling for news recommendation. Specifically, we devise
the local impression modeling module to simultaneously attend to decomposed
details in the impression when understanding the semantic meaning of news
title, which could explicitly get close to the process of users reading news.
In addition, we inspect the impression from a global view and take structural
information, such as the arrangement of different fields and spatial position
of different words on the impression, into the modeling of multiple modalities.
To accommodate the research of visual impression-aware news recommendation, we
extend the text-dominated news recommendation dataset MIND by adding snapshot
impression images and will release it to nourish the research field. Extensive
comparisons with the state-of-the-art news recommenders along with the in-depth

feature of the method is that it systematically reduces the energy error with

$\rm NNLO + \overline{NNLL}$ accuracy reduces by $3.15\%$ as compared to the
$\rm NNLO$ result for the central scale $\mu_R = \mu_F = m_H/2$ at 13 TeV LHC.
We also observe that the resummed $\rm SV + NSV$ result improves the
renormalisation scale uncertainty at every order in perturbation theory. The
uncertainty from the renormalisation scale $\mu_R$ ranges between $(+8.85\%
,-10.12\%)$ at $\rm NNLO$ whereas it goes down to $(+6.54\% , - 8.32\%)$ at
$\rm NNLO + \overline{NNLL}$ accuracy. However, the factorisation scale
uncertainty is worsened by the inclusion of these NSV logarithms hinting the
importance of resummation beyond $\rm NSV$ terms. We also present our
predictions for $\rm SV + NSV$ resummed result at different collider energies.

\textit{et al.} [PRE 71, 031504 (2005)] in its symmetric version. In this
model, defined on the triangular lattice, interaction between molecules
occupying nearest-neighbor sites depends on their relative orientation,
mimicking the formation of hydrogen bonds in network-forming fluids. Although
all previous studies of this model agree that it has a disordered fluid (DF), a
low-density liquid (LDL) and a high-density liquid (HDL) phase, quite different
forms have been reported for its phase diagram. Here, we present a thorough
investigation of its phase behavior using both transfer matrix calculations and
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, along with finite-size scaling extrapolations.
Results in striking agreement are found using these methods. The critical point
associated with the DF-HDL transition at full occupancy, dentified by Furlan
and coworkers [Phys.~Rev.~E~{\bf 100}, 022109 (2019)] is shown to be one
terminus of a {\it critical line} separating these phases. In opposition to
previous simulation studies, we find that the transition between the DF and LDL
phases is always discontinuous, similar to the LDL-HDL transition. The
associated coexistence lines meet at the point where the DF-HDL critical line
ends, making it critical-end-point. Overall, the form of the phase diagram
observed in our simulations is very similar to that found in the exact solution
of the model on a Husimi lattice. Our results confirm that, despite the
existence of some waterlike anomalies in this model, it is unable to reproduce
key features of the phase behavior of liquid water.

  Continuous, Discrete, and Impulsive Dynamical Systems -- A Unified Approach
  for the Stability Analysis of Linear Systems","46 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Symmetric matrix-valued dynamical systems are an important class of systems
that can describe important processes such as covariance/second-order moment
processes, or processes on manifolds and Lie Groups. We address here the case
of processes that leave the cone of positive semidefinite matrices invariant,
thereby including covariance and second-order moment processes. Both the
continuous-time and the discrete-time cases are first considered. In the LTV
case, the obtained stability and stabilization conditions are expressed as
differential and difference Lyapunov conditions which are equivalent, in the
LTI case, to some spectral conditions for the generators of the processes.
Convex stabilization conditions are also obtained in both the continuous-time
and the discrete-time setting. It is proven that systems with constant delays
are stable provided that the systems with zero-delays are stable -- which
mirrors existing results for linear positive systems. The results are then
extended and unified into a impulsive formulation for which similar results are
obtained. The proposed framework is very general and can recover and/or extend
almost all the results on the literature of linear systems related to
(mean-square) exponential (uniform) stability. Several examples are discussed
to illustrate this claim by deriving stability conditions for stochastic
systems driven by Brownian motion and Poissonian jumps, Markov jump systems,
(stochastic) switched systems, (stochastic) impulsive systems, (stochastic)
sampled-data systems, and all their possible combinations.

reduction in annotation efforts. In particular, we demonstrate that our model
achieves the performance of a 6-layer TinyBERT and DistilBERT, whilst using
only 2% of their total parameters. Finally, by the integration of our AL

  We prove that for all WCFS models, scaled mean response time $E[T](1-\rho)$
converges to the same value, $E[S^2]/(2E[S])$, in the heavy-traffic limit,
which is also the heavy traffic limit for the M/G/1/FCFS. Moreover, we prove

complete analysis of two mean field models, one of which is well-know

critical behaviour despite their rate functions having unique minimiser. The
main focus is then a model with negative counter term, the probabilistic
version of the so-called \emph{Huang-Yang-Luttinger} (HYL) model \cite{BLP}.
Criticality in this model is the existence of a critical parameter for which
two simultaneous minimiser exists. At criticality an order parameter is
introduced as the double limits for the density of cycles with diverging
length, and as such it extends recent work \cite{AD21}.

where pairs of nondegenerate bands cross at isolated points in the Brillouin
zone called Weyl nodes. Near these points, the electronic dispersion is gapless
and linear. A magnetic field $B$ changes this dispersion into a set of Landau
levels which are dispersive along the direction of the magnetic field only. The
$n=0$ Landau level is special since its dispersion$\ $is linear and
unidirectional. The presence of this chiral level distinguishes Weyl from
Schr\""{o}dinger fermions. In this paper, we study the quantum oscillations of
the orbital magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in Weyl semimetals. We
generalise earlier works% \cite{Mikitik2019} on these De Haas-Van Alphen
oscillations by considering the effect of a tilt of the Weyl nodes. We study
how the fundamental period of the oscillations in the small $B$ limit and the
strength of the magnetic field $B_{1}$ required to reach the quantum limit are
modified by the magnitude and orientation of the tilt vector $\mathbf{t}$. We
show that the magnetization from a single node is finite in the $B\rightarrow
0$ limit. Its sign depends on the product of the chirality and sign of the tilt
component along the magnetic field direction. We also study the magnetic
oscillations from a pair of Weyl nodes with opposite chirality and with
opposite or identical tilt. Our calculation shows that these two cases lead to
a very different behavior of the magnetization in the small and large $B$
limits. We finally consider the effect of an energy shift $\pm \Delta _{0}$ of
a pair of Weyl nodes on the magnetic oscillations. We assume a constant density
of carriers so that both nodes share a common Fermi level. Our calculation can
easily be extended to a WSM with an arbitrary number of pairs of Weyl nodes.

the evolution of a spherical dust cloud in the presence of an external electric
or magnetic field. The solution contains three arbitrary functions $f(R)$,
$F(R)$ and $\tau_0(R)$, where $R$ is a radial coordinate in the comoving
reference frame. The solution splits into three branches corresponding to
hyperbolic ($f >0$), parabolic ($f=0$) and elliptic ($f < 0$) types of motion.
In such models, we study the possible existence of wormhole throats defined as
spheres of minimum radius at a fixed time instant, and prove the existence of
throats in the elliptic branch under certain conditions imposed on the
arbitrary functions. It is further shown that the normal to a throat is a
timelike vector (except for the instant of maximum expansion, when this vector
is null), hence a throat is in general located in a T-region of space-time.
Thus if such a dust cloud is placed between two empty (Reissner-Nordstr\""om or
Schwarzschild) space-time regions, the whole configuration is a black hole
rather than a wormhole. However, dust clouds with throats can be inscribed into
closed isotropic cosmological models filled with dust to form wormholes which
exist for a finite period of time and experience expansion and contraction
together with the corresponding cosmology. Explicit examples and numerical
estimates are presented. The possible traversability of wormhole-like evolving
dust layers is established by a numerical study of radial null geodesics.

not go against observations. Moreover, we show that stellar seismology allows
us to suggest exclusion limits that complement the constraints set by direct

properties and $\Delta\Pi_\ell$ is found to be the most reliable, having the
potential to build future DM exclusion diagrams. This new methodology can be a
powerful tool in the analysis of the data coming from the next generation of

abilities: while some are fully wireless and can send and receive messages at
any distance, a subset of the agents are senders, they can only transmit
messages wirelessly, and the rest are receivers, they can only receive messages
wirelessly. The agents start at the same time and their communication abilities

goal of the agents is to collectively find a target/exit at an unknown location
on the line while minimizing the evacuation time, defined as the time when the

  We investigate the impact of such a mixed communication model on evacuation

has made them appealing for practical applications. However, their mean
representations, which are generally used for downstream tasks, have recently
been shown to be more correlated than their sampled counterpart, on which
disentanglement is usually measured. In this paper, we refine this observation
through the lens of selective posterior collapse, which states that only a
subset of the learned representations, the active variables, is encoding useful
information while the rest (the passive variables) is discarded. We first
extend the existing definition to multiple data examples and show that active
variables are equally disentangled in mean and sampled representations. Based
on this extension and the pre-trained models from disentanglement lib, we then
isolate the passive variables and show that they are responsible for the
discrepancies between mean and sampled representations. Specifically, passive
variables exhibit high correlation scores with other variables in mean
representations while being fully uncorrelated in sampled ones. We thus
conclude that despite what their higher correlation might suggest, mean
representations are still good candidates for downstream tasks applications.
However, it may be beneficial to remove their passive variables, especially
when used with models sensitive to correlated features.

and then transformed into ceramic compounds through a pyrolysis step that
preserves the shape. Light-based additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising
route to achieve solidification of the PCP resin. Different approaches, such as
stereolithography, have already been proposed but they all rely on a
layer-by-layer printing process which sets limitations on the printing speed
and object geometry. Here, we report on the fabrication of complex 3D
centimeter-scale ceramic parts by using tomographic volumetric printing which
is fast, high resolution and offers a lot of freedom in terms of geometrical
design compared to state-of-the-art AM techniques. First, we formulated a
photosensitive preceramic resin that was solidified by projecting light
patterns from multiple angles. Then, the obtained 3D printed parts were
converted into ceramics by pyrolyzing them in a furnace. We demonstrate the
strength of this approach through the fabrication of dense microcomponents
exhibiting overhangs and hollow geometries without the need of supporting

non-stationary velocity fields to handle large deformations in images whilst
guaranteeing diffeomorphisms in the resultant deformation. We then propose a
convex optimisation model that uses a regularisation term of arbitrary order to
impose smoothness on these velocity fields and solve this model with a fast
algorithm that combines Nesterov gradient descent and the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we leverage the computational power of
GPU to implement this accelerated ADMM solver on a 3D cardiac MRI dataset,
further reducing runtime to less than 2 seconds. In addition to producing
strictly diffeomorphic deformations, our methods outperform both
state-of-the-art deep learning-based and iterative DiffIR approaches in terms
of dice and Hausdorff scores, with speed approaching the inference time of deep
learning-based methods.

gradients by breaking down the broadly distributed attractants in the
environment, which leads to propulsion. How cells sense the environment and the
interplay of self-generated force and long-range range chemotactic interactions

develop a theory to provide quantitative insight into how self-generated
chemotaxis (SGC) steers the collective migration of cells during their
long-distance journeys. In an externally imposed gradient, the cells exhibit
super-diffusive motion at time less than persistent time ($\tau_p$) and exhibit
diffusive motion at time $t>\tau_p$. On the other hand breakdown of
chemo-attractants influences the density fluctuations and long-range
correlations emerge in the density of chemotactic cells. The cells exhibit
superdiffusive motion at a longtime limit. The SGG provides an effective
mechanism for long-distance travel compared to an externally imposed gradient.
Our theory provides a general framework for studying the non-equilibrium

  on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2021)",,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  State-of-the-art techniques for addressing scaling-related main memory errors
identify and repair bits that are at risk of error from within the memory
controller. Unfortunately, modern main memory chips internally use on-die error
correcting codes (on-die ECC) that obfuscate the memory controller's view of
errors, complicating the process of identifying at-risk bits (i.e., error
profiling). To understand the problems that on-die ECC causes for error
profiling, we analytically study how on-die ECC changes the way that memory
errors appear outside of the memory chip (e.g., to the memory controller). We
show that on-die ECC introduces statistical dependence between errors in
different bit positions, raising three key challenges for practical and
effective error profiling.
  To address the three challenges, we introduce Hybrid Active-Reactive
Profiling (HARP), a new error profiling algorithm that rapidly achieves full
coverage of at-risk bits in memory chips that use on-die ECC. HARP separates
error profiling into two phases: (1) using existing profiling techniques with
the help of small modifications to the on-die ECC mechanism to quickly identify
a subset of at-risk bits; and (2) using a secondary ECC within the memory
controller to safely identify the remaining at-risk bits, if and when they
fail. Our evaluations show that HARP achieves full coverage of all at-risk bits
faster (e.g., 99th-percentile coverage 20.6%/36.4%/52.9%/62.1% faster, on
average, given 2/3/4/5 raw bit errors per ECC word) than two state-of-the-art
baseline error profiling algorithms, which sometimes fail to achieve full
coverage. We perform a case study of how each profiler impacts the system's
overall bit error rate (BER) when using a repair mechanism to tolerate DRAM
data-retention errors. We show that HARP outperforms the best baseline
algorithm (e.g., by 3.7x for a raw per-bit error probability of 0.75).

with respect to hyperplanes as classical polar spaces. Non-classical examples
of quasi-quadrics have been constructed using a technique called pivoting [5].
We introduce a more general notion of pivoting, called switching, and also
extend this notion to Hermitian polar spaces. The main result of this paper
studies the switching technique in detail by showing that, for q >= 4, if we
modify the points of a hyperplane of a polar space to create a quasi-polar
space, the only thing that can be done is pivoting. The cases q = 2 and q = 3
play a special role for parabolic quadrics and are investigated in detail.
Furthermore, we give a construction for quasi-polar spaces obtained from
pivoting multiple times. Finally, we focus on the case of parabolic quadrics in
even characteristic and determine under which hypotheses the existence of a
nucleus (which was included in the definition given in [5]) is guaranteed.

recently become more urgent and acute. It is extremely hard to accurately
detect manipulated videos using content analysis, especially in the face of
subtle, yet effective, manipulations, such as frame rate changes or skin tone
adjustments. One prominent alternative to content analysis is to securely embed
provenance information into videos. However, prior approaches have poor
performance and/or granularity that is too coarse. To this end, we construct
Vronicle -- a video provenance system that offers fine-grained provenance
information and substantially better performance. It allows a video consumer to
authenticate the camera that originated the video and the exact sequence of
video filters that were subsequently applied to it. Vronicle exploits the
increasing popularity and availability of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
on many types of computing platforms.
  One contribution of Vronicle is the design of provenance information that
allows the consumer to verify various aspects of the video, thereby defeating
numerous fake-video creation methods. Vronicle's adversarial model allows for a
powerful adversary that can manipulate the video (e.g., in transit) and the
software state outside the TEE. Another contribution is the use of
fixed-function Intel SGX enclaves to post-process videos. This design
facilitates verification of provenance information.
  We present a prototype implementation of Vronicle (to be open sourced), which
relies on current technologies, making it readily deployable. Our evaluation
demonstrates that Vronicle's performance is well-suited for offline use-cases.

unilaterally change group affiliation, either because the agent cannot increase
her utility by switching, or because the intended receiving group is unwilling

  Neural Network of Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2106.00172,
  arXiv:2105.06057",,,,"q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate disynaptic effect of the hilar cells on pattern separation in
a spiking neural network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The principal
granule cells (GCs) in the DG perform pattern separation, transforming similar
input patterns into less-similar output patterns. The hilus consists of
excitatory mossy cells (MCs) and inhibitory HIPP (hilar perforant
path-associated) cells. Here, we consider the disynaptic effects of the MCs and
the HIPP cells on the GCs, mediated by the inhibitory basket cells (BCs); MC
$\rightarrow$ BC $\rightarrow$ GC and HIPP $\rightarrow$ BC $\rightarrow$ GC.
By changing synaptic strength $K^{\rm (BC, X)}$ ( X = MC or HIPP) from the
default value ${K^{\rm (BC, X)}}^*$, we study the change in the pattern
separation degree ${\cal S}_d$. When decreasing $K^{\rm (BC, MC)}$ or
independently increasing $K^{\rm (BC, HIPP)}$ from their default values, ${\cal
S}_d$ is found to decrease (i.e., pattern separation is reduced). On the other
hand, as $K^{\rm (BC, MC)}$ is increased or independently $K^{\rm (BC, HIPP)}$
is decreased from their default values, pattern separation becomes enhanced
(i.e., ${\cal S}_d$ increases). In this way, the disynaptic effects of the MCs
and the HIPP cells on the pattern separation are opposite ones. Thus, when
simultaneously varying both $K^{\rm (BC, MC)}$ and $K^{\rm (BC, HIPP)}$, as a
result of balance between the two competing disynaptic effects of the MCs and
the HIPP cells, ${\cal S}_d$ forms a bell-shaped curve with an optimal maximum
at their default values. Moreover, the population and individual behaviors of
the sparsely synchronized rhythm of the GCs are found to be strongly correlated
with the pattern separation degree ${\cal S}_d$. Consequently, the larger the
synchronization and the random phase-locking degrees of the sparsely
synchronized rhythm is, the more the pattern separation becomes enhanced.

  We reduce solving general linear systems in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ to solving
unit-weight low-degree graph Laplacians over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with a
polylogarithmic overhead on the number of non-zeros. Given the hardness of
solving general linear systems in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ [Casacuberta-Kyng 2022], this
result shows that it is unlikely that we can generalize Laplacian solvers over
$\mathbb{R}$, or finite-element based methods over $\mathbb{R}$ in general, to
a finite-field setting. We also reduce solving general linear systems over
$\mathbb{Z}_p$ to solving linear systems whose coefficient matrices are walk
matrices (matrices with all ones on the diagonal) and normalized Laplacians
(Laplacians that are also walk matrices) over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  We often need to apply linear system solvers to random linear systems, in
which case the worst case analysis above might be less relevant. For example,
we often need to substitute variables in a symbolic matrix with random values.
Here, a symbolic matrix is simply a matrix whose entries are in a polynomial
ring $\mathbb{F}[x_1, \ldots, x_t]$. We formally define the reducibility
between symbolic matrix classes, which are classified in terms of the degrees
of the entries and the number of occurrences of the variables. We show that the
determinant identity testing problem for symbolic matrices with polynomial

  Editors L. Buoninfante and S. Kumar",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With standard Einstein gravity not being renormalizable at the quantum level
there is much interest in studying higher-derivative quantum gravity theories.
Thus just as a Ricci-scalar-based action produces a propagator that behaves as
a non-renormalizable $1/k^2$ at large $k^2$, an action based on the square of
the Ricci scalar behaves as a renormalizable $1/k^4$ at large $k^2$. An action
based on both the Ricci scalar and its square leads to a renormalizable
propagator of the generic Pauli-Villars form. However, given the form of the
Hamiltonian and the propagator such theories are thought to be plagued by
either energies that are unbounded from below or states of negative Dirac norm
(the overlap of a ket with its Hermitian conjugate bra). But when one
constructs the quantum Hilbert space one finds (Bender and Mannheim) that in
fact neither of these problems is actually present. The Hamiltonian turns out
to not be Hermitian but to instead have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry, and for
this symmetry the needed inner product is the overlap of a ket with its $PT$
conjugate bra. And this inner product is positive definite. Moreover, for the
pure $1/k^4$ propagator the Hamiltonian turns out to not be diagonalizable, and
again there are no states of negative energy or of negative norm. Instead there
are states of zero norm, non-standard but perfectly acceptable states that
serve to maintain probability conservation. With the locally conformal
invariant fourth-order derivative conformal gravity theory being in this
category, it can be offered as a candidate theory of quantum gravity that is
renormalizable and unitary in four spacetime dimensions.

improving the robustness of neural networks is one promising approach to
mitigate this issue, an appealing alternate to robustifying networks against
all possible test-time shifts is to instead directly adapt them to unlabeled
inputs from the particular distribution shift we encounter at test time.
However, this poses a challenging question: in the standard Bayesian model for
supervised learning, unlabeled inputs are conditionally independent of model
parameters when the labels are unobserved, so what can unlabeled data tell us
about the model parameters at test-time? In this paper, we derive a Bayesian
model that provides for a well-defined relationship between unlabeled inputs
under distributional shift and model parameters, and show how approximate
inference in this model can be instantiated with a simple regularized entropy
minimization procedure at test-time. We evaluate our method on a variety of

formulate the multimodal reward learning as a mixture learning problem and

of challenging problems of near-field microscopy that leverages the powerful
framework of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the inversion of the
complex optical parameters of nanostructured environments. Specifically, we
show that PINNs can be flexibly designed based on the full-vector Maxwell's
equations to inversely retrieve the spatial distributions of the complex
electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of unknown scattering objects
in the resonance regime from near-field data. Moreover, we demonstrate that
PINNs achieve excellent convergence to the true material parameters under both
plane wave and point source (localized) excitations, enabling parameter
retrieval in scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). Our method is
computationally efficient compared to traditional data-driven deep learning
approaches as it requires only a single dataset for training. Furthermore, we
develop and successfully demonstrate adaptive PINNs with trainable loss weights
that largely improve the accuracy of the inverse reconstruction for high-index
materials compared to standard PINNs. Finally, we demonstrate the full
potential of our approach by retrieving the space-dependent permittivity of a
three-dimensional (3D) unknown object from near-field data. The presented
framework paves the way to the development of a computationally-driven,
accurate, and non-invasive platform for the simultaneous retrieval of the
electric and magnetic parameters of resonant nanostructures from measured
optical images, with applications to biomedical imaging, optical remote
sensing, and characterization of metamaterial devices.

standard LSTMs and Transformer/Attention-based neural networks, using publicly

accuracy, the performance of the trained programs on the actual L\&S sequence
is bad, and shows no understanding of the principles behind the sequences. The
ramifications of this finding include: (1) from the cognitive science
perspective, we argue that we need better mathematical models of abstraction;
(2) the universality of neural networks should be re-examined for functions

strong exciton resonances. We simultaneously observe a strong and sharp ground

6061 aluminum alloy based on internal friction (IF) measurement, which is
realized by a quantitative electromechanical impedance (Q-EMI) method using a
small piezoelectric wafer bonded on the specimen. Large strain amplitude
(3.3*10^-3) was employed thus the fatigue life can always be below 10^5 cycles.
It was found that except for the initial testing stage, the IF always increases
steadily with the increasing fatigue cycles. Before the fatigue failure, the IF
can reach 2.5 to 3.4 times of the initial value, which is thought to be caused
by the micro-cracks forming and growing. In comparison, the resonance frequency
of the specimen just drops less than 2% compared with the initial value.
Finally, a general fatigue criterion based on IF measurement is suggested for
all the metallic materials.

supplements the regularization with regression to estimate the unregularized

the regularization with a reweighting strategy before regression. Both methods

decision making and motion planning of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes
a graph-based spatial-temporal convolutional network (GSTCN) to predict future
trajectory distributions of all neighbor vehicles using past trajectories. This
network tackles the spatial interactions using a graph convolutional network
(GCN), and captures the temporal features with a convolutional neural network
(CNN). The spatial-temporal features are encoded and decoded by a gated
recurrent unit (GRU) network to generate future trajectory distributions.
Besides, we propose a weighted adjacency matrix to describe the intensities of
mutual influence between vehicles, and the ablation study demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Our network is evaluated on two
real-world freeway trajectory datasets: I-80 and US-101 in the Next Generation
Simulation (NGSIM).Comparisons in three aspects, including prediction errors,
model sizes, and inference speeds, show that our network can achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

understanding plasma behavior, but this power often comes at great
computational expense. Artificially reducing the ion/electron mass ratio is a
time-honored practice to reduce simulation costs. Usually, this is a severe
approximation. However, for steady-state collisionless, electrostatic
(Vlasov-Poisson) systems, the solution with reduced mass ratio can be scaled to
the solution for the real mass ratio, with no approximation. This 'scaled mass'
method, which works with already-existing PIC codes, can reduce the computation
time for a large class of electrostatic PIC simulations by the square root of
the mass ratio. The particle distributions of the resulting steady state must
be trivially rescaled to yield the true distributions, but the self-consistent
electrostatic field is independent of the mass ratio. This method is equivalent
to 'numerical timestepping,' an approach that evolves electron and ion
populations with different timesteps. Numerical timestepping can be viewed as a
special case of the speed-limited PIC (SLPIC) method, which is not restricted
to steady-state phenomena. Although the scaled-mass approach is simplest,
numerical timestepping and SLPIC more easily generalize to include other
effects, such as collisions. The equivalence of these new approaches is
demonstrated by applying them to simulate a cylindrical Langmuir probe in
electron-argon plasma, speeding up simulation by two orders of magnitude.
Methods such as SLPIC can therefore play an invaluable role in interpreting
probe measurements by including geometric effects, collisions, secondary
emission, and non-Maxwellian distributions.

time-dependent Schroedinger equation. In this paper, the Madelung equation,
whose gradient is an Euler equation, is refined by introducing interpretations
of functions that are shown to depend only on the real-part of the
complex-valued wavefunction. These interpretations are extensions of functions
from the recently derived generalized Bernoulli equation, applicable to
real-valued quantum-mechanical stationary states. In particular, the velocity
and pressure definitions are extended so that they depend on the real-part of a
time-dependent complex-valued wavefunction. The Bohn quantum potential is then
interpreted as the sum of two terms, one involving the kinetic energy and the
other involving the pressure. Substituting the interpreted quantum-potential
into the Madelung equation gives a refined equation containing two kinetic
energy terms, a pressure term, and the external potential. It is easily
demonstrated that the refined Madelung equation, applied to the hydrogen atom
states with a nonzero magnetic quantum number, gives a fluid velocity that
contains both a radial component and a free vortex. Hence, the fluid particles
have angular momentum and move on streamlines that terminate at infinity. It is
also demonstrated that the two velocities from the refined Madelung equation
are related: One is the real component and the other is the imaginary component
of a complex velocity. Furthermore, an Euler equation for quantum mechanical
systems is derived by taking the gradient of the refined Madelung equation.

geographic scales, ranging from local hazards to regional/international

meaning that satellite observations provide the only record of volcanic
behavior and unrest. Among these remote sensing observations, thermal imagery
is inspected daily by volcanic observatories for examining the early signs,
onset, and evolution of eruptive activity. However, thermal scenes are often
obstructed by clouds, meaning that forecasts must be made off image sequences
whose scenes are only usable intermittently through time. Here, we explore
forecasting this thermal data stream from a deep learning perspective using
existing architectures that model sequences with varying spatiotemporal
considerations. Additionally, we propose and evaluate new architectures that
explicitly model intermittent image sequences. Using ASTER Kinetic Surface
Temperature data for $9$ volcanoes between $1999$ and $2020$, we found that a
proposed architecture (ConvLSTM + Time-LSTM + U-Net) forecasts volcanic
temperature imagery with the lowest RMSE ($4.164^{\circ}$C, other methods:
$4.217-5.291^{\circ}$C). Additionally, we examined performance on multiple time
series derived from the thermal imagery and the effect of training with data
from singular volcanoes. Ultimately, we found that models with the lowest RMSE
on forecasting imagery did not possess the lowest RMSE on recreating time
series derived from that imagery and that training with individual volcanoes
generally worsened performance relative to a multi-volcano data set. This work
highlights the potential of data-driven deep learning models for volcanic
unrest forecasting while revealing the need for carefully constructed

flux inside the dark string through the kinetic mixing. The dark monopole, on
the other hand, does not induce the QED magnetic flux in the U(1) symmetric
phase, even in the presence of the kinetic mixing. Finally, we show that the
dark bead solution induces a spherically symmetric QED magnetic flux through
the kinetic mixing. The induced flux looks like the QED magnetic monopole
viewed from a distance, although QED satisfies the Bianchi identity everywhere,
which we call a pseudo magnetic monopole.

point of view, however, it is not clear how planet form at the outer region of

radial drift barrier. Here, on the basis of three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of disk evolution with the dust growth, we
propose a mechanism named ""ash-fall"" phenomenon induced by powerful molecular
outflow driven by magnetic field which may circumvent the radial drift barrier.
We found that the large dust which grows to a size of $\sim \cm$ in the inner
region of a disk is entrained by an outflow from the disk. Then large dust
decoupled from gas is ejected from the outflow due to centrifugal force,
enriching the grown dust in the envelope and is eventually fall onto the outer
edge of the disk. The overall process is similar to behaviour of ash-fall from
volcanic eruptions. In the ash-fall phenomenon, the Stokes number of dust
increases by reaccreting to the less dense disk outer edge. This may make the
dust grains overcome the radial drift barrier. Consequently, the ash-fall
phenomenon can provide a crucial assist for making the formation of the
planetesimals in outer region of the disk possible, and hence the formation of
wide-orbit planets and the formation of the gaps.

shows how to incorporate into support-vector machines (SVMs) those properties

important is the ability to incorporate domain knowledge of invariances, e.g.,
translational invariance of images. Kernels based on the \textit{maximum}
similarity over a group of transformations are not generally positive definite.
Perhaps it is for this reason that they have not been studied theoretically. We
address this lacuna and show that positive definiteness indeed holds
\textit{with high probability} for kernels based on the maximum similarity in
the small training sample set regime of interest, and that they do yield the
best results in that regime. We also show how additional properties such as
their ability to incorporate local features at multiple spatial scales, e.g.,
as done in CNNs through max pooling, and to provide the benefits of composition
through the architecture of multiple layers, can also be embedded into SVMs. We
verify through experiments on widely available image sets that the resulting
SVMs do provide superior accuracy in comparison to well-established deep neural
network benchmarks for small sample sizes.

an increased interest in High Frame Rate (HFR) videos. In this work we address
the problem of frame rate dependent Video Quality Assessment (VQA) when the
videos to be compared have different frame rate and compression factor. The
current VQA models such as VMAF have superior correlation with perceptual
judgments when videos to be compared have same frame rates and contain
conventional distortions such as compression, scaling etc. However this
framework requires additional pre-processing step when videos with different
frame rates need to be compared, which can potentially limit its overall
performance. Recently, Generalized Entropic Difference (GREED) VQA model was
proposed to account for artifacts that arise due to changes in frame rate, and
showed superior performance on the LIVE-YT-HFR database which contains frame
rate dependent artifacts such as judder, strobing etc. In this paper we propose
a simple extension, where the features from VMAF and GREED are fused in order
to exploit the advantages of both models. We show through various experiments
that the proposed fusion framework results in more efficient features for
predicting frame rate dependent video quality. We also evaluate the fused
feature set on standard non-HFR VQA databases and obtain superior performance
than both GREED and VMAF, indicating the combined feature set captures
complimentary perceptual quality information.

In contrast to previous methods, the advantage of our method is that it
requires less manual effort to adjust the emotion of the synthesized speech.
Our synthesizer receives an emotion vector to characterize the emotion of
synthesized speech. The vector is automatically obtained from human utterances
by using a speech emotion recognizer. We evaluated our method in a scenario
when a robot tries to regulate an elderly person's circadian rhythm by speaking
to the person using appropriate emotional states. For the target speech to
imitate, we collected utterances from professional caregivers when they speak
to elderly people at different times of the day. Then we conducted a subjective
evaluation where the elderly participants listened to the speech samples
generated by our method. The results showed that listening to the samples made
the participants feel more active in the early morning and calmer in the middle

multiple layers of the solar atmosphere.
  Methods. The new approach combines the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) extrapolation
which models the solar low atmosphere in a flat box and the nonlinear
force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation which models the solar corona with a
chromospheric vector magnetogram deduced from the MHS extrapolation. We test
our code with a snapshot of a radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a
solar flare. Comparisons are conducted by several metrics quantitatively.
  Results. Based on a number of test runs, we find out the optimized
configuration for the combination of two extrapolations with a 5.8-Mm-high box
for the MHS extrapolation and a magnetogram at a height of 1 Mm for the NLFFF
extrapolation. The new approach under this configuration is able to reconstruct
the magnetic fields in multi-layers accurately and efficiently. Based on
figures of merit that are used to assess the performance of different
extrapolations (NLFFF extrapolation, MHS extrapolation, and the combined one),
we find the combined extrapolation reaches accuracy of the MHS extrapolation
which is better than the NLFFF extrapolation. The combined extrapolation is
moderately efficient for application to magnetograms with high resolution.

accomplished by separating the quark operators appearing in the QCD sum rules
for these hadrons into the chiral symmetric and symmetry breaking parts
depending on the contributions of the fermion zero modes. We then extract the
vacuum expectation values of all the separated parts of the quark operators
using the QCD sum rule relations for these hadrons with their vacuum masses and
widths. By taking the chiral symmetry breaking parts to be zero while keeping
the symmetric operators to their vacuum values, we obtain the chiral symmetric
part of the hadron masses. We find that the masses of chiral partners, such as
the $(\rho,a_1)$ and $(K^*,K_1)$, become degenerate to values between 500 and
600 MeV in the chiral symmetry restored vacuum, while parity partners
$(\omega,f_1)$ that are chiral partners only in the limit where the
disconnected diagrams are neglected remain non-degenerate with masses
$(655,1060)$ MeV, respectively. The masses of the nucleon and the Delta are
also found to reduce to about 500 and 600 MeV, respectively, in the chiral

spin-singlet pairing correlations are significantly enhanced near the quantum
critical point in the SU(2) case; however, with adequate but still realistic

competitive. Our results demonstrate that spin-flip processes strengthen the
spin-singlet pairing at the Kondo-destruction quantum critical points, and
point towards a way for antiferromagnetic correlations to drive spin-triplet
pairing. Further implications of our findings in the broader context of
strongly correlated superconductivity are discussed.

the ""cognitive reality monitoring network"" (CRMN) orchestrates conscious
involvement of generative-inverse model pairs in perception and action. Based
on mismatches between computations by generative and inverse models, as well as
reward prediction errors, CRMN computes a ""responsibility signal"" that gates
selection and learning of pairs in perception, action, and reinforcement
learning. A high responsibility signal is given to the pairs that best capture
the external world, that are competent in movements (small mismatch), and that
are capable of reinforcement learning (small reward prediction error). CRMN
selects pairs with higher responsibility signals as objects of metacognition,
and consciousness is determined by the entropy of responsibility signals across
all pairs.

quarantine strategies is a key concern for jurisdictions in which the local

Australia, and New Zealand, rare outbreak events can lead to escalating
epidemics and trigger the imposition of large scale lockdown policies. Here, we
examine to what degree vaccination status of incoming arrivals and the
quarantine workforce can allow relaxation of quarantine requirements. To do so,
we develop and apply a detailed model of COVID-19 disease progression and
transmission taking into account nuanced timing factors. Key among these are
disease incubation periods and the progression of infection detectability
during incubation. Using the disease characteristics associated with the
ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 to benchmark the level of acceptable risk, we
examine the performance of the border quarantine system for vaccinated
arrivals. We examine disease transmission and vaccine efficacy parameters over
a wide range, covering plausible values for the Delta variant currently
circulating globally. Our results indicate a threshold in outbreak potential as
a function of vaccine efficacy, with the time until an outbreak increasing by
up to two orders of magnitude as vaccine efficacy against transmission
increases from 70% to 90%. For parameters corresponding to the Delta variant,
vaccination is able to maintain the capacity of quarantine systems to reduce
case importation and outbreak risk, by counteracting the pathogen's increased
infectiousness. To prevent outbreaks, heightened vaccination in border
quarantine systems must be combined with mass vaccination. The ultimate success
of these programs will depend sensitively on the efficacy of vaccines against
viral transmission.

models are not built to be robust to errors in labeling or annotation,
distributional data shift, or adversarial data perturbations. To fill this gap,
we introduce a new listwise LTR model called Distributionally Robust
Multi-output Regression Ranking (DRMRR). Different from existing methods, the
scoring function of DRMRR was designed as a multivariate mapping from a feature
vector to a vector of deviation scores, which captures local context
information and cross-document interactions. DRMRR uses a Distributionally
Robust Optimization (DRO) framework to minimize a multi-output loss function
under the most adverse distributions in the neighborhood of the empirical data
distribution defined by a Wasserstein ball. We show that this is equivalent to
a regularized regression problem with a matrix norm regularizer. Our
experiments were conducted on two real-world applications, medical document
retrieval, and drug response prediction, showing that DRMRR notably outperforms
state-of-the-art LTR models. We also conducted a comprehensive analysis to
assess the resilience of DRMRR against various types of noise: Gaussian noise,
adversarial perturbations, and label poisoning. We show that DRMRR is not only
able to achieve significantly better performance than other baselines, but it
can maintain a relatively stable performance as more noise is added to the

high translation quality by searching for better intermediate automatic speech

decoding model decomposing the overall task into ASR and machine translation
sub-tasks. However, the decoding speed is not fast enough for real-world
applications because it conducts beam search for both sub-tasks during

non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding based on connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) outputs followed by an ASR decoder. We investigated two
types of NAR HI: (1) parallel HI by using an autoregressive Transformer ASR
decoder and (2) masked HI by using Mask-CTC, which combines CTC and the
conditional masked language model. To reduce a mismatch in the ASR decoder
between teacher-forcing during training and conditioning on CTC outputs during
testing, we also propose sampling CTC outputs during training. Experimental
evaluations on three corpora show that Fast-MD achieved about 2x and 4x faster
decoding speed than that of the na\""ive MD model on GPU and CPU with comparable
translation quality. Adopting the Conformer encoder and intermediate CTC loss
further boosts its quality without sacrificing decoding speed.

online learning without the use of error back-propagation or the calculation of

each node, the network rapidly learns to appropriately allocate its neuronal
resources at each layer for any given problem without using a real-valued error

ensuring network stability and remarkable robustness to noise as well as to the
selection of initial system parameters. Network activations are inherently
sparse due to a hard Winner-Take-All (WTA) constraint at each layer. We
evaluate the architecture on existing spatio-temporal datasets, including the
spike-encoded IRIS and TIDIGITS datasets, as well as a novel set of tasks based

possible to describe the vorticity or the stream function in terms of one
modulated profile. There are in fact two profiles, both at the level of the
physical vorticity and at the level of the stream function. The spectral
density function allows us to identify these profiles, and its smoothness leads
to pointwise decay of the stream function which is consistent with the decay

feature-rich set of discretization techniques for the numerical approximation
of a wide range of PDEs, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, and
multi-field equations. An expressive API allows users to define PDEs in weak
form by a syntax close to the mathematical notation. While this is also
available in previous codes, the main novelty of Gridap is that it implements
this API without introducing a DSL plus a compiler of variational forms.
Instead, it leverages the Julia just-in-time compiler to build efficient code,
specialized for the concrete problem at hand. As a result, there is no need to
use different languages for the computational back-end and the user front-end
anymore, thus eliminating the so-called two-language problem. Gridap also
provides a low-level API that is modular and extensible via the
multiple-dispatch paradigm of Julia and provides easy access to the main
building blocks of the library. The main contribution of this paper is the
detailed presentation of the novel software abstractions behind the Gridap
design that leverages the new software possibilities provided by the Julia
language. The second main contribution of the article is a performance
comparison against FEniCS. We measure CPU times needed to assemble discrete
systems of linear equations for different problem types and show that the
performance of Gridap is comparable to FEniCS, demonstrating that the new
software design does not compromise performance. Gridap is freely available at

The extinction process of the detonation wave is also been analyzed. It is
found that small n-heptane droplets (e.g., 2 um) are completely vaporized in
the fuel refilling area. Increasing the droplet diameter causes the droplet to
fail to evaporate completely within the fuel refilling area and exist after the
detonation wave. A reflected shock can be obsevered after the detonation wave.
When the droplet diameter is larger than 10 {\mu}m, the higher pressure after
the detonation wave leads to the reactants cannot be sprayed into the
combustor, eventually leading to extinction of the detonation wave. In
bi-disperse n-heptane sprays, presence of droplets with small diameter
maintains the stable propagation of the detonation wave. The average
equivalence ratio in the fuel refilling area is lower than total equivalence
ratio (up to 0.66 only), and the average equivalence ratio decreases with the
increase of droplet diameter in bi-disperse n-heptane sprays. The increase in

extraordinary opportunities to realize rich exotic magnetic topological phases

rare-earth hexaborides EuB6 represents an interesting magnetic topological
phase with tunable magnetizations along different crystallographic directions,
while the correlation with the topological properties remains scarcely
explored. In this work, combining magnetotransport measurements and first
principles calculations, we demonstrate that EuB6 exhibits versatile magnetic
topological phases along different crystallographic directions, which tightly
correlate with the varied magnetizations. Moreover, by virtue of the weak
magneto-crystalline anisotropy and the relatively strong coupling between the
local magnetization and the conduction electrons, we show that the magnetic
ground state of the system can be directly probed by the anisotropy in the
magnetotransport properties. Our work thus introduces an excellent platform to
study the rich topological phases that are tunable by magnetic orders.

to represent statistical models in various areas, such as data compression,

becomes problematic. A method to solve this problem is to assume a prior
distribution on the full rooted trees. This enables the optimal model selection
based on the Bayes decision theory. For example, by assigning a low prior
probability to a complex model, the maximum a posteriori estimator prevents the
selection of the complex one. Furthermore, we can average all the models
weighted by their posteriors. In this paper, we propose a probability
distribution on a set of full rooted trees. Its parametric representation is
suitable for calculating the properties of our distribution using recursive
functions, such as the mode, expectation, and posterior distribution. Although
such distributions have been proposed in previous studies, they are only
applicable to specific applications. Therefore, we extract their mathematically

Herein, we examine the multi-functional properties of hybrid aerogels
consisting of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) integrated with hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) platelets. Using a freeze-drying approach, hybrid aerogels are
fabricated by simple mixing with various volume fractions of hBN and rGO up to
0.5/0.5 ratio. The fabrication method is simple, cost effective, scalable and
can be extended to other 2D materials combinations. The hybrid rGO/hBN aerogels
(HAs) are mechanically robust and highly compressible with mechanical
properties similar to those of the pure rGO aerogel. We show that the presence
of hBN in the HAs enhances the gas absorption capacities of formaldehyde and
water vapour up to ~7 and > 8 times, respectively, as compared to pure rGO
aerogel. Moreover, the samples show good recoverability, making them highly
efficient materials for gas absorption applications and for the protection of
artefacts such as paintings in storage facilities. Finally, even in the
presence of large quantity of insulating hBN, the HAs are electrically
conductive, extending the potential application spectrum of the proposed
hybrids to the field of electro-thermal actuators. The work proposed here paves

different types of planetary bodies and even for specific objects it is often
not known in detail. One of the physical properties that strongly depends on
the surface structure is the surface temperature. In highly porous media with
large voids, radiation can efficiently transport heat, whereas more compact,
micro-porous structures transport the heat primarily by conduction through the
solid material. In this work, we investigate under which conditions a
macro-porous surface can be distinguished from a micro-porous one by simply
measuring the surface temperature. In our numerical simulations, we included
circular and elliptical orbits with and without obliquity and varied the
rotation period of the considered objects. We found that daily temperature
cycles are rather insensitive to the specific surface granularity. However, the
surface temperature at sunrise shows significant dependency on the material
structure and this effect becomes even more pronounced when the solar intensity
increases. By measuring the sunrise temperature as a function of insolation at
noon, a differentiation between micro- and macro-granular surface structures is
possible. In this paper, we provide a strategy how remote sensing can be used
to derive the surface structure of small Solar System bodies.

state-of-the-art approach to recommender systems. In this survey, we conduct a
comprehensive review of the literature on graph neural network-based
recommender systems. We first introduce the background and the history of the
development of both recommender systems and graph neural networks. For
recommender systems, in general, there are four aspects for categorizing
existing works: stage, scenario, objective, and application. For graph neural
networks, the existing methods consist of two categories, spectral models and
spatial ones. We then discuss the motivation of applying graph neural networks
into recommender systems, mainly consisting of the high-order connectivity, the
structural property of data, and the enhanced supervision signal. We then
systematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding
propagation/aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency.
Afterward and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a multitude of
existing works of graph neural network-based recommender systems, following the
taxonomy above. Finally, we raise discussions on the open problems and
promising future directions in this area. We summarize the representative

how to interact with objects and its environment. Affordances are defined as
the relationships between an agent, the objects, and the possible future
actions in the environment. In this paper, we present a Bayesian deep learning
method to predict the affordances available in the environment directly from
RGB images. Based on previous work on socially accepted affordances, our model
is based on a multiscale CNN that combines local and global information from
the object and the full image. However, previous works assume a deterministic
model, but uncertainty quantification is fundamental for robust detection,
affordance-based reason, continual learning, etc. Our Bayesian model is able to
capture both the aleatoric uncertainty from the scene and the epistemic
uncertainty associated with the model and previous learning process. For
comparison, we estimate the uncertainty using two state-of-the-art techniques:
Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles. We also compare different types of CNN
encoders for feature extraction. We have performed several experiments on an
affordance database on socially acceptable behaviours and we have shown
improved performance compared with previous works. Furthermore, the uncertainty
estimation is consistent with the the type of objects and scenarios. Our
results show a marginal better performance of deep ensembles, compared to
MC-dropout on the Brier score and the Expected Calibration Error.

  Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The crime forecasting is an important problem as it greatly contributes to
urban safety. Typically, the goal of the problem is to predict different types
of crimes for each geographical region (like a neighborhood or censor tract) in
the near future. Since nearby regions usually have similar socioeconomic
characteristics which indicate similar crime patterns, recent state-of-the-art
solutions constructed a distance-based region graph and utilized Graph Neural
Network (GNN) techniques for crime forecasting, because the GNN techniques
could effectively exploit the latent relationships between neighboring region
nodes in the graph. However, this distance-based pre-defined graph cannot fully
capture crime correlation between regions that are far from each other but
share similar crime patterns. Hence, to make an accurate crime prediction, the
main challenge is to learn a better graph that reveals the dependencies between
regions in crime occurrences and meanwhile captures the temporal patterns from
historical crime records. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end
graph convolutional recurrent network called HAGEN with several novel designs
for crime prediction. Specifically, our framework could jointly capture the
crime correlation between regions and the temporal crime dynamics by combining
an adaptive region graph learning module with the Diffusion Convolution Gated
Recurrent Unit (DCGRU). Based on the homophily assumption of GNN, we propose a
homophily-aware constraint to regularize the optimization of the region graph
so that neighboring region nodes on the learned graph share similar crime
patterns, thus fitting the mechanism of diffusion convolution. It also
incorporates crime embedding to model the interdependencies between regions and
crime categories. Empirical experiments and comprehensive analysis on two
real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of HAGEN.

complementary observations at X-ray and radio wavelengths. We present X-ray
observations from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) and radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
of a series of GOES A3.4 to B1.6 class flares observed on 2013 April 23. The
flares, as seen in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV), originated from
multiple locations within active region NOAA 11726. A veritable zoo of
different radio emissions between 1 GHz and 2 GHz was observed co-temporally
with the X-ray flares. In addition to broad-band continuum emission, broad-band
short-lived bursts and narrow-band spikes, indicative of accelerated electrons,
were observed. However, these sources were located up to 150 arcsec away from
the flaring X-ray sources but only some of these emissions could be explained
as signatures of electrons that were accelerated near the main flare site. For
other sources, no obvious magnetic connection to the main flare site could be
found. These emissions likely originate from secondary acceleration sites
triggered by the flare, but may be due to reconnection and acceleration
completely unrelated to the co-temporally observed flare. Thanks to the
extremely high sensitivity of the VLA, not achieved with current X-ray
instrumentation, it is shown that particle acceleration happens frequently and
at multiple locations within a flaring active region.

proposed and attracted widespread attention in many fields. However, most of
them are based on anchor-boxes or standard Gaussian heatmaps. Such label
assignment strategy may not only fail to reflect the shape and direction
characteristics of arbitrary-oriented objects, but also have high
parameter-tuning efforts. In this paper, a novel AOOD method called General
Gaussian Heatmap Label Assignment (GGHL) is proposed. Specifically, an
anchor-free object-adaptation label assignment (OLA) strategy is presented to
define the positive candidates based on two-dimensional (2-D) oriented Gaussian
heatmaps, which reflect the shape and direction features of arbitrary-oriented
objects. Based on OLA, an oriented-bounding-box (OBB) representation component
(ORC) is developed to indicate OBBs and adjust the Gaussian center prior
weights to fit the characteristics of different objects adaptively through
neural network learning. Moreover, a joint-optimization loss (JOL) with area
normalization and dynamic confidence weighting is designed to refine the
misalign optimal results of different subtasks. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that the proposed GGHL improves the AOOD performance with
low parameter-tuning and time costs. Furthermore, it is generally applicable to
most AOOD methods to improve their performance including lightweight models on
embedded platforms.

by the causal children. The assumed population can be modeled by finite

shown that the stationary state of the population always exists and the matrix

recent deep learning (DL) solutions, however these developments have mostly
focused on the classification accuracy. Before employing DL solutions in
safety-critical applications, such as automated driving, an indispensable
prerequisite is the accurate quantification of the classifiers' reliability.
Unfortunately, DL classifiers are characterized as black-box systems which
output severely over-confident predictions, leading downstream decision-making
systems to false conclusions with possibly catastrophic consequences. We find
that deep radar classifiers maintain high-confidences for ambiguous, difficult
samples, e.g. small objects measured at large distances, under domain shift and
signal corruptions, regardless of the correctness of the predictions. The focus
of this article is to learn deep radar spectra classifiers which offer robust
real-time uncertainty estimates using label smoothing during training. Label
smoothing is a technique of refining, or softening, the hard labels typically
available in classification datasets. In this article, we exploit
radar-specific know-how to define soft labels which encourage the classifiers
to learn to output high-quality calibrated uncertainty estimates, thereby
partially resolving the problem of over-confidence. Our investigations show how
simple radar knowledge can easily be combined with complex data-driven learning
algorithms to yield safe automotive radar perception.

acceleration is found to be nearly independent of the underlying numerical

methods such cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) in alkaline media. A significant improvement in the OER activity is
observed when the top surface presents an Fe:Ni composition ratio in the range
20-40%, which is in good agreement with what has been observed for powder
catalysts. Furthermore, a decrease in the OER overpotential is observed
following surface aging in electrolyte for three days. At higher Ni load, AFM
shows the growth of a new phase attributed to an (oxy)-hydroxide phase which,
according to CV measurements, does not seem to correlate with the surface
activity towards OER. EIS suggests that the OER precursor species observed on
the clean and Ni-modified surfaces are similar and Fe-centered, but form at
lower overpotentials when the surface Fe:Ni ratio is optimized.

spatially-resolved measurements (~0.06'' on the ~0.15'' disk subtended by Pluto
and its atmosphere) of CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) (ii) targetting new chemical
compounds, primarily hydrogen isocyanide (HNC). The CO line shows an absorption
core at beam positions within Pluto's disk, a direct signature of Pluto's cold
mesosphere. Analysis provides tentative evidence for a non-uniform temperature
field in the lower atmosphere (near 30 km), with summer pole latitudes being
7$\pm$3.5 K warmer than low latitudes. This unexpected result may point to
shorter radiative timescales in the atmosphere than previously thought. The HCN
emission is considerably more extended than CO, peaking at radial distances
beyond Pluto limb, and providing a new method to determine Pluto's HCN vertical
profile in 2017. The mean (column-averaged) location of HCN is at 690+/-75 km
altitude, with an upper atmosphere (> 800 km) mixing ratio of ~ 1.8 x
10$^{-4}$. Little or no HCN (<5 x 10$^{-9}$ at 65 km) is present in the lower
atmosphere, implying undersaturation of HCN there. The HCN emission appears
enhanced above the low-latitude limb, but interpretation, in terms of an
enhanced HCN abundance or a warmer upper atmosphere there, is uncertain. The
first detection of HNC is reported, with a (7.0$\pm$2.1) x 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$
column density, referred to Pluto surface, and a HNC / HCN ratio of
0.095+/-0.026, very similar to their values in Titan's atmosphere. We also
obtain upper limits on CH3CN (< 2.6 x 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$) and CH$_3$CCH (< 8.5

Despite the lightweight architecture, we observed that this vanilla framework
suffered from insufficient discriminative power in distinguishing graph
topologies, leading to a dramatic drop in performance. This discovery motivates
us to devise meta aggregators to improve the expressive power of vanilla
binarized GNNs, of which the aggregation schemes can be adaptively changed in a
learnable manner based on the binarized features. Towards this end, we propose
two dedicated forms of meta neighborhood aggregators, an exclusive meta
aggregator termed as Greedy Gumbel Neighborhood Aggregator (GNA), and a
diffused meta aggregator termed as Adaptable Hybrid Neighborhood Aggregator
(ANA). GNA learns to exclusively pick one single optimal aggregator from a pool
of candidates, while ANA learns a hybrid aggregation behavior to simultaneously
retain the benefits of several individual aggregators. Furthermore, the
proposed meta aggregators may readily serve as a generic plugin module into
existing full-precision GNNs. Experiments across various domains demonstrate
that the proposed method yields results superior to the state of the art.

electrical properties tomography (MREPT) is an imaging modality that
reconstructs EPs by the radio-frequency field in an MRI system. MREPT
reconstructs EPs by solving analytic models numerically based on Maxwell's
equations. Most MREPT methods suffer from artifacts caused by inaccuracy of the
hypotheses behind the models, and/or numerical errors. These artifacts can be
mitigated by adding coefficients to stabilize the models, however, the
selection of such coefficient has been empirical, which limit its medical
application. Alternatively, end-to-end Neural networks-based MREPT (NN-MREPT)
learns to reconstruct the EPs from training samples, circumventing Maxwell's
equations. However, due to its pattern-matching nature, it is difficult for
NN-MREPT to produce accurate reconstructions for new samples. In this work, we
proposed a physics-coupled NN for MREPT (PCNN-MREPT), in which an analytic
model, cr-MREPT, works with diffusion and convection coefficients, learned by
NNs from the difference between the reconstructed and ground-truth EPs to
reduce artifacts. With two simulated datasets, three generalization experiments
in which test samples deviate gradually from the training samples, and one
noise-robustness experiment were conducted. The results show that the proposed
PCNN-MREPT achieves higher accuracy than two representative analytic methods.
Moreover, compared with an end-to-end NN-MREPT, the proposed method attained
higher accuracy in two critical generalization tests. This is an important step
to practical MREPT medical diagnoses.

Then, the proposed regularizer penalizes the $W_2$-distance of the patch
distribution of the reconstruction to the patch distribution of some reference
image at different scales. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
regularizer by two- and three-dimensional numerical examples.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The traditional observed data used to train the recommender model suffers
from severe bias issues (e.g., exposure bias, popularity bias). Interactions of
a small fraction of head items account for almost the whole training data. The
normal training paradigm from such biased data tends to repetitively generate
recommendations from the head items, which further exacerbates the biases and
affects the exploration of potentially interesting items from the niche set. In
this work, distinct from existing methods, we innovatively explore the central
theme of unbiased recommendation from an item cluster-wise multi-objective
optimization perspective. Aiming to balance the learning on various item
clusters that differ in popularity during the training process, we characterize
the recommendation task as an item cluster-wise multi-objective optimization
problem. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework namely Item
Cluster-Wise Multi-Objective Recommendation (ICMRec) for unbiased
recommendation. In detail, we define our item cluster-wise optimization target
that the recommender model should balance all item clusters that differ in
popularity. Thus we set the model learning on each item cluster as a unique
optimization objective. To achieve this goal, we first explore items'
popularity levels from a novel causal reasoning perspective. Then, we devise
popularity discrepancy-based bisecting clustering to separate the discriminated
item clusters. Next, we adaptively find the overall harmonious gradient
direction for multiple item cluster-wise optimization objectives from a
Pareto-efficient solver. Finally, in the prediction stage, we perform
counterfactual inference to further eliminate the impact of user conformity.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiorities of ICMRec on
overall recommendation performance and biases elimination. Codes will be
open-source upon acceptance.

studies have shown that these properties can be tuned by varying the Si/Ge

thin films of SixGe1-xO2 quartz have never been reported. Here we present the
successful crystallization of SixGe1-xO2 thin films in the alpha-quartz phase

semi-epitaxially, with the same orientation as the substrates. Interestingly,
the Si0.75Ge0.25O2 composition grows fully strained by the quartz substrates

Dauphine twin structure. These studies represent a first step towards the

suitable approach for some types of derivatives but suffers from the {\it curse

multiple underlying assets. We propose a quantum algorithm for FDM-based
pricing of multi-asset derivative with exponential speedup with respect to
dimensionality compared with classical algorithms. The proposed algorithm
utilizes the quantum algorithm for solving differential equations, which is
based on quantum linear system algorithms. Addressing the specific issue in
derivative pricing, that is, extracting the derivative price for the present
underlying asset prices from the output state of the quantum algorithm, we
present the whole of the calculation process and estimate its complexity. We
believe that the proposed method opens the new possibility of accurate and

from the Marvel network, such as the number of nodes and links, the hubs, the
components, the shortest path lengths and the diameter. In the next part, we
analyze the structure of the Marvel network and obtain some results of the
connectedness, the clustering, the degree distribution, the degree correlation.
Meanwhile, we fit the power law and divide the network into different
communities. In this process, we not only find that the network appears to have
the small world nature, since it is obviously a scale-free network, but also
find that it is very similar to the real-world social network. Further, based
on the work of Loverkar et al., we do a hypothesis test on the small world
nature of the network. We find that the Marvel network does have small world
property. In the end, we visualize the Marvel network to give a better
understanding of the network.

communication with a wide array of applications in disciplines including the
Life Sciences, Computer Science, and the Social Sciences. Languages like RDF,
OWL, and other formalisms based on formal logic are applied to make scientific
knowledge accessible not only to human readers but also to automated systems.
These approaches have mostly focused on the structure of scientific
publications themselves, on the used scientific methods and equipment, or on
the structure of the used datasets. The core claims or hypotheses of scientific
work have only been covered in a shallow manner, such as by linking mentioned
entities to established identifiers. In this research, we therefore want to
find out whether we can use existing semantic formalisms to fully express the
content of high-level scientific claims using formal semantics in a systematic
way. Analyzing the main claims from a sample of scientific articles from all
disciplines, we find that their semantics are more complex than what a
straight-forward application of formalisms like RDF or OWL account for, but we
managed to elicit a clear semantic pattern which we call the 'super-pattern'.
We show here how the instantiation of the five slots of this super-pattern
leads to a strictly defined statement in higher-order logic. We successfully
applied this super-pattern to an enlarged sample of scientific claims. We show
that knowledge representation experts, when instructed to independently
instantiate the super-pattern with given scientific claims, show a high degree
of consistency and convergence given the complexity of the task and the
subject. These results therefore open the door for expressing high-level
scientific findings in a manner they can be automatically interpreted, which on
the longer run can allow us to do automated consistency checking, and much
more.

adding explicit information compression to these algorithms yields better and
more robust representations. We verify this by developing SimCLR and BYOL
formulations compatible with the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB)

the learned representation, and observe their impact on downstream tasks.
Furthermore, we explore the relationship between Lipschitz continuity and
compression, showing a tractable lower bound on the Lipschitz constant of the
encoders we learn. As Lipschitz continuity is closely related to robustness,
this provides a new explanation for why compressed models are more robust. Our
experiments confirm that adding compression to SimCLR and BYOL significantly
improves linear evaluation accuracies and model robustness across a wide range
of domain shifts. In particular, the compressed version of BYOL achieves 76.0%

on that work with a replication of A&W's experiments and additional analyses on
model stability and the effects of preprocessing, both in relation to the small
data size. We show that (1) the small data causes the classification model to
be highly sensitive to variations in the random train-test split, and that (2)
the applied preprocessing causes the data to be extremely sparse, with the
majority of items in the data having at most two non-zero lexical features.
With additional experiments in which we vary the steps of the preprocessing
pipeline, we show that the small data size keeps causing problems, irrespective

topological band theory due to its exotic bulk-edge correspondence. Recently,
it has been predicted that external magnetic field can introduce rich physics
into two-dimensional (2D) HOTIs. However, up to now the theoretical description
is still incomplete and the experimental realization is still lacking. Here we
investigate the influence of continuously varying magnetic field on 2D
Su-Schriffer-Heeger lattice, which is one of the most celebrated HOTI models,
and proposed a corresponding circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) simulator.
Our numerical calculation shows that the zero energy corner modes (ZECMs),
which can serve as evidence of the high order topology of the lattice, exhibit
exotic and rich dependence on the imposed magnetic field and the inhomogeneous
hopping strength. Moreover, by exploiting the parametric conversion method, we
can establish time- and site-resolved tunable hopping constants in the proposed
cQED simulator, thus providing an ideal platform for simulating the magnetic
field induced topological phase transitions in 2D HOTIs. Since the high-order
topological phases of the proposed model can be characterized by the existence
of the ZECMs on the lattice, we further investigate the corner site excitation
of the lattice in the steady state limit. Our numerical results imply that the
predicted topological phase transitions can be unambiguously identified by the
steady-state photon number measurement of the corner sites and their few
neighbors. Requiring only current level of technology, our scheme can be
readily tested in experiment and may pave an alternative way towards the future
investigation of HOTIs in the presence of magnetic field, disorder, and strong

poor generalization of the trained model. A classical global pooled
representation will probably lose useful local information. Many few-shot
learning methods have recently addressed this challenge using deep descriptors
and learning a pixel-level metric. However, using deep descriptors as feature
representations may lose image contextual information. Moreover, most of these
methods independently address each class in the support set, which cannot
sufficiently use discriminative information and task-specific embeddings. In
this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based neural network architecture
called sparse spatial transformers (SSFormers), which finds task-relevant
features and suppresses task-irrelevant features. Particularly, we first divide
each input image into several image patches of different sizes to obtain dense
local features. These features retain contextual information while expressing
local information. Then, a sparse spatial transformer layer is proposed to find
spatial correspondence between the query image and the full support set to
select task-relevant image patches and suppress task-irrelevant image patches.
Finally, we propose using an image patch-matching module to calculate the
distance between dense local representations, thus determining which category
the query image belongs to in the support set. Extensive experiments on popular
few-shot learning benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art methods. Our source code is available at

dependence on the RS is identified which has a remarkable impact on the
switching performance of MoS2 RRAM. RS behavior was found to be significantly
dependent on the charge conduction in the channel. Moreover, we have shown a
potential device forming event when MoS2 gated RRAMs were subjected to a
steady-state electrical stress. Both hysteresis and steady state electrical
stress were found to disturb the transistor action of these gated RRAMs, which
in fact can be used as a signature of RS. Interestingly, current-voltage
hysteresis resulted in unipolar RS, whereas steady-state electrical stress
before RS measurement led to bipolar RS. Moreover, successive stress cycles of
such an electrical stress leads to multiple resistance states, a behavior
similar to synaptic properties like long-term potentiation and long-term
depression, typically found in memristors. We find that charge transport
mechanism dominant in the MoS2 FET in conjunction with steady-state stress
induced device forming determine the extent of RS induced in these MoS2 based
gated RRAMs. Finally on the basis of insights developed from the dependence on
charge transport mechanism and steady-state stress induced forming of MoS2

MRI is limited by the lack of standardization, and time-consuming
postprocessing. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that a cascaded deep
learning pipeline trained with augmentation by synthetically generated data
would improve model accuracy and robustness for automated scar quantification.
  Methods: A cascaded pipeline consisting of three consecutive neural networks
is proposed, starting with a bounding box regression network to identify a
region of interest around the left ventricular (LV) myocardium. Two further
nnU-Net models are then used to segment the myocardium and, if present, scar.
The models were trained on the data from the EMIDEC challenge, supplemented
with an extensive synthetic dataset generated with a conditional GAN.
  Results: The cascaded pipeline significantly outperformed a single nnU-Net
directly segmenting both the myocardium (mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)
(standard deviation (SD)): 0.84 (0.09) vs 0.63 (0.20), p < 0.01) and scar (DSC:
0.72 (0.34) vs 0.46 (0.39), p < 0.01) on a per-slice level. The inclusion of
the synthetic data as data augmentation during training improved the scar
segmentation DSC by 0.06 (p < 0.01). The mean DSC per-subject on the challenge
test set, for the cascaded pipeline augmented by synthetic generated data, was
0.86 (0.03) and 0.67 (0.29) for myocardium and scar, respectively.
  Conclusion: A cascaded deep learning-based pipeline trained with augmentation
by synthetically generated data leads to myocardium and scar segmentations that
are similar to the manual operator, and outperforms direct segmentation without

supernova with signatures of interaction with circumstantial material in its
earliest spectra. High ionization lines, the earmark of shock breakout, are not
seen in the earliest spectral epoch, and are only seen in a single spectrum at
4.9 d after explosion. The strength and brevity of these features imply a
confined circumstellar material shell in the immediate vicinity of the
progenitor. Once the narrow emission lines disappear, SN 2018zd evolves
similarly to a Type IIP SN, although the blue colour and enhanced plateau
magnitude of SN 2018zd suggests an additional source of luminosity throughout
the plateau phase. While SN 2018zd has previously been proposed as an
electron-capture SN, we suggest that it is an Fe core-collapse from a low mass
red supergiant progenitor. Differences in interpretation for SN 2018zd arise in
part due to the large uncertainty on the distance to the host-galaxy NGC 2146,
which we re-derive here to be $15.6^{+6.1}_{-3.0}$ Mpc. We find the ejected
$^{56}$Ni mass for SN 2018zd to be 0.017 M$_{\odot}$, significantly higher than
models of ECSNe predict. We also find the Ni/Fe ratio in SN 2018zd to be much
lower that would be expected for an ECSN.

generate multiply-quantized superfluid circulation about an obstacle in highly
oblate Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Our method involves spiraling a
blue-detuned laser beam, which acts as a repulsive optical potential, around
and towards the center of the BEC. This optical potential serves first as a
repulsive stirrer to initiate superflow within the BEC, and then as a pinning
potential that transports the center of the superfluid circulation to the
center of the condensate. By changing the rate at which the beam moves along
the spiral trajectory, we selectively control the net circulation introduced
into the BEC. We experimentally achieve pinned superflow with winding numbers
as high as 11, which persists for at least 4 s. At the end of the spiral
trajectory, with the pinning beam on at full power, the BEC has a toroidal
geometry with a high winding-number persistent current. Alternatively, the beam
power can be ramped off, allowing controlled placement of a cluster of
singly-quantized vortices of the same circulation. This technique can serve as
a building block in future experimental architectures to create on-demand
vortex distributions and superfluid circulation in BECs.

of the newly formed DNA strand as well as cleaving the erroneous growth in case

coordination of the polymerization and exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase.
Here we propose and analyze a minimal kinetic model of DNA replication and
determine exact expressions for the velocity of elongation and the accuracy of
replication. We first analyze the case without exonuclease activity. In that
case, accuracy is determined by a kinetic competition between stepping and
unbinding, with discrimination between correct and incorrect nucleotides in
both transitions. We then include exonuclease activity and ask how different
modes of additional discrimination in the exonuclease pathway can improve the
accuracy while limiting the detrimental effect of exonuclase on the speed of
replication. In this way, we ask how the kinetic parameters of the model have
to be set to coordinate the two activities of the enzyme for high accuracy and
high speed. The analysis also shows that the design of a replication system
does not universally have to follow the speed-accuracy trade-off rule, although
it does in the biologically realized parameter range. The accuracy of the
process is mainly controlled by the crucial role of stepping after erroneous
incorporation, which has impact on both polymerase and exonuclease activities

for transformers. We show that transformers have unique quantization challenges
-- namely, high dynamic activation ranges that are difficult to represent with
a low bit fixed-point format. We establish that these activations contain
structured outliers in the residual connections that encourage specific
attention patterns, such as attending to the special separator token. To combat
these challenges, we present three solutions based on post-training
quantization and quantization-aware training, each with a different set of
compromises for accuracy, model size, and ease of use. In particular, we
introduce a novel quantization scheme -- per-embedding-group quantization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the GLUE benchmark using BERT,
establishing state-of-the-art results for post-training quantization. Finally,
we show that transformer weights and embeddings can be quantized to ultra-low
bit-widths, leading to significant memory savings with a minimum accuracy loss.

Furthermore, there is no possibility of using end-to-end training data in
conventional cascaded systems, meaning that the training data most suited for
the task cannot be used. Previous studies suggested several approaches for
integrated end-to-end training to overcome those problems, however they mostly
rely on (synthetic or natural) three-way data. We propose a cascaded model
based on the non-autoregressive Transformer that enables end-to-end training
without the need for an explicit intermediate representation. This new
architecture (i) avoids unnecessary early decisions that can cause errors which
are then propagated throughout the cascaded models and (ii) utilizes the
end-to-end training data directly. We conduct an evaluation on two pivot-based
machine translation tasks, namely French-German and German-Czech. Our
experimental results show that the proposed architecture yields an improvement
of more than 2 BLEU for French-German over the cascaded baseline.

to understand implicatures relating to connectives, and the extent to which
models show humanlike preferences regarding temporal dynamics of connectives.
We find that although models predict connectives reasonably well in the context

substantial humanlike temporal preferences. Overall, the findings suggest that
at present, dominant pre-training paradigms do not result in substantial

attempts to highlight such a case. Using this example of ad-hoc communication
between aircraft mid-flight, a tutorial-style description is attempted that
shall show how the OMNeT++ simulator can be used when a wealth of real-world
trace data is available. In particular, it is described how mobility trace
files can be directly used within OMNeT++, and how to link the generation of
data messages to this mobility data. This is explained via an example
simulation that evaluates a communication network in which an aircraft notifies
the ground control when it enters or leaves a specific geographic region.
Additionally, a novel trace-based application has been developed to achieve
this link between mobility and message generation. Furthermore, a new
TDMA-based medium access protocol for decentralized communication networks is
presented, which is oracle-based and thus allows a TDMA-like behavior of medium
access without causing any overhead; it can be useful when upper-layer
protocols should be evaluated under the assumption of TDMA-like behavior, but
isolated from the effects of a full-fledged TDMA protocol. Finally, physical
layer behavior is often either overly simplistic or overly computationally
expensive. For the latter case, when a detailed channel model is available but
its evaluation requires prohibitive computational effort, then averaging its
behavior into trace data can find a middle ground between efficient evaluation
and realistic representation. Hence, a novel trace-based radio model has been
developed that makes use of an SNR to PER mapping. In the spirit of open
science, all implementations have been made available under open licenses.

superoperator exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, which leads to
unidirectional damping dynamics, dubbed as ""chiral damping"". Due to the
non-Hermitian skin effect, the damping dynamics is boundary sensitive: The
long-time damping of such open systems is algebraic under periodic boundary
conditions but exponential under open boundary conditions. We reveal the phase
transition with the inclusion of the hopping amplitude modulation. By using the
spectral topology and a finite-size scaling analysis in the commensurate case,
we show there exists a phase transition of the skin effect with non-Bloch
anti-parity-time symmetry breaking. For the incommensurate case, we find richer
phases with the coexistence of the non-Hermitian skin effect and the Anderson
localization, which are separated by a generalized mobility edge. We reveal the
transition of the damping dynamics as a consequence of the phase transition.
Furthermore, we propose a possible scheme with ultracold atoms in a dissipative
momentum lattice to realize and detect the damping dynamics.

acoustic solitary wave from a potential barrier in a dusty plasma medium. The
experiments have been carried out in an inverted $\Pi$-shaped Dusty Plasma
Experimental (DPEx) device in a DC glow discharge plasma environment. The dust
acoustic solitary wave is excited by modulating the plasma with a short
negative Gaussian pulse that is superimposed over the discharge voltage. The
solitary wave structure is seen to move towards a potential barrier, created by
the sheath around a biased wire, and turn back after reflecting off the
barrier. The amplitude, width, and velocity of the soliton are recorded as a
function of time. The experiment is repeated for different strengths of the
potential barrier and for different initial amplitudes of the solitary wave. It
is found that the distance of the closest approach of the solitary wave to the
centre of the barrier increases with the increase of the strength of the
potential barrier and with the decrease of the initial wave amplitude. An
emissive probe is used to measure the sheath potential and its thickness by
measuring the plasma potential profile in the axial direction over a range of
resistances connected to the biased wire. A modified Korteweg de Vries equation
is derived and numerically solved to qualitatively understand the experimental
findings.

$z(x;\theta)$ with a single linear unit and input/output dimensions equal to
one that interpolate a given dataset $\mathcal D=\{(x_i,f(x_i))\}$ and, among
all such interpolants, minimize the $\ell_2$-norm of the neuron weights. Such
networks can intuitively be thought of as those that minimize the mean-squared
error over $\mathcal D$ plus an infinitesimal weight decay penalty. We
therefore refer to them as ridgeless ReLU interpolants. Our description proves
that, to extrapolate values $z(x;\theta)$ for inputs $x\in (x_i,x_{i+1})$ lying
between two consecutive datapoints, a ridgeless ReLU interpolant simply
compares the signs of the discrete estimates for the curvature of $f$ at $x_i$
and $x_{i+1}$ derived from the dataset $\mathcal D$. If the curvature estimates
at $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ have different signs, then $z(x;\theta)$ must be linear
on $(x_i,x_{i+1})$. If in contrast the curvature estimates at $x_i$ and
$x_{i+1}$ are both positive (resp. negative), then $z(x;\theta)$ is convex
(resp. concave) on $(x_i,x_{i+1})$. Our results show that ridgeless ReLU
interpolants achieve the best possible generalization for learning $1d$
Lipschitz functions, up to universal constants.

estimated using the bootstrap method, while systematic errors are determined
from variations of the spectral functions. We also perform a high-precision
extraction of the nucleon radii and find good agreement with previous analyses
of spacelike data alone. For the proton charge radius, we find $r_E^p =
0.840^{+0.003}_{-0.002}{}^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$~fm, where the first error is
statistical and the second one is systematic. The Zemach radius and third

The combined data set of space- and timelike data disfavors a zero crossing of
$\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$ in the spacelike region. Finally, we discuss the status and
perspectives of modulus and phase of the form factors in the timelike region in

to the recent development and emerging interest in applying data fusion for

existing works on aerodynamic model using data fusion mainly concern integral

These simplifications to SSVAEs preserve their theoretical soundness while
providing a number of practical advantages in the semi-supervised setup where
the result of training is a text classifier. These simplifications are the
removal of (i) the Kullback-Liebler divergence from its objective and (ii) the
fully unobserved latent variable from its probabilistic model. These changes
relieve users from choosing a prior for their latent variables, make the model
smaller and faster, and allow for a better flow of information into the latent

show a speed-up of 26%, while keeping equivalent classification scores. The

with electron number densities of ~300-700 cm-3. They are all characterised by
high Hbeta equivalent widths EW(Hbeta)~190-520A and high
O32=[OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratios of 10-30, indicating young starburst ages and
the presence of high ionization radiation. All are low-metallicity objects with

component of the Halpha line and five out of six objects show Wolf-Rayet
features. Comparison with photoionization models shows that pure stellar
ionization radiation from massive stars is not hard enough to produce such
strong [NeV] and HeII emission in our galaxies. The [NeV]3426/HeII4686 flux
ratio of ~1.2 in J1222+3602 is consistent with some contribution of active
galactic nucleus ionizing radiation. However, in the remaining five galaxies,

be non-uniform in density, where HeII and [NeV] lines are emitted in
low-density channels made by outflows and illuminated by harder ionizing
radiation from radiative shocks propagating through these channels, whereas

infinite path graph. However, the Schr\""odinger equation requires the
Hamiltonian to be symmetric, and thus only undirected graphs can be
implemented. In this thesis, we address the question, whether it is possible to
construct a continuous-time quantum walk on general directed graphs, preserving
its propagation properties. Secondly, the quantum spatial search defined
through CTQW has been proven to work well on various undirected graphs.
However, most of these graphs have very simple structures. The most advanced

to offer a lightweight application deployment. Container images are stored in
registry services and operated by orchestration platforms to download and start
the respective applications on nodes of the infrastructure. During large
application rollouts, the connection to the registry is prone to become a
bottleneck, which results in longer provisioning times and deployment
latencies. Previous work has mainly addressed this problem by proposing
scalable registries, leveraging the BitTorrent protocol or distributed storage
to host container images. However, for lightweight and dynamic edge
environments the overhead of several dedicated components is not feasible in
regard to its interference of the actual workload and is subject to failures
due to the introduced complexity.
  In this paper we introduce a fully decentralized container registry called
EdgePier, that can be deployed across edge sites and is able to decrease
container deployment times by utilizing peer-to-peer connections between
participating nodes. Image layers are shared without the need for further
centralized orchestration entities. The conducted evaluation shows that the
provisioning times are improved by up to 65% in comparison to a baseline
registry, even with limited bandwidth to the cloud.

semiconductor in the spin-valley polarized limit. In this configuration, the
carriers in the Fermi sea are indistinguishable from one of the two carriers
forming the exciton. Most notably, this indistinguishability requires the
three-body trion state to have p-wave symmetry. To explore the consequences of
this, we evaluate the system's optical properties within a polaron description,
which can interpolate from the low density limit -- where the relevant
excitations are few-body bound states -- to higher density many-body states. In
the parameter regime where the trion is bound, we demonstrate that the spectrum
is characterized by an attractive quasiparticle branch, a repulsive branch, and
a many-body continuum, and we evaluate the doping dependence of the
corresponding energies and spectral weights. In particular, at low doping we
find that the oscillator strength of the attractive branch scales with the
square of the Fermi energy as a result of the trion's p-wave symmetry. Upon
increasing density, we find that both the repulsive and attractive branches
blueshift, and that the orbital character of the states associated with these
branches interchanges. We compare our results with previous investigations of
the scenario where the Fermi sea involves carriers distinguishable from those

ensure good results, the utilized ML models need to be updated periodically to
adapt to seasonal changes and concept drifts in the sensor data. Although the
increasing resource availability at the edge can allow for in-situ execution of
model training directly on the devices, it is still often offloaded to fog
devices or the cloud.
  In this paper, we propose Local-Optimistic Scheduling (LOS), a method for
executing periodic ML model training jobs in close proximity to the data
sources, without overloading lightweight edge devices. Training jobs are
offloaded to nearby neighbor nodes as necessary and the resource consumption is
optimized to meet the training period while still ensuring enough resources for
further training executions. This scheduling is accomplished in a
decentralized, collaborative and opportunistic manner, without full knowledge
of the infrastructure and workload. We evaluated our method in an edge
computing testbed on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that
LOS places the training executions close to the input sensor streams, decreases
the deviation between training time and training period by up to 40% and
increases the amount of successfully scheduled training jobs compared to an
in-situ execution.

practice . Deep learning with Differential Privacy (DP) was implemented as a
practical learning algorithm at a manageable cost in complexity. However, DP is
vulnerable to aggressive Bayesian restoration attacks as disclosed in the
literature and demonstrated in experimental results of this work. To address
the aforementioned perplexity, we propose a novel Bayesian Privacy (BP)
framework which enables Bayesian restoration attacks to be formulated as the
probability of reconstructing private data from observed public information.
Specifically, the proposed BP framework accurately quantifies privacy loss by
Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between the prior distribution about the
privacy data and the posterior distribution of restoration private data
conditioning on exposed information}. To our best knowledge, this Bayesian
Privacy analysis is the first to provides theoretical justification of secure
privacy-preserving capabilities against Bayesian restoration attacks. As a
concrete use case, we demonstrate that a novel federated deep learning method
using private passport layers is able to simultaneously achieve high model

  new model for the classification of hemispheric dominance in healthy subjects
  and epileptic patients",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: to compare different methods to calculate Laterality Index (LI), a
metric which allows to evaluate hemispheric brain language dominance in
functional MRI examinations (fMRI).
  Methods: Two methods were considered for calculating LI: LI AVE and LI VOL ,
respectively based on the differences between measurements of average and
volume of fMRI signal in brain hemispheres. Laterality curves were obtained
calculating values of LI VOL with increasing thresholds of fMRI signal and
fitted with sigmoidal functions. A model for dominant and co-dominant
classification based on fit parameters has been developed. The two methods and
the sigmoidal model were applied to two cohorts of 93 epileptic patients and 27
healthy subjects undergoing language fMRI examinations with association,
understanding and fluency tasks.
  Results: Despite the different definitions, LI AVE and LI VOL resulted in
equivalent classification of language lateralization. The agreement of
neuroradiological clinical reports with classification of language
lateralization resulting from the proposed methods ranged from 94.6% to 89.2%
for LI metrics and up to 100% for the sigmoidal model. The fit parameters of
the sigmoidal function defined empirical thresholds useful for classification
between dominant and co-dominant, providing similar values for subjects and
epileptic patients for fluency and association tasks. This result supports the
idea of a unique model for language lateralization classification in epileptic
patients and healthy subjects.
  Conclusions: Language lateralization in fMRI can be effectively assessed by
objective metrics. A novel approach based on sigmoidal fit of laterality curves
resulted in higher agreement with clinical reports providing further
information about the strength of language lateralization.

perform exact beat segmentation, and to retain diagnostically important
morphological information. Methods: We therefore propose a model that is based
on Hermite and sigmoid functions combined with piecewise polynomial
interpolation for exact segmentation and low-dimensional representation of
individual ECG beat segments. Hermite and sigmoidal functions enable reliable
extraction of important ECG waveform information while the piecewise polynomial
interpolation captures noisy signal features like the BLW. For that we use
variable projection, which allows the separation of linear and nonlinear
morphological variations of the according ECG waveforms. The resulting ECG
model simultaneously performs BLW cancellation, beat segmentation, and
low-dimensional waveform representation. Results: We demonstrate its BLW
denoising and segmentation performance in two experiments, using synthetic and

distinctions of polysemy and homonymy. To this end, we introduce an extended,
human-annotated dataset of graded word sense similarity and co-predication
acceptability, and evaluate how well the similarity of embeddings predicts
similarity in meaning. Both types of human judgements indicate that the
similarity of polysemic interpretations falls in a continuum between identity
of meaning and homonymy. However, we also observe significant differences
within the similarity ratings of polysemes, forming consistent patterns for
different types of polysemic sense alternation. Our dataset thus appears to
capture a substantial part of the complexity of lexical ambiguity, and can
provide a realistic test bed for contextualised embeddings. Among the tested

sense similarity ratings, but struggles to consistently replicate the observed

problem. By continuously connecting the current system state with a safe
terminal set using a robust tube, safety can be ensured. Thereby, the main
sources of conservative safety interventions are model uncertainties and short
planning horizons. We develop an adaptive mechanism to improve the system
model, which leverages set-membership estimation to guarantee recursively
feasible and non-decreasing safety performance improvements. In order to
accommodate short prediction horizons, iterative safe set enlargements using
previously computed robust backup plans are proposed. Finally, we illustrate
the increase of the safety performance through the parameter and safe set
adaptation for numerical examples with up to 16 state dimensions.

correlated random variables modeled via Langevin dynamics for a particle in a
potential field. For potentials growing at infinity faster than linearly and
for long measurement times, we find that the EV distribution of the discretely
sampled process diverges from that of the full continuous dataset and converges
to that of independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from
the process's equilibrium measure. However, for processes with sublinear

significant attention recently. Herein, we consider the case where both the
response and covariates are functions. There are two available approaches for
addressing such a situation: concurrent and nonconcurrent functional models. In
the former, the value of the functional response at a given domain point
depends only on the value of the functional regressors evaluated at the same
domain point, whereas, in the latter, the functional covariates evaluated at
each point of their domain have a non-null effect on the response at any point
of its domain. To balance these two extremes, we propose a locally sparse
functional regression model in which the functional regression coefficient is
allowed (but not forced) to be exactly zero for a subset of its domain. This is
achieved using a suitable basis representation of the functional regression
coefficient and exploiting an overlapping group-Lasso penalty for its
estimation. We introduce efficient computational strategies based on
majorization-minimization algorithms and discuss appealing theoretical
properties regarding the model support and consistency of the proposed
estimator. We further illustrate the empirical performance of the method

``smart environments'' (e.g., smart cities and smart factories) will be, among
others, generators of huge amounts of data. Currently, this is typically
achieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However,
according to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from
the standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One
possibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to
where data is generated. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing and
analyzing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are
performed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where
data is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are
performed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by
(e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of
other nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them
accordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics
services. In the specific case analysed in the paper, we focus on a learning
task, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity
recognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we
compare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud
solution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show
that using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to
drastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance comparable
to the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The analysis also shows
when each distributed learning approach is preferable, based on the specific
distribution of the data on the nodes.

perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis of both stellar components. The
primary and secondary components are classified as O4.5~IV(f) and O9.7~V,
respectively. From a radial-velocity (RV) study we derived a set of orbital
parameters for the system. We found an eccentric orbit ($e=0.14 \pm 0.01$) with
a period of $P = 5.87820 \pm 0.00008$~days. Through the simultaneous analysis
of the RVs and the $V$-band light curve we derived an orbital inclination of
$70.0^{\circ} \pm 2.0$ and stellar masses of
$M_a=33.6^{+1.4}_{-1.2}~\text{M}_{\sun}$ for the primary, and
$M_b=17.7^{+0.5}_{-0.7}~\text{M}_{\sun}$ for the secondary. The components show
projected rotational velocities $v_1\sin{i}=105 \pm 14~\text{km~s}^{-1}$ and
$v_2\sin{i}=82 \pm 15~\text{km~s}^{-1}$, respectively. A tidal evolution
analysis is also performed and found to be in agreement with the orbital
characteristics. Finally, the available X-ray observations show no evidence of
a colliding winds region, therefore the X-ray emission is attributed to stellar
winds.

establish its optimal minimax mixing time under a warm start. Our main
contribution is two-fold. First, for a $d$-dimensional log-concave density with
condition number $\kappa$, we show that MALA with a warm start mixes in $\tilde
O(\kappa \sqrt{d})$ iterations up to logarithmic factors. This improves upon
the previous work on the dependency of either the condition number $\kappa$ or
the dimension $d$. Our proof relies on comparing the leapfrog integrator with
the continuous Hamiltonian dynamics, where we establish a new concentration
bound for the acceptance rate. Second, we prove a spectral gap based mixing
time lower bound for reversible MCMC algorithms on general state spaces. We
apply this lower bound result to construct a hard distribution for which MALA
requires at least $\tilde \Omega (\kappa \sqrt{d})$ steps to mix. The lower
bound for MALA matches our upper bound in terms of condition number and
dimension. Finally, numerical experiments are included to validate our
theoretical results.

introduced in this study to customize the wireless channel. Utilizing the RIS

Predominantly, two formulations are used for sentence-pair tasks: bi-encoders

representations and are computationally efficient, however, they usually
underperform cross-encoders. Cross-encoders can leverage their attention heads
to exploit inter-sentence interactions for better performance but they require
task fine-tuning and are computationally more expensive. In this paper, we
present a completely unsupervised sentence representation model termed as
Trans-Encoder that combines the two learning paradigms into an iterative joint
framework to simultaneously learn enhanced bi- and cross-encoders.
Specifically, on top of a pre-trained Language Model (PLM), we start with
converting it to an unsupervised bi-encoder, and then alternate between the bi-

will produce pseudo-labels which are used as learning signals for the other

discrete optimization problem of the adjacency matrix can be solved in the
context of graph clustering. In particular, we propose to measure the

is related to how the victim nodes will be affected by the injected fake node,
and to cluster the victim nodes accordingly. Our attack is performed in a

considers the problem of estimating K angle of arrivals (AoA), i.e., the direct
path's AoA and the AoA of subsequent echoes. Significant progress has been made
on this problem, however, solutions remain elusive when the source signal is
unknown (such as human voice) and the channel is strongly correlated (such as
in multipath settings). Today's algorithms reliably estimate the
direct-path-AoA, but the subsequent AoAs diverge in noisy real-world
conditions.
  We design SubAoA, an algorithm that improves on the current body of work. Our
core idea models signal in a new AoA sub-space, and employs a cancellation
approach that successively cancels each AoA to decode the next. We explain the
behavior and complexity of the algorithm from the first principles, simulate
the performance across a range of parameters, and present results from
real-world experiments. Comparison against multiple existing algorithms like
GCC-PHAT, MUSIC, and VoLoc shows increasing gains for the latter AoAs, while
our computation complexity allows real-time operation. We believe progress in
multi-AoA estimation is a fundamental building block to various acoustic and RF
applications, including human or vehicle localization, multi-user separation,

simulation through the development of efficient and accurate models of
interatomic interactions. In particular, neural network models can describe
interactions at the level of accuracy of quantum mechanics-based calculations,
but with a fraction of the cost, enabling the simulation of large systems over
long timescales with ab initio accuracy. However, implicit in the construction
of neural network potentials is an assumption of locality, wherein atomic
arrangements on the scale of about a nanometer are used to learn interatomic
interactions. Because of this assumption, the resulting neural network models
cannot describe long-range interactions that play critical roles in dielectric
screening and chemical reactivity. To address this issue, we introduce the
self-consistent field neural network (SCFNN) model -- a general approach for
learning the long-range response of molecular systems in neural network
potentials. The SCFNN model relies on a physically meaningful separation of the
interatomic interactions into short- and long-range components, with a separate
network to handle each component. We demonstrate the success of the SCFNN
approach in modeling the dielectric properties of bulk liquid water, and show
that the SCFNN model accurately predicts long-range polarization correlations
and the response of water to applied electrostatic fields. Importantly, because
of the separation of interactions inherent in our approach, the SCFNN model can
be combined with many existing approaches for building neural network
potentials. Therefore, we expect the SCFNN model to facilitate the proper
description of long-range interactions in a wide-variety of machine
learning-based force fields.

fluid simulations used for Hall effect thrusters and streamer discharges, since
the Poisson solution appears as a source term of the unsteady nonlinear flow
equations. As a first step, solving the 2D Poisson equation with zero Dirichlet
boundary conditions using a deep neural network is investigated using
multiple-scale architectures, defined in terms of number of branches, depth and
receptive field. One key objective is to better understand how neural networks
learn the Poisson solutions and provide guidelines to achieve optimal network
configurations, especially when coupled to the time-varying Euler equations
with plasma source terms. Here, the Receptive Field is found critical to
correctly capture large topological structures of the field. The investigation
of multiple architectures, losses, and hyperparameters provides an optimal
network to solve accurately the steady Poisson problem. The performance of the
optimal neural network solver, called PlasmaNet, is then monitored on meshes
with increasing number of nodes, and compared with classical parallel linear
solvers. Next, PlasmaNet is coupled with an unsteady Euler plasma fluid
equations solver in the context of the electron plasma oscillation test case.
In this time-evolving problem, a physical loss is necessary to produce a stable
simulation. PlasmaNet is finally tested on a more complex case of discharge
propagation involving chemistry and advection. The guidelines established in
previous sections are applied to build the CNN to solve the same Poisson
equation in cylindrical coordinates with different boundary conditions. Results
reveal good CNN predictions and pave the way to new computational strategies
using modern GPU-based hardware to predict unsteady problems involving a
Poisson equation.

  In press",,"10.1145/3538705",,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A major challenge for autonomous vehicles is interacting with other traffic
participants safely and smoothly. A promising approach to handle such traffic
interactions is equipping autonomous vehicles with interaction-aware
controllers (IACs). These controllers predict how surrounding human drivers
will respond to the autonomous vehicle's actions, based on a driver model.
However, the predictive validity of driver models used in IACs is rarely
validated, which can limit the interactive capabilities of IACs outside the
simple simulated environments in which they are demonstrated. In this paper, we
argue that besides evaluating the interactive capabilities of IACs, their
underlying driver models should be validated on natural human driving behavior.
We propose a workflow for this validation that includes scenario-based data
extraction and a two-stage (tactical/operational) evaluation procedure based on
human factors literature. We demonstrate this workflow in a case study on an
inverse-reinforcement-learning-based driver model replicated from an existing
IAC. This model only showed the correct tactical behavior in 40% of the
predictions. The model's operational behavior was inconsistent with observed
human behavior. The case study illustrates that a principled evaluation
workflow is useful and needed. We believe that our workflow will support the
development of appropriate driver models for future automated vehicles.

any physical property (except when exactly QS), optimisation should employ
additional physical metrics for guidance. Especially close to QS minima,
treating QS metrics through inequality constraints so that additional physics

a square-well attraction only between small monomers and spheres. Recently, we
have characterized the low-temperature regime of this mixture by Monte Carlo,
reporting on the spontaneous formation of a wide spectrum of supramolecular
aggregates [Prestipino et al, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2019, 123, 9272]. Here we focus
on a regime of temperatures where, on cooling, the appearance of local
inhomogeneties first, and the early stages of aggregation thereafter, are
observed. In particular, we find signatures of aggregation in the onset of a
low-wavevector peak in the structure factors of the mixture, as computed by
both theory and simulation. Then, we link the structural information to the
microscopic arrangement through a detailed cluster analysis of Monte Carlo
configurations. In this regard, we devise a novel method to compute the maximum
distance for which two spheres can be regarded as bonded together, a crucial
issue in the proper identification of fluid aggregates. The RISM theory
provides relatively accurate structural and thermodynamic predictions in

the efficacy of the RISM approach as a useful complement to numerical

  More",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Until recently, the potential to transfer evolved skills across distinct
optimization problem instances (or tasks) was seldom explored in evolutionary
computation. The concept of evolutionary multitasking (EMT) fills this gap. It
unlocks a population's implicit parallelism to jointly solve a set of tasks,
hence creating avenues for skills transfer between them. Despite it being early
days, the idea of EMT has begun to show promise in a range of real-world
applications. In the backdrop of recent advances, the contribution of this
paper is twofold. First, a review of several application-oriented explorations
of EMT in the literature is presented; the works are assimilated into half a
dozen broad categories according to their respective application domains. Each
of these six categories elaborates fundamental motivations to multitask, and
contains a representative experimental study (referred from the literature).
Second, a set of recipes is provided showing how problem formulations of
general interest, those that cut across different disciplines, could be
transformed in the new light of EMT. Our discussions emphasize the many
practical use-cases of EMT, and is intended to spark future research towards
crafting novel algorithms for real-world deployment.

to be made less explicit, for instance using shorter, less informative words.
Studying these dynamics in the domain of referring expressions has proven
difficult, with existing studies, both psycholinguistic and corpus-based,
providing contradictory results. We test the hypothesis that speakers produce
less informative referring expressions (e.g., pronouns vs. full noun phrases)
when the context is more informative about the referent, using novel
computational estimates of referent predictability. We obtain these estimates
training an existing coreference resolution system for English on a new task,
masked coreference resolution, giving us a probability distribution over
referents that is conditioned on the context but not the referring expression.
The resulting system retains standard coreference resolution performance while
yielding a better estimate of human-derived referent predictability than
previous attempts. A statistical analysis of the relationship between model
output and mention form supports the hypothesis that predictability affects the
form of a mention, both its morphosyntactic type and its length.

will be located at well-defined positions, derived from localized molecular
orbitals or Wannier centers, naturally imposing the correct dielectric and

can predict dipole moments, polarizabilities and IR-spectra of unseen molecules

echogenicity. Unfortunately, an ultrasound image is a low-quality version of
the expected Tissue Reflectivity Function (TRF) mainly due to the non-ideal
Point Spread Function (PSF) of the imaging system. This paper presents a novel
beamforming approach based on deep learning to get closer to the ideal PSF in
Plane-Wave Imaging (PWI). The proposed approach is designed to reconstruct the
desired TRF from echo traces acquired by transducer elements using only a
single plane-wave transmission. In this approach, first, an ideal model for the
TRF is introduced by setting the imaging PSF as a sharp Gaussian function.
Then, a mapping function between the pre-beamformed Radio-Frequency (RF)
channel data and the proposed TRF is constructed using deep learning. Network
architecture contains multi-resolution decomposition and reconstruction using
wavelet transform for effective recovery of high-frequency content of the
desired TRF. Inspired by curriculum learning, we exploit step by step training
from coarse (mean square error) to fine ($\ell_{0.2}$) loss functions. The
proposed method is trained on a large number of simulation ultrasound data with
the ground-truth echogenicity map extracted from real photographic images. The
performance of the trained network is evaluated on the publicly available
simulation and \textit{in vivo} test data without any further fine-tuning.
Simulation test results confirm that the proposed method reconstructs images
with a high quality in terms of resolution and contrast, which are also
visually similar to the proposed ground-truth image. Furthermore, \textit{in
vivo} results show that the trained mapping function preserves its performance
in the new domain. Therefore, the proposed approach maintains high resolution,
contrast, and framerate simultaneously.

We discuss the problem of choosing the initial weights from the perspective of
three goals. We want to start in a region of weight space a) with low loss
value, b) that is favourable for second-order optimization, and c) where the
conjugate-gradient (CG) calculations can be performed quickly. For margin
losses, such an initialization is achieved by selecting the initial vector such
that it separates the mean of all positive (relevant for a label) instances
from the mean of all negatives -- two quantities that can be calculated quickly
for the highly imbalanced binary problems occurring in XMC. We demonstrate a
speedup of $\approx 3\times$ for training with squared hinge loss on a variety
of XMC datasets. This comes in part from the reduced number of iterations that
need to be performed due to starting closer to the solution, and in part from
an implicit negative mining effect that allows to ignore easy negatives in the
CG step. Because of the convex nature of the optimization problem, the speedup
is achieved without any degradation in classification accuracy.

effect of a binary exposure on an outcome. Extensions to continuous exposures,
however, either quantify the effects of interventions that are rarely relevant
(e.g., applying the same exposure level uniformly in the population), or
consider shift interventions that are rarely intended, raising the question how
large a shift to consider. Average derivative effects (ADEs) instead express
the effect of an infinitesimal shift in each subject's exposure level, making
inference less prone to extrapolation. ADEs, however, are rarely considered in
practice because their estimation usually requires estimation of (a) the
conditional density of exposure given covariates, and (b) the derivative of (a)
w.r.t. exposure. Here, we introduce a class of estimands which can be inferred

exposure obeys a specific distribution determined by the choice of estimand in

emerge from the interaction of the random walker at time $t$ with the territory
that it has visited at earlier times $t'<t$. This class of non Markovian random
walks has applications in a broad range of examples, ranging from insects to
living cells, where a random walker modifies locally its environment -- leaving
behind footprints along its path, and in turn responds to its own footprints.
Because of their inherent non Markovian nature, the exploration properties of
self-interacting random walks have remained elusive. Here we show that long
range memory effects can have deep consequences on the dynamics of generic
self-interacting random walks ; they can induce aging and non trivial
persistence and transience exponents, which we determine quantitatively, in
both infinite and confined geometries. Based on this analysis, we quantify the
search kinetics of self-interacting random walkers and show that the
distribution of the first-passage time (FPT) to a target site in a confined
domain takes universal scaling forms in the large domain size limit, which we
characterize quantitatively. We argue that memory abilities induced by
attractive self-interactions provide a decisive advantage for local space
exploration, while repulsive self-interactions can significantly accelerate the
global exploration of large domains.

weak. Finally, we come up with a proposal, where the degree of spin
polarization can be enhanced significantly in the presence of a time-periodic

unpolarized source in a fractal network is completely new to the best of our

precise dependencies of driving field parameters, spin-dependent scattering

nodes that give well-conditioned and quickly converging interpolatory
quadrature rules at the same time. Therefore, we go beyond classical
interpolatory quadrature by lowering the degree of the polynomial approximant
and by applying auxiliary mapping functions that map the original quadrature
nodes to more suitable fake nodes. More precisely, we investigate the
combination of the Kosloff Tal-Ezer map and least-squares approximation (KTL)
for numerical quadrature: a careful selection of the mapping parameter ensures
stability of the scheme, a high accuracy of the approximation and, at the same
time, an asymptotically optimal ratio between the degree of the polynomial and
the spacing of the grid. We will investigate the properties of this KTL
quadrature and focus on the symmetry of the quadrature weights, the limit
relations for the mapping parameter, as well as the computation of the
quadrature weights in the standard monomial and in the Chebyshev bases with
help of a cosine transform. Numerical tests on equispaced nodes show that a
static choice of the map's parameter improve the results of the composite
trapezoidal rule, while a dynamic approach achieves larger stability and faster
convergence, even when the sampling nodes are perturbed. From a computational

converts to transferring directory entries (dentrys), which causes concretely

of subducting plates and have substantial relation with adjacent megathrust
fault motion. Conventional techniques of quantifying slow earthquake frictional
features show that these features may be indicative of predictive seismic
motion; however, quantifying high-accuracy uncertainty of the frictional fields
has not yet been achieved. We therefore propose a method of uncertainty
quantification for spatially inhomogeneous frictional features from slip motion
on an LSSE fault--megathrust fault complex in southwestern Japan. By combining
a fault motion model that mimics slow-slip motion and a variational data
assimilation (DA) technique using a second-order adjoint method, we have
succeeded in quantifying the spatial distribution of the uncertainty of the
frictional features. Further, evaluation of the spatial distribution in
high-resolution reveals the correlation between the dynamics of the slow-slip
motion and the important components of the frictional features, which is
valuable information for observational DA design. Findings from this study are
expected to advance the theoretical foundation of applied seismic motion
prediction techniques using slow-slip frictional features as stress meters for

powerful tool for modeling complex systems with many advantages, e.g., the
ability to handle uncertainty and possessing good interpretability. Considering
the success of these two aforementioned research areas, it seems natural to
apply PGMs to transfer learning. However, although there are already some
excellent PGMs specific to transfer learning in the literature, the potential
of PGMs for this problem is still grossly underestimated. This paper aims to
boost the development of PGMs for transfer learning by 1) examining the pilot
studies on PGMs specific to transfer learning, i.e., analyzing and summarizing
the existing mechanisms particularly designed for knowledge transfer; 2)
discussing examples of real-world transfer problems where existing PGMs have

  Reconstructions","20 pages, 8 figures, Undergraduate Thesis",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Deep Learning models possess two key traits that, in combination, make their
use in the real world a risky prospect. One, they do not typically generalize
well outside of the distribution for which they were trained, and two, they
tend to exhibit confident behavior regardless of whether or not they are
producing meaningful outputs. While Deep Learning possesses immense power to
solve realistic, high-dimensional problems, these traits in concert make it
difficult to have confidence in their real-world applications. To overcome this
difficulty, the task of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) Detection has been defined,
to determine when a model has received an input from outside of the
distribution for which it is trained to operate.
  This paper introduces and examines a novel methodology, DOODLER, for OOD
Detection, which directly leverages the traits which result in its necessity.
By training a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) on the same data as another Deep
Learning model, the VAE learns to accurately reconstruct In-Distribution (ID)
inputs, but not to reconstruct OOD inputs, meaning that its failure state can
be used to perform OOD Detection. Unlike other work in the area, DOODLER
requires only very weak assumptions about the existence of an OOD dataset,
allowing for more realistic application. DOODLER also enables pixel-wise
segmentations of input images by OOD likelihood, and experimental results show
that it matches or outperforms methodologies that operate under the same
constraints.

phases may exist at the highest densities in the inner crust, potentially
having an impact on different neutron-star phenomena. We study the properties
of the pasta phase and the uncertainties in the pasta observables which are due
to our incomplete knowledge of the nuclear energy functional. To this aim, we
employed a compressible liquid-drop model approach with surface parameters
optimised either on experimental nuclear masses or theoretical calculations. To
assess the model uncertainties, we performed a Bayesian analysis by largely
varying the model parameters using uniform priors, and generating posterior
distributions with filters accounting for both our present low-density nuclear
physics knowledge and high-density neutron-star physics constraints. Our
results show that the nuclear physics constraints, such as the neutron-matter
equation of state at very low density and the experimental mass measurements,
are crucial in determining the crustal and pasta observables. Accounting for
all constraints, we demonstrate that the presence of pasta phases is robustly
predicted in an important fraction of the inner crust. We estimate the relative
crustal thickness associated with pasta phases as $R_{\rm pasta}/R_{\rm
crust}=0.128\pm 0.047$ and the relative moment of inertia as $I_{\rm
pasta}/I_{\rm crust}=0.480\pm 0.137$. Our findings indicate that the surface
and curvature parameters are more influential than the bulk parameters for the
description of pasta observables. We also show that using a surface tension
that is inconsistent with the bulk functional leads to an underestimation of
both the average values and the uncertainties in the pasta properties, thus
highlighting the importance of a consistent calculation of the nuclear
functional.

work in the phase space formalism, specifically at the covariance matrix level,

the heterodyne measurement outperforms the homodyne measurement in the mean
estimation of squeezed state ensemble, the homodyne measurement outperforms the
heterodyne measurement for variance estimation of squeezed state ensemble up to
a certain range of squeezing parameter. We then modify the Hamiltonian in the

that the optimal performance is achieved when the meters are uncorrelated. We

well-studied variant of the traditional binary knapsack problem; key changes
being the relaxation of the binary constraint and allowing the unit weights of
each item to fall within a range. In this paper, we formulate a variant of this
problem, which we call the strict unbounded knapsack problem with bounded
weights, by replacing the inequality constraint on the total weight with an
equality. We show that this problem can be decomposed into a two-stage,
pre-emptive goal programming problem, with the first stage being a
2-dimensional knapsack problem and the second being either a linear feasibility
program (per canonical formulation) or simply a linearly-constrained program in
the general case. This reformulation is shown to be equivalent to the original
formulation but allows the use of well-studied, efficient algorithms for
multidimensional knapsack problems. In addition, it separates the modeling
effort around what to put in the knapsack from considerations around what unit
weight one should assign to each item type, providing substantially more
flexibility to the modeler without adding complexity to the choice of knapsack
configuration. Finally, we show that for the feasibility version of the second
stage, one can immediately get a feasible solution to the first stage solution.

two PbWO$_{4}$ test crystals of ${1 \over N}{dN \over dx}<0.5 \times 10^{-6}$

for $G$ measurements. We discuss the implications of this result and of other

(POTS) patients have abnormal low frequency $\approx 0.1$ Hz blood pressure and
heart rate dynamics. These dynamics are attributed to the baroreflex and can
give insight into the mechanistic causes which are the basis for proposed
subgroups of POTS. In this study we develop a baroreflex model replicating the
low-frequency dynamics observed in POTS patient data as well as represent
subgroups of POTS in our model. We utilize signal processing to quantify the
effects that model parameters have on low-frequency oscillations. Results show
that key physiological parameters that represent the hypothesized causes are
central to our model's ability to reproduce observed dynamics from patient

present a Bayesian hierarchical model to infer the main features that explain
score differences in rugby matches of the English Premiership Rugby 2020/2021

the number of tries and the scoring kick attempts) is highly relevant to
explain outcomes in those matches.

systems have achieved great success due to their simplicity and promising
performance. Neural Transducer based models are increasingly popular in
streaming E2E based ASR systems and have been reported to outperform the
traditional hybrid system in some scenarios. However, the joint optimization of
acoustic model, lexicon and language model in neural Transducer also brings
about challenges to utilize pure text for language model adaptation. This
drawback might prevent their potential applications in practice. In order to
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel model, factorized neural
Transducer, by factorizing the blank and vocabulary prediction, and adopting a
standalone language model for the vocabulary prediction. It is expected that
this factorization can transfer the improvement of the standalone language
model to the Transducer for speech recognition, which allows various language
model adaptation techniques to be applied. We demonstrate that the proposed
factorized neural Transducer yields 15% to 20% WER improvements when
out-of-domain text data is used for language model adaptation, at the cost of a
minor degradation in WER on a general test set.

  Graphs","12 pages; 6 figures",,,,"cs.SI cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Representation learning on temporal interaction graphs (TIG) is to model
complex networks with the dynamic evolution of interactions arising in a broad
spectrum of problems. Existing dynamic embedding methods on TIG discretely
update node embeddings merely when an interaction occurs. They fail to capture
the continuous dynamic evolution of embedding trajectories of nodes. In this
paper, we propose a two-module framework named ConTIG, a continuous
representation method that captures the continuous dynamic evolution of node
embedding trajectories. With two essential modules, our model exploit
three-fold factors in dynamic networks which include latest interaction,
neighbor features and inherent characteristics. In the first update module, we
employ a continuous inference block to learn the nodes' state trajectories by
learning from time-adjacent interaction patterns between node pairs using
ordinary differential equations. In the second transform module, we introduce a
self-attention mechanism to predict future node embeddings by aggregating
historical temporal interaction information. Experiments results demonstrate
the superiority of ConTIG on temporal link prediction, temporal node
recommendation and dynamic node classification tasks compared with a range of
state-of-the-art baselines, especially for long-interval interactions
prediction.

  Aftershocks or hidden nuclear tests?","48 pages",,,,"physics.geo-ph physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The multi-master method based on waveform cross-correlation has found several
aftershocks of the third (DPRK3) and the fourth (DPRK4) announced underground
nuclear tests conducted by the DPRK on 12.02.2013, and 06.01.2016,
respectively. The second DPRK test had no reliable aftershock hypotheses at the
level of the method sensitivity and resolution. The closest to the test site
array station USRK was not operational before 20.12.2008 and the first DPRK
test cannot be analyzed by the multi-master method based on waveform templates
from two IMS stations - USRK and KSRS. The largest aftershocks of the DPRK3 and
DPRK4 are close in magnitude to the first aftershock of the DPRK5 on
11.09.2016, and many aftershocks of the DPRK6. Three big aftershocks of the
DPRK3 occurred on 25.05.2014, i.e. 467 days after the mainshock. The DPRK3
aftershock found at 6:43:03 UTC had a relative magnitude of 2.91. There were
found two aftershocks of the DPRK4: on 19.02.2016 (0:28:07 UTC) and on
02.07.2016 (19:52:27 UTC). The largest aftershocks of the DPRK3 and DPRK4 could
be interpreted as related to the cavity collapse process likely followed by a
chimney collapse, not reaching the free surface, however, as no noble gases
and/or radionuclide particles were detected. Seismic signals from all events
found before the DPRK5 (09.09.2016), had a high level of cross-correlation with
the waveform templates of the DRPK5 and DPRK6. These signals prove the shape
similarity, and thus, the close spatial proximity of the seismic events after
DPRK3/DPRK4 to the DPRK5/DPRK6 aftershocks. There were no other events found by
the multi-master method since 01.01.2009, even when the highest resolution
regime was used. The resolution and sensitivity of the multi-master method were
tuned and tested using the data after 09.09.2016.

of load cycles before materials break, as a function of the maximal stress in
each cycle. Although such plots are prevalent in engineering for more than 150
years, their theoretical understanding is lacking. Recently a scaling theory of
W\""ohler plots in the context of cyclic bending was offered [1]. Here we
elaborate further on cyclic bending and extend the considerations to cyclic
tensile loads on an amorphous strip of material; the scaling theory applies to
both types of cyclic loading equally well. On the basis of atomistic
simulations we conclude that the crucial quantities to focus on are the
accumulated damage and the average damage per cycle. The dependence of these
quantities on the loading determines the statistics of the number of cycles to
failure. Finally we consider the probability distribution functions of the
number of cycles to failure and demonstrate that the scaling theory allows
prediction of these distributions at one value of the forcing amplitude from
measurements and another value.
