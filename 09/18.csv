network accelerator, which affords efficient in-memory computing and high
bandwidth interconnectivity. The inherent optoelectronic noises, however, make
the photonic systems error-prone in practice. It is thus imperative to devise
strategies to mitigate and, if possible, harness noises in photonic computing
systems. Here, we demonstrate a photonic generative network as a part of a
generative adversarial network (GAN). This network is implemented with a
photonic core consisting of an array of four programable phase-change memory
cells to perform 4-elements vector-vector dot multiplication. We demonstrate
that the GAN can generate a handwritten number (""7"") in experiments and full
ten digits in simulation. We realize an optical random number generator derived
from the amplified spontaneous emission noise, apply noise-aware training by
injecting additional noise and demonstrate the network's resilience to hardware
non-idealities. Our results suggest the resilience and potential of more
complex photonic generative networks based on large-scale, realistic photonic
hardware.

core bosons and non-interacting fermions. However, at the field theory level,
no exact duality connecting strongly interacting bosons to weakly interacting
fermions is known. Here we propose a solution to this long standing problem.
Our derivation relies on regularizing the only point-like interaction between
fermions in 1D that induces a discontinuity in the wave function proportional
to its derivative. In contrast to all known regularisations our potential is
weak for small interaction strengths. Crucially, this allows one to apply
standard methods of diagrammatic perturbation theory to strongly interacting
bosons. As a first application we compute the finite temperature spectral
function of the Cheon-Shigehara model, the fermionic model dual to the
celebrated Lieb-Liniger model.

traditionally formulated as a regression task, and the performance of QE models
is typically measured by Pearson correlation with human labels. Recent QE
models have achieved previously-unseen levels of correlation with human

that are computationally expensive and make them infeasible for real-world
applications. In this work, we evaluate several model compression techniques
for QE and find that, despite their popularity in other NLP tasks, they lead to
poor performance in this regression setting. We observe that a full model
parameterization is required to achieve SoTA results in a regression task.
However, we argue that the level of expressiveness of a model in a continuous
range is unnecessary given the downstream applications of QE, and show that
reframing QE as a classification problem and evaluating QE models using
classification metrics would better reflect their actual performance in
real-world applications.

transformations of quadratic form expansions. This is a representation of a
quantum state which specifies a formula for the expansion in the standard

polynomial over the integers. We show how, with deft management of the
quadratic form expansion representation, we may simulate individual stabiliser
operations in $O(n^2)$ time matching the overall complexity of other simulation
techniques [arXiv:quant-ph/0406196, arXiv:quant-ph/0504117, arXiv:1808.00128].
Our techniques provide economies of scale in the time to simulate simultaneous
measurements of all (or nearly all) qubits in the standard basis. Our
techniques also allow single-qubit measurements with deterministic outcomes to
be simulated in constant time. We also describe throughout how these bounds may
be tightened when the expansion of the state in the standard basis has
relatively few terms (has low 'rank'), or can be specified by sparse matrices.
Specifically, this allows us to simulate a 'local' stabiliser syndrome

matching what is possible using techniques developed by Gidney

for bug finding in the software industry. In general, fuzzing provides various
inputs to the target program to discover unhandled exceptions and crashes. In
business sectors where the time budget is limited, software vendors often
launch many fuzzing instances in parallel as common means of increasing code
coverage. However, most of the popular fuzzing tools in their parallel
mode-naively run multiple instances concurrently, without elaborate
distribution of workload. This can lead different instances to explore
overlapped code regions, eventually reducing the benefits of concurrency. In
this paper, we propose a general model to describe parallel fuzzing. This model
distributes mutually-exclusive but similarly-weighted tasks to different
instances, facilitating concurrency and also fairness across instances.
Following this model, we develop a solution, called AFL-EDGE, to improve the
parallel mode of AFL, considering a round of mutations to a unique seed as a
task and adopting edge coverage to define the uniqueness of a seed. We have
implemented AFL-EDGE on top of AFL and evaluated the implementation with AFL on
9 widely used benchmark programs. It shows that AFL-EDGE can benefit the edge
coverage of AFL. In a 24-hour test, the increase of edge coverage brought by
AFL-EDGE to AFL ranges from 9.49% to 10.20%, depending on the number of
instances. As a side benefit, we discovered 14 previously unknown bugs.

particularly in dim lighting conditions. A theory explaining how photon and
electron noise affect DVS output events has so far not been developed.
Moreover, there is no clear understanding of how DVS parameters and operating
conditions affect noise. There is an apparent paradox between the real noise
data observed from the DVS output and the reported noise measurements of the
logarithmic photoreceptor. While measurements of the logarithmic photoreceptor
predict that the photoreceptor is approximately a first-order system with RMS
noise voltage independent of the photocurrent, DVS output shows higher noise
event rates at low light intensity. This paper unravels this paradox by showing
how the DVS photoreceptor is a second-order system, and the assumption that it
is first-order is generally not reasonable. As we show, at higher
photocurrents, the photoreceptor amplifier dominates the frequency response,
causing a drop in RMS noise voltage and noise event rate. We bring light to the
noise performance of the DVS photoreceptor by presenting a theoretical
explanation supported by both transistor-level simulation results and chip

Representation Learning (SRL) is proposed to specifically learn to encode

However, the pervasive implementation of SRL is usually conducted by a
decoupling strategy in which the observation-state mapping is learned
separately, which is prone to over-fit. To handle such problem, we present a
new algorithm called Policy Optimization via Abstract Representation which
integrates SRL into the original RL scale. Firstly, We engage RL loss to assist
in updating SRL model so that the states can evolve to meet the demand of
reinforcement learning and maintain a good physical interpretation. Secondly,
we introduce a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism so that both models can
efficiently adapt to each other. Thirdly, we introduce a new prior called
domain resemblance to leverage expert demonstration to train the SRL model.
Finally, we provide a real-time access by state graph to monitor the course of
learning. Results show that our algorithm outperforms the PPO baselines and
decoupling strategies in terms of sample efficiency and final rewards. Thus our

set of strategic agents with additive valuation functions. We assume no
monetary transfers and, therefore, a mechanism in our setting is an algorithm
that takes as input the reported -- rather than the true -- values of the
agents. Our main goal is to explore whether there exist mechanisms that have
pure Nash equilibria for every instance and, at the same time, provide fairness
guarantees for the allocations that correspond to these equilibria. We focus on
two relaxations of envy-freeness, namely envy-freeness up to one good (EF1),
and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX), and we positively answer the above
question. In particular, we study two algorithms that are known to produce such
allocations in the non-strategic setting: Round-Robin (EF1 allocations for any
number of agents) and a cut-and-choose algorithm of Plaut and Roughgarden [SIAM
Journal of Discrete Mathematics, 2020] (EFX allocations for two agents). For
Round-Robin we show that all of its pure Nash equilibria induce allocations
that are EF1 with respect to the underlying true values, while for the
algorithm of Plaut and Roughgarden we show that the corresponding allocations
not only are EFX but also satisfy maximin share fairness, something that is not
true for this algorithm in the non-strategic setting! Further, we show that a
weaker version of the latter result holds for any mechanism for two agents that
always has pure Nash equilibria which all induce EFX allocations.

not removed. We then discuss basic features of loop quantum cosmology. For the
isotropic Universe, we compare the original $\mu_0$ scheme and the most
commonly accepted formulation, the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme. Some results concerning
the Bianchi Universes are also discussed. Finally, we consider some relevant
criticisms on the real link between full loop quantum gravity and its
minisuperspace implementation. In the second part of the review we consider the
isotropic Universe and the Bianchi models in the framework of polymer quantum
mechanics. We first address the polymerization in terms of the
Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connection and show how the resulting dynamics is
isomorphic to the $\mu_0$. Then we analyze the polymerization of volume-like
variables, and we see the resulting dynamics is isomorphic to the $\bar{\mu}$
scheme with a fixed critical energy density. Finally, we consider the polymer
quantum dynamics of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Mixmaster model through a
metric approach. We compare the results obtained by using the volume variable
to the standard Misner variable. In the latter case we find a cosmology that is
still singular, and its chaotic properties depend on the ratio between the
lattice steps for the isotropic and anisotropic variables. We conclude the
review with some considerations on changing variables in the polymer
representation. In particular we consider how the dynamics can be mapped in two
different sets of variables (at the price of using a coordinate-dependent
lattice step), and we infer some possible implications on the equivalence of
the $\mu_0$ and $\bar{\mu}$ scheme of loop quantum cosmology.

general, asymmetry and nonlinearity interweave with each other. To explore the
effects of asymmetry and nonlinearity on thermalization separately, we here
introduce an asymmetric harmonic (AH) model, whose IIP has the only asymmetry
but no nonlinearity in the sense that the frequency of a system is independent
of input energy. Through extensive numerical simulations, a power-law
relationship between the thermalization time $T_{\rm eq}$ and the perturbation
strength (here the degree of asymmetry) is still confirmed, yet a larger
exponent is observed instead of the previously found inverse square law in the
thermodynamic limit. Then the quartic (symmetric) nonlinearity is added into
the AH model, and the thermalization behavior under the coexistence of
asymmetry and nonlinearity is systematically studied. It is found that
Matthiessen's rule gives a better estimation of the $T_{\rm eq}$ of the system.

properties of relaxation of a system.

  We consider the relation between topologies induced by a number of metrics
over a number of limited categories of open bounded regions in n-dimensional
Euclidean space. Specifically, we consider a homeomorphism-based metric; the
Hausdorff metric; the dual-Hausdorff metric; the symmetric difference metric;

  Over the space of convex regions, all five metrics, and indeed any metric
that satisfies two general well-behavedness constraints, induce the same
topology.
  Over the space of convex regions and unions of two separated convex regions,
these five metrics are all ordered by ""strictly finer than"" relations. In
descending order of fineness, these are: the homeomorphism-based, the
dual-Hausdorff, the Hausdorff, the Wasserstein, and the symmetric difference.
Also, Wasserstein metrics are strictly ordered among themselves.

a toric variety along hypersurfaces in its toric boundary, and $D$ is the
strict transform of the toric boundary. The main ingredient is ``the heart of
the canonical wall structure'' associated to such pairs $(X,D)$, which is
constructed purely combinatorially, following our previous work with Mark
Gross. In the case when we blow up a single hypersurface we show that our
results agree with previous results computed symplectically by
Aroux--Abouzaid--Katzarkov. In the situation when the locus of blow-up is
formed by more than a single hypersurface, due to infinitely many walls
interacting, writing the equations becomes significantly more challenging. We
provide the first examples of explicit equations for mirror families in such
situations.

ensuring efficient use of wireless bandwidth. At each iteration, each robot
approximately optimizes an augmented Lagrangian function, then communicates the
resulting weights to its neighbors, updates dual variables, and repeats.
Eventually, all robots' local network weights reach a consensus. For convex
objective functions, we prove this consensus is a global optimum. We compare
our algorithm to two existing distributed deep neural network training
algorithms in (i) an MNIST image classification task, (ii) a multi-robot

graphical lasso using the so-called combinatorial graph Laplacian framework, a
key difference is the use of a nonconvex alternative to the $\ell_1$ norm to
attain graphs with better interpretability. Specifically, we use the
weakly-convex minimax concave penalty (the difference between the $\ell_1$ norm
and the Huber function) which is known to yield sparse solutions with lower
estimation bias than $\ell_1$ for regression problems. In our framework, the
graph Laplacian is replaced in the optimization by a linear transform of the
vector corresponding to its upper triangular part. Via a reformulation relying
on Moreau's decomposition, we show that overall convexity is guaranteed by
introducing a quadratic function to our cost function. The problem can be
solved efficiently by the primal-dual splitting method, of which the admissible
conditions for provable convergence are presented. Numerical examples show that
the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing graph learning

language processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however,
have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce
the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared
to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the
primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an
architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original
Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's
improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring
ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and
V projection in self-attention.
  Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale
grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We
also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to
significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a
500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4
auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X.
Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to
reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter
configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to
achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models
and several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.

on recasting the equation of state originally developed in the context of
lattice kinetic theory by Shan \& Chen as the coupling between the vacuum and
cold dark matter (CDM). This coupling allows the vacuum to evolve and is
nonlinear around a characteristic energy scale $\rho_*$, changing into a linear
coupling with a typical power law evolution at scales much lower and much
higher than $\rho_*$. Focusing on the simplest sub-class of models where the
interaction consists only of an energy exchange and the CDM remains geodesic,
we first illustrate the various possible models that can arise from the
Shan--Chen coupling, with several different behaviours at both early and late
times depending on the values of the model parameters selected. We then place
the first observational constraints on this Shan--Chen interacting vacuum
scenario, performing an MCMC analysis to find those values of the model and
cosmological parameters which are favoured by observational data. We focus on
models where the nonlinearity of the coupling is relevant at late times,
choosing for the reference energy scale $\rho_*$, the critical energy density
in $\Lambda$CDM. We show that the observational data we use are compatible with
a wide range of models which result in different cosmologies. However, we also
show that $\Lambda$CDM is preferred over all of the Shan--Chen interacting
vacuum models that we study, and comment on the inability of these models to
relax the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.

PointGoal Navigation -- navigating to a target coordinate in an unseen
environment under actuation and sensor noise without access to ground-truth
localization. Specifically, we find that the primary challenge under this
setting is learning localization -- when stripped of idealized localization,
agents fail to stop precisely at the goal despite reliably making progress
towards it. To address this we introduce a set of auxiliary losses to help the
agent learn localization. Further, we explore the idea of treating the precise
location of the agent as privileged information -- it is unavailable during
test time, however, it is available during training time in simulation. We
grant the agent restricted access to ground-truth localization readings during
training via an information bottleneck. Under this setting, the agent incurs a
penalty for using this privileged information, encouraging the agent to only
leverage this information when it is crucial to learning. This enables the
agent to first learn navigation and then learn localization instead of
conflating these two objectives in training. We evaluate our proposed method
both in a semi-idealized (noiseless simulation without Compass+GPS) and
realistic (addition of noisy simulation) settings. Specifically, our method
outperforms existing baselines on the semi-idealized setting by 18\%/21\%

Thresholding is a popular method for segmentation that uses the histogram of an

However, the computational cost increases exponentially according to the number
of thresholds. In this paper, we perform the multi-level thresholding using an
evolutionary metaheuristic. It is an improved version of the Harris Hawks
Optimization (HHO) algorithm that combines the chaotic initialization and the
concept of altruism. Further, for fitness assignment, we use a hybrid objective

new hybrid approach. The HHO was originally designed to solve numerical
optimization problems. Earlier, the statistical results and comparisons have

well-established metaheuristic techniques. In this article, the altruism has

sector containing a Majorana dark matter candidate and a coloured
coannihilation partner, connected to the Standard Model predominantly via a
$U_1$ vector leptoquark. A TeV scale $U_1$ leptoquark, which couples mostly to
third generation fermions, is the only successful single-mediator description
of the $B$-physics anomalies. After calculating the dark matter relic surface,
we focus on the most promising experimental avenue: LHC searches for the
coloured coannihilation partner. We find that the coloured partner hadronizes
and forms meson-like bound states leading to resonant signatures at colliders
reminiscent of the quarkonia decay modes in the Standard Model. By recasting
existing dilepton and monojet searches we exclude coannihilation partner masses
less than 280 GeV and 400 GeV, respectively. Since other existing collider
searches do not significantly probe the parameter space, we propose a new
dedicated search strategy for pair production of the coloured partner decaying
into $bb\tau\tau$ final states and dark matter particles. This search is
expected to probe the model up to dark matter masses around 600 GeV with
current luminosity.

magnetic activity and large-scale magnetic field of this prototypical young,
rapidly rotating solar-like star. Methods: With time-resolved
spectropolarimetric observations spread over four close-by nights, we
reconstructed the brightness distribution and large-scale magnetic field
geometry of V530 Per through Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Simultaneously, we
estimated the short-term variability of the surface through latitudinal
differential rotation. Using the same data set, we also mapped the spatial
distribution of prominences through tomography of H$\alpha$ emission. Results:
As in our previous study, a large dark spot occupies the polar region of V530
Per with smaller, dark, and bright spots at lower latitudes. The large-scale
magnetic field is dominated by a toroidal, mostly axisymmetric component. The
maximal radial field strength is equal to $\sim1$ kG. The surface differential
rotation is consistent with a smooth Sun-like shear d$\Omega = 0.053 \pm 0.004$
rad.d$^{-1}$, close to the solar shear level. The prominence pattern displays a
stable component that is confined close to the corotation radius. We also
observe rapidly evolving H$\alpha$ emitting structures, over timescales ranging
from minutes to days. The fast H$\alpha$ evolution was not linked to any
detected photospheric changes in the spot or magnetic coverage.

both unitary gates and projective measurements, we ask whether two
complementary subsystems are entangled or not. For Clifford circuits, we find
that this question can be mapped to a certain classical error-correction
problem where various entanglement measures can be explicitly computed from the
recoverability. The dual classical code is constructed from spacetime patterns
of out-of-time ordered correlation functions among local operators and measured
Pauli operators in the past, suggesting that the volume-law entanglement in a
monitored circuit emerges from quantum information scrambling, namely the
growth of local operators. We also present a method of verifying quantum
entanglement by providing a simple deterministic entanglement distillation
algorithm, which can be interpreted as decoding of the dual classical code.
Discussions on coding properties of a monitored Clifford circuit, including
explicit constructions of logical and stabilizer operators, are also presented.
Applications of our framework to various physical questions, including
non-Clifford systems, are discussed as well. Namely, we argue that the
entanglement structure of a monitored quantum circuit in the volume-law phase
is largely independent of the initial states and past measurement outcomes
except recent ones, due to the decoupling phenomena from scrambling dynamics,
up to a certain polynomial length scale which can be identified as the code
distance of the circuit. We also derive a general relation between the code
distance and the sub-leading contribution to the volume-law entanglement
entropy. Applications of these results to black hole physics are discussed as
well.

kinematically irregular and are widely spread throughout the core region of the

cosmology. The presence of anisotropy often spells doom on bouncing models,
since the energy density due to the anisotropic stress outweighs that of other
matter components, as the universe contracts. Different suggestions have been
made in the literature to resolve this pathology, classically. Here, we
introduce a family of bouncing models, in which the shear density can be tuned
to either allow or forbid classical bouncing scenarios. Following this, we show
that quantum cosmological considerations can drastically change the above
scenario. Most importantly, we find that quantum effects can enable a bounce,
even when the anisotropic stress is large enough to forbid the same
classically. We employ the solutions of the appropriate mini-superspace
Wheeler-DeWitt equation for homogeneous, but anisotropic cosmologies, with the
boundary condition that the universe is initially contracting. Intriguingly,
the solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exhibit an interesting phase
transition-like behaviour, wherein, the probability to have a bouncing universe
is precisely unity before the shear density reaches a critical value and then
starts to decrease abruptly as the shear density increases further. We verified
our findings using the tools of the Lorentzian quantum cosmology, along with
the application of the Picard-Lefschetz theory. In particular, the
semi-classical probability for a bounce has been re-derived from the imaginary
component of the on-shell effective action, evaluated at the complex saddle
points. Implications and future directions have also been discussed.

collapse earlier than in standard \LambdaCDM, baryons cool to form stars at

Bondi capture. The volume emissivity of these sources peaks at $z\sim20$ and
rapidly fades at lower redshifts. As a consequence, PBH DM could also provide a

nearby galaxy NGC 300 to quantify the effect of stellar feedback as a function
of the local galactic environment. We extract spectra from emission line
regions identified within dendrograms, combine emission line ratios and line
widths to distinguish between HII regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova
remnants, and compute their ionised gas properties, gas-phase oxygen
abundances, and feedback-related pressure terms. For the HII regions, we find
that the direct radiation pressure ($P_\mathrm{dir}$) and the pressure of the
ionised gas ($P_{HII}$) weakly increase towards larger galactocentric radii,
i.e. along the galaxy's (negative) abundance and (positive) extinction
gradients. While the increase of $P_{HII}$ with galactocentric radius is likely
due to higher photon fluxes from lower-metallicity stellar populations, we find
that the increase of $P_\mathrm{dir}$ is likely driven by the combination of
higher photon fluxes and enhanced dust content at larger galactocentric radii.
In light of the above, we investigate the effect of increased pre-supernova
feedback at larger galactocentric distances (lower metallicities and increased
dust mass surface density) on the ISM, finding that supernovae at lower
metallicities expand into lower-density environments, thereby enhancing the

  Enhancements",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Over the past decade, GPS enabled traffic applications, such as Google Maps
and Waze, have become ubiquitous and have had a significant influence on
billions of daily commuters' travel patterns. A consequence of the online route
suggestions of such applications, e.g., via greedy routing, has often been an
increase in traffic congestion since the induced travel patterns may be far
from the system optimum. Spurred by the widespread impact of traffic
applications on travel patterns, this work studies online traffic routing in
the context of capacity-constrained parallel road networks and analyzes this
problem from two perspectives. First, we perform a worst-case analysis to
identify the limits of deterministic online routing and show that the ratio
between the total travel cost of the online solution of any deterministic
algorithm and that of the optimal offline solution is unbounded, even in simple
settings. This result motivates us to move beyond worst-case analysis. Here, we
consider algorithms that exploit knowledge of past problem instances and show
how to design data-driven algorithms whose performance can be quantified and
formally generalized to unseen future instances. We present numerical
experiments based on an application case for the San Francisco Bay Area to
evaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the data-driven
algorithms we develop outperform commonly used greedy online-routing
algorithms.

repel mutually via a logarithmic potential on the real line, more specifically
the Dyson model. These systems are characterized by a parameter that controls
the strength of the interaction, $k>0$. In spite of being a one-dimensional
system, this system is interesting due to the properties that arise from the
long-range interaction between particles. It is a well-known fact that when $k$
is small enough, particle collisions occur almost surely, while when $k$ is
large, collisions never occur. However, aside from this fact there was no
characterization of the collision times until now. In this paper, we derive the
fractal (Hausdorff) dimension of the set of collision times by generalizing
techniques introduced by Liu and Xiao to study the return times to the origin
of self-similar stochastic processes. In our case, we consider the return times
to configurations where at least one collision occurs, which is a condition
that defines unbounded sets, as opposed to a single point, namely, the origin.
We find that the fractal dimension characterizes the collision behavior of
these systems, and establishes a clear delimitation between the colliding and
the non-colliding regions in a way similar to that of an order parameter.

which a group of pursuer robots are tasked with detecting an evader within a

formulation of the pursuit-evasion problem that modifies the pursuers'
objective by requiring that the evader still be detected, even in spite of the
failure of any single pursuer robot. This novel constraint, whereby two
pursuers are required to detect an evader, has the benefit of providing
redundancy to the search, should any member of the team become unresponsive,
suffer temporary sensor disruption/failure, or otherwise become incapacitated.
Existing methods, even those that are designed to respond to failures, rely on
the pursuers to replan and update their search pattern to handle such
occurrences. In contrast, the proposed formulation produces plans that are
inherently tolerant of some level of disturbance. Building upon this new
formulation, we introduce an augmented data structure for encoding the problem
state and a novel sampling technique to ensure that the generated plans are
robust to failures of any single pursuer robot. An implementation and

We also focus on the structure of critical points of stochastic fields, and
their relationship with formation and evolution of structures in the universe.
  The topological background is accompanied by an investigation of Gaussian

varying spectral indices. We present the statistical properties in terms of the
intensity and difference maps constructed from the persistence diagrams, as
well as their distribution functions. We demonstrate that the intensity maps
encapsulate information about the distribution of power across the hierarchies

This level of information is not available from the geometric Minkowski
functionals or the topological Euler characteristic, or even the Betti numbers,
and demonstrates the usefulness of hierarchical topological methods. Another
important result is the observation that topological characteristics of
Gaussian fields depend on the power spectrum, as opposed to the geometric
measures that are insensitive to the power spectrum characteristics.

video data, and then select oriented ST Chips based on how closely they fit
parametric models of natural video statistics. We show that the parameters that
describe these statistics can be used to reliably predict the quality of
videos, without the need for a reference video. The proposed method implicitly
models ST video naturalness, and deviations from naturalness. We train and test
our model on several large VQA databases, and show that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance at reduced cost, without requiring motion

couples to the fourth VL lepton, leading to an enhanced contribution to the

contribution requires a non-vanishing coupling of $Z'$ to right-handed muons,
which arises within this model due to mixing effects between the SM and VL

for the measured $B$-decay ratios $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and $\left(g-2\right)_{\mu}$.
We identify the parameter space where this explanation is consistent with

coordination reaction between MoS$_2$ monolayers with 3d transition metals
(TMs), exploring the nature and the trend of MoS$_2$-TMs interaction. Density
Functional Theory calculations, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and
Photoluminescence (PL) point to the formation of MoS$_2$-TM coordination
complexes, where the adsorption energy trend for 3d TM resembles the
crystal-field (CF) stabilization energy for weak-field complexes. Pearson's
theory for hard-soft acid-base and Ligand-field theory were applied to discuss
the periodic trends on 3d TM coordination on the MoS$_2$ surface. We found that
softer acids with higher ligand field stabilization energy, such as Ni$^{2+}$,
tend to form bonds with more covalent character with MoS$_2$, which can be
considered a soft base. On the other hand, harder acids, such as Cr$^{3+}$,
tend to form bonds with more ionic character. Additionally, we studied the
trends in charge transfer and doping observed in the XPS and PL results, where
metals such as Ni led to an n-type of doping, while Cu functionalization
results in p-type doping. Therefore, the formation of coordination complexes on
TMD's surface is demonstrated to be a promising and effective way to control

provided inequalities between the size of a $G$ -operator and certain
computable constants depending among others on its solutions. First, we recall
Andr\'e's idea to attach a notion of size to differential modules and detail
his results on the behavior of the size relatively to the standard algebraic
operations on the modules. This is the corner stone to prove a quantitative
version of Andr\'e's generalization of Chudnovsky's Theorem: for
$f(z)=\sum_{\alpha, k,\ell} c_{\alpha, k,\ell} z^{\alpha} \log(z)^k f_{\alpha,
k,\ell}(z)$, where $f_{\alpha, k,\ell}(z)$ are $G$-functions, we can determine
an upper bound on the size of the minimal operator $L$ over
$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(z)$ of $f(z)$ in terms of quantities depending on the
$f_{\alpha, k,\ell}(z)$, the rationals $\alpha$ and the integers $k$. We give
two applications of this result: we estimate the size of a product of two
$G$-operators in function of the size of each operator; we also compute a
constant appearing in a Diophantine problem encountered by the author.

constraint satisfaction with a specific probability; however, solving an
optimization problem with chance constraints assumes that the solver has access
to the exact underlying probability distribution, which is often unreasonable.
In data-driven applications, it is common instead to use historical data
samples as a surrogate to the distribution; however, this comes at a
significant computational cost from the added time spent either processing the
data or, worse, adding additional variables and constraints to the optimization
problem. On the other hand, the sample mean and covariance matrix are
lightweight to calculate, and it is possible to reframe the chance constraint
as a distributionally robust chance constraint. The challenge here is that the
sample mean and covariance matrix themselves are random variables, so their
uncertainty should be factored into the chance constraint. This work bridges
this gap by modifying the standard method of distributionally robust chance
constraints to guarantee its satisfaction. The proposed data-driven method is
tested on a particularly problematic example. The results show that the
computationally fast proposed method is not significantly more conservative

the scale of parts per million. However, unintended micron-scale contaminants
on the resonator mirrors that absorb the light circulating in the cavity can
deform the surface thermoelastically, and thus increase losses by scattering
light out of the resonant mode. The point absorber effect is a limiting factor
in some high-power cavity experiments, for example, the Advanced LIGO
gravitational wave detector. In this Letter, we present a general approach to
the point absorber effect from first principles and simulate its contribution
to the increased scattering. The achievable circulating power in current and
future gravitational-wave detectors is calculated statistically given different
point absorber configurations. Our formulation is further confirmed
experimentally in comparison with the scattered power in the arm cavity of
Advanced LIGO measured by in-situ photodiodes. The understanding presented here

multi-channel encoder with Spatial Filtering neural beamforming for FT speech,
which are jointly trained with the encoder selection. We validate our approach
on both attention-based and RNN Transducer end-to-end ASR systems. The
experiments are done with conversational speech from a medical use case, which
is recorded simultaneously with a CT device and a microphone array. Our results
show that the proposed dual-encoder architecture obtains up to 9% relative WER

understand the complexity of basic computational tasks in extremely adversarial

on property testing in the model with online erasures. We show that two
fundamental properties of functions, linearity and quadraticity, can be tested
for constant $t$ with asymptotically the same complexity as in the standard
property testing model. For linearity testing, we prove tight bounds in terms
of $t$, showing that the query complexity is $\Theta(\log t)$. In contrast to
linearity and quadraticity, some other properties, including sortedness and the
Lipschitz property of sequences, cannot be tested at all, even for $t=1$. Our
investigation leads to a deeper understanding of the structure of violations of
linearity and other widely studied properties. We also consider implications of
our results for algorithms that are resilient to online adversarial corruptions

that the plastic dynamics are entirely driven by the movement of dislocations,

known that glide motion of dislocations is the dominant microscopic mechanism
for plastic deformation in many crystalline materials, most notably in metals.
We propose a novel geometric language, built on the concepts of space-time
""slip trajectories"" and the ""crystal scaffold"" to describe the movement of

energetics and dissipation relationships in our model are derived from first
principles drawing on the theories of crystal modeling, elasticity, and

stress tensor describing the forces acting against slip. In order to place our
model into context, we further show that it recovers several laws that were
known in special cases before, most notably the equation for the Peach-Koehler
force (linearized configurational force) and the fact that the combination of
all dislocations yields the curl of the plastic distortion field. Finally, we

hardening, softening, dislocation climb, and coarse-graining, could be

band and \textit{Swift-XRT/UVOT} available data in X-ray and
Optical-to-Ultraviolet bands. In the $\gamma$-ray band, five flaring periods
have been detected, during which the flux dramatically increases by several
times (>5) compared with its average quiescent phase. Quasi-simultaneously with
the flaring times, the X-ray and UVOT data detected by \textit{Swift-XRT/UVOT}
have also been analysed. In one of the brightest flare periods (Flare 5;
observed on Oct 12, 2018) the $\gamma$-ray flux reached $(6.7\pm0.81)\times
10^{-6}$ photon/cm^2/s ($\sim31\times$ higher than the mean flux over 12.3
years) with detection significance of $\sigma=6.1$. The apparent $\gamma$-ray
luminosity of this flaring corresponds to $3.6\times10^{49}$ erg/s (for a
distance of 8.38 Gpc), one of the highest $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed
for blazars. Flare 5 has an estimated $\sim2$ hours time block, which can be
considered the average $\gamma$-ray variability time. The variability time
constrains the $\gamma$-ray emitting region size to <9e14 cm, which is close to
the black hole radius. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the
$\gamma$-ray band for the $\sim12.3$ years of data show an early cut-off at
$\sim14$ GeV; beyond $\sim60$ GeV, however, the spectrum hardens and is
detected up to $\sim316$ GeV. Similar spectral behaviour is also noticeable for
the SEDs of flares, which can be linked to the photon absorption by the
emitting region's internal and external narrow-band radiation fields.
Considering the significance of the obtained results from 4C\,+28.07, we
compared the parameters with 3C\,279 and M87, to motivate further studies.

period during the first one billion years. In particular, it remains unclear
whether or not plate tectonics and an active carbonate-silicate cycle were
present. In the presence of liquid water but without plate tectonics,
weathering would have been limited to freshly produced basaltic crust, with an
early carbon cycle restricted to the crust and atmosphere. With the evaporation
of surface water, weathering would cease. With ongoing volcanism, carbonate
sediments would be buried and sink downwards. Thereby, carbonates would heat up
until they become unstable and the crust would become depleted in carbonates.
With CO$_2$ supply to the atmosphere the surface temperature rises further, the
depth below which decarbonation occurs decreases, causing the release of even
more CO$_2$.
  We assess the habitable period of an early stagnant-lid Venus by employing a
coupled interior-atmosphere evolution model accounting for CO$_2$ degassing,
weathering, carbonate burial, and crustal decarbonation. We find that if
initial surface conditions allow for liquid water, weathering can keep the
planet habitable for up to 900 Myr, followed by evaporation of water and rapid
crustal carbonate depletion. For the atmospheric CO$_2$ of stagnant-lid
exoplanets, we predict a bimodal distribution, depending on whether or not
these planets experienced a runaway greenhouse in their history. Planets with
high atmospheric CO$_2$ could be associated with crustal carbonate depletion as
a consequence of a runaway greenhouse, whereas planets with low atmospheric
CO$_2$ would indicate active silicate weathering and thereby a habitable
climate.

constructed in a general covariant way in terms of kinematic factors that are

HDR images are useful in capturing scenes that pose high brightness, darker
areas, and shadows, etc. An HDR image comprises multiple narrow-range-exposure
images combined into one high-quality image. As these HDR images cannot be
displayed on standard display devices, the real challenge comes while
converting these HDR images to Low dynamic range (LDR) images. The conversion
of HDR image to LDR image is performed using Tone-mapped operators (TMOs). This
conversion results in the loss of much valuable information in structure,
color, naturalness, and exposures. The loss of information in the LDR image may
not directly be visible to the human eye. To calculate how good an LDR image is
after conversion, various metrics have been proposed previously. Some are not
noise resilient, some work on separate color channels (Red, Green, and Blue one
by one), and some lack capacity to identify the structure. To deal with this
problem, we propose a metric in this paper called the Tone Mapping Quality
Index (TMQI-3), which evaluates the quality of the LDR image based on its
objective score. TMQI-3 is noise resilient, takes account of structure and
naturalness, and works on all three color channels combined into one luminosity
component. This eliminates the need to use multiple metrics at the same time.
We compute results for several HDR and LDR images from the literature and show
that our quality index metric performs better than the baseline models.

distributional RL loss based on the categorical parameterization equipped with
the Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence. The resulting stable gradients while the
optimization in distributional RL accounts for its better training robustness

that relates the flow conductance to the permeable surface area via the
Carman-Kozeny equation. This equation allows calculating the flow rate of a
fluid flowing through the granules packed in the sample for a given pressure
drop. However, Carman-Kozeny makes inherent assumptions about tunnel shapes and
flow paths that may not accurately hold in situations where the particles
possess a wide distribution in shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios, as is true
with many powdered systems of technological and commercial interest. To address
this challenge, we replicate these measurements virtually on micro-CT images of
the powdered material, introducing a new Pore Network Model based on the
skeleton of the Morse-Smale complex. Pores are identified as basins of the
complex, their incidence encodes adjacency, and the conductivity of the
capillary between them is computed from the cross-section at their interface.
We build and solve a resistive network to compute an approximate laminar fluid
flow through the pore structure. We provide two means of estimating
flow-permeable surface area: (i) by direct computation of conductivity, and
(ii) by identifying dead-ends in the flow coupled with isosurface extraction
and the application of the Carman-Kozeny equation, with the aim of establishing
consistency over a range of particle shapes, sizes, porosity levels, and void

Internet protocol in favor of better security for the overall Internet. The
necessary cryptographic key management is made particularly challenging by DNS'
loosely-federated delegation substrate and unprecedented cryptographic scale.
Though fundamental for current and future operational success, our community
lacks a clear notion of how to empirically evaluate the process of securely
changing (or transitioning) keys.
  In this paper, we propose two building blocks to fundamentally understand and
assess key transitions. First, the anatomy of key transitions: measurable and
well-defined properties of key changes; and second a novel classification model
based on this anatomy to describe key transitions practices in abstract terms.
Our anatomy enables the evaluation of cryptographic keys' life cycles in
general, and comparison of operational practices with prescribed key management
processes, e.g., RFC key rollover guidelines. The fine-grained transition
anatomy is then abstracted through our classification model to characterize
transitions in abstract terms which rather describe a transition's behavior
than its specific features.
  The applicability and utility of our proposed transition anatomy and
transition classes are exemplified for the global DNSSEC deployment.
Specifically, we use measurements from the first 15 years of the DNSSEC rollout
to detect and measure which key rollover/transitions have been used, to what
degree, and what their rates of errors and warnings have been. Our results show
measurable gaps between prescribed key management processes and key transitions
in the wild. We also find evidence that such noncompliant transitions are
inevitable in the wild.

importance of adopting operational strategies to provide a demand-responsive
service. Aiming at improving passengers' travel time, the present study
introduces an advanced data-driven optimization approach to determine the
optimal stop-skip pattern in urban rail transit lines. In detail, first, using
the time-series smart card data for an entire month, we employ a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict the station-level
demand rates for the peak hour. This prediction is based on four preceding
hours and is especially important knowing that the true demand rates of the
peak hour are posterior information that can be obtained only after the peak
hour operation is finished. Moreover, utilizing a real-time prediction instead
of assuming fixed demand rates, allows us to account for unexpected real-time
changes which can be detrimental to the subsequent analyses. Then, we integrate
the output of the LSTM model as an input to an optimization model with the
objective of minimizing patrons' total travel time. Considering the exponential
nature of the problem, we propose an Ant Colony Optimization technique to solve
the problem in a desirable amount of time. Finally, the performance of the
proposed models and the solution algorithm is assessed using real case data.
The results suggest that the proposed approach can enhance the performance of
the service by improving both passengers' in-vehicle time as well as
passengers' waiting time.

Hopf algebras, which extends the notions of Hopf algebras, multiplier Hopf
algebras, and weak Hopf algebras. With an additional requirement of an
existence of left or right integrals, this framework provides a self-dual class
of algebraic quantum groupoids. The aim of this paper is to show that from this
purely algebraic data, with only a minimal additional requirement
(""quasi-invariance""), one can construct a $C^*$-algebraic quantum groupoid of
separable type, recently defined by the author, with Van Daele. The
$C^*$-algebraic quantum groupoid is represented as an operator algebra on the
Hilbert space constructed from the left integral, and the comultiplication is
determined by means of a certain multiplicative partial isometry $W$, which is
no longer unitary. In the last section (Appendix), we obtain some results in
the purely algebraic setting, which have not appeared elsewhere.

transceiver where the number of receive RF chains is different from that of the
transmit RF chains. Due to this unequal number of RF chains, channel
inconsistency appears. To overcome the channel inconsistency and thus fully
harness the system's downlink data transmission capability, we propose two
uplink-to-downlink channel transfer algorithms. The cost and power consumption
models for the asymmetrical transceiver are also developed and the uplink
signal-to-noise loss due to the channel inconsistency is investigated. Through
analyzing system spectral, cost, and energy efficiency, we demonstrate that the
proposed asymmetrical transceiver-based massive MIMO system can achieve
excellent downlink spectral efficiency while maintaining a reasonable energy

multi-antenna base station (BS) serving a single-antenna user with the help of

i.e., imperfect CSIT, and focus on the robust optimization of the BS's
instantaneous CSI-adaptive beamforming and the IRS's quasi-static phase shifts.
First, we formulate the robust optimization of the BS's instantaneous channel
state information (CSI)-adaptive beamforming and IRS's quasi-static phase
shifts for the ergodic rate maximization as a very challenging two-timescale
stochastic non-convex problem. Then, we obtain a closed-form beamformer for any

algorithm to obtain quasi-static phase shifts which correspond to a KKT point

proposed method offers a closed-form robust instantaneous CSI-adaptive
beamforming design that can promptly adapt to rapid CSI changes over slots and
a robust quasi-static phase shift design of low computation and phase

requires careful physical considerations and mathematical derivations, which
means a long research process. In addition, various complicated situations
often occur in practice, which brings great difficulties to the application of
theoretical models. On the other hand, there are many empirical formulas based
on real data. These empirical models are often simple and easy to use, but may
be not based on physical principles and lack a proper formulation of physics.
This work proposed a rational function neural networks (RafNN) for data-driven
rock physics modeling. Based on the observation data set, this method can
deduce a velocity model which not only satisfies the actual data distribution,
but also has a proper mathematical form reflecting the inherent rock physics.
The Gassmann's equation, which is the most commonly used theoretical model
relating bulk modulus of porous rock to mineral composition, porosity and
fluid, is perfectly reconstructed by using data-driven RafNN. The advantage of
this method is that only observational data sets are required to extract model
equations, and no complex mathematical and physical processes are involved.
This work opens up for the first time a new avenue on constructing analytical
expression of velocity models using neural networks and field data, which is of
great interest for exploring the heterogeneous structure of the Earth.

model performance under highly dynamic communication environments. This issue
can be alleviated by the fact that modern edge devices usually can connect to
the edge FL server via multiple communication channels (e.g., 4G, LTE and 5G).
However, having an edge device send copies of local models to the FL server
along multiple channels is redundant, time-consuming, and would waste resources
(e.g., bandwidth, battery life and monetary cost). In this paper, motivated by
the layered coding techniques in video streaming, we propose a novel FL
framework called layered gradient compression (LGC). Specifically, in LGC,
local gradients from a device is coded into several layers and each layer is
sent to the FL server along a different channel. The FL server aggregates the
received layers of local gradients from devices to update the global model, and
sends the result back to the devices. We prove the convergence of LGC, and
formally define the problem of resource-efficient federated learning with LGC.
We then propose a learning based algorithm for each device to dynamically
adjust its local computation (i.e., the number of local stochastic descent) and
communication decisions (i.e.,the compression level of different layers and the
layer to channel mapping) in each iteration. Results from extensive experiments
show that using our algorithm, LGC significantly reduces the training time,
improves the resource utilization, while achieving a similar accuracy, compared
with well-known FL mechanisms.

obtained from the statistical analysis is slightly lower than the corresponding
one to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that we are dealing with a more realistic
description of the fluid we must introduce more free parameters, this results
as evidence against the model based on the BIC value. However, despite this
statistical drawback we find that this model could be a good candidate to mimic
the $\Lambda$CDM model for redshift values at $z<1$. In this sense, we show
that the non linear regime of the Israel-Stewart theory describes consistently
the recent accelerated expansion of the universe without the inclusion of some

voltage $V_\text{for}$ is larger than expected, especially for green LEDs. This
is mainly due to the large barriers to vertical carrier transport caused by the
total polarization discontinuity at multiple quantum well and quantum barrier
interfaces. The natural random alloy fluctuation in QWs has proven to be an
important factor reducing $V_\text{for}$. However, this does not suffice in the
case of green LEDs because of their larger polarization-induced barrier.
V-defects have been proposed as another key factor in reducing $V_\text{for}$
to allow laterally injection into multiple quantum wells (MQWs), thus bypassing
the multiple energy barriers incurred by vertical transport. In this paper, to
model carrier transport in the whole LED, we consider both random-alloy and
V-defect effects. A fully two-dimensional drift-diffusion charge-control solver
is used to model both effects. The results indicate that the turn-on voltages
for blue and green LEDs are both affected by random alloy fluctuations and
V-defect density. For green LEDs, $V_\text{for}$ decreases more due to
V-defects, where the smaller polarization barrier at the V-defect sidewall is
the major path for lateral carrier injection. Finally, we discuss how V-defect
density and size affects the results.

networks, in which transmitters need to send a sequence of information packets
to the intended receivers over a shared spectrum. Due to interference, the
dynamics at the link pairs will interact with each other over both space and
time, and the effects of these spatiotemporal interactions on the AoI are not
well understood. In this paper, we straddle queueing theory and stochastic
geometry to establish an analytical framework, that accounts for the interplay
between the temporal traffic attributes and spatial network topology, for such
a study. Specifically, we derive accurate and tractable expressions to quantify
the network average AoI as well as the outage probability of peak AoI. Besides,
we develop a decentralized channel access policy that exploits the local
observation at each node to make transmission decisions that minimize the AoI.
Our analysis reveals that when the packet transmissions are scheduled in a
last-come first-serve (LCFS) order, whereas the newly incoming packets can
replace the undelivered ones, depending on the deployment density, there may or
may not exist a tradeoff on the packet arrival rate that minimizes the network
average AoI. Moreover, the slotted ALOHA protocol is shown to be instrumental
in reducing the AoI when the packet arrival rates are high, yet it cannot
contribute to decreasing the AoI in the regime of infrequent packet arrivals.
The numerical results also confirm the efficacy of the proposed scheme, where
the gain is particularly pronounced when the network grows in size because our
method is able to adapt the channel access probabilities with the change of
ambient environment.

essential component for large ground-based optical/infrared telescope. The
performance of the AO system can be significantly hindered if the on-sky spot
profile of its sLGS is degraded by the turbulence along the laser launching
uplink path. One effective method to overcome this problem is to perform
real-time pre-correction on the laser before it is launched onto the sky to
counter this turbulence effect especially for the lower altitude where
turbulence is stronger. The by-product Rayleigh backscatter generated by large
molecule and aerosols at low altitude when projecting sLGS is a perfect
candidate for real time detection of low altitude turbulence. It is therefore
important to evaluate whether this by-product of a sodium laser guide star
could achieve suitable performance for wavefront sensing. In this paper, we
attempt to answer the question regarding to the achievable photon return of
such Rayleigh backscattered plume. A comparison between results from our field
test and theoretical model of MSISE-90 was presented. We showed that the
greatest differences is less than 20% which hints the applicability of using
the defocused Rayleigh plume as wavefront sensing signal for different
turbulence strengths. The result also showed that in case of strong (Fried

their expected dark matter emissivities is difficult because of observational
challenges in their distance measurements. Here we present a stacking method
that makes use of catalogs of LSBGs and maps of unresolved gamma-ray emission
measured by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We show that, for relatively
large number of LSBGs, individual distance measurements to the LSBGs are not
necessary, instead the overall distance distribution of the population is
sufficient in order to impose dark matter constraints. Further, we demonstrate
that the effect of the covariance between two galaxies located closely -- at an
angular distance comparable to the size of the Fermi point spread function --
is negligibly small. As a case in point, we apply our pipeline to a sample of
800 faint LSBGs discovered by Hyper Suprime-Cam and find that, the 95 per cent

scales with inverse of the number LSBGs. In light of this linear dependence

Lack of which may lead to serious issues such as loose coordination between
teammates, reduced situation awareness, and ultimately teaming failures. Hence,
it is important for robots to behave explicably by meeting the human's
expectations. One of the challenges here is that the expectations of the human
are often hidden and can change dynamically as the human interacts with the
robot. However, existing approaches to generating explicable plans often assume
that the human's expectations are known and static. In this paper, we propose
the idea of active explicable planning to relax this assumption. We apply a
Bayesian approach to model and predict dynamic human belief and expectations to
make explicable planning more anticipatory. We hypothesize that active
explicable plans can be more efficient and explicable at the same time, when
compared to explicable plans generated by the existing methods. In our
experimental evaluation, we verify that our approach generates more efficient
explicable plans while successfully capturing the dynamic belief change of the

($\left\|u_0\right\|_2<\left\|Q\right\|_2$) is global and bounded in
$H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$, where $Q$ is the ground state of the mass-critical

for the equation with $C_1>0$ and $C_2=0$ or $C_1=0$ and $C_2>0$ and
investigate the behaviour of the solution near the blow-up time. Moreover, they
have suggested that a subcritical power nonlinearity and an inverse power
potential behave in a similar way with respect to blow-up. On the other hand,
the previous results also show the nonexistence of a minimal-mass blow-up
solution for the equation with $C_1<0$ and $C_2=0$ or $C_1=0$ and $C_2<0$. In
this paper, we investigate the existence and behaviour of a minimal-mass
blow-up solution for the equation with $C_1>0>C_2$ or $C_1<0<C_2$, that is the
subcritical power nonlinearity and the inverse power potential cancel each
other's effects. Furthermore, we give a lower estimate of the arbitrary
finite-time blow-up solution with critical mass and show that the energies of
critical-mass blow-up solutions are positive when $(C_1,C_2,p,\sigma)$ is under

identity classes between training and test sets, is a major issue of
RGB-Infrared person re-identification. A key to tackle the inherent issue --
domain shift -- is to enforce the data distributions of the two domains to be
similar. However, RGB-IR ReID always demands discriminative features, leading
to over-rely feature sensitivity of seen classes, \textit{e.g.}, via
attention-based feature alignment or metric learning. Therefore, predicting the
unseen query category from predefined training classes may not be accurate and
leads to a sub-optimal adversarial gradient. In this paper, we uncover it in a
more explainable way and propose a novel multi-granularity memory regulation
and alignment module (MG-MRA) to solve this issue. By explicitly incorporating
a latent variable attribute, from fine-grained to coarse semantic granularity,
into intermediate features, our method could alleviate the over-confidence of
the model about discriminative features of seen classes. Moreover, instead of
matching discriminative features by traversing nearest neighbor, sparse
attributes, \textit{i.e.}, global structural pattern, are recollected with
respect to features and assigned to measure pair-wise image similarity in
hashing. Extensive experiments on RegDB \cite{RegDB} and SYSU-MM01 \cite{SYSU}

video understanding, aiming to localize the temporal segments containing human
action instances and predict the action categories. The previous works greatly
rely upon dense candidates either by designing varying anchors or enumerating
all the combinations of boundaries on video sequences; therefore, they are
related to complicated pipelines and sensitive hand-crafted designs. Recently,
with the resurgence of Transformer, query-based methods have tended to become
the rising solutions for their simplicity and flexibility. However, there still
exists a performance gap between query-based methods and well-established
methods. In this paper, we identify the main challenge lies in the large
variants of action duration and the ambiguous boundaries for short action
instances; nevertheless, quadratic-computational global attention prevents
query-based methods to build multi-scale feature maps. Towards high-quality
temporal action detection, we introduce Sparse Proposals to interact with the
hierarchical features. In our method, named SP-TAD, each proposal attends to a
local segment feature in the temporal feature pyramid. The local interaction
enables utilization of high-resolution features to preserve action instances
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
especially under high tIoU thresholds. E.g., we achieve the state-of-the-art

networks coupled to external vibrations by Holstein and Peierls couplings. By
treating the positions of the network sites and the site-dependent phonon
frequencies as independent variables, we determine the Hamiltonian parameters
corresponding to minimum transfer time by Bayesian optimization. The results
show that Holstein couplings may accelerate transfer through sub-optimal
network configurations but cannot accelerate quantum dynamics beyond the limit
of the transfer time in an optimal phonon-free configuration. By contrast,
Peierls couplings distort the optimal networks to accelerate quantum transfer
through configurations with less than six sites. However, the speed-up offered
by Peierls couplings decreases with the network size and disappears for
networks with more than seven sites. For networks with seven sites or more,
Peierls couplings distort the optimal network configurations and change the
mechanism of quantum transfer but do not affect the lower limit of the transfer
time. The machine-learning approach demonstrated here can be applied to
determine quantum speed limits in other applications.

greedy approach may not be guaranteed. To address this challenge, we propose a
bi-criteria polynomial-time approximation algorithm with high certainty. At the
heart of the algorithm is a novel group reachable reverse sample concept, which
helps speed up the estimation of the group influence function. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted on real social networks show that our proposed
algorithm outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the objective

important role for understand the mechanism of materials. However, it is

For example, the spectral information deconvoluted by scanning tunneling
spectroscopy suffers from the temperature broadening effect, which is ill-posed
and makes the deconvolution result unstable. To solve this problem, the core
idea of existing methods, such as the maximum entropy method, tends to select
appropriate regularization to suppress unstable oscillations. However, the
choice of regularization is difficult, and the oscillation has not been
completely eliminated. We think non-uniform sampling is the core improvement
direction, combined with stochastic optimization and deep learning, we
introduce a neural network based discretization scheme to solve the
deconvolution problem. Due to the neural network can represent any piece-wise
linear function, our method replace the target spectrum by network and can find
a better approximation solution through optimization accurate and efficient.
Experiments on theoretical datasets about superconductors demonstrate that the

structural barriers that historically constrain individuals to reach out to
different others. Through the platform, people from all walks of life and
virtually any location can develop diverse friendships online. However,
friendships on Facebook have been as segregated as friendships in real life.
This research sought to understand why the leading social networking site
intended to 'bring the world closer together' retains segregated friendship. In
doing so, we employed a series of agent-based simulations based on the
Framework for Intergroup Relations and Multiple Affiliations Networks (FIRMAN).
As demonstrated, Facebook has primarily enhanced users' capacity to maintain a
larger number of friendships (tie capacity), while has done little to empower
users' ability to accept diversity and befriend different others (tie
outreachability). Facebook must focus on the latter should they truly wish to
contribute to the development of a more inclusive society. While in this study
we focus on ethnically segregated friendship on Facebook, we argue that the
same explanation may also hold for racially and ideologically segregated
friendships on other bi-directional social networking sites.

to its computational and storage efficiency. However, recent works raise the
security concerns of deep hashing. Although existing works focus on the
vulnerability of deep hashing in terms of adversarial perturbations, we
identify a more pressing threat, backdoor attack, when the attacker has access
to the training data. A backdoored deep hashing model behaves normally on
original query images, while returning the images with the target label when
the trigger presents, which makes the attack hard to be detected. In this
paper, we uncover this security concern by utilizing clean-label data
poisoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the
backdoor attack against deep hashing models. To craft the poisoned images, we
first generate the targeted adversarial patch as the backdoor trigger.
Furthermore, we propose the confusing perturbations to disturb the hashing code
learning, such that the hashing model can learn more about the trigger. The
confusing perturbations are imperceptible and generated by dispersing the
images with the target label in the Hamming space. We have conducted extensive
experiments to verify the efficacy of our backdoor attack under various
settings. For instance, it can achieve 63% targeted mean average precision on
ImageNet under 48 bits code length with only 40 poisoned images.

illustrate a strategy that is able to unmask the sender's identity by analyzing

anonymous precoding to preserve the sender's anonymity, while ensuring high

in finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes. The decrease
of the widths of spectral bands leads to a decrease in the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of measurements. The decreased SNR reduces the reliability of
measured features or information extracted from HSIs. Furthermore, the image
degradations linked with various mechanisms also result in different types of
noise, such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, deadlines, and stripes. This
paper introduces a fast and parameter-free hyperspectral image mixed noise
removal method (termed FastHyMix), which characterizes the complex distribution
of mixed noise by using a Gaussian mixture model and exploits two main
characteristics of hyperspectral data, namely low-rankness in the spectral
domain and high correlation in the spatial domain. The Gaussian mixture model
enables us to make a good estimation of Gaussian noise intensity and the

explosive progresses in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown great potential

imaging systems based on the ""capturing images first and processing afterwards""
mechanism cannot meet this unprecedented demand. Differently, Computational
Imaging (CI) systems are designed to capture high-dimensional data in an
encoded manner to provide more information for mobile vision systems.Thanks to
AI, CI can now be used in real systems by integrating deep learning algorithms
into the mobile vision platform to achieve the closed loop of intelligent
acquisition, processing and decision making, thus leading to the next
revolution of mobile vision.Starting from the history of mobile vision using
digital cameras, this work first introduces the advances of CI in diverse
applications and then conducts a comprehensive review of current research
topics combining CI and AI. Motivated by the fact that most existing studies
only loosely connect CI and AI (usually using AI to improve the performance of
CI and only limited works have deeply connected them), in this work, we propose
a framework to deeply integrate CI and AI by using the example of self-driving
vehicles with high-speed communication, edge computing and traffic planning.
Finally, we outlook the future of CI plus AI by investigating new materials,
brain science and new computing techniques to shed light on new directions of
mobile vision systems.

only a small amount of data from an individual user, the adaptive parameters
are adjusted to enable user-specific prediction through a two-step process:
initialization via a separate network and adaptation via a few gradient steps.
Regarding the motion dataset that has 20 users collaborating with a robotic

variety of astrophysical contexts. This has been complemented by theoretical
efforts to understand the dynamics of warp evolution. Despite significant
efforts to understand the dynamics of warped discs, previous work fails to
address arguably the most prevalent regime -- nonlinear warps in Keplerian
discs for which there is a resonance between the orbital, epicyclic and
vertical oscillation frequencies. In this work, we implement a novel nonlinear
ring model, developed recently by Fairbairn and Ogilvie, as a framework for
understanding such resonant warp dynamics. Here we uncover two distinct
nonlinear regimes as the warp amplitude is increased. Initially we find a
smooth modulation theory which describes warp evolution in terms of the
averaged Lagrangian of the oscillatory vertical motions of the disc. This hints
towards the possibility of connecting previous warp theory under a generalised
secular framework. Upon the warp amplitude exceeding a critical value, which
scales as the square root of the aspect-ratio of our ring, the disc enters into
a bouncing regime with extreme vertical compressions twice per orbit. We
develop an impulsive theory which predicts special retrograde and prograde
precessing warped solutions, which are identified numerically using our full
equation set. Such solutions emphasise the essential activation of nonlinear
vertical oscillations within the disc and may have important implications for
energy and warp dissipation. Future work should search for this behaviour in
detailed numerical studies of the internal flow structure of warped discs.

Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) to blocks. Before the decoding stage, we
introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion Layer to implicitly fuse intent and slot

concatenating intent and slot features, we first compute two correlation
matrices to weight on two features. Furthermore, we present Higher-order

  Excess Paradox","18 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The geological conundrum of sulfur excess refers to the finding that
predicted amounts of sulfur, in the form of SO2, discharged in volcanic
eruptions much exceeds the sulfur available for degassing from the erupted
magma. Exploring the source of the excess sulfur has been the subject of
considerable interest. Here, from a systematic computational investigation of
sulfur-oxygen compounds under pressure, a hitherto unknown S3O4 compound
containing a mixture of sulfur oxidation states +II and +IV emerges and is
predicted to be stabilized above a pressure of 79 GPa. We predict that S3O4 can
be produced via multiple redox reactions involving subducted S-bearing minerals
(e.g., sulfates and sulfides) at high pressure conditions relevant to the deep
lower mantle, and conversely be decomposed into SO2 and S at shallow depths of
Earth. Therefore, S3O4 can be considered as a key intermediate compound to
promote the decomposition of sulfates to release SO2, which offers an
alternative source of the excess sulfur released during explosive eruptions.
These findings provide a possible resolution to the geological paradox of
excess sulfur degassing and a viable mechanism for the understanding of S
exchange between surface and the lower mantle for the deep sulfur cycle.

alloy by employing conventional alloying and thermomechanical processing to
induce partial recrystallization (PR) and precipitation strengthening in the
microstructure. The combined usage of electron microscopy and atom probe
tomography reveals the sequence of microstructural evolution during the
process. First, the cold working of homogenized alloy resulted in a highly
deformed microstructure. On annealing at 700{\deg}C, B2 ordered precipitates
heterogeneously nucleate on the highly misoriented sites. These B2 promotes
particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) of new recrystallized strain-free grains.
The migration of recrystallized grain boundaries leads to discontinuous
precipitation of L12 ordered regions in highly dense lamellae structures.
Atomic-scale compositional analysis reveals a significant amount of Ni confined
to the GB regions between B2 and L12 precipitates, indicating Ni as a
rate-controlling element for coarsening the microstructure. On 20 hours of
annealing, the alloy comprises a composite microstructure of soft
recrystallized and hard non-recrystallized zones, B2 particles at the grain
boundaries (GBs), and coherent L12 precipitates inside the grains. The B2 pins
the GB movement during recrystallization while the latter provides high
strength. The microstructure results in a 0.2% yield stress (YS) value of 1030
MPa with 32% elongation at ambient temperature and retains up to 910 MPa at
670{\deg}C. Also, it shows exceptional microstructural stability at 700 {\deg}C
and resistance to deformation at high temperatures up to 770{\deg}C.
Examination of deformed microstructure reveals excessive twinning, formation of
stacking faults, shearing of L12 precipitates, and accumulation of dislocations

overall good agreement. Additionally, we show that further insight can be

and the model equations have largely evolved since the original Lotka-Volterra
system towards more realistic descriptions of the processes of predation,
reproduction and mortality. One important aspect is the recognition of the fact
that the growth of a population can be subject to an Allee effect, where the
per capita growth rate increases with the population density. Including an
Allee effect has been shown to fundamentally change predator-prey dynamics and
strongly impact species persistence, but previous studies mostly focused on
scenarios of an Allee effect in the prey population. Here we explore a
predator-prey model with an ecologically important case of the Allee effect in
the predator population where it occurs in the numerical response of predator
without affecting its functional response. Biologically, this can result from
various scenarios such as a lack of mating partners, sperm limitation and
cooperative breeding mechanisms, among others. Unlike previous studies, we
consider here a generic mathematical formulation of the Allee effect without
specifying a concrete parameterisation of the functional form, and analyse the
possible local bifurcations in the system. Further, we explore the global
bifurcation structure of the model and its possible dynamical regimes for three
different concrete parameterisations of the Allee effect. The model possesses a
complex bifurcation structure: there can be multiple coexistence states
including two stable limit cycles. Inclusion of the Allee effect in the
predator generally has a destabilising effect on the coexistence equilibrium.
We also show that regardless of the parametrisation of the Allee effect,

word order. It has been predicted theoretically that DDm implies compression,
namely the minimization of word lengths. This is a second order prediction
because it links a principle with another principle, rather than a principle
and a manifestation as in a first order prediction. Here we test that second
order prediction with a parallel collection of treebanks controlling for
annotation style with Universal Dependencies and Surface-Syntactic Universal
Dependencies. To test it, we use a recently introduced score that has many
mathematical and statistical advantages with respect to the widely used sum of
dependency distances. We find that the prediction is confirmed by the new score
when word lengths are measured in phonemes, independently of the annotation
style, but not when word lengths are measured in syllables. In contrast, one of
the most widely used scores, i.e. the sum of dependency distances, fails to
confirm that prediction, showing the weakness of raw dependency distances for
research on word order. Finally, our findings expand the theory of natural
communication by linking two distinct levels of organization, namely syntax

sensitive applications like healthcare and medicine, concerns have been raised
over the privacy aspects of trained GNNs. More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to
privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox
access to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy
has emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets.
Following the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE),
recent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models. These teachers are
trained on disjoint subsets of private data and are employed to transfer
knowledge to a student model, which is then released with privacy guarantees.
However, splitting graph data into many disjoint training sets may destroy the
structural information and adversely affect accuracy. We propose a new
graph-specific scheme of releasing a student GNN, which avoids splitting
private training data altogether. The student GNN is trained using public data,
partly labeled privately using the teacher GNN models trained exclusively for

unlabeled multivariate cardiac signals to identify abnormal heart rhythms
(cardiac arrhythmias) is valuable in real-world clinical settings but often
challenging due to its complex temporal dynamics. Cardiac arrhythmias can vary
significantly in temporal patterns even for the same patient ($i.e.$, intra
subject difference). Meanwhile, the same type of cardiac arrhythmia can show
different temporal patterns among different patients due to different cardiac
structures ($i.e.$, inter subject difference). In this paper, we address the
challenges by proposing an Intra-inter Subject self-supervised Learning (ISL)
model that is customized for multivariate cardiac signals. Our proposed ISL
model integrates medical knowledge into self-supervision to effectively learn
from intra-inter subject differences. In intra subject self-supervision, ISL
model first extracts heartbeat-level features from each subject using a
channel-wise attentional CNN-RNN encoder. Then a stationarity test module is
employed to capture the temporal dependencies between heartbeats. In inter
subject self-supervision, we design a set of data augmentations according to
the clinical characteristics of cardiac signals and perform contrastive
learning among subjects to learn distinctive representations for various types
of patients. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets were conducted.
In a semi-supervised transfer learning scenario, our pre-trained ISL model
leads about 10% improvement over supervised training when only 1% labeled data
is available, suggesting strong generalizability and robustness of the model.

representations. The learned representations carry rich timbral, harmonic, and

Previous feature-level adversarial learning methods only consider adapting

between source and target domains in the high-level semantic features makes
accurate adaptation difficult. In this paper, we present the first attempt at
explicitly using low-level edge information, which has a small inter-domain
gap, to guide the transfer of semantic information. To this end, a
semantic-edge domain adaptation architecture is proposed, which uses an
independent edge stream to process edge information, thereby generating
high-quality semantic boundaries over the target domain. Then, an edge
consistency loss is presented to align target semantic predictions with
produced semantic boundaries. Moreover, we further propose two entropy
reweighting methods for semantic adversarial learning and self-supervised
learning, respectively, which can further enhance the adaptation performance of
our architecture. Comprehensive experiments on two UDA benchmark datasets

study the response of a magnetically truncated inner disk to an episodic
accretion event. Additionally, we vary the protostellar magnetic field strength
and investigate the consequences of the magnetic field on the long-term
behavior of PPDs. We use the fully implicit 1+1D TAPIR code which solves the
axisymmetric hydrodynamic equations self-consistently. Our model allows us to
investigate disk dynamics close to the star and to conduct long-term evolution
simulations simultaneously and includes the radial radiation transport in the
stationary diffusion limit. We include stellar magnetic torques, the influence
of a pressure gradient, and a variable inner disk radius in the TAPIR code to
describe the innermost disk region in a more self-consistent manner and can
show that this approach alters the disk dynamics considerably compared to a
simplified diffusive evolution equation, especially during outbursts. The
influences of a prescribed stellar magnetic field, local pressure gradients,
and a variable inner disk radius result in a more consistent description of the
gas dynamics in the innermost regions of PPDs. Combining magnetic torques
acting on the innermost disk regions with the long-term evolution of PPDs
yields previously unseen results, whereby the whole disk structure is affected
over its entire lifetime. Additionally, we want to emphasize that a combination
of our 1+1D model with more sophisticated multi-dimensional codes could improve
the understanding of PPDs even further.

$K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ for the optimal UCI is $2\leq K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}\leq
2.75$. Currently, the code constructions achieve $K_{\mathcal{C}}=2.75$ for UCI

evolved into a new format, called Online Matching Markets (OMMs), with examples

two features distinguishing OMMs from traditional matching markets. One is the
dynamic arrival of one side of the market: we refer to these as online agents
while the rest are offline agents. Examples of online and offline agents
include keywords (online) and sponsors (offline) in Google Advertising; workers

The second distinguishing feature of OMMs is the real-time decision-making
element. However, studies have shown that the algorithms making decisions in
these OMMs leave disparities in the match rates of offline agents. For example,
tasks in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status rarely get matched to gig
workers, and drivers of certain races/genders get discriminated against in
matchmaking. In this paper, we propose online matching algorithms which
optimize for either individual or group-level fairness among offline agents in
OMMs. We present two linear-programming (LP) based sampling algorithms, which

(CNN) has dominated semantic segmentation for many years. CNN adopts
hierarchical feature representation, demonstrating strong capabilities for

layer limits the network from capturing the global context. Recently, as a hot
topic in the domain of computer vision, Transformer has demonstrated its great
potential in global information modelling, boosting many vision-related tasks
such as image classification, object detection, and particularly semantic
segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based decoder and
construct a UNet-like Transformer (UNetFormer) for real-time urban scene

lightweight ResNet18 as the encoder and develops an efficient global-local
attention mechanism to model both global and local information in the decoder.
Extensive experiments reveal that our method not only runs faster but also
produces higher accuracy compared with state-of-the-art lightweight models.
Specifically, the proposed UNetFormer achieved 67.8% and 52.4% mIoU on the

the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE) with weak nonlinearity. For the
Schr\""odinger equation with small potential characterized by a dimensionless
parameter $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$ representing the amplitude of the potential,
we employ the unitary flow property of the (second-order) time-splitting
Fourier pseudospectral (TSFP) method in $L^2$-norm to prove a uniform error
bound at $C(T)(h^m +\tau^2)$ up to the long time $T_\varepsilon= T/\varepsilon$
for any $T>0$ and uniformly for $0<\varepsilon\le1$, while $h$ is the mesh
size, $\tau$ is the time step, $m \ge 2$ depends on the regularity of the exact
solution, and $C(T) =C_0+C_1T$ grows at most linearly with respect to $T$ with
$C_0$ and $C_1$ two positive constants independent of $T$, $\varepsilon$, $h$
and $\tau$. Then by introducing a new technique of {\sl regularity compensation
oscillation} (RCO) in which the high frequency modes are controlled by
regularity and the low frequency modes are analyzed by phase cancellation and
energy method, an improved uniform error bound at $O(h^{m-1} + \varepsilon

at $O(1/\varepsilon)$ of the Schr\""odinger equation with
$O(\varepsilon)$-potential with $m \geq 3$, which is uniformly for
$\varepsilon\in(0,1]$. Moreover, the RCO technique is extended to prove an
improved uniform error bound at $O(h^{m-1} + \varepsilon^2\tau^2)$ in
$H^1$-norm for the long-time dynamics up to the time at $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ of
the cubic NLSE with $O(\varepsilon^2)$-nonlinearity strength, uniformly for

video content uploaded to social networking and video sharing websites like
Facebook and Youtube. As of result of this, the risk of children getting
exposed to adult and violent content on the web also increased. To address this
issue, an approach to automatically detect violent content in videos is
proposed in this work. Here, a novel attempt is made also to detect the
category of violence present in a video. A system which can automatically
detect violence from both Hollywood movies and videos from the web is extremely
useful not only in parental control but also for applications related to movie
ratings, video surveillance, genre classification and so on.
  Here, both audio and visual features are used to detect violence. MFCC
features are used as audio cues. Blood, Motion, and SentiBank features are used
as visual cues. Binary SVM classifiers are trained on each of these features to
detect violence. Late fusion using a weighted sum of classification scores is
performed to get final classification scores for each of the violence class
target by the system. To determine optimal weights for each of the violence
classes an approach based on grid search is employed. Publicly available
datasets, mainly Violent Scene Detection (VSD), are used for classifier
training, weight calculation, and testing. The performance of the system is
evaluated on two classification tasks, Multi-Class classification, and Binary
Classification. The results obtained for Binary Classification are better than
the baseline results from MediaEval-2014.

However, traditional 3-D wavelet transforms are designed manually with certain

minimizing analytical errors is a critical factor in the optimal computer

zeros (sparse), a well structure, and a well condition are advantageous for
this objective. As a result, a problem of optimization with various goals will

errors in skeletal structural flexibility matrixes via the use of more
consistent and appropriate mathematical methods. These errors become more
pronounced in particular designs with ill-suited flexibility matrixes;
structures with varying stiffness are a frequent example of this. Due to the
usage of weak elements, the flexibility matrix has a large number of
non-diagonal terms, resulting in analytical errors. In numerical analysis, the
ill-condition of a matrix may be resolved by moving or substituting rows; this
study examined the definition and execution of these modifications prior to
creating the flexibility matrix. Simple topological and algebraic features have
been mostly utilized in this study to find fundamental cycle bases with

experience of a user to output a set of recommendations, each associated with a
precise confidence value. Given a significance level $\varepsilon$, it provides
a bound $\varepsilon$ on the probability of making a wrong recommendation. The
conformal framework uses a key concept called \emph{nonconformity measure} that
measures the strangeness of an item concerning other items. One of the
significant design challenges of any conformal recommendation framework is
integrating nonconformity measures with the recommendation algorithm. This
paper introduces an inductive variant of a conformal recommender system. We
propose and analyze different nonconformity measures in the inductive setting.
We also provide theoretical proofs on the error-bound and the time complexity.
Extensive empirical analysis on ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that the
inductive variant substantially improves the performance in computation time

success. In this letter, through explorative data analysis and dedicated

operational regimes of tokamaks can affect the power of a trained disruption
predictor. First, our results suggest data-driven disruption predictors trained
on abundant LP discharges work poorly on the HP regime of the same tokamak,
which is a consequence of the distinct distributions of the tightly correlated
signals related to disruptions in these two regimes. Second, we find that
matching operational parameters among tokamaks strongly improves cross-machine
accuracy which implies our model learns from the underlying scalings of
dimensionless physics parameters like q_{95}, \beta_{p} and confirms the
importance of these parameters in disruption physics and cross machine domain
matching from the data-driven perspective. Finally, our results show how in the
absence of HP data from the target devices, the best predictivity of the HP
regime for the target machine can be achieved by combining LP data from the
target with HP data from other machines. These results provide a possible
disruption predictor development strategy for next generation tokamaks, such as

exploding or vanishing. Existing initialization schemes solve this problem in
specific cases by assuming that the network has a certain activation function
or topology. It is difficult to derive such weight initialization strategies,
and modern architectures therefore often use these same initialization schemes
even though their assumptions do not hold. This paper introduces AutoInit, a
weight initialization algorithm that automatically adapts to different neural
network architectures. By analytically tracking the mean and variance of
signals as they propagate through the network, AutoInit appropriately scales
the weights at each layer to avoid exploding or vanishing signals. Experiments
demonstrate that AutoInit improves performance of convolutional, residual, and
transformer networks across a range of activation function, dropout, weight
decay, learning rate, and normalizer settings, and does so more reliably than
data-dependent initialization methods. This flexibility allows AutoInit to
initialize models for everything from small tabular tasks to large datasets
such as ImageNet. Such generality turns out particularly useful in neural
architecture search and in activation function discovery. In these settings,
AutoInit initializes each candidate appropriately, making performance
evaluations more accurate. AutoInit thus serves as an automatic configuration
tool that makes design of new neural network architectures more robust. The
AutoInit package provides a wrapper around TensorFlow models and is available

problem is notably prominent for the task of metastasis detection in lymph
nodes, due to the tissue's low tumor-to-non-tumor ratio, resulting in labor-
and time-intensive annotation processes for the pathologists. This work
explores alternatives on how to augment the training data for colon carcinoma
metastasis detection when there is limited or no representation of the target
domain. Through an exhaustive study of cross-validated experiments with limited
training data availability, we evaluate both an inter-organ approach utilizing
already available data for other tissues, and an intra-organ approach,
utilizing the primary tumor. Both these approaches result in little to no extra
annotation effort. Our results show that these data augmentation strategies can
be an efficient way of increasing accuracy on metastasis detection, but
fore-most increase robustness.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2109.08806",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The impacts of channel estimation errors, inter-cell interference, phase
adjustment cost, and computation cost on an intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS)-assisted system are severe in practice but have been ignored for
simplicity in most existing works. In this paper, we investigate a
multi-antenna base station (BS) serving a single-antenna user with the help of
a multi-element IRS in a multi-cell network with inter-cell interference. We
consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the BS, i.e., imperfect
CSIT, and focus on the robust optimization of the BS's instantaneous
CSI-adaptive beamforming and the IRS's quasi-static phase shifts in two
scenarios. In the scenario of coding over many slots, we formulate a robust
optimization problem to maximize the user's ergodic rate. In the scenario of
coding within each slot, we formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize
the user's average goodput under the successful transmission probability
constraints. The robust optimization problems are challenging two-timescale
stochastic non-convex problems. In both scenarios, we obtain closed-form robust
beamforming designs for any given phase shifts and more tractable stochastic
non-convex approximate problems only for the phase shifts. Besides, we propose
an iterative algorithm to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each of
the stochastic problems for the phase shifts. It is worth noting that the
proposed methods offer closed-form robust instantaneous CSI-adaptive
beamforming designs which can promptly adapt to rapid CSI changes over slots
and robust quasi-static phase shift designs of low computation and phase
adjustment costs in the presence of imperfect CSIT and inter-cell interference.
Numerical results further demonstrate the notable gains of the proposed robust
joint designs over existing ones and reveal the practical values of the
proposed solutions.

$\epsilon$ apart from $x_i$ for $\epsilon>0$ a confidence threshold. The LF
model involves two types of groups--the leader group and the follower group.
All leader groups have their target opinion. The original LF model partitions
all agents whose opinion is a number in $[-1,1]$ to a follower group, a leader
group with a positive target opinion in $[0,1]$ and a leader group with a
negative target opinion in $[-1,0]$. A leader group agent has a constant degree
to its target and mix it with the average opinion of its group neighbors at
each update. A follower has a constant degree to the average opinion of each
leader group neighbors and mix it with the average opinion of its group
neighbors at each update. In this paper, we consider a variant of the LF model,
namely the mixed model, in which the degrees can vary over time, the opinions
can be high dimensional, and the number of leader groups can be more than two.
The LF model can be applied to e-commerce and the mixed model covers it when
there is only one confidence threshold. We study the mixed model theoretically

versatile medium for communicating about the visual world. How do images
spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning? Do viewers
understand drawings based solely on their ability to resemble the entities they
refer to (i.e., as images), or do they understand drawings based on shared but
arbitrary associations with these entities (i.e., as symbols)? In this paper,
we provide evidence for a cognitive account of pictorial meaning in which both
visual and social information is integrated to support effective visual
communication. To evaluate this account, we used a communication task where
pairs of participants used drawings to repeatedly communicate the identity of a
target object among multiple distractor objects. We manipulated social cues
across three experiments and a full internal replication, finding pairs of
participants develop referent-specific and interaction-specific strategies for
communicating more efficiently over time, going beyond what could be explained
by either task practice or a pure resemblance-based account alone. Using a
combination of model-based image analyses and crowdsourced sketch annotations,
we further determined that drawings did not drift toward arbitrariness, as
predicted by a pure convention-based account, but systematically preserved
those visual features that were most distinctive of the target object. Taken
together, these findings advance theories of pictorial meaning and have
implications for how successful graphical conventions emerge via complex
interactions between visual perception, communicative experience, and social
context.

the existing mapped WENO schemes suffer from either losing high resolutions or
generating spurious oscillations in long-run simulations of hyperbolic problems
has been successfully addressed, by devising the improved mapped WENO schemes,
namely MOP-WENO-X, where ""X"" stands for the version of the existing mapped WENO
scheme. However, all the MOP-WENO-X schemes bring about the serious deficiency
that their resolutions in the region with high-frequency but smooth waves are
dramatically decreased compared to their associated WENO-X schemes. The purpose
of this paper is to overcome this drawback. We firstly present the definition
of the locally order-preserving (LOP) mapping. Then, by using a new proposed
posteriori adaptive technique, we apply this LOP property to obtain the new
mappings from those of the WENO-X schemes. The essential idea of the posteriori
adaptive technique is to identify the global stencil in which the existing
mappings fail to preserve the LOP property, and then replace the mapped weights
with the weights of the classic WENO-JS scheme to recover the LOP property. We
build the resultant mapped WENO schemes and denote them as LOP-WENO-X. The
numerical experiments demonstrate that the resolutions in the region with
high-frequency but smooth waves of the LOP-WENO-X schemes are similar or even
better than those of their associated WENO-X schemes and naturally much higher
than the MOP-WENO-X schemes. Furthermore, the LOP-WENO-X schemes gain all the
great advantages of the MOP-WENO-X schemes, such as attaining high resolutions
and in the meantime preventing spurious oscillations near discontinuities when
solving the one-dimensional linear advection problems with long output times,
and significantly reducing the post-shock oscillations in the simulations of
the two-dimensional problems with shock waves.

symptoms ASD displays, the diagnosis process remains challenging, with numerous
misdiagnoses as well as lengthy and expensive diagnoses. Fortunately, if ASD is
diagnosed and treated early, then the patient will have a much higher chance of
developing normally. For an ASD diagnosis, machine learning algorithms can
analyze both social behavior and facial features accurately and efficiently,
providing an ASD diagnosis in a drastically shorter amount of time than through
current clinical diagnosis processes. Therefore, we propose to develop a hybrid
architecture fully utilizing both social behavior and facial feature data to
improve the accuracy of diagnosing ASD. We first developed a Linear Support
Vector Machine for the social behavior based module, which analyzes Autism
Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) social behavior data. For the facial
feature based module, a DenseNet model was utilized to analyze facial feature

results show that the highest accuracy of 87% for ASD diagnosis has been
achieved by our proposed hybrid model. The pros and cons of each module will be
