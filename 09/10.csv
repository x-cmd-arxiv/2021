  Comparisons",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-known linear dimension-reduction
method that has been widely used in data analysis and modeling. It is an
unsupervised learning technique that identifies a suitable linear subspace for
the input variable that contains maximal variation and preserves as much
information as possible. PCA has also been used in prediction models where the
original, high-dimensional space of predictors is reduced to a smaller, more
manageable, set before conducting regression analysis. However, this approach
does not incorporate information in the response during the dimension-reduction
stage and hence can have poor predictive performance. To address this concern,
several supervised linear dimension-reduction techniques have been proposed in
the literature. This paper reviews selected techniques, extends some of them,
and compares their performance through simulations. Two of these techniques,
partial least squares (PLS) and least-squares PCA (LSPCA), consistently
outperform the others in this study.

of the ground state and are critical to a variety of systems. Most approximate
functionals of density functional theory (DFT) fail to properly describe these
effects. A number of diagnostics have been proposed that allow to estimate the
reliability of a given single-reference solution in this respect. Some of these
diagnostics however lack size-consistency, while remaining computationally
expensive. In this work we use the DFT method of determining atomic populations
of effectively localized electrons (APELE) as a novel diagnostic in this vein.
It is compared with several existing diagnostics of nondynamic correlation on
select exemplary systems. We show that the APELE method is on average in good
agreement with the existing diagnostics, while being both size-consistent and
less costly. It becomes particularly informative in cases involving bond
stretching or bond breaking. The APELE method is applied next to organic
diradicals like the bis-acridine dimer and the p-quinodimethane molecule which
possess unusually high nonlinear optical response, and to the reaction of
ethylene addition to Ni dithiolene, where our results shed some more light on
how the oxidation state of the Ni center may change when going from the initial
reactant to the product.

experimentally not accessible bubble parameters and shock wave emission. The
model is extended by a term covering the initial shock-driven acceleration of
the bubble wall, an automated method determining shock front position and
pressure decay, and an energy balance for the partitioning of absorbed laser
energy into vaporization, bubble and shock wave energy, and dissipation through
viscosity and condensation. These tools are used for analysing a scattering
signal covering 102 oscillation cycles. The bubble was produced by a plasma
with 1550 K average temperature and had 36 $\mu$m maximum radius. Predicted
bubble wall velocities during expansion agree well with experimental data. Upon
first collapse, most energy was stored in the compressed liquid around the
bubble and then radiated away acoustically. The collapsed bubble contained more
vapour than gas, and its pressure was 13.5 GPa. The pressure of the rebound
shock wave initially decayed $\propto r^{-1.8}$, and energy dissipation at the
shock front heated liquid near the bubble wall above the superheat limit. The
shock-induced temperature rise reduces damping during late bubble oscillations.
Bubble dynamics changes significantly for small bubbles with less than 10
$\mu$m radius.

patterns from the tactile data, hallucinate the changes in the environment,
estimate the uncertainty of the prediction, and generalize to unseen objects.

unsupervised sentence embeddings. The current state-of-the-art unsupervised
method is the unsupervised SimCSE (unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE takes dropout as
a minimal data augmentation method, and passes the same input sentence to a
pre-trained Transformer encoder (with dropout turned on) twice to obtain the
two corresponding embeddings to build a positive pair. As the length
information of a sentence will generally be encoded into the sentence
embeddings due to the usage of position embedding in Transformer, each positive
pair in unsup-SimCSE actually contains the same length information. And thus
unsup-SimCSE trained with these positive pairs is probably biased, which would
tend to consider that sentences of the same or similar length are more similar
in semantics. Through statistical observations, we find that unsup-SimCSE does
have such a problem. To alleviate it, we apply a simple repetition operation to
modify the input sentence, and then pass the input sentence and its modified
counterpart to the pre-trained Transformer encoder, respectively, to get the
positive pair. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the community of computer
vision and introduce a momentum contrast, enlarging the number of negative
pairs without additional calculations. The proposed two modifications are
applied on positive and negative pairs separately, and build a new sentence
embedding method, termed Enhanced Unsup-SimCSE (ESimCSE). We evaluate the
proposed ESimCSE on several benchmark datasets w.r.t the semantic text

contribution is evolving circular domains coverage (ECDC) algorithm. The
proposed scheme integrates both block-based and keypoint-based forgery
detection methods. Firstly, the speed-up robust feature (SURF) in log-polar
space and the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) are extracted from an
entire image. Secondly, generalized 2 nearest neighbor (g2NN) is employed to
get massive matched pairs. Then, random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is
employed to filter out mismatched pairs, thus allowing rough localization of
counterfeit areas. To present these forgery areas more accurately, we propose
the efficient and accurate ECDC algorithm to present them. This algorithm can
find satisfactory threshold areas by extracting block features from jointly
evolving circular domains, which are centered on matched pairs. Finally,
morphological operation is applied to refine the detected forgery areas.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed CMFD scheme can achieve better

If either condition is unmet, such as for active particles in a bounded region,
floating particles, or for filters, then the ultimate state after a long time
is not uniform, and may be time dependent. We show that in those cases of
nonuniform mixing it is preferable to characterize the degree of mixing in
terms of an f-divergence, which is a generalization of relative entropy, or to
use the $L^1$ norm. Unlike concentration variance ($L^2$ norm), the
f-divergence and $L^1$ norm always decay monotonically, even for nonuniform

shown that already just for one coherent control any point in the Bloch ball

the decoherence rate and $\omega$ is the transition frequency. Typical values
are $\delta\lesssim10^{-3}$ that implies high accuracy of achieving any density

pervasive electrostatic field active in the whole Galaxy except in restricted

the maximum energies of Galactic protons are $3.0 \times 10^{19}$ eV. The

the electrostatic structure in the Milky Way Galaxy are the same that generate
the Galactic magnetic field. Accordingly, the intensity, orientation and

amount of negative charge in the parent galaxy. Negative charge is mainly
stored by quiescent electrons. After adequate particle propagation neither the

force between clusters which overwhelms gravity. After a few billions years of
electrostatic repulsion, peripheral clusters attain relativistic velocities and
their mutual distances increase accordingly. Several facts suggest that the

identification of a Planck-selected protocluster located in the Cosmos field,
PHz G237.01+42.50 (G237). G237 contains a galaxy overdensity of 31
spectroscopically identified galaxies at z~2.16 (significant at 5.4 sigma) in a
10'x11' region. The overdensity contains two substructures or protoclusters at
<z>~2.16 and 2.195 with estimated halo masses at z=0 of ~(5-6)x10^14 Msun. The
overdensity total SFR, ~4000 Msun/yr, is higher than predicted by simulations
but much smaller than the SFR derived from the Planck data. The analysis of the
Herschel data, in combination with the available ancillary data, shows that
such a difference is due to an effect of source alignment along the line of
sight that produces a 5 sigma overdensity of red Herschel sources in the field.
We analyze the members' UV spectra and UV-far-infrared spectral energy
distributions to derive their SFR, stellar mass, and metallicity. Galaxy
members include blue star-forming galaxies and AGN with SFRs and stellar masses
consistent with the main sequence. AGN, identified through optical spectroscopy
or X-ray data, represent a significant fraction (20+/-10%) of all members of
the protocluster at z=2.16, and they are powerful enough to produce radiative
feedback. The core of this protocluster, besides being denser, includes members
that are, on average, more massive and star-forming and contains a larger
fraction of AGN and Herschel-detected galaxies than the full sample, suggesting
an environmental effect on galaxy growth. A comparison between G237 and other
protoclusters in the literature at similar redshifts reveals some common traits
and differences that reflect both observational biases and a diversity in
intrinsic properties that is not yet fully understood.

reaches at most, if the force softening is sufficiently small, $\sim 2-3

extends up to wavenumbers of order $5k_\Lambda$ at late times. Expressed as a
suitable function of the scale-factor, accuracy shows a very simple
$n$-dependence, allowing a extrapolation to place conservative bounds on the
accuracy of \emph{N}-body simulations of non-scale free models like LCDM. We
note that deviations due to discretization in the converged range are not well
modelled by shot noise, and subtracting it in fact degrades accuracy.
Quantitatively our findings are broadly in line with the conservative

outperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.
Furthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many

inverse problems converge to a plausible minimum by any means. We therefore
introduce for the first time in geophysics the smooth DTW distance, which has
demonstrated its performance in time series classification, clustering, and
prediction as the loss function. The fundamental idea of such a distance is to
replace the $\min$ operator with its smooth relaxation. Then it becomes
possible to define the analytic derivative of DTW distance. The new misfit
function is entitled to the differentiable DTW distance. Moreover, considering
that the warping path is an indicator of the traveltime difference between the
observed and synthetic trace, a penalization term is constructed based on the
warping path such that the misfit accumulation by the penalized differentiable
DTW distance is weighted in favor of the traveltime difference. Numerical

eventually deforms into the dumbbell-shaped form making its bulges to move
towards the branches of the junction. We observe that the asymmetric
distribution of the magnetic force lines, acting over the T-junction
divergence, induces an accelerating motion to the left moving bulge (since the
magnet is placed adjacent to the left branch). We show that the non-uniform
force field gradient allows the formation of a hump-like structure inside the
left moving bulge which triggers the onset of augmented convection in its flow
field. We reveal that this augmented internal convection developed in the left
moving volume/bulge, on getting coupled with the various involved time scales
of the flow field, lead to the asymmetric splitting of the droplet into two
sister droplets. Our analysis establishes that at the critical strength of the
applied forcing, as realized by the critical magnetic Bond number, the flow
time scale becomes minimum at the left branch of the channel, leading to the
formation of larger sized sister droplet therein. Inferences of the present

Recently, these measures have been applied to embeddings from contextualized

informativity of such measures for contextualized language models. We find that
a small number of rogue dimensions, often just 1-3, dominate these measures.
Moreover, we find a striking mismatch between the dimensions that dominate

We show that simple postprocessing techniques such as standardization are able

however, can accelerate the decoding speed by generating multiple tokens in
parallel on the basis of the token-wise conditional independence assumption. We
propose a unified NAR E2E-ST framework called Orthros, which has an NAR decoder
and an auxiliary shallow AR decoder on top of the shared encoder. The auxiliary
shallow AR decoder selects the best hypothesis by rescoring multiple candidates
generated from the NAR decoder in parallel (parallel AR rescoring). We adopt
conditional masked language model (CMLM) and a connectionist temporal
classification (CTC)-based model as NAR decoders for Orthros, referred to as
Orthros-CMLM and Orthros-CTC, respectively. We also propose two training
methods to enhance the CMLM decoder. Experimental evaluations on three
benchmark datasets with six language directions demonstrated that Orthros
achieved large improvements in translation quality with a very small overhead
compared with the baseline NAR model. Moreover, the Conformer encoder
architecture enabled large quality improvements, especially for CTC-based
models. Orthros-CTC with the Conformer encoder increased decoding speed by
3.63x on CPU with translation quality comparable to that of an AR model.

datasets and methods to improve the representation of MWEs are urgently needed.
Existing datasets are limited to providing the degree of idiomaticity of
expressions along with the literal and, where applicable, (a single)
non-literal interpretation of MWEs. This work presents a novel dataset of
naturally occurring sentences containing MWEs manually classified into a
fine-grained set of meanings, spanning both English and Portuguese. We use this
dataset in two tasks designed to test i) a language model's ability to detect
idiom usage, and ii) the effectiveness of a language model in generating
representations of sentences containing idioms. Our experiments demonstrate
that, on the task of detecting idiomatic usage, these models perform reasonably
well in the one-shot and few-shot scenarios, but that there is significant
scope for improvement in the zero-shot scenario. On the task of representing
idiomaticity, we find that pre-training is not always effective, while
fine-tuning could provide a sample efficient method of learning representations
of sentences containing MWEs.

Boolean CSPs. The smoothed model is a hybrid between worst and average-case
input models, where the input is an arbitrary instance of the CSP with only the
negation patterns of the literals re-randomized with some small probability.
For an $n$-variable smoothed instance of a $k$-arity CSP, our algorithm runs in
$n^{O(\ell)}$ time, and succeeds with high probability in bounding the optimum
fraction of satisfiable constraints away from $1$, provided that the number of
constraints is at least $\tilde{O}(n) (\frac{n}{\ell})^{\frac{k}{2} - 1}$. This
matches, up to polylogarithmic factors in $n$, the trade-off between running
time and the number of constraints of the state-of-the-art algorithms for
refuting fully random instances of CSPs [RRS17].
  We also make a surprising new connection between our algorithm and even
covers in hypergraphs, which we use to positively resolve Feige's 2008
conjecture, an extremal combinatorics conjecture on the existence of even
covers in sufficiently dense hypergraphs that generalizes the well-known Moore
bound for the girth of graphs. As a corollary, we show that polynomial-size
refutation witnesses exist for arbitrary smoothed CSP instances with number of
constraints a polynomial factor below the ""spectral threshold"" of $n^{k/2}$,
extending the celebrated result for random 3-SAT of Feige, Kim and Ofek

Lorentz symmetry, but possessing an inhomogeneous scaling symmetry. A number of
aspects of such models are explored, including the addition of supersymmetry,
and their application in the construction of more conventional conformal field
theories.
  In Part I, we describe a scaling technique by which non-Lorentzian theories
with an inhomogeneous scaling symmetry are obtained from Lorentzian
supersymmetric models, while retaining all supersymmetry of the parent theory.
The dynamics of the resulting theories are generically constrained to the
moduli space of some BPS soliton. We explore this scaling technique and the
resulting reduction to superconformal quantum mechanics for some examples,
including several relevant to the branes of M-theory.
  In Part II, we build from the ground up the theory of models in five
dimensions with an exotic $SU(1,3)$ spacetime symmetry, including an
inhomogeneous scaling. We derive and solve the corresponding Ward-Takahashi
identities for correlators, and demonstrate how such models naturally describe
any six-dimensional conformal field theory on a conformal compactification of
Minkowski space. We derive necessary conditions for a generic $SU(1,3)$ theory
to admit such a six-dimensional interpretation, and also explore a degenerate
limit of the construction that recovers the standard DLCQ picture. Finally, we
study in detail an explicit $SU(1,3)$ model, conjectured to provide a
Lagrangian description of the non-Abelian $(2,0)$ theory. The theory is shown
to realise six-dimensional physics through the inclusion of singular points
carrying non-zero instanton charge, which are encoded by instanton operators in
the path integral. We explore the constrained dynamics of the theory, which are
shown to describe the propagation of Yang-Mills instanton-particles between

applications. However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and
fine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big
laughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose
Talk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs
fine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the
system. Our key insight is to model a continual ""semantic field"" in the GAN
latent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing
straight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated
as finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape
on the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and
determined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To
engage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback
by considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic
field.
  We also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to
facilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated
fine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual
descriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the
smoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and
3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency. Notably, user study validates
that our overall system is consistently favored by around 80% of the
participants. Our project page is https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/talkedit/.

patterns with increasing complexity within various cycle lengths. For a
generated rhythm pattern the performance assessment of the learner is carried
out through the statistical deviations calculated from the onset detection and
temporal assessment of a learner's performance. This is compared with the
generated pattern, and their performance accuracy forms the feedback to the
learner. The system proceeds to generate a new pattern of increased complexity
when performance assessment results are within certain error bounds. The system
thus mimics a learner-teacher relationship as the learner progresses in their
feedback-based learning. The choice of progression within a cycle for each
pattern is determined by a predefined complexity metric. This metric is based
on a coded element model for the perceptual processing of sequential stimuli.

problem, offering a good trade-off between performance accuracy and speed. The
experiments on graph alignment and classification show that the flexibility
gained through filter graph distances can have a significant impact on

augmentation strategy for neural machine translation (NMT), especially for

we introduce HintedBT -- a family of techniques which provides hints (through
tags) to the encoder and decoder. First, we propose a novel method of using
both high and low quality BT data by providing hints (as source tags on the
encoder) to the model about the quality of each source-target pair. We don't
filter out low quality data but instead show that these hints enable the model
to learn effectively from noisy data. Second, we address the problem of
predicting whether a source token needs to be translated or transliterated to
the target language, which is common in cross-script translation tasks (i.e.,
where source and target do not share the written script). For such cases, we
propose training the model with additional hints (as target tags on the
decoder) that provide information about the operation required on the source
(translation or both translation and transliteration). We conduct experiments
and detailed analyses on standard WMT benchmarks for three cross-script
low/medium-resource language pairs: {Hindi,Gujarati,Tamil}-to-English. Our
methods compare favorably with five strong and well established baselines. We
show that using these hints, both separately and together, significantly
improves translation quality and leads to state-of-the-art performance in all

errors are significantly larger than gate errors on some platforms. A widely
used {\it transition matrix error mitigation} (TMEM) technique uses measured
transition probabilities between initial and final classical states to correct
subsequently measured data. However from a rigorous perspective, the noisy
measurement should be calibrated with perfectly prepared initial states and the
presence of any state-preparation error corrupts the resulting mitigation. Here
we develop a measurement error mitigation technique, conditionally rigorous
TMEM, that is not sensitive to state-preparation errors and thus avoids this
limitation. We demonstrate the importance of the technique for high-precision
measurement and for quantum foundations experiments by measuring Mermin

allows one to correct for both state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors
in expectation values as well; we illustrate this by giving a protocol for

constant ($H_0$) inferred from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data over that
found in $\Lambda$CDM, via the introduction of a new form of energy density in
the early universe. The EDE component briefly accelerates cosmic expansion just
prior to recombination, which reduces the physical size of the sound horizon
imprinted in the CMB. Previous work has found that non-zero EDE is not
preferred by Planck CMB power spectrum data alone, which yield a 95% confidence
level (CL) upper limit $f_{\rm EDE} < 0.087$ on the maximal fractional
contribution of the EDE field to the cosmic energy budget. In this paper, we
fit the EDE model to CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data
Release 4. We find that a combination of ACT, large-scale Planck TT (similar to
WMAP), Planck CMB lensing, and BAO data prefers the existence of EDE at
$>99.7$% CL: $f_{\rm EDE} = 0.091^{+0.020}_{-0.036}$, with $H_0 =
70.9^{+1.0}_{-2.0}$ km/s/Mpc (both 68% CL). From a model-selection standpoint,
we find that EDE is favored over $\Lambda$CDM by these data at roughly
$3\sigma$ significance. In contrast, a joint analysis of the full Planck and
ACT data yields no evidence for EDE, as previously found for Planck alone. We
show that the preference for EDE in ACT alone is driven by its TE and EE power
spectrum data. The tight constraint on EDE from Planck alone is driven by its
high-$\ell$ TT power spectrum data. Understanding whether these differing
constraints are physical in nature, due to systematics, or simply a rare
statistical fluctuation is of high priority. The best-fit EDE models to ACT and
Planck exhibit coherent differences across a wide range of multipoles in TE and
EE, indicating that a powerful test of this scenario is anticipated with
near-future data from ACT and other ground-based experiments.

  neural population activity",,,,,"cs.LG q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advances in neural recording present increasing opportunities to study neural
activity in unprecedented detail. Latent variable models (LVMs) are promising
tools for analyzing this rich activity across diverse neural systems and
behaviors, as LVMs do not depend on known relationships between the activity
and external experimental variables. However, progress with LVMs for neuronal
population activity is currently impeded by a lack of standardization,
resulting in methods being developed and compared in an ad hoc manner. To
coordinate these modeling efforts, we introduce a benchmark suite for latent
variable modeling of neural population activity. We curate four datasets of
neural spiking activity from cognitive, sensory, and motor areas to promote
models that apply to the wide variety of activity seen across these areas. We
identify unsupervised evaluation as a common framework for evaluating models
across datasets, and apply several baselines that demonstrate benchmark
diversity. We release this benchmark through EvalAI.

the black hole in this promising, if simplified, scenario, called the BSW
effect, turned out to be subject to unconditional upper bounds. And although
such bounds were not found for the electrostatic variant of the process, this

approach to this problem by introducing a new resource monotone that obeys a
very strong type of monotonicity: it can rule out all transformations,
probabilistic or deterministic, between states in any quantum resource theory.
This allows us to place fundamental limitations on state transformations and
restrict the advantages that probabilistic protocols can provide over
deterministic ones, significantly strengthening previous findings and extending
recent no-go theorems. We apply our results to obtain a substantial improvement
in bounds for the errors and overheads of probabilistic distillation protocols,
directly applicable to tasks such as entanglement or magic state distillation,
and computable through convex optimization. In broad classes of resources, we
strengthen our results to show that the monotone completely governs

direct operational interpretation, as it can exactly quantify the highest
fidelity achievable in resource distillation tasks by means of any

quantum-classical algorithm that seeks to achieve approximate solutions to
optimization problems by iteratively alternating between intervals of
controlled quantum evolution. Here, we examine the effect of analog precision
errors on QAOA performance both from the perspective of algorithmic training
and canonical state- and observable-dependent QAOA-relevant metrics. Leveraging
cumulant expansions, we recast the faulty QAOA as a control problem in which
precision errors are expressed as multiplicative control noise and derive
bounds on the performance of QAOA. We show using both analytical techniques and
numerical simulations that errors in the analog implementation of QAOA circuits
hinder its performance as an optimization algorithm. In particular, we find
that any fixed precision implementation of QAOA will be subject to an
exponential degradation in performance dependent upon the number of optimal
QAOA layers and magnitude of the precision error. Despite this significant
reduction, we show that it is possible to mitigate precision errors in QAOA via
digitization of the variational parameters, therefore at the cost of increasing
circuit depth. We illustrate our results via numerical simulations and analytic
and empirical error bounds as a comparison. While focused on precision errors,
our approach naturally lends itself to more general noise scenarios and the
calculation of error bounds on QAOA performance and broader classes of
variational quantum algorithms.

towards the Galactic bulge. A full analysis of the cluster can give hints on
the early chemical enrichment of the Galaxy and a plausible origin of the
cluster. The aim of this study is threefold: a detailed analysis of
high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the
Very Large Telescope (VLT) at ESO, the derivation of the age and distance of
Pal~6 from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometric data, and an orbital
analysis to determine the probable origin of the cluster. High-resolution
spectra of six red giant stars in the direction of Palomar 6 were obtained at
the $8$m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope equipped with the UVES spectrograph in
FLAMES$+$UVES configuration. Spectroscopic parameters were derived through
excitation and ionisation equilibrium of \ion{Fe}{I} and \ion{Fe}{II} lines,
and the abundances were obtained from spectrum synthesis. From HST photometric
data, the age and distance were derived through a statistical isochrone
fitting. Finally, a dynamical analysis was carried out for the cluster assuming
two different Galactic potentials. Four stars that are members of Pal~6 were
identified in the sample, which gives a mean radial velocity of $174.3\pm1.6$
km\,s$^{-1}$ and a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]$\,=-1.10\pm0.09$ for the cluster.
We found an enhancement of $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, and Ca)

The odd-Z elements (Na and Al) show a mild enhancement of [X/Fe]$\,\sim +0.25$.

fractions that range between $\sim$6\% and 19\% in nice agreement with the
values found in previous works for merging clusters. We also observe an ICL
fraction excess between 3800 \AA and 4800 \AA, previously identified as a
signature of merging clusters at $0.18<z<0.55$. This excess suggests the
presence of an enhanced population of young/low-metallicity stars in the ICL.
All indicators thus point to WHL J013719.8-08284 as a disturbed cluster with a
significant amount of recently injected stars, bluer than the average stars
hosted by the cluster members and likely stripped out from infalling galaxies
during the current merging event. Infrared ICL fractions are $\sim$50\% higher
than the optical ones, which could be signature of an older and/or
higher-metallicity ICL population that can be associated with the build-up of
the BCG, the passive evolution of young stars, previously injected, or
preprocessing in infalling groups. Finally, investigating the photometry of the

disk galaxies is one of the most successful a priori predictions of the
modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm on galaxy scales. Another important
consequence of MOND as a classical modification of gravity is that the strong
equivalence principle (SEP) -- which requires the dynamics of a small,
free-falling, self-gravitating system not to depend on the external
gravitational field in which it is embedded -- should be broken. Multiple
tentative detections of this so-called external field effect (EFE) of MOND have
been made in the past, but the systems that should be most sensitive to it are
galaxies with low internal gravitational accelerations residing in galaxy
clusters within a strong external field. Here, we show that ultra-diffuse
galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster do lie on the RAR, and that their velocity
dispersion profiles are in full agreement with isolated MOND predictions,
especially when including some degree of radial anisotropy. However, including
a breaking of the SEP via the EFE seriously deteriorates this agreement. We
discuss various possibilities to explain this within the context of MOND,
including a combination of tidal heating and higher baryonic masses. We also
speculate that our results could mean that the EFE is screened in cluster UDGs.
The fact that this would happen precisely within galaxy clusters, where
classical MOND fails, could be especially relevant to the nature of the
residual MOND missing mass in clusters of galaxies.

assumptions about halo growth and feedback-regulated star formation can match
the (limited) existing observational data on galaxies at z>6. By extending such
models, we demonstrate that imposing a time delay on stellar feedback (as
inevitably occurs in the case of supernova explosions) induces burstiness in
small galaxies. Although supernova progenitors have short lifetimes (~5-30
Myr), the delay exceeds the dynamical time of galaxies at such high redshifts.
As a result, star formation proceeds unimpeded by feedback for several cycles
and ""overshoots"" the expectations of feedback-regulated star formation models.
We show that such overshoot is expected even in atomic cooling halos, with
masses up to ~10^10.5 Msun at z>6. However, these burst cycles damp out quickly
in massive galaxies, because large haloes are more resistant to feedback so
retain a continuous gas supply. Bursts in small galaxies - largely beyond the
reach of existing observations - induce a scatter in the luminosity of these
haloes (of ~1 mag) and increase the time-averaged star formation efficiency by
up to an order of magnitude. This kind of burstiness can have substantial
effects on the earliest phases of star formation and reionization.

masks include rings and lenses, publicly released but not explicitly used in
this paper. We examine trends using PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) intensity maps and
tracers of star formation. The interarm regions and discs without strong
spirals dominate in area, whereas molecular gas and star formation are quite
evenly distributed among the five basic environments. We reproduce the
molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with a slope compatible with unity within
the uncertainties, without significant slope differences among environments. In
contrast to early studies, we find that bars are not always deserts devoid of
gas and star formation, but instead they show large diversity. Similarly,
spiral arms do not account for most of the gas and star formation in disc
galaxies, and they do not have shorter depletion times than the interarm
regions. Spiral arms accumulate gas and star formation, without systematically
boosting the star formation efficiency. Centres harbour remarkably high surface
densities and on average shorter depletion times than other environments.
Centres of barred galaxies show higher surface densities and wider
distributions compared to the outer disc; yet, depletion times are similar to
unbarred galaxies, suggesting highly intermittent periods of star formation
when bars episodically drive gas inflow, without enhancing the central star
formation efficiency permanently. In conclusion, we provide quantitative
evidence that stellar structures in galaxies strongly affect the organisation
of molecular gas and star formation, but their impact on star formation
efficiency is more subtle.

contrast to a Landau quasiparticle under the SOC, in which the spin texture

such strong nebular emission is powered remains unclear, with both active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and hot stars considered equally viable. The UV continuum

minimal dust obscuration, young ages, and low metallicities. This contrasts
with narrow-lined AGN at $z\sim2-3$, whose UV slopes are significantly redder
($\beta>-1$) than typical star-forming systems in the reionisation era. To
investigate the properties of AGN in the reionisation era, we have conducted a
search for potential examples of rare analogues with blue continua at
intermediate redshift ($z\sim2-3$). Our goals are to determine whether AGN with
intense line emission and blue continua exist and thereby to establish the
range of rest-frame UV and optical line ratios in this population. In this
paper we report the detection of a X-ray luminous AGN at $z=3.21$ (UDS-24561)

continuum slope ($\beta=-2.34$). MMT/Binospec and Keck/MOSFIRE spectra indicate
rest-frame UV line ratios consistent with AGN photoionisation models and
rest-frame optical lines with both a narrow component (FWHM $=154$ km$/$s) and
extended broad wings (FWHM $=977$ km$/$s), consistent with outflowing gas. We
describe how such objects can be identified in future JWST emission line
surveys in the reionisation era, thereby providing a valuable census of AGN
activity at $z>6$ and understanding their contribution to cosmic reionisation.

vacuum decay proceeds through the formation of bubbles that nucleate at random
positions in spacetime and subsequently expand. In this paper we investigate
the presence of correlations between bubble nucleation sites using a recently
proposed semi-classical stochastic description of vacuum decay. This procedure
samples vacuum fluctuations, which are then evolved using classical lattice
simulations. We compute the two-point function for bubble nucleation sites from
an ensemble of simulations, demonstrating that nucleation sites cluster in a
way that is qualitatively similar to peaks in random Gaussian fields. We
qualitatively assess the phenomenological implications of bubble clustering in
early Universe phase transitions, which include features in the power spectrum

  Estimation","29 pages; 5 figures; 4 tables",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper addresses the task of estimating a covariance matrix under a
patternless sparsity assumption. In contrast to existing approaches based on
thresholding or shrinkage penalties, we propose a likelihood-based method that
regularizes the distance from the covariance estimate to a symmetric sparsity
set. This formulation avoids unwanted shrinkage induced by more common norm
penalties and enables optimization of the resulting non-convex objective by
solving a sequence of smooth, unconstrained subproblems. These subproblems are
generated and solved via the proximal distance version of the
majorization-minimization principle. The resulting algorithm executes rapidly,
gracefully handles settings where the number of parameters exceeds the number
of cases, yields a positive definite solution, and enjoys desirable convergence
properties. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing
methods by several metrics across a suite of simulated experiments. Its merits
are illustrated on an international migration dataset and a classic case study
on flow cytometry. Our findings suggest that the marginal and conditional
dependency networks for the cell signalling data are more similar than
previously concluded.

magnetic domain walls and skyrmions, originating from the interplay between an
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya interaction (DMI) and a perpendicular
magnetic field. Although conventional interfacial DMI favors chiral N\'eel
skyrmions, it does not break the energetic symmetry of the two Bloch
chiralities in mixed Bloch$-$N\'eel skyrmions. However, the energy barrier to
switching between Bloch chiralities does depend on the sense of rotation, which
is dictated by the direction of the driving field. Our analytical and
micromagnetic analyses of steady-state Dzyaloshinskii domain wall dynamics
culminates in a switching diagram akin to the Stoner$-$Wohlfarth astroid,
revealing the existence of achiral, chiral, and precessional Bloch regimes; we
further show that in view of established energetic models, skyrmions should
exhibit the same fundamental behavior. Finally, we discuss a recent theory of
vertical Bloch line$-$mediated deterministic Bloch chirality in the
precessional regime and extend these arguments to lower driving fields. This
work establishes that the Bloch chirality of magnetic solitons can be switched
on demand with applied fields, as indicated by the Dzyaloshinskii astroid.

a spatial dimension on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the

extracted by using the Abel-Plana summation formula. The mean energy-momentum
tensor is diagonal and the vacuum stresses along the direction perpendicular to
the AdS boundary and along the cosmic string are equal to the energy density.
All the components are even periodic functions of the magnetic fluxes inside
the string core and enclosed by compact dimension, with the period equal to the
flux quantum. The vacuum energy density can be either positive or negative,
depending on the values of the parameters and the distance from the string. The
topological contributions in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor vanish on
the AdS boundary. Near the string the effects of compactification and
gravitational field are weak and the leading term in the asymptotic expansion
coincides with the corresponding VEV in (4+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
At large distances, the decay of the cosmic string induced contribution in the
vacuum energy-momentum tensor, as a function of the proper distance from the
string, follows a power law. For a cosmic string in the Minkowski bulk and for
massive fields the corresponding fall off is exponential. Within the framework

as Uncitedness. This paper traces brief history of the concept of uncitedness
sprouted first in 1964 in an article entitled Cybernetics, homeostasis and a
model of disease by Gerson Jacobs. The concept of uncitedness was
scientometrically first explained by Garfield in 1970. The uncitedness of
twelve esteemed Indian physics and astronomy journals over a twelve years'
(2009-2020) time span is analysed here. Besides Uncitedness Factor (UF), three
other indicators are introduced here, viz. Citation per paper per Year (CY),
h-core Density (HD) and Time-normalised h-index (TH). The journal-wise
variational patterns of these four indicators, i.e. UF, CY, HD and TH and the
relationships of UF with other three indicators are analysed. The calculated
numerical values of these indicators are observed to formulate seven
hypotheses, which are tested by F-Test method. The average annual rate of
change of uncited paper is found 67% of total number of papers. The indicator
CY is found temporally constant. The indicator HD is found nearly constant
journal-wise over the entire time span, while the indicator TH is found nearly
constant for all journals. The UF inversely varies with CY and TH for the
journals and directly varies with TH over the years. Except few highly reputed
Indian journals in physics and astronomy, majority other journals face the
situation of uncitedness. The uncitedness of Indian journals in this field
outshines the same for global journals by 12%, which indicates lack of
circulation and timely reach of research communication to the relevant

incident photon energy is up-converted to the multiples of its initial energy.
In solids, under the influence of a strong laser field, electron-hole (e-h)
pairs are generated and subsequently driven to high energy and momentum within
a fraction of the optical cycle. These dynamics encode the band structure,
including non-trivial topological properties of the source material, through
both intraband current and interband polarization, into the high harmonic
spectrum. In the course of this process, dephasing between the driven electron
and the hole can significantly reduce the HHG efficiency. Here, we exploit this
feature and turn it into a measurement of e-h coherence in strongly driven
solids. Utilizing a pre-pump pulse, we first photodope monolayer molybdenum
disulfide and then examine the HHG induced by an intense infrared pulse. We
observe clear suppression of the HH intensity, which becomes more pronounced
with increasing order. Based on quantum simulations, we attribute this
monotonic order dependence as a signature of ultrafast electron-hole dephasing,
which leads to an exponential decay of the inter-band polarization,
proportional to the sub-cycle excursion time of the e-h pair. Our results
demonstrate the importance of many-body effects, such as density-dependent
decoherence in HHG and provide a novel platform to probe electron-hole
coherence in strongly driven systems.

the design of mutation-proof vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. We integrate
the genotyping of 1,489,884 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolates, 130 human antibodies,
tens of thousands of mutational data points, topological data analysis, and
deep learning to reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolution mechanism and forecast emerging

antibody-disruptive co-mutations on the S protein RBD can quantitatively
explain the infectivity and virulence of all prevailing variants. We
demonstrate that Lambda is as infectious as Delta but is more

time-varying currents on the form drag and vortex dynamics of submerged 3D
topography in a stratified rotating environment. The current is of the form
$U_c+U_t \sin(2\pi f_t t)$, where $U_c$ is the mean, $U_t$ is the tidal
component and $f_t$ is its frequency. A conical obstacle is considered in the
regime of low Froude number. When tides are absent, eddies are shed at the
natural shedding frequency $f_{s,c}$. The relative frequency $f^*=f_{s,c}/f_t$
is varied in a parametric study which reveals states of high time-averaged form
drag coefficient. There is a two-fold amplification of the form drag
coefficient relative to the no-tide ($U_t=0$) case when $f^*$ lies between 0.5
and 1. The spatial organization of the near-wake vortices in the high drag
states is different from a K\'arm\'an vortex street. For instance, the vortex
shedding from the obstacle is symmetric when $f^*=5/12$ and strongly asymmetric
when $f^*=5/6$. The increase in form drag with increasing $f^*$ stems from
bottom intensification of the pressure in the obstacle lee which is linked to
changes in flow separation and near-wake vortices.

following two inter-related public health challenges. (1) Inference Challenge:
assuming that there are $N$ census blocks (nodes) in the city, and given an
initial infection at any set of nodes, what is the probability for a subset of
census blocks to become infected by the time the spread of the infection burst
is stabilized? (2) Prevention Challenge: What is the minimal control action one
can take to minimize the infected part of the stabilized state footprint? To
answer the challenges, we build a Graphical Model of pandemic of the attractive
Ising (pair-wise, binary) type, where each node represents a census track and
each edge factor represents the strength of the pairwise interaction between a
pair of nodes. We show that almost all attractive Ising Models on dense graphs
result in either of the two modes for the most probable state: either all nodes
which were not infected initially became infected, or all the initially
uninfected nodes remain uninfected. This bi-modal solution of the Inference
Challenge allows us to re-state the Prevention Challenge as the following
tractable convex programming: for the bare Ising Model with pair-wise and bias
factors representing the system without prevention measures, such that the MAP
state is fully infected for at least one of the initial infection patterns,
find the closest, in $l_1$ norm, set of factors resulting in all the MAP states

safe.

determination of the spin-wave spectra and -dispersion in magnetic systems
where analytic theories are not yet available. Micromagnetic simulations can be
used to compute the spatial profiles and oscillation frequencies of spin-waves
in magnetic system with almost arbitrary geometry and different magnetic
interactions. Although numerical approaches are very versatile, they often do
not give the same insight and physical understanding as analytical theories.
For example, it is not always possible to decide whether a certain feature
(such as dispersion asymmetry, for example) is governed by one magnetic
interaction or the other. Moreover, since numerical approaches typically yield
the normal modes of the system, it is not always feasible to disentangle
hybridized modes. In this manuscript, we build a bridge between numerics and
analytics by presenting a methodology to calculate the individual contributions
to general spin-wave dispersions in a fully numerical manner. We discuss the
general form of any spin-wave dispersion in terms of the effective (stiffness)
fields produced by the modes. Based on a special type of micromagnetic
simulations, the numerical dynamic-matrix approach, we show how to calculate
each stiffness field in the respective dispersion law, separately for each
magnetic interaction. In particular, it becomes possible to disentangle
contributions of different magnetic interactions to the dispersion asymmetry in
systems where non-reciprocity is present. At the same time, dipolar-hybridized
modes can be easily disentangled. Since this method is independent of the
geometry or the involved magnetic interactions at hand, we believe it is
attractive for experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic systems where
there are no analytics yet, but also to aid the development of new analytical

actively star-forming cores known, yet constraints on the total stellar mass of
this system are highly uncertain. We have therefore carried out deep optical
and infrared observations of this system, probing rest-frame ultraviolet to
infrared wavelengths. Using the positions of the spectroscopically-confirmed
protocluster members, we identify counterparts and perform detailed source
deblending, allowing us to fit spectral energy distributions in order to
estimate stellar masses. We show that the galaxies in SPT2349$-$56 have stellar
masses proportional to their high star-formation rates, consistent with other
protocluster galaxies and field submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) around redshift
4. The galaxies in SPT2349$-$56 have on average lower molecular gas-to-stellar
mass fractions and depletion timescales than field SMGs, although with
considerable scatter. We construct the stellar-mass function for SPT2349$-$56
and compare it to the stellar-mass function of $z\,{=}\,1$ galaxy clusters,
finding consistent shapes between the two. We measure rest-frame galaxy
ultraviolet half-light radii from our HST-F160W imaging, finding that on
average the galaxies in our sample are similar in size to typical star-forming
galaxies at these redshifts. However, the brightest HST-detected galaxy in our
sample, found near the luminosity-weighted centre of the protocluster core,
remains unresolved at this wavelength. Hydrodynamical simulations predict that
the core galaxies will quickly merge into a brightest cluster galaxy, thus our
observations provide a direct view of the early formation mechanisms of this
class of object.

the quantum computing systems operating at cryogenic temperatures with room
temperature electronics and media for high data-rate communication. Current
approaches to control and readout of such cryogenic computing systems use
electrical cables, which prevent scalability due to their large size, heat
conduction, and limited bandwidth1. A more viable approach is to use optical
fibers which allow high-capacity transmission and thermal isolation. A key
component in implementing photonic datalinks is a cryogenic optical modulator
for converting data from the electrical to the optical domain at high speed and
with low power consumption, while operating at temperatures of 4 K or lower.
Cryogenic modulators based on the electro-optic effect have been demonstrated
in a variety of material platforms, however they are voltage driven components
while superconducting circuits are current based, resulting in a large
impedance mismatch. Here, we present the first demonstration of an integrated
current-driven modulator based on the magneto-optic effect operating over a
wide temperature range that extends down to less than 4 K. The modulator works
at data rates up to 2 Gbps with energy consumption below 4 pJ/bit, and we show
that this figure can be reduced to less than 40 fJ/bit with optimized design
and fabrication. This modulator is a hybrid device, where a current-driven
magneto-optically active crystal (cerium substituted yttrium iron garnet, or
Ce:YIG) is bonded to a high-quality silicon microring resonator. Because of its
potential for extremely low power consumption under cryogenic conditions, the

rewrite by further pre-training BART on both an existing collection of generic
paraphrases, as well as on synthetic pairs created using a general-purpose

train two models, each in a transfer direction, so that they can provide each
other with synthetically generated pairs, dynamically in the training process.
Lastly, we let our best reresulting model generate static synthetic pairs to be

  At the receiver, a four channel loud speaker (LS) setup is used for spatial

chosen virtual listener position in the transmitter enclosure. Vector base
amplitude panning (VBAP) method is used for direct component reproduction using
the LS setup and the diffuse component is reproduced equally from all the loud

tables continue to be the focus of a great deal of both theoretical and
empirical research. A central reason for this is that many of the fundamental
properties that one desires from a hash table are difficult to achieve
simultaneously; thus many variants offering different trade-offs have been
proposed.
  This paper introduces Iceberg hashing, a hash table that simultaneously
offers the strongest known guarantees on a large number of core properties.
Iceberg hashing supports constant-time operations while improving on the state
of the art for space efficiency, cache efficiency, and low failure probability.
Iceberg hashing is also the first hash table to support a load factor of up to
$1 - o(1)$ while being stable, meaning that the position where an element is
stored only ever changes when resizes occur. In fact, in the setting where keys
are $\Theta(\log n)$ bits, the space guarantees that Iceberg hashing offers,
namely that is uses at most $\log \binom{|U|}{n} + O(n \log \log n)$ bits to
store $n$ items from a universe $U$, matches a lower bound by Demaine et al.
that applies to any stable hash table.
  Iceberg hashing introduces new general-purpose techniques for some of the
most basic aspects of hash-table design. Notably, our indirection-free
technique for dynamic resizing, which we call waterfall addressing, and our
techniques for achieving stability and very-high probability guarantees, can be
applied to any hash table that makes use of the front-yard/backyard paradigm

performs sequence modeling on the dynamic entity embeddings to solve the

Temporal Graph Neural Network that generates dynamic entity embeddings in the

probability model and has low computation complexity in both training and
inference. SeDyT is compatible with most Temporal Graph Neural Networks and
sequence models. We also design an efficient training method that trains the
two components in one gradient descent propagation. We evaluate the performance

especially self-attention, plays a vital role in the global correlation
discovery. However, is hand-crafted attention irreplaceable when modeling the
global context? Our intriguing finding is that self-attention is not better
than the matrix decomposition (MD) model developed 20 years ago regarding the
performance and computational cost for encoding the long-distance dependencies.
We model the global context issue as a low-rank recovery problem and show that
its optimization algorithms can help design global information blocks. This
paper then proposes a series of Hamburgers, in which we employ the optimization
algorithms for solving MDs to factorize the input representations into
sub-matrices and reconstruct a low-rank embedding. Hamburgers with different
MDs can perform favorably against the popular global context module
self-attention when carefully coping with gradients back-propagated through
MDs. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in the vision tasks where it is
crucial to learn the global context, including semantic segmentation and image
generation, demonstrating significant improvements over self-attention and its
variants.

address these issues, we propose Subword Mapping and Anchoring across Languages

subword alignments using an unsupervised state-of-the-art mapping technique and
uses them to create cross-lingual anchors based on subword similarities. We
demonstrate the benefits of SMALA for cross-lingual natural language inference

$\mathcal{O}_\lambda$ inside the Lie algebra of $n \times n$ skew-Hermitian
matrices. We use the orbit context to study the totally nonnegative part of a
partial flag variety from an algebraic, geometric, and dynamical perspective.
The paper has three main parts:
  (1) We introduce the totally nonnegative part of $\mathcal{O}_\lambda$, and
describe it explicitly in several cases. We define a twist map on it, which
generalizes (in type $A$) a map of Bloch, Flaschka, and Ratiu (1990) on an
isospectral manifold of Jacobi matrices.
  (2) We study gradient flows on $\mathcal{O}_\lambda$ which preserve
positivity, working in three natural Riemannian metrics. In the K\""ahler
metric, positivity is preserved in many cases of interest, extending results of
Galashin, Karp, and Lam (2017, 2019). In the normal metric, positivity is
essentially never preserved on a generic orbit. In the induced metric, whether
positivity is preserved appears to depends on the spacing of the eigenvalues
defining the orbit.
  (3) We present two applications. First, we discuss the topology of totally
nonnegative flag varieties and amplituhedra. Galashin, Karp, and Lam (2017,
2019) showed that the former are homeomorphic to closed balls, and we interpret
their argument in the orbit framework. We also show that a new family of
amplituhedra, which we call twisted Vandermonde amplituhedra, are homeomorphic
to closed balls. Second, we discuss the symmetric Toda flow on
$\mathcal{O}_\lambda$. We show that it preserves positivity, and that on the
totally nonnegative part, it is a gradient flow in the K\""ahler metric up to
applying the twist map. This extends a result of Bloch, Flaschka, and Ratiu
(1990).

transition, confinement-deconfinement and Higgs magnetization. Here they are
explored through two order parameters, the Coulomb magnetization which is a
local order parameter for confinement, and a replica-based gauge-invariant
order parameter which tracks the Higgs transition in a way similar to
Landau-gauge magnetization. Minimal Coulomb gauge is set exactly, using the
polynomial-time minimum-weight matching algorithm of Edmonds. This is a
tremendous speed improvement over relaxation/annealing methods and completely
eliminates the systematic error. The replica-overlap is also an improvement
over relaxation methods for setting Landau gauge, in that it has an easily
controllable and measurable systematic error. These simulations show the phase
transitions not ending at the first-order endpoint but bifurcating near there
and continuing even through the expected analyticity region. The specific heat
critical exponents, $\alpha$, are highly negative, explaining the lack of
strong signals in the energy. Nevertheless, energy moments are seen to follow
curves consistent with the predictions from the order parameters, showing these
to be true thermal transitions, albeit weak ones. These results cast further
doubt on Fradkin-Shenker analyticity. They also suggest one or more new yet to
be explored phases in gauge-Higgs models in the bifurcated region.

because their inferred parameters can be used to generate hypotheses and design
experiments. This requires that the learned model provide an accurate
representation of the input data and yield a latent space that effectively
predicts outcomes relevant to the scientific question. Supervised Variational
Autoencoders (SVAEs) have previously been used for this purpose, where a
carefully designed decoder can be used as an interpretable generative model
while the supervised objective ensures a predictive latent representation.
Unfortunately, the supervised objective forces the encoder to learn a biased
approximation to the generative posterior distribution, which renders the
generative parameters unreliable when used in scientific models. This issue has
remained undetected as reconstruction losses commonly used to evaluate model
performance do not detect bias in the encoder. We address this
previously-unreported issue by developing a second order supervision framework
(SOS-VAE) that influences the decoder to induce a predictive latent
representation. This ensures that the associated encoder maintains a reliable
generative interpretation. We extend this technique to allow the user to
trade-off some bias in the generative parameters for improved predictive
performance, acting as an intermediate option between SVAEs and our new
SOS-VAE. We also use this methodology to address missing data issues that often
arise when combining recordings from multiple scientific experiments. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of these developments using synthetic data and
electrophysiological recordings with an emphasis on how our learned
representations can be used to design scientific experiments.

and Lebowitz posed the question of whether such very small perturbations could
affect the macroscopic current. Different groups of physicists, using a range
of heuristics and numerical simulations reached opposing conclusions on whether
the critical value of $\varepsilon$ is 0. This was ultimately resolved
rigorously in Basu-Sidoravicius-Sly which established that $\varepsilon_c=0$.
  Here we study the effect of the current as $\varepsilon$ tends to 0 and in
doing so explain why it was so challenging to predict on the basis of numerical
simulations. In particularly we show that the current has an infinite order
phase transition at 0, with the effect of the perturbation tending to 0 faster
than any polynomial. Our proof focuses on the Last Passage Percolation
formulation of TASEP where a slow bond corresponds to reinforcing the diagonal.
We give a multiscale analysis to show that when $\varepsilon$ is small the
effect of reinforcement remains small compared to the difference between
optimal and near optimal geodesics. Since geodesics can be perturbed on many
different scales, we inductively bound the tails of the effect of reinforcement
by controlling the number of near optimal geodesics and giving new tail
estimates for the local time of (near) geodesics along the diagonal.

in the 21st century. Its importance in determining the health and living
standards in urban settings is only expected to increase with time. Various
factors ranging from artificial emissions to natural phenomena are known to be
primary causal agents or influencers behind rising air pollution levels.
However, the lack of large scale data involving the major artificial and
natural factors has hindered the research on the causes and relations governing
the variability of the different air pollutants. Through this work, we
introduce a large scale city-wise dataset for exploring the relationships among
these agents over a long period of time. We also introduce a transformer based
model - cosSquareFormer, for the problem of pollutant level estimation and
forecasting. Our model outperforms most of the benchmark models for this task.
We also analyze and explore the dataset through our model and other
methodologies to bring out important inferences which enable us to understand
the dynamics of the causal agents at a deeper level. Through our paper, we seek
to provide a great set of foundations for further research into this domain
that will demand critical attention of ours in the near future.

Therefore, potentially useful linguistic information is not accessible to

Speechformer, an architecture that, thanks to reduced memory usage in the

the rotational dynamics of the robot. In this paper, we aim to improve the
jumping performance by proposing a unified model for planning highly dynamic
jumps that can approximately model the centroidal inertia. This model abstracts
the robot as a single rigid body for the base and point masses for the legs.
The model is called the Lump Leg Single Rigid Body Model (LL-SRBM) and can be
used to plan motions for both bipedal and quadrupedal robots. By taking the
effects of leg dynamics into account, LL-SRBM provides a computationally
efficient way for the motion planner to change the centroidal inertia of the
robot with various leg configurations. Concurrently, we propose a novel contact
detection method by using the norm of the average spatial velocity. After the
contact is detected, the controller is switched to force control to achieve a
soft landing. Twisting jump and forward jump experiments on the bipedal robot
SLIDER and quadrupedal robot ANYmal demonstrate the improved jump performance
by actively changing the centroidal inertia. These experiments also show the
generalization and the robustness of the integrated planning and control
framework.

long-term evolution of young open clusters and their tidal streams, and how
such an effect influences the constraint of initial conditions by looking at
the present-day observations.
  Aims: OB stars are typically in binaries, have a strong wind mass loss during
the first few Myr, and many become black holes. These affect the dynamical
evolution of an open star cluster and impact its dissolution in a given
Galactic potential. We investigate the correlation between the mass of OB stars
and the observational properties of open clusters. Hyades-like star clusters
are well represented in the Solar neighborhood and thus allow comparisons with
observational data.
  Methods: We perform a large number of star-by-star numerical $N$-body
simulations of Hyades-like star clusters by using the high-performance $N$-body
code \textsc{petar} combined with \textsc{galpy}. We also developed the tool to
transfer the simulation data to mock observations of Gaia.
  Results: We find that OB stars and black holes have a major effect on star
cluster evolution. Star clusters with the same initial conditions, but a
different initial content of OB stars, follow very different evolutionary
paths. Thus, the initial total mass and radius of an observed star cluster
cannot be unambiguously determined unless the initial content of OB stars is
known. We show that the stellar counts in the corresponding tidal tails, that
can be identified in the Gaia data, help to resolve this issues. We thus
emphasise the importance of exploring not only star-clusters, but also their
corresponding tidal tails. These findings are relevant for studies of the
formation of massive stars.

to presenting an extensive analysis that identifies the bottlenecks towards
building competitive systems to ameliorate data scarcity, our study has several
key contributions, including, i) a large parallel corpus covering 22 Turkic
languages consisting of common public datasets in combination with new datasets
of approximately 2 million parallel sentences, ii) bilingual baselines for 26

permutations to estimate the Jaccard similarity in massive binary (0/1) data,
where $K$ can be (e.g.,) 1024 or even larger, depending on applications. The
recent work on C-MinHash (Li and Li, 2021) has shown, with rigorous proofs,
that only two permutations are needed. An initial permutation is applied to
break whatever structures which might exist in the data, and a second
permutation is re-used $K$ times to produce $K$ hashes, via a circulant
shifting fashion. (Li and Li, 2021) has proved that, perhaps surprisingly, even
though the $K$ hashes are correlated, the estimation variance is strictly
smaller than the variance of the traditional MinHash.
  It has been demonstrated in (Li and Li, 2021) that the initial permutation in
C-MinHash is indeed necessary. For the ease of theoretical analysis, they have
used two independent permutations. In this paper, we show that one can actually
simply use one permutation. That is, one single permutation is used for both
the initial pre-processing step to break the structures in the data and the
circulant hashing step to generate $K$ hashes. Although the theoretical
analysis becomes very complicated, we are able to explicitly write down the
expression for the expectation of the estimator. The new estimator is no longer
unbiased but the bias is extremely small and has essentially no impact on the
estimation accuracy (mean square errors). An extensive set of experiments are
provided to verify our claim for using just one permutation.

of emission lines were used to derive the ionic and total neon and oxygen
abundances through electron temperature estimations ($T_{e}$-method). For the
neon, abundance estimates were obtained by using both $T_{e}$-method and
IR-method. Based on photoionization model results, we found a lower electron
temperature [$t_{e}([Ne III])$] for the gas phase where the Ne$^{2+}$ is
located in comparison with $t_{3}$ for the O$^{2+}$ ion. We find that the
differences (D) between Ne$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$ ionic abundances calculated from
IR-method and $T_{e}-$method (assuming $t_{3}$ in the Ne$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$

they are reduced by a mean factor of $\sim3$ when $t_{e}([Ne III])$ is
considered. We propose a semi-empirical Ionization Correction Factor (ICF) for
the neon, based on [Ne II]12.81$\mu$m, [\ion{Ne}{iii}]15.56$\mu$m and oxygen
ionic abundance ratios. We find that the average Ne/H abundance for the Seyfert

the very high metallicity regime (i.e. [$12+log(O/H) > 8.80$]) an increase in

general epidemic spread models including SIS/SIR/SEIR and a new model of
COVID-19 transmissions. By fitting the real data in New York State to our
framework, we found that the optimal stabilizing vaccine allocation policy
suggests offering vaccines priority to locations where there are more
susceptible people and where the residents spend longer time outside the home.
Besides, we found that offering vaccines priority to young adults (20-29) and
middle-age adults (20-44) can minimize the cumulative infected cases and the
death cases. Moreover, we compared our method with five age-stratified
strategies in \cite{bubar2021model} based on their epidemics model. We also
found it's better to offer vaccine priorities to young people to curb the
disease and minimize the deaths when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is
moderately above one, which describes the most world during COVID-19. Such
phenomenon has been ignored in \cite{bubar2021model}.

personal data facilitate the application of algorithmic personalized pricing.
However, this leads to the growing concern of potential violation of privacy
due to adversarial attack. To address the privacy issue, this paper studies a
dynamic personalized pricing problem with \textit{unknown} nonparametric demand
models under data privacy protection. Two concepts of data privacy, which have
been widely applied in practices, are introduced: \textit{central differential
privacy (CDP)} and \textit{local differential privacy (LDP)}, which is proved
to be stronger than CDP in many cases. We develop two algorithms which make
pricing decisions and learn the unknown demand on the fly, while satisfying the
CDP and LDP gurantees respectively. In particular, for the algorithm with CDP
guarantee, the regret is proved to be at most $\tilde
O(T^{(d+2)/(d+4)}+\varepsilon^{-1}T^{d/(d+4)})$. Here, the parameter $T$
denotes the length of the time horizon, $d$ is the dimension of the
personalized information vector, and the key parameter $\varepsilon>0$ measures
the strength of privacy (smaller $\varepsilon$ indicates a stronger privacy
protection). On the other hand, for the algorithm with LDP guarantee, its
regret is proved to be at most $\tilde
O(\varepsilon^{-2/(d+2)}T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$, which is near-optimal as we prove a
lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2/(d+2)}T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ for any

better than the mean model. Multi-model projections of future climate

the study region are downscaled by the LARS-WG5 model. Uncertainty among the
projections is evaluated from three perspectives: large-scale climate scenarios
downscaled values, and mean decadal changes. 15 GCMs unanimously project an
increasing trend in the temperature for the study region. Also, uncertainty in
the projections for the summer months is greater than projection uncertainty
for other months. The mean absolute surface temperature increase for the three
periods is projected to be about 0.8{\deg}C, 2.4{\deg}C, and 3.8{\deg}C in the
summers, respectively. The uncertainty of the multi-model projections for
precipitation in summer seasons, and the radiation in the springs and falls is
higher than other seasons for the study region. Model projections indicate that
for the three future periods and relative to their baseline period, springtime
precipitation will decrease about 5\%, 10\%, and 20\%, and springtime radiation
will increase about 0.5\%, 1.5\%, and 3\%, respectively. The projected mean
decadal changes indicate an increase in temperature and radiation and a
decrease in precipitation. Furthermore, the performance of the GCMs in
simulating the baseline climate by the MOTP method does not indicate any
distinct pattern among the GCMs for the study region.

efforts have attempted to extend the LL phenomenology to two dimensions (2D),
especially in models of closely packed arrays of 1D quantum wires, each being
described as a LL. Such coupled-wire models have been successfully used to
construct 2D anisotropic non-Fermi liquids, quantum Hall states, topological
phases, and quantum spin liquids. However, an experimental demonstration of
high-quality arrays of 1D LLs suitable for realizing these models remains
absent. Here we report the experimental realization of 2D arrays of 1D LLs with
crystalline quality in a moir\'e superlattice made of twisted bilayer tungsten
ditelluride (tWTe$_{2}$). Originating from the anisotropic lattice of the
monolayer, the moir\'e pattern of tWTe$_{2}$ hosts identical, parallel 1D
electronic channels, separated by a fixed nanoscale distance, which is tunable
by the interlayer twist angle. At a twist angle of ~ 5 degrees, we find that
hole-doped tWTe$_{2}$ exhibits exceptionally large transport anisotropy with a
resistance ratio of ~ 1000 between two orthogonal in-plane directions. The
across-wire conductance exhibits power-law scaling behaviors, consistent with
the formation of a 2D anisotropic phase that resembles an array of LLs. Our
results open the door for realizing a variety of correlated and topological
quantum phases based on coupled-wire models and LL physics.

Existing graph generators fail to simultaneously simulate the relationships

Motivated by this limitation, we propose GenCAT, an attributed graph generator
for controlling those relationships, which has the following advantages. (i)
GenCAT generates graphs with user-specified node degrees and flexibly controls
the relationship between nodes and labels by incorporating the connection
proportion for each node to classes. (ii) Generated attribute values follow
user-specified distributions, and users can flexibly control the correlation
between the attributes and labels. (iii) Graph generation scales linearly to
the number of edges. GenCAT is the first generator to support all three of
these practical features. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
GenCAT can efficiently generate high-quality complex attributed graphs with
user-controlled relationships between labels, attributes, and topology.

effectiveness in compressing large-scale pre-trained models. In typical KD
methods, the small student model is trained to match the soft targets generated
by the big teacher model. However, the interaction between student and teacher
is one-way. The teacher is usually fixed once trained, resulting in static soft
targets to be distilled. This one-way interaction leads to the teacher's
inability to perceive the characteristics of the student and its training
progress. To address this issue, we propose Interactive Knowledge Distillation
(IKD), which also allows the teacher to learn to teach from the feedback of the
student. In particular, IKD trains the teacher model to generate specific soft
target at each training step for a certain student. Joint optimization for both
teacher and student is achieved by two iterative steps: a course step to
optimize student with the soft target of teacher, and an exam step to optimize
teacher with the feedback of student. IKD is a general framework that is
orthogonal to most existing knowledge distillation methods. Experimental
results show that IKD outperforms traditional KD methods on various NLP tasks.

hardware-efficient universal quantum computing. Specifically, in the limit of
strong two-photon drivings, phase-flip errors of the cat-state qubits are
effectively suppressed, leaving only a bit-flip error to be corrected. Because
this dominant error commutes with the evolution operator, our protocol
preserves the error bias, and, thus, can lower the code-capacity threshold for
error correction. A geometric evolution guarantees the robustness of the
protocol against stochastic noise along the evolution path. Moreover, by
changing detunings of the cavity-cavity couplings at a proper time, the
protocol can be robust against parameter imperfections (e.g., the total
evolution time) without introducing extra noises into the system. As a result,
the gate can produce multi-mode entangled cat states in a short time with high
fidelities.

2040-2064. The projections are calculated by assuming that current emissions
conditions of O3 precursors remain constant in the future. The employed O3
metrics include the number of days exceeding one-hour (1-hr) (120 ppb) and
eight-hour (8-hr) (75 ppb) O3 standards and the number of days exceeding 8-hr

intent classification, dialog state tracking, and natural language generation.
A sequence-to-sequence model (T5) is adopted to solve these three tasks in a
unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on these ToD tasks in
realistic few-shot learning scenarios with small validation data. Empirical
results demonstrate that the proposed CINS approach consistently improves
techniques that finetune PLMs with raw input or short prompts.

Furthermore, numerical simulations based on QHT are more efficient than fully
quantum mechanical approaches, as exemplified by time-dependent density
functional theory using a jellium model. However, QHT involves kinetic energy
functionals, the practical implementation of which typically induces
significant numerical instabilities, particularly in nonlinear optical
phenomena. To mitigate this problem, we develop a numerical solution to QHT
that is quite stable, even in a nonlinear regime. The key to our approach is to
rewrite the dynamical equation of QHT using the effective Schr\""odinger
equation. We apply the new method to the linear and nonlinear responses of a
metallic nanoparticle and compare the results with fully quantum mechanical
calculations. The results demonstrate the numerical stability of our method, as
well as the reliability and limitations of QHT.

emerging ideas. One result of this tension is the formation of new
compositions, such that existing linguistic units can be combined with emerging
items into novel expressions. We develop a framework that exploits the
cognitive mechanisms of chaining and multimodal knowledge to predict emergent
compositional expressions through time. We present the syntactic frame
extension model (SFEM) that draws on the theory of chaining and knowledge from
""percept"", ""concept"", and ""language"" to infer how verbs extend their frames to
form new compositions with existing and novel nouns. We evaluate SFEM
rigorously on the 1) modalities of knowledge and 2) categorization models of
chaining, in a syntactically parsed English corpus over the past 150 years. We
show that multimodal SFEM predicts newly emerged verb syntax and arguments
substantially better than competing models using purely linguistic or unimodal
knowledge. We find support for an exemplar view of chaining as opposed to a
prototype view and reveal how the joint approach of multimodal chaining may be
fundamental to the creation of literal and figurative language uses including
metaphor and metonymy.

model checking. When the Mealy machine violates the specification, the model
checker returns an input witnessing the specification violation of the Mealy

the BBC for CPSs, equivalence testing tends to be time-consuming due to the

tensor, and dispersion relations are recapitulated. Corresponding refractive
indices are achieved in terms of the frequency and the vector-valued background
field. For a purely timelike background, the refractive indices are real. Their
associated propagation modes are circularly polarized and exhibit
birefringence. For a purely spacelike background, one refractive index is
always real and the other can be complex. The circularly polarized propagating

Subsequently, we examine a dimension-five MCFJ-type electrodynamics, previously
scrutinized in the literature, in a continuous medium. Following the same
procedure, we find the refractive indices from a sixth-order dispersion
equation. For a purely timelike background, three distinct refractive indices
are obtained, one of them being real and two being complex. They are associated

dichroism, depending on the frequency range. Scenarios of propagation and
absorption analogous to those found in dispersive dielectrics are also observed

tracking velocimetry (PTV). The results reveal the direct linkage among vortex
structures in atmospheric turbulence, the spatial distribution of snow particle
concentration, and their settling dynamics. In particular, with snow turbulence
interaction at near-critical Stokes number, the settling velocity enhancement
of snow particles is multifold, and larger than what has been observed in
previous field studies. SLPIV measurements show higher concentration of snow
particles preferentially located on the downward side of the vortices
identified in the atmospheric flow field. PTV, performed on high resolution
images around the reconstructed vortices, confirms the latter trend and
provides statistical evidence of the acceleration of snow particles, as they
move toward the downward side of vortices. Overall, the simultaneous
multi-scale particle imaging presented here enables us to directly quantify the

mechanism of snow settling enhancement in the atmospheric surface layer.

theories, we need precise measurements of both the mean value and the scatter
of epsilon_ff, but high-precision measurements have been difficult because they
require determining cloud volume densities, from which we can calculate
free-fall times. Until recently, most density estimates assume clouds as
uniform spheres, while their real structures are often filamentary and highly
non-uniform, yielding systematic errors in epsilon_ff estimates and smearing
real cloud-to-cloud variations. We recently developed a theoretical model to
reduce this error by using column density distributions in clouds to produce
more accurate volume density estimates. In this letter, we apply this model to
recent observations of 12 nearby molecular clouds. Compared to earlier
analyses, our method reduces the typical dispersion of epsilon_ff within
individual clouds from 0.35 dex to 0.31 dex, and decreases the median value of
epsilon_ff over all clouds from ~ 0.02 to ~ 0.01. However, we find no

the spin-singlet channel with enhanced $T_c$, that scales with the

Here, we demonstrate the topological phase transitions in the system via the
numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo method. Without prior assumptions, our
unbiased real-space calculation shows that spin-orbit coupling can stabilize an
unconventional pairing in the weak SOC regime, in which the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing coexists with the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing. Furthermore, we use the jumps in the spin
polarization at the time-reversal invariant momenta to qualify the topological
phase transition, where we find the critical exponent deviated from the
mean-field theory. Our results pave the way for the searching of unconventional
pairing and topological superfluids with degenerate Fermi gases.

self-adjoint operator $V,$ the functions $r_j(z) = - \sigma_j^{-1}(z),$ where
$\sigma_j(z)$ are eigenvalues of the compact operator $(H_0-z)^{-1}V,$ bear a
lot of important information about the pair $H_0$ and $V.$ We call them
coupling resonances. In case of rank one (and positive) perturbation $V,$ there
is only one coupling resonance function, which is a Herglotz function. This
case has been studied in depth in the literature, and appears in different
situations, such as Sturm-Liouville theory, random Schr\""odinger operators,
harnomic and spectral analyses, etc. The general case is complicated by the
fact that the resonance functions are no longer single valued holomorphic
functions, and potentially can have quite an erratic behaviour, typical for
infinitely-valued holomorphic functions. Of special interest are those coupling
resonance functions $r_z$ which approach a real number $r_{\lambda+i0}$ from
the interval $[0,1]$ as the spectral parameter $z=\lambda+iy$ approaches a
point $\lambda$ of the essential spectrum, since they are responsible for
spectral flow through $\lambda$ inside essential spectrum when $H_0$ gets
deformed to $H_1 = H_0+V$ via the path $H_0 + rV, r \in [0,1].$
  In this paper it is shown that if the pair $H_0,$ $V$ satisfies the limiting
absorption principle, then the coupling resonance functions are well-behaved
near the essential spectrum in the following sense. Let $I$ be an open interval
inside the essential spectrum of $H_0$ and $\epsilon>0.$ Then there exists a
compact subset~$K$ of~$I$ such that $| I \setminus K | < \epsilon,$ and $K$ has
a ""non-tangential"" neighbourhood in the upper complex half-plane, such that any
coupling resonance function is either single-valued in the neighbourhood, or
does not take a real value in the interval $[0,1].$

physics models that learn to predict physical interaction outcomes, they mostly
focus on generating short sequences of future frames based on physical
properties (e.g. mass, friction and velocity) extracted from visual inputs or a
latent space. However, there is a lack of intuitive physics models that are
tested on long physical interaction sequences with multiple interactions among
different objects. We hypothesize that selective temporal attention during

Interaction Prediction via Mental Simulation with Span Selection (PIP). It
utilizes a deep generative model to model approximate mental simulations by
generating future frames of physical interactions before employing selective
temporal attention in the form of span selection for predicting physical
interaction outcomes. To evaluate our model, we further propose the large-scale

the existing unsupervised methods are: (i) distinguishing between normal and

the representation learner can gradually learn more informative representation

displacement vector between two consecutive frames of point clouds or images,
which has important application in fields such as service robots and autonomous
driving. Although many previous works have explored greatly on scene flow
estimation based on point clouds, there are two problems that have not been
noticed or well solved before: 1) Points of adjacent frames in repetitive
patterns may be wrongly associated due to similar spatial structure in their
neighbourhoods; 2) Scene flow between adjacent frames of point clouds with
long-distance movement may be inaccurately estimated. To solve the first
problem, a novel context-aware set convolution layer is proposed in this paper
to exploit contextual structure information of Euclidean space and learn soft
aggregation weights for local point features. This design is inspired by human
perception of contextual structure information during scene understanding with
repetitive patterns. The context-aware set convolution layer is incorporated in
a context-aware point feature pyramid module of 3D point clouds for scene flow
estimation. For the second problem, an explicit residual flow learning
structure is proposed in the residual flow refinement layer to cope with
long-distance movement. The experiments and ablation study on FlyingThings3D

component. The qualitative results show that the problems of ambiguous
inter-frame association and long-distance movement estimation are well handled.
Quantitative results on both FlyingThings3D and KITTI scene flow datasets show

In particular, instead of using a linear equation with increasing size to
represent multiple polynomial segments as in literature, we take a new
perspective from state-space representation such that the linear equation
reduces to a finite horizon control system with a fixed state dimension and the
required continuity conditions for consecutive polynomials are automatically
satisfied. Consequently, the constrained trajectory generation problem (both
with and without time optimization) can be converted to a discrete-time
finite-horizon optimal control problem with inequality constraints, which can
be approached by a recently developed interior-point DDP (IPDDP) algorithm.
Furthermore, for unconstrained trajectory generation with preallocated time, we
show that this problem is indeed a linear-quadratic tracking (LQT) problem (DDP
algorithm with exact one iteration). All these algorithms enjoy linear
complexity with respect to the number of segments. Both numerical comparisons

scale separation represents a significant challenge to meet the critical
requirements on computational scalability and efficiency -- adopting a mesh
fine enough to fully account for the small-scale heterogeneities leads to
prohibitive computational costs while simply ignoring these fine
heterogeneities tends to drastically over-stiffen the structure's rigidity.
  This study proposes an approach to construct new material-aware shape (basis)
functions per element on a coarse discretization of the structure with respect
to each curved bridge nodes (CBNs) defined along the elements' boundaries.
Instead of formulating their derivation by solving a nonlinear optimization
problem, the shape functions are constructed by building a map from the CBNs to
the interior nodes and are ultimately presented in an explicit matrix form as a
product of a B\'ezier interpolation transformation and a boundary-interior
transformation. The CBN shape function accomodates more flexibility in closely
capturing the coarse element's heterogeneity, overcomes the important and
challenging issues of inter-element stiffness and displacement discontinuity
across interface between coarse elements, and improves the analysis accuracy by
orders of magnitude; they also meet the basic geometric properties of shape
functions that avoid aphysical analysis results. Extensive numerical examples,
including a 3D industrial example of billions of degrees of freedom, are also
tested to demonstrate the approach's performance in comparison with results
obtained from classical approaches.

challenging in non-Hermitian systems due to the change of state norm. To tackle
this problem, we modify the two-point measurement method in Hermitian systems.
The modified method can be applied to non-Hermitian systems which are Hermitian
before and after the evolution. In Hermitian systems, our method is equivalent
to the two-point measurement method. When the system is non-Hermitian, our
results represent a projection of the statistics in a larger Hermitian system.
As an example, we calculate the work statistics in a non-Hermitian
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our results reveal several differences between the

important role for ascertaining Majorana fermions. The edge states, which also
have almost-zero-energy in one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain (SSHc),
have been extensively studied for their topologically protected properties when
the on-sites have dissipations induced by independent environments. We here
show that common environments shared by each pair of the nearest neighbour
sites in the SSHc can result in dissipative couplings between sites, and thus
change topologically trivial phase to nontrivial one. The Majorana-like
oscillation for the finite-size hybridizations of two non-Hermitian edge states
with complex localization lengths can be induced by the dissipative coupling.
The controllable topology parameter of the SSHc plays the role of the magnetic
field in the nanowire for controlling Majorana oscillation. The measurement for
the oscillation is proposed. Our study provides a new way to manipulate edge
states and is experimentally feasible within current technology of
superconducting quantum circuits.

We find that local differences between rotational velocity and the azimuthally

Perseus spiral arms, with pitch angles of 9.12$^{\circ}$ and 7.76$^{\circ}$,

kinematic spiral is located behind the Perseus arm and appears as a distortion
in rotation velocities left by this massive arm but with no known counterpart

semi-definite (PSD) cone projection operator per iteration is expensive, due to
the required full matrix eigen-decomposition. In this paper, leveraging a
recent linear algebraic theorem called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment
(GDPA), we unroll a projection-free algorithm for semi-definite programming
relaxation (SDR) of a binary graph classifier, where the PSD cone constraint is
replaced by a set of ""tightest possible"" linear constraints per iteration. As a
result, each iteration only requires computing a linear program (LP) and one
extreme eigenvector. Inside the unrolled network, we optimize parameters via
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that determine graph edge weights in two
ways: i) a metric matrix that computes feature distances, and ii) a sparse

one key engine is the increasing size of training data. For example, the
largest face dataset, WebFace42M contains about 2 million identities and 42
million faces. However, a massive number of faces raise the constraints in
training time, computing resources, and memory cost. The current research on
this problem mainly focuses on designing an efficient Fully-connected layer
(FC) to reduce GPU memory consumption caused by a large number of identities.
In this work, we relax these constraints by resolving the redundancy problem of
the up-to-date face datasets caused by the greedily collecting operation (i.e.
the core-set selection perspective). As the first attempt in this perspective
on the face recognition problem, we find that existing methods are limited in
both performance and efficiency. For superior cost-efficiency, we contribute a
novel filtering strategy dubbed Face-NMS. Face-NMS works on feature space and
simultaneously considers the local and global sparsity in generating core sets.
In practice, Face-NMS is analogous to Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) in the
object detection community. It ranks the faces by their potential contribution
to the overall sparsity and filters out the superfluous face in the pairs with
high similarity for local sparsity. With respect to the efficiency aspect,
Face-NMS accelerates the whole pipeline by applying a smaller but sufficient
proxy dataset in training the proxy model. As a result, with Face-NMS, we
successfully scale down the WebFace42M dataset to 60% while retaining its
performance on the main benchmarks, offering a 40% resource-saving and 1.64

boost performance when adapting to a new domain. However, the costs associated
with pre-training raise an important question: given a fixed budget, what steps
should an NLP practitioner take to maximize performance? In this paper, we view
domain adaptation with a constrained budget as a consumer choice problem, where
the goal is to select an optimal combination of data annotation and
pre-training. We measure annotation costs of three procedural text datasets,
along with the pre-training costs of several in-domain language models. The
utility of different combinations of pre-training and data annotation are
evaluated under varying budget constraints to assess which combination strategy
works best. We find that for small budgets, spending all funds on annotation
leads to the best performance; once the budget becomes large enough, however, a
combination of data annotation and in-domain pre-training yields better
performance. Our experiments suggest task-specific data annotation should be
part of an economical strategy when adapting an NLP model to a new domain.

used for addressing the class imbalance problem, however, they are not
effective when there is label dependency besides class imbalance because they
result in oversampling of common labels. Here, we introduce the application of
balancing loss functions for multi-label text classification. We perform
experiments on a general domain dataset with 90 labels (Reuters-21578) and a
domain-specific dataset from PubMed with 18211 labels. We find that a
distribution-balanced loss function, which inherently addresses both the class
imbalance and label linkage problems, outperforms commonly used loss functions.

devices implemented in practice, for example, imperfect lasers, detectors and
unbalanced interferometers, the value of residual phase noise in current system

First, the quantum mechanics of individual particles scattered on a random
potential is discussed. The quantum-mechanical description is extended to
many-body systems by using many-body Green functions. The many-body approach is
used to derive the coherent-potential approximation and to show how it fits
into the dynamical mean-field theory. The generating functional of the
coherent-potential approximation is obtained in an analytic form from the limit
to infinite dimensions of the general many-body description of non-interacting
electrons in random lattices. The analytic generating functional of the
mean-field description of random systems is extended to the Falicov-Kimball
model with thermally equilibrated scattering lattice potential. The many-body
Green functions are then used to calculate transport properties. The electrical
conductivity of the coherent-potential approximation is derived from the
two-particle Green function calculated in infinite spatial dimensions. Finally,
a perturbation theory for the vertex corrections to the mean-field conductivity
is introduced. In particular, it is shown how to make the expansion beyond the
local approximations conserving.

different choices of random seeds, scoring rules and words. Furthermore, we
analyse the effects of various factors on these measures' reliability scores.
Our findings inform better design of word embedding gender bias measures.

  Question Answering","Submitted to AAAI'22",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video question answering (VideoQA) is challenging given its multimodal
combination of visual understanding and natural language understanding. While
existing approaches seldom leverage the appearance-motion information in the
video at multiple temporal scales, the interaction between the question and the
visual information for textual semantics extraction is frequently ignored.
Targeting these issues, this paper proposes a novel Temporal Pyramid
Transformer (TPT) model with multimodal interaction for VideoQA. The TPT model
comprises two modules, namely Question-specific Transformer (QT) and Visual
Inference (VI). Given the temporal pyramid constructed from a video, QT builds
the question semantics from the coarse-to-fine multimodal co-occurrence between
each word and the visual content. Under the guidance of such question-specific
semantics, VI infers the visual clues from the local-to-global multi-level
interactions between the question and the video. Within each module, we
introduce a multimodal attention mechanism to aid the extraction of
question-video interactions, with residual connections adopted for the
information passing across different levels. Through extensive experiments on
three VideoQA datasets, we demonstrate better performances of the proposed
method in comparison with the state-of-the-arts.

to constrain the abundances of these species. AlCl is found in clumps very
close to the star, with emission confined within 0.1$^{\prime\prime}$ of the

0.2$^{\prime\prime}$ to 0.6$^{\prime\prime}$ from the continuum peak. We find
peak abundances, relative to H$_2$, of $1.7\times 10^{-7}$ for Al$^{35}$Cl,

abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already
been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar
envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that
AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain

high-mass stars form through a disk-mediated accretion process. At the same
time, formation of high-mass stars still necessitates high accretion rates, and
hence, high gas densities, which in turn can cause disks to become unstable
against gravitational fragmentation. We study the kinematics and fragmentation
of the disk around the high-mass star forming region AFGL 2591-VLA 3 which was
hypothesized to be fragmenting based on the observations that show multiple
outflow directions. We use a new set of high-resolution (0.19 arcsec)
IRAM/NOEMA observations at 843 micron towards VLA 3 which allow us to resolve
its disk, characterize the fragmentation, and study its kinematics. In addition
to the 843 micron continuum emission, our spectral setup targets warm dense gas
and outflow tracers such as HCN, HC$_3$N and SO$_2$, as well as vibrationally
excited HCN lines. The high resolution continuum and line emission maps reveal
multiple fragments with subsolar masses within the inner 1000 AU of VLA 3.
Furthermore, the velocity field of the inner disk observed at 843 micron shows
a similar behavior to that of the larger scale velocity field studied in the
CORE project at 1.37 mm. We present the first observational evidence for disk
fragmentation towards AFGL 2591-VLA 3, a source that was thought to be a single
high-mass core. While the fragments themselves are low-mass, the rotation of
the disk is dominated by the protostar with a mass of 10.3$\pm 1.8~M_{\odot}$.
These data also show that NOEMA Band 4 can obtain the highest currently
achievable spatial resolution at (sub-)mm wavelengths in observations of strong
northern sources.

the results to the model atmosphere; this sensitivity is correlated between the
different diagnostic groups, which all agree with the mean result to within
$0.03$ dex. For carbon and oxygen, the molecular results are in excellent
agreement with our 3D non-LTE analyses of atomic lines. For nitrogen, however,
the molecular indicators give a $0.12$ dex larger abundance than the atomic
indicators, and our best estimate of the solar nitrogen abundance is given by
the mean: $7.83$ dex. The solar oxygen abundance advocated here is close to our
earlier determination of $8.69$ dex, and so the present results do not
significantly alleviate the solar modelling problem.

diagnostic methods, the creation of photonic crystals, the formation of

earlier experiments had shown the possibility of particle separation near the
contact line, dependent upon their size. A mathematical model has been
developed to describe this process. Bi-dispersed colloidal droplets evaporating
on a hydrophilic substrate are taken into consideration. A particle monolayer
is formed near the periphery of such droplets due to the small value of the
contact angle. The shape of the resulting deposit is associated with the coffee
ring effect. The model takes into account both particle diffusion and transfers
caused by capillary flow due to liquid evaporation. Monte Carlo simulations of
such particle dynamics have been performed at several values of particle
concentration in the colloidal solution. The numerical results agree with the
experimental observations, in which small particles accumulate nearer to the
contact line than do the large particles. However, the particles do not
actually reach the contact line, but accumulate at a small distance from it.
The reason for this is the surface tension acting on the particles in areas
where the thickness of the liquid layer is comparable to the particle size.
Indeed, the same mechanism affects the observed separation of the small and
large particles.

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which enables the assessment of chemical
states and electronic structure through the collection of core level and
valence band spectra. However, in the case of metallic tungsten, open questions
remain regarding the origin, nature, and position of satellite features that
are prominent in the photoelectron spectrum. These satellites are a fingerprint
of the electronic structure of the material and have not been thoroughly
investigated, at times leading to their misinterpretation. The present work
combines high-resolution soft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS

multi-tiered ab-initio theoretical approach, including density functional
theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (G0W0 and GW+C), to disentangle
the complex set of experimentally observed satellite features attributed to the
generation of plasmons and interband transitions. This combined

tungsten's electronic structure. Furthermore, it lays the groundwork for future

Two varieties of states, namely sentence-level and word-level, are integrated

in-depth study of transfer Krull monoids. We investigate how the root closure
of a monoid can affect the transfer Krull property and under what circumstances
transfer Krull monoids have to be half-factorial or Krull. In particular, we
show that if $\widetilde{H}$ is a DVM, then $H$ is transfer Krull if and only

neutrinos from various sources. In particular, it is the only technique used so
far for the precision spectroscopy of sub-MeV solar neutrinos, as demonstrated
by the Borexino experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. The
benefit of a high light yield, and thus a low energy threshold and a good
energy resolution, comes at the cost of the directional information featured by
water Cherenkov detectors, measuring $^8$B solar neutrinos above a few MeV. In
this paper we provide the first directionality measurement of sub-MeV solar
neutrinos which exploits the correlation between the first few detected photons
in each event and the known position of the Sun for each event. This is also
the first signature of directionality in neutrinos elastically scattering off
electrons in a liquid scintillator target. This measurement exploits the
sub-dominant, fast Cherenkov light emission that precedes the dominant yet
slower scintillation light signal. Through this measurement, we have also been
able to extract the rate of $^{7}$Be solar neutrinos in Borexino. The
demonstration of directional sensitivity in a traditional liquid scintillator
target paves the way for the possible exploitation of the Cherenkov light
signal in future kton-scale experiments using liquid scintillator targets.
Directionality is important for background suppression as well as the
disentanglement of signals from various sources.

learned policies directly to the real world. In addition, to learn a single
policy that manipulates multiple materials, we randomize the material

in recent papers on the notion of p-entailment of Adams and its relationship
with conjoined and iterated conditionals. We recall that conjoined and iterated
conditionals are suitably defined in the framework of conditional random
quantities. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $n$ conditional events
$\{E_1|H_1,\ldots, E_n|H_n\}$ we denote by
$\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})=(E_1|H_1)\wedge \cdots \wedge (E_n|H_n)$ the
conjunction of the conditional events in $\mathcal{F}$. We introduce the
iterated conditional $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$,
where $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ are two finite families of
conditional events, by showing that the prevision of
$\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)\wedge \mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$ is the product of
the prevision of $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$ and
the prevision of $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$. Likewise the well known equality
$(A\wedge H)|H=A|H$, we show that $ (\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)\wedge
\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1))|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)=
\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$. Then, we consider the
case $\mathcal{F}_1=\mathcal{F}_2=\mathcal{F}$ and we verify for the prevision
$\mu$ of $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})$ that the unique
coherent assessment is $\mu=1$ and, as a consequence,
$\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})$ coincides with the constant
1. Finally, by assuming $\mathcal{F}$ p-consistent, we deepen some previous
characterizations of p-entailment by showing that $\mathcal{F}$ p-entails a
conditional event $E_{n+1}|H_{n+1}$ if and only if the iterated conditional
$(E_{n+1}|H_{n+1})\,|\,\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})$ is constant and equal to 1. We

which are then compacted into a highly-condensed version of the original
document, guaranteeing to be encoded once. The latter further predicts the
global answers from this condensed document. Eventually, a voting strategy is

toward a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise and
homogeneous characterization of their host stars. Better spectroscopic stellar
parameters along with new results from Gaia eDR3 provide updated and precise
parameters for the discovered planets. A new version of the catalog, whose
homogeneity in the derivation of the parameters is key to unraveling
star-planet connections, is available to the community. Methods. We made use of
high-resolution spectra for planet-host stars, either observed by our team or
collected through public archives. The spectroscopic stellar parameters were
derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES and
MOOG (ARES+MOOG) as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. We re-derived
parameters for the stars in the catalog using better quality spectra and/or
using the most recent versions of the codes. Moreover, the new SWEET-Cat table
can now be more easily combined with the planet properties listed both at the
Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive to perform
statistical analyses of exoplanets. We also made use of the recent GAIA eDR3
parallaxes and respective photometry to derive consistent and accurate surface
gravity values for the host stars. Results. We increased the number of stars

different mass regimes comparing the low-mass planets (< 30M$_{\oplus}$) with

momentum in wireless connectivity as a metric for serving real-time
communications requirements. However, in many applications, research has
pointed out that latency could be inefficient to handle applications with data
freshness requirements. Recently, Age of Information (AoI) metric, which can
capture the freshness of the data, has attracted a lot of attention. In this
work, we consider mixed traffic with time-sensitive users; a
deadline-constrained user, and an AoI-oriented user. To develop an efficient
scheduling policy, we cast a novel optimization problem formulation for
minimizing the average AoI while satisfying the timely throughput constraints.
The formulated problem is cast as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP).
We relax the constrained problem to an unconstrained Markov Decision Process
(MDP) problem by utilizing the Lyapunov optimization theory and it can be
proved that it is solved per frame by applying backward dynamic programming
algorithms with optimality guarantees. In addition, we provide a low-complexity
algorithm guaranteeing that the timely-throughput constraint is satisfied.
Simulation results show that the timely throughput constraints are satisfied
while minimizing the average AoI. Simulation results show the convergence of
the algorithms for different values of the weighted factor and the trade-off
between the AoI and the timely throughput.

dominant position in providing Internet access thanks to their freedom of
deployment and configuration as well as the existence of affordable and highly
interoperable devices. The Wi-Fi community is currently deploying Wi-Fi 6 and
developing Wi-Fi 7, which will bring higher data rates, better multi-user and
multi-AP support, and, most importantly, improved configuration flexibility.
These technical innovations, including the plethora of configuration
parameters, are making next-generation WLANs exceedingly complex as the
dependencies between parameters and their joint optimization usually have a
non-linear impact on network performance. The complexity is further increased
in the case of dense deployments and coexistence in shared bands. While
classical optimization approaches fail in such conditions, machine learning
(ML) is able to handle complexity. Much research has been published on using ML
to improve Wi-Fi performance and solutions are slowly being adopted in existing
deployments. In this survey, we adopt a structured approach to describe the
various Wi-Fi areas where ML is applied. To this end, we analyze over 250
papers in the field, providing readers with an overview of the main trends.
Based on this review, we identify specific open challenges and provide general
future research directions.

resolution (PCR) mostly focus on resolving pronouns to mentions in text while
ignoring the exophoric scenario. Exophoric pronouns are common in daily
communications, where speakers may directly use pronouns to refer to some
objects present in the environment without introducing the objects first.
Although such objects are not mentioned in the dialogue text, they can often be
disambiguated by the general topics of the dialogue. Motivated by this, we
propose to jointly leverage the local context and global topics of dialogues to
solve the out-of-text PCR problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of adding topic regularization for resolving exophoric pronouns.

where the decision maker's utility function at each stage depends on historical
data and the information on the true utility function is incomplete. To
mitigate adverse impact arising from ambiguity of the true utility, we propose
a maximin robust model where the optimal policy is based on the worst-case
sequence of utility functions from an ambiguity set constructed with partially
available information about the decision maker's preferences. We then show that
the multistage maximin problem is time consistent when the utility functions
are state-dependent and demonstrate with a counter example that the time
consistency may not be retained when the utility functions are
state-independent. With the time consistency, we show the maximin problem can
be solved by a recursive formula whereby a one-stage maximin problem is solved
at each stage beginning from the last stage. Moreover, we propose two
approaches to construct the ambiguity set: a pairwise comparison approach and a
zeta-ball approach where a ball of utility functions centered at a nominal
utility function under zeta-metric is considered. To overcome the difficulty
arising from solving the infinite dimensional optimization problem in
computation of the worst-case expected utility value, we propose piecewise
linear approximation of the utility functions and derive error bound for the
approximation under moderate conditions. Finally, we use the SDDP method and
the nested Benders' decomposition method to solve the multistage
state-dependent preference robust problem and the scenario tree method to solve
the state-independent problem, and carry out comparative analysis on the
efficiency of the computational schemes as well as out-of-sample performances

difficulty of pointing tasks as a logarithmic relationship between
movement-amplitude ($A$) and target-width ($W$), is used for modelling the
corresponding observed movement-times ($MT_O$) in such tasks in controlled
experimental setup. However, real-life pointing tasks are both spatially and
temporally uncontrolled, being influenced by factors such as - human aspects,
subjective behavior, the context of interaction, the inherent speed-accuracy
trade-off where, emphasizing accuracy compromises speed of interaction and vice

adjustment for compensating accuracy. However, no significant adjustment exists
in the literature for compensating speed in different contexts of interaction
in these tasks. As a result, without any temporal adjustment, the true
difficulty of an uncontrolled pointing task may be inaccurately quantified
using Shannon's ID. To verify this, we propose the ANTASID (A Novel Temporal

hypothesized a temporal adjustment factor ($t$) as a binary logarithm of

measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) has focused on the quantum resources
involved in the problem with the implicit assumption that these will provide
the main constraints on system scaling. However, the `flying-qubit'
architecture of photonic MBQC requires specific timing constraints that need to
be met by the classical control system. This classical control includes, for
example: the amplification of the signals from single-photon detectors to
voltage levels compatible with digital systems; the implementation of a control
system which converts measurement outcomes into basis settings for measuring
subsequent cluster qubits, in accordance with the quantum algorithm being
implemented; and the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and amplifier systems
required to set these measurement bases using a fast phase modulator. In this
paper, we analyze the digital system needed to implement arbitrary one-qubit
rotations and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates in discrete-variable photonic MBQC,
in the presence of an ideal cluster state generator, with the main aim of
understanding the timing constraints imposed by the digital logic on the analog
system and quantum hardware. We use static timing analysis of a Xilinx FPGA (7
series) to provide a practical upper bound on the speed at which the adaptive
measurement processing can be performed, in turn constraining the photonic
clock rate of the system. Our work points to the importance of co-designing the

investment and evaluate the impact on the valuation of an investment. By
assuming no disagreement on the cash flows, we emphasize how risk preferences
in particular, but also the costs of capital, influence a subjective evaluation
of the decision to invest now or retain the option to invest in future. We
propose a risk-adjusted valuation model to facilitate investors' subjective
decision making, in response to the market valuation of an investment
opportunity. The investor's subjective assessment arises from their perceived
misvaluation of the investment by the market, so projected cash flows are
discounted using two different rates representing the investor's and the
market's view. This liberates our model from perfect or imperfect hedging
assumptions and instead, we are able to illustrate the hedging effect on the
real option value when perceptions of risk premia diverge. During crises
periods, delaying an investment becomes more valuable as the idiosyncratic risk
of future cash flows increases, but the decision-maker may rush to invest too
quickly when the risk level is exceptionally high. Our model verifies features
established by classical real-option valuation models and provides many new
insights about the importance of modelling divergences in decision-makers risk
premia, especially during crisis periods. It also has many practical advantages
because it requires no more parameter inputs than basic discounted cash flow
approaches, such as the marketed asset disclaimer method, but the outputs are
much richer. They allow for complex interactions between cost and revenue
uncertainties as well as an easy exploration of the effects of hedgeable and
un-hedgeable risks on the real option value. Furthermore, we provide
fully-adjustable Python code in which all parameter values can be chosen by the
user.

core-cladding interface of photonic-bandgap hollow-core fiber (PBG-HCF). When
coupling with SM, the air modes (AM) in the core would suffer a higher loss
despite being spectrally within the cladding photonic bandgap, and would be
highly dispersive around the avoided crossing (anti-crossing) wavelength. In
this paper, we numerically demonstrate that such avoided crossings can play an
important role in the tuning of the temperature dependence of group delay of AM
of PBG-HCF. At higher temperatures, both the thermal-optic effect and thermal
expansion contribute to the redshift of avoided crossing wavelength, giving
rise to a temperature dependence of the AM dispersion. Numerical simulations
show that the redshift of avoided crossing can significantly tune the thermal
coefficient of delay (TCD) of PBG-HCF from -400 ps/km/K to 400 ps/km/K,
approximately -120 ppm/K to 120 ppm/K. In comparison with the known tuning
mechanism by the thermal-induced redshift of photonic bandgap [Fokoua et al.,

tuning range and higher efficiency. Our finding would provide a new route to

resolve this paradox for the FSC using the island proposal. To do this, we

incompletely 2H-labeled molecules by exciting only the desired protons in a
frequency-selective manner. While a selective pulse (SP) on 1H at the beginning
of pulsed SOT had been considered before, using SPs during the SOT suppresses
undesired indirect spin-spin interactions. As a result, we achieved a more
robust SOT for the SP variants of the phINEPT+ sequence that we refer to as
phSPINEPT+. Thereby, for the first time, we report a sequence that is effective
for all weakly coupled spin systems. Our simulations show that the method
converts close to 100 % of the parahydrogen-derived spin order into 13C
hyperpolarization in weakly coupled three-spin systems and partially or fully
2H-labeled molecules if relaxation is neglected. Experimentally we demonstrate
high hyperpolarization of 13C with 15.8 % for 1-13C-hydroxyethyl propionate-d3
and 12.6 % for 1-13C-ethyl acetate-d6, which corresponds to ~47 % and ~38 % if
the enrichment of parahydrogen had been 100 %. Even in non-2H-labeled
molecules, a remarkable 13C polarization is achieved, e.g. up to 20 % were
simulated for 100 % pH2, and 1.25 % were obtained experimentally for
1-13C-ethyl pyruvate and 50 % pH2, which can be further improved by faster
hydrogenation. As a result, full deuterium labeling may no longer be required
e.g., when new PHIP agents are investigated, the synthesis of fully deuterated
molecules is too complex, or when a kinetic isotope effect regarding the
metabolic conversion rate of an agent is to be avoided. Using SPs during SOT
seems very promising and may be extended to other sequences in the context of
PHIP and be-yond to make them less prone to experimental imperfections or real
molecular environments.

  Selfish Caching","48 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The original coded caching scenario assumes a content library that is of
interest to all receiving users. In a realistic scenario though, the users may
have diverging interests which may intersect to various degrees. What happens
for example if each file is of potential interest to, say, $40\,\%$ of the
users and each user has potential interest in $40\,\%$ of the library? In this
work, we investigate the so-called symmetrically selfish coded caching
scenario, where each user only makes requests from a subset of the library that
defines its own File Demand Set (FDS), each user caches selfishly only contents
from its own FDS, and where the different FDSs symmetrically overlap to some
extent. In the context of various traditional prefetching scenarios (prior to
the emergence of coded caching), selfish approaches were known to be
potentially very effective. On the other hand, with the exception of some
notable works, little is known about selfish coded caching. We here present a
new information-theoretic converse that proves, in a general setting of
symmetric FDS structures, that selfish coded caching, despite enjoying a much
larger local caching gain and a much smaller set of possible demands,
introduces an unbounded load increase compared to the unselfish case. In
particular, in the $K$-user broadcast channel where each user stores a fraction
$\gamma$ of the library, where each file (class) is of interest to $\alpha$
users, and where any one specific file is of interest to a fraction $\delta$ of
users, the optimal coding gain of symmetrically selfish caching is at least $(K
- \alpha)\gamma + 1$ times smaller than in the unselfish scenario. This allows
us to draw the powerful conclusion that the optimal selfish coding gain is
upper bounded by $1/(1 - \delta)$, and thus does not scale with $K$. These
derived limits are shown to be exact for different types of demands.

adapting a model to a novel target domain under limited or no additional
supervision. While tackling the input domain gap, the standard domain
adaptation settings assume no domain change in the output space. In semantic
prediction tasks, different datasets are often labeled according to different
semantic taxonomies. In many real-world settings, the target domain task
requires a different taxonomy than the one imposed by the source domain. We
therefore introduce the more general taxonomy adaptive cross-domain semantic
segmentation (TACS) problem, allowing for inconsistent taxonomies between the
two domains. We further propose an approach that jointly addresses the
image-level and label-level domain adaptation. On the label-level, we employ a
bilateral mixed sampling strategy to augment the target domain, and a
relabelling method to unify and align the label spaces. We address the
image-level domain gap by proposing an uncertainty-rectified contrastive
learning method, leading to more domain-invariant and class-discriminative
features. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our framework under
different TACS settings: open taxonomy, coarse-to-fine taxonomy, and
implicitly-overlapping taxonomy. Our approach outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin, while being capable of adapting to target
taxonomies. Our implementation is publicly available at

it is anytime feasible and models various nonlinearities to account for
imperfections and constraints on the (physical model of) agents in terms of
limited actuation capabilities, e.g., quantization and saturation. Due to such
inherent nonlinearities, the existing linear solutions considering ideal agent
models may not necessarily converge with guaranteed optimality and anytime
feasibility. Some applications also impose specific nonlinearities, e.g.,
convergence in fixed/finite-time or sign-based robust disturbance-tolerant
dynamics. Our proposed distributed protocol generalizes such nonlinear models.
Putting convex set analysis together with nonsmooth Lyapunov analysis, we prove
convergence, (i) regardless of the particular type of nonlinearity, and (ii)
with weak network-connectivity requirements (uniform-connectivity).

their non-thermal emission of radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays. However, the
ability to accelerate CRs up to PeV-energies has yet to be demonstrated. The
presence of cut-offs in the gamma-ray spectra of several young SNRs led to the
idea that PeV energies might only be achieved during the very initial stages of
a remnant's evolution. We use the time-dependent acceleration code RATPaC to
study the acceleration of cosmic rays in supernovae expanding into dense
environments around massive stars, where the plentiful target material might
offer a path to the detection of gamma-rays by current and future experiments.
We performed spherically symmetric 1-D simulations in which we simultaneously
solve the transport equations for cosmic rays, magnetic turbulence, and the
hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the test-particle limit. We
investigated typical parameters of the circumstellar medium (CSM) in the freely
expanding winds around red supergiant (RSG) and luminous blue variable (LBV)
stars. The maximum achievable energy might be limited to sub-PeV energies
despite strong magnetic fields close to the progenitor star that enhance
turbulence-damping by cascading: we find a maximum CR energy of 100-200 TeV,
reached within one month after explosion. The peak luminosity for a LBV
progenitor is 1e43 erg/s (1e42 erg/s) at GeV (TeV) energies and, for a RSG
progenitor, 1e41 erg/s (1e40 erg/s). All calculated SNe reach their peak
gamma-ray luminosity after <~1 month and then fade at a rate ~1/t as long as
the SN shock remains in the freely expanding wind of the progenitor.
Potentially detectable gamma-ray signals can be expected in the Fermi-LAT
waveband weeks to months after an explosion into a freely expanding wind.

Existing federated learning systems only work on local data from a single

chemical evolution. On the other hand, we focus on the possible dependence of
carbon abundances on the presence of planets and on the impact of various
factors (such as different oxygen lines) on the determination of C/O elemental
ratios. We derived chemical abundances of carbon from two atomic lines for 757
FGK stars in the HARPS-GTO sample. The abundances were derived with the code
MOOG using automatically measured EWs and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres.
Oxygen abundances, derived using different lines, were taken from previous
papers in this series and updated with the new stellar parameters. We find that
thick- and thin-disk stars are chemically disjunct for [C/Fe] across the full
metallicity range that they have in common. Moreover, the population of
high-$\alpha$ metal-rich stars also presents higher and clearly separated
[C/Fe] ratios than thin-disk stars up to [Fe/H]\,$\sim$\,0.2\,dex. The [C/O]
ratios present a general flat trend as a function of [O/H] but this trend
becomes negative when considering stars of similar metallicity. We find
tentative evidence that stars with low-mass planets at lower metallicities have
higher [C/Fe] ratios than stars without planets at the same metallicity, in the
same way as has previously been found for $\alpha$ elements. Finally, the
elemental C/O ratios for the vast majority of our stars are below 0.8 when
using the oxygen line at 6158A however, the forbidden oxygen line at 6300A
provides systematically higher C/O values. Moreover, by using different
atmosphere models the C/O ratios can have a non negligible difference for cool
stars. Therefore, C/O ratios should be scaled to a common solar reference in
order to correctly evaluate its behaviour.

in this part of the nuclear landscape. Recent studies have suggested that a
prospective two-neutron halo in the dripline nucleus $^{31}$F could be linked
to the occupancy of the $pf$ intruder configurations. Focusing on configuration
mixing, matter radii and neutron-neutron ($nn$) correlations in the
ground-state of $^{31}$F, we explore various scenarios to analyze its possible
halo nature as well as the low-lying electric dipole ($E$1) response within a
three-body approach. We use an analytical, transformed harmonic oscillator
basis under the aegis of a hyperspherical formalism to construct the ground
state three-body wave function of $^{31}$F. The $^{31}$F ground-state
configuration mixing and its matter radius are computed for different choices
of the $^{30}$F structure coupled to the valence neutron. The admixture of
{$p_{3/2}$, $d_{3/2}$, and $f_{7/2}$} components is found to play an important
role, favouring the dominance of inverted configurations with dineutron spreads
for two-neutron halo formation. The increase in matter radius with respect to
the core radius, $\Delta r \geqslant$ 0.30 fm and the dipole distributions
along with the integrated $B(E1)$ strengths of $\geqslant$ 2.6 $e^2$fm$^2$ are
large enough to be compatible with other two-neutron halo nuclei. Three-body
results for $^{31}$F indicate a large spatial extension in its ground state due
to the inversion of the energy levels of the normal shell model scheme. The
increase is augmented by and is proportional to the extent of the $p_{3/2}$
component in the wave function. Additionally, the enhanced dipole distributions
and large $B(E1)$ strengths all point to the two-neutron halo character of
$^{31}$F.

possible diagnostic to study highly elusive coronal heating. Such nanojets can
be observed in coronal loops and they have been linked to nanoflares. However,
while models successfully describe the bilateral post-reconnection magnetic
slingshot effect that leads to the jets, observations reveal that nanojets are
unidirectional, or highly asymmetric, with only the jet travelling inward with
respect to the coronal loop's curvature being clearly observed. The aim of this
work is to address the role of the curvature of the coronal loop in asymmetric
reconnection jets. In order to do so, we first use a simplified analytical
model where we estimate the post-reconnection tension forces based on the local
intersection angle between the pre-reconnection magnetic field lines and on
their post-reconnection retracting length towards new equilibria. Second, we
use a simplified numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to study how two
opposite propagating jets evolve in curved magnetic field lines. Our analytical
model demonstrates that in the post-reconnection reorganised magnetic field,
the inward directed magnetic tension is inherently stronger (up to 3 orders of
magnitude) than the outward directed one and that, with a large enough
retracting length, a regime exists where the outward directed tension
disappears, leading to no outward jet at large, observable scales. Our MHD
numerical model provides support for these results proving also that in the
following time evolution the inward jets are consistently more energetic. The
degree of asymmetry is also found to increase for small-angle reconnection and
for more localised reconnection regions. This work shows that the curvature of
the coronal loops plays a role in the asymmetry of the reconnection jets and
inward directed jets are more likely to occur and more energetic.

are used, totaling 45 hours. The remaining 83 flights totaling 8 hours are held
out for validation. Error in a single flight is taken to be the maximum
absolute difference in 3D position (MPE) between the RNN predictions (without

  Resolution",,,,,"cs.LO cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  QBF solvers implementing the QCDCL paradigm are powerful algorithms that
successfully tackle many computationally complex applications. However, our
theoretical understanding of the strength and limitations of these QCDCL
solvers is very limited.
  In this paper we suggest to formally model QCDCL solvers as proof systems. We
define different policies that can be used for decision heuristics and unit
propagation and give rise to a number of sound and complete QBF proof systems
(and hence new QCDCL algorithms). With respect to the standard policies used in
practical QCDCL solving, we show that the corresponding QCDCL proof system is
incomparable (via exponential separations) to Q-resolution, the classical QBF
resolution system used in the literature. This is in stark contrast to the
propositional setting where CDCL and resolution are known to be p-equivalent.
  This raises the question what formulas are hard for standard QCDCL, since
Q-resolution lower bounds do not necessarily apply to QCDCL as we show here. In
answer to this question we prove several lower bounds for QCDCL, including
exponential lower bounds for a large class of random QBFs.
  We also introduce a strengthening of the decision heuristic used in classical
QCDCL, which does not necessarily decide variables in order of the prefix, but
still allows to learn asserting clauses. We show that with this decision
policy, QCDCL can be exponentially faster on some formulas.
  We further exhibit a QCDCL proof system that is p-equivalent to Q-resolution.
In comparison to classical QCDCL, this new QCDCL version adapts both decision
and unit propagation policies.

consider low-energy configurations by rescaling the elastic energy according to
the linearized von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n regime. First, we identify a reduced model by
computing the $\Gamma$-limit of the magnetoelastic energy, as the thickness of
the plate goes to zero. This extends a previous result obtained by the first
author in the incompressible case to the compressible one. Then, we introduce
applied loads given by mechanical forces and external magnetic fields and we
prove that, under clamped boundary conditions, sequences of almost minimizes of
the total energy converge to minimizers of the corresponding energy in the
reduced model. Subsequently, we study quasistatic evolutions driven by
time-dependent applied loads and a rate-independent dissipation. We prove that
solutions to the approximate incremental minimization problem at the bulk
converge to energetic solutions to the reduced model. This result provides a
further justification of the latter in the spirit of evolutionary
$\Gamma$-convergence.

cross-modal mutual matching to maximize their mutual information. Experiments

identifying unmodeled constraints that affect the behavior of a demonstrator

only for discrete state-action spaces. Continuous dynamics are more useful for
modeling many real-world systems of interest, including the movements of humans

approximates continuous dynamics and can be used for constraint inference on
demonstrations that obey the true system dynamics. We then demonstrate accurate
constraint inference on nonlinear pendulum systems with 2- and 4-dimensional
state spaces, and show that performance is robust to a range of
hyperparameters. The demonstrations are not required to be fully optimal with
respect to the objective, and the most likely constraints can be identified
even when demonstrations cover only a small portion of the state space. For
these reasons, the proposed approach may be especially useful for inferring
constraints on human demonstrators, which has important applications in
human-robot interaction and biomechanical medicine.

with a constant row sum. Due to the non-negativity the focus is on conditional
proportions that add up to 1 for each row. A row of conditional proportions is
called an observed budget. Latent budget analysis (LBA) assumes a mixture of
latent budgets that explains the observed budgets. LBA is usually fitted to a
contingency table, where the rows are levels of one or more explanatory
variables and the columns the levels of a response variable. In prospective
studies, there is only knowledge about the explanatory variables of individuals
and interest goes out to predicting the response variable. Thus, a form of LBA
is needed that has the functionality of prediction. Previous studies proposed a
constrained neural network (NN) extension of LBA that was hampered by an
unsatisfying prediction ability. Here we propose LBA-NN, a feed forward NN
model that yields a similar interpretation to LBA but equips LBA with a better
ability of prediction. A stable and plausible interpretation of LBA-NN is
obtained through the use of importance plots and table, that show the relative
importance of all explanatory variables on the response variable. An LBA-NN-K-
means approach that applies K-means clustering on the importance table is used
to produce K clusters that are comparable to K latent budgets in LBA. Here we
provide different experiments where LBA-NN is implemented and compared with
LBA. In our analysis, LBA-NN outperforms LBA in prediction in terms of
accuracy, specificity, recall and mean square error. We provide open-source

related language adapter for the new language variety, but we observe that this
solution can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve
the robustness of language adapters to uncovered languages without training new
adapters. We find that ensembling multiple existing language adapters makes the
fine-tuned model significantly more robust to other language varieties not
included in these adapters. Building upon this observation, we propose Entropy
Minimized Ensemble of Adapters (EMEA), a method that optimizes the ensemble
weights of the pretrained language adapters for each test sentence by
minimizing the entropy of its predictions. Experiments on three diverse groups

two kinds of private information: (1) type variable, which can be misreported;
(2) information variable, which the bidder may want to conceal or partially
reveal, but importantly, not to misreport. We refer to bidders with such
behaviors as strategically reticent bidders. Among others, one direct
motivation of our model is the ad auction in which many ad platforms today
elicit from each bidder not only their private value per conversion but also
their private information about Internet users (e.g., user activities on the
advertiser's websites) in order to improve the platform's estimation of
conversion rates.
  We show that in this new setup, it is still possible to design mechanisms
that are both Incentive and Information Compatible (IIC). We develop two
different black-box transformations, which convert any mechanism $\mathcal{M}$
for classic bidders to a mechanism $\bar{\mathcal{M}}$ for strategically
reticent bidders, based on either outcome of expectation or expectation of
outcome, respectively. We identify properties of the original mechanism
$\mathcal{M}$ under which the transformation leads to IIC mechanisms
$\bar{\mathcal{M}}$. Interestingly, as corollaries of these results, we show
that running VCG with bidders' expected values maximizes welfare, whereas the
mechanism using expected outcome of Myerson's auction maximizes revenue.
Finally, we study how regulation on the auctioneer's usage of information can
lead to more robust mechanisms.

improve the recognition rates of small-vocabulary systems, compared to their
audio-only counterparts. For large-vocabulary systems, however, there are still
many difficulties, such as unsatisfactory video recognition accuracies, that
make it hard to improve over audio-only baselines. In this paper, we
specifically consider such scenarios, focusing on the large-vocabulary task of
the LRS2 database, where audio-only performance is far superior to video-only
accuracies, making this an interesting and challenging setup for multi-modal
integration.
  To address the inherent difficulties, we propose a new fusion strategy: a
recurrent integration network is trained to fuse the state posteriors of
multiple single-modality models, guided by a set of model-based and
signal-based stream reliability measures. During decoding, this network is used
for stream integration within a hybrid recognizer, where it can thus cope with
the time-variant reliability and information content of its multiple feature
inputs.
  We compare the results with end-to-end AVSR systems as well as with
competitive hybrid baseline models, finding that the new fusion strategy shows
superior results, on average even outperforming oracle dynamic stream
weighting, which has so far marked the -- realistically unachievable -- upper
bound for standard stream weighting. Even though the pure lipreading
performance is low, audio-visual integration is helpful under all -- clean,
noisy, and reverberant -- conditions. On average, the new system achieves a
relative word error rate reduction of 42.18\% compared to the audio-only model,
pointing at a high effectiveness of the proposed integration approach.

footprint coordinates with an updated Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) ephemeris and
a revised Mars rotation model. The reprocessed MOLA dataset at the South Pole
of Mars (poleward of 78{\deg}S) is then self-registered to form a coherent
reference digital terrain model (DTM). We co-register segments of reprocessed
MOLA profiles to the self-registered MOLA reference DTM to obtain the temporal
height differences at either footprints or cross-overs. Subsequently, a
two-step Regional Pseudo Cross-over Adjustment (RPCA) procedure is proposed and
applied to post-correct the aforementioned temporal height differences for a
temporal systematic bias and other residual errors. These pseudo cross-overs
are formed by profile pairs that do not necessarily intersect, but are
connected through the underlaying DTM. Finally, CO2 snow/ice temporal height
variation is obtained by median-filtering those post-corrected temporal height
differences. The precision of the derived height change time series is ~4.9 cm.
The peak-to-peak height variation is estimated to be ~2 m. In addition, a
pronounced ""pit"" (transient height accumulation) of ~0.5 m in magnitude
centered at Ls=210{\deg} in southern spring is observed. The proposed method
opens the possibility to map the seasonal CO2 snow/ice height variations at the

-\log(P_\text{ss}(x))$ of microstate $x$ to measurable physical quantities.
This is a central problem in non-equilibrium statistical physics. By
considering open systems described by stochastic dynamics which become
deterministic in the macroscopic limit, we show that changes $\Delta

emergent second law $\Sigma + k_b \Delta \mathcal{I}\geq 0$, which contains the
usual second law $\Sigma \geq 0$ as a corollary, and is saturated in the linear
regime close to equilibrium. We thus obtain a tighter version of the second law
of thermodynamics that provides a link between the deterministic relaxation of
a system and the non-equilibrium fluctuations at steady state. In addition to
its fundamental value, our result leads to novel methods for computing
non-equilibrium distributions, providing a deterministic alternative to

between pump power and frequency mismatch. To move beyond a three-mode
approximation, a necessity for geometries such as integrated microring
resonators, we numerically simulate the Lugiato-Lefever Equation that accounts
for the full spectrum of nonlinearly-coupled resonator modes. We observe and
characterize two nonlinear phenomena linked to parametric oscillations in
multi-mode resonators: Mode competition and cross phase modulation-induced
modulation instability. Both processes may impact conversion efficiency.
Finally, we show how to increase the conversion efficiency by tuning the
microresonator loss rates. Our analysis will guide microresonator designs that
aim for high conversion efficiency and output power.

goal of research in different fields. Trapped ultracold Rydberg-excited atoms
in optical lattices are a promising platform for realizing quantum phases with
broken lattice translational symmetry since they are interacting over distances
larger than the lattice constant. Although numerous theoretical works on
trapped Rydberg-excited gases have predicted such phases, in particular density
wave or supersolid phases, their experimental observation proves to be
difficult due to challenges such as scattering processes and the limited
experimentally achievable coupling strength. Most of these previous studies
have focused on isotropically interacting gases dressed with Rydberg
$s$-states, while the effect of anisotropic interactions due to Rydberg-excited
$p$-states in trapped quantum gases remains much less investigated.
Additionally, it was shown that the excitation scheme used to excite Rydberg
$p$-states possesses advantages regarding achievable coupling strengths and
limitation of scattering processes compared to its $s$-state counterpart, which
makes the investigation of Rydberg $p$-state dressed quantum gases even more
interesting. In the present work, we study the extended, two-component
Bose-Hubbard model, realized with a bosonic quantum gas with Rydberg-excited
$p$-states trapped in an optical lattice, within Gutzwiller mean-field theory.
We compute the ground state phase diagram and investigate its different
regimes. By comparison to the phase diagram of the isotropic case, we find the
anisotropic interaction to be more advantageous for the observation of
supersolid phases.

different reconstructed complex environments. Furthermore, the approximation of

acoustic Te modes in the 1T$^\prime$ phase. We find that the electron and hole
pockets carry trivial $s$-wave order parameters of slightly different
magnitude, reminiscent of a two-gap structure as suggested by recent
experiments. We suggest that a possible route for enhancing the superconducting
critical temperature, and realizing $s_{+-}$ pairing, in the T$_d$ phase is to
exploit its non-trivial band topology via electron doping.

this manuscript, we address this issue by undertaking the first attempt at

obtaining encouraging agreement on arrival time, spacecraft crossing location,

The Clean Energy Package aims to ensure that methods for capacity allocation

market for electricity, align with this transformation.
  Flow-based market coupling, the preferred method for capacity allocation, is
first and foremost a formal process to allocate exchange capacities to the
markets. However, the process also allows for many considerations of the
involved parties that impact the resulting capacities. As part of the Clear
Energy Package, the regulatory body enacted their ambition to increase exchange
capacities by enforcing transmission system operators to allocate a minimum
margin of physical line capacity with the goal of providing a higher level of
competition and better integration of renewable energy sources. This study
investigates this and other policy relevant consideration of flow-based market
coupling.
  The model results quantify the trade-off between permissive capacity
allocation and increased congestion management. For high shares of intermittent
renewable generation, less constrained exchange capacities are favorable,
however also highlight the importance of the markets ability to integrate high
shares of intermittent generation. apacities are favourable, however also

multi-armed bandits in the fixed confidence setting, where the goal is to
identify, with probability $1-\delta$ for some $\delta>0$, the arm with the
highest mean reward in minimum possible samples from the set of arms
$\mathcal{K}$. Most existing best-arm identification algorithms and analyses
operate under the assumption that the rewards corresponding to different arms
are independent of each other. We propose a novel correlated bandit framework
that captures domain knowledge about correlation between arms in the form of
upper bounds on expected conditional reward of an arm, given a reward
realization from another arm. Our proposed algorithm C-LUCB, which generalizes
the LUCB algorithm utilizes this partial knowledge of correlations to sharply
reduce the sample complexity of best-arm identification. More interestingly, we
show that the total samples obtained by C-LUCB are of the form
$\mathcal{O}\left(\sum_{k \in \mathcal{C}}
\log\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$ as opposed to the typical
$\mathcal{O}\left(\sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}}
\log\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$ samples required in the independent
reward setting. The improvement comes, as the $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\delta))$
term is summed only for the set of competitive arms $\mathcal{C}$, which is a
subset of the original set of arms $\mathcal{K}$. The size of the set
$\mathcal{C}$, depending on the problem setting, can be as small as $2$, and
hence using C-LUCB in the correlated bandits setting can lead to significant
performance improvements. Our theoretical findings are supported by experiments
on the Movielens and Goodreads recommendation datasets.

particle with non-negative self-binding energy. Because of the dual conformal
field theory (CFT) formulation in the anti-de Sitter space the conformal
dimension $\Delta (Q)$ of the lowest-dimension operator with charge Q under
some global U(1) symmetry must be a convex function of Q. This property has
been conjectured to hold for any (unitary) conformal field theory and
generalized to larger global symmetry groups. Here we refine and further test
the convex charge conjecture via semiclassical computations for fixed charge
sectors of different theories in different dimensions. We analyze the convexity
properties of the leading and next-to-leading order terms stemming from the
semiclassical computation, de facto, extending previous tests beyond the
leading perturbative contributions and to arbitrary charges. In particular, the
leading contribution is sufficient to test convexity in the semiclassical
computations. We also consider intriguing cases in which the models feature a
transition from real to complex conformal dimensions either as a function of
the charge or number of matter fields. As a relevant example of the first kind,
we investigate the $O(N)$ model in $4+\epsilon$ dimensions. As an example of
the second type we consider the $U(N)\times U(M)$ model in $4-\epsilon$
dimensions. Both models display a rich dynamics where, by changing the number
of matter fields and/or charge, one can achieve dramatically different physical
regimes. We discover that whenever a complex conformal dimension appears, the
real part satisfies the convexity property.

producing the $\rho$ meson mass in the formalism, and then input into the
dispersion relations for the scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor glueballs. It is
shown that the low-energy limit of the correlation function for the scalar

spectral densities for the scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs reveal a
double-peak structure: the peak located at lower mass implies that the

gluonium components, and should be included into scalar (pseudoscalar) mixing
frameworks. Another peak determines the scalar (pseudoscalar) glueball mass

only MAs or only HMs because of the difference in their texture, sizes, and
morphology. Though some methods detect both MAs and HMs, they suffer from the
curse of dimensionality of shape and colors features and fail to detect all
shape variations of HMs such as flame-shaped. Leveraging the progress in deep
learning, we proposed a two-stream red lesions detection system dealing
simultaneously with small and large red lesions. For this system, we introduced
a new ROIs candidates generation method for large red lesions on fundus images;
it is based on blood vessel segmentation and morphological operations, and
reduces the computational complexity, and enhances the detection accuracy by
generating a small number of potential candidates. For detection, we proposed a
framework with two streams. We used pretrained VGGNet as a backbone model and
carried out several extensive experiments to tune it for vessels segmentation
and candidates generation, and finally learning the appropriate mapping, which
yields better detection of the red lesions comparing with the state-of-the-art

the detection of both MAs and HMs; it yields higher performance for per lesion

(GTD) of Bardeen black hole to study its stability. Next, we estimate the size
of black hole remnant in terms of some known parameters of the black hole
solution. Motivated by the fact that estimation of size, characteristics and
stability of remnants of black holes could further increase our understanding
of binary collisions, information loss paradox and dark energy, the black hole
remnant, which gives an idea about stable mass left over after evaporation of
black hole, is seen to owe its presence due to thermal fluctuations. We see
that the thermal fluctuations bring an overall increase in entropy curve.
However, in presence of thermal fluctuations, a positive kink, which signifies
a maximum increase in the value of entropy, occurs at a certain value of
horizon, which is exactly equal to the remnant radius. We observe that the
thermal fluctuations, which are characteristics of quantum gravity, lead to
stable values of thermodynamic quantities near the remnant radius. In presence
of thermal fluctuations, we then derive various corrected thermodynamic
potentials and also discuss the validity of first law of black hole
thermodynamics for Bardeen black hole.

a diffuse representation of sharp cracks, enables the proposed implementation
to overcome such well-known drawbacks of the discrete approach for predicting
complex crack paths as the need for re-meshing, enrichment of finite element
shape functions and an explicit tracking of the crack surfaces. On the other
hand, the use of Gridap makes the proposed implementation very compact and

design of models. When a time series obtained from observing the system is
available, the task can be performed by designing the model from these
observations without additional assumptions or by assuming a preconceived
structure in the model, with the help of additional information about the
system. In the second case, it is a question of adequately combining theory
with observations and subsequently optimizing the mixture. In this work, we
proposes the design of time-continuous models of dynamical systems as solutions
of differential equations, from non-uniform sampled or noisy observations,
using machine learning techniques. The performance of strategy is shown with
both, several simulated data sets and experimental data from Hare-Lynx
