in tetragonal (penta-) and orthorhombic (rec-) phases, as promising light
absorber semiconductors for overall water splitting. The predicted
nanomembranes exhibit good mechanical, dynamical and thermal stabilities. They
also show small cleavage energies in the range of 0.31 J/m2 to 0.39 J/m2,
comparable to that of the graphene and thus suggesting the feasibility of their
experimental exfoliation. Notably, predicted monolayers are semiconductors with
indirect band gaps of 2.65 eV for penta-SiP2, 2.35 eV for penta-SiAs2, 1.89 eV
for rec-SiAs2, and a direct band gap of 2.21 eV for rec-SiP2. These
nanomaterials however show relatively large interlayer quantum confinement
effects, resulting in smaller band gap values for bilayer lattices. We observed
a huge difference between the electron and hole mobilities for penta-SiP2 and
rec-SiAs2 monolayers and highly directional dependent electron and hole
mobilities in rec-SiP2, yielding an effective separation of photogenerated
charge carriers. Remarkably, these novel nanomembranes show strong absorption
in the visible region of light as well as suitable band edge positions for
photocatalytic water splitting reaction, specifically under neutral conditions.

shifting as a result of global changes. To evaluate whether these shifts are
negatively impacting biodiversity processes, it is critical to monitor the
status, trends, and effects of environmental variables on entire communities.
However, modeling the dynamics of multiple species simultaneously can require
large amounts of diverse data, and few modeling approaches exist to
simultaneously provide species and community level inferences. We present an
""integrated community occupancy model"" (ICOM) that unites principles of data
integration and hierarchical community modeling in a single framework to
provide inferences on species-specific and community occurrence dynamics using
multiple data sources. We use simulations to compare the ICOM to previously
developed hierarchical community occupancy models and single species integrated
distribution models. We then apply our model to assess the occurrence and
biodiversity dynamics of foliage-gleaning birds in the White Mountain National
Forest in the northeastern USA from 2010-2018 using three independent data
sources. Simulations reveal that integrating multiple data sources in the ICOM
increased precision and accuracy of species and community level inferences
compared to single data source models, although benefits of integration were
dependent on data source quality (e.g., amount of replication). Compared to
single species models, the ICOM yielded more precise species-level estimates.
Within our case study, the ICOM had the highest out-of-sample predictive
performance compared to single species models and models that used only a
subset of the three data sources. The ICOM offers an attractive approach to
estimate species and biodiversity dynamics, which is additionally valuable to
inform management objectives of both individual species and their broader
communities.

autonomous vehicles (AVs) in unsignaled intersections, roundabouts, and during

of other agents, especially human drivers, as their intentions are hidden from
other agents. Our algorithm uses game theory to develop a new auction, called
GamePlan, that directly determines the optimal action for each agent based on
their driving style (which is observable via commonly available sensors).
GamePlan assigns a higher priority to more aggressive or impatient drivers and
a lower priority to more conservative or patient drivers; we theoretically
prove that such an approach is game-theoretically optimal prevents collisions
and deadlocks. We compare our approach with prior state-of-the-art auction
techniques including economic auctions, time-based auctions (first-in
first-out), and random bidding and show that each of these methods result in
collisions among agents when taking into account driver behavior. We compare
with methods based on DRL, deep learning, and game theory and present our
benefits over these approaches. Finally, we show that our approach can be
implemented in the real-world with human drivers.

detailed study of trajectory errors in a constant magnetic field. These errors
in the gyrocenter location and the gyroradius are the foundational basis for
why Boris solvers existed, independent of any finite-difference schemes. This
work shows that there are two distinct ways of eliminating these errors so that
the trajectory of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field is exactly on
the cyclotron orbit. One way reproduces the known second-order symmetric Boris
solver. The other yields a previously unknown, but also on-orbit solver, not
derivable from finite-difference schemes. By revisiting some historical
calculations, it is found that many publications do not distinguish the poorly
behaved leap-frog Boris solver from the symmetric second-order Boris algorithm.
This symmetric second-order Boris solver's trajectory is much more accurate and
remains close to the exact orbit in a combined $nonuniform$ electric and
magnetic field at time-steps greater than the cyclotron period. Finally, this
operator formalism showed that Buneman's cycloid fitting scheme is
mathematically identical to Boris' on-orbit solver and that Boris' E-B
splitting is unnecessary.

machine learning. We consider the typical DG setting where the hypothesis is
composed of a representation mapping followed by a labeling function. Within
this setting, the majority of popular DG methods aim to jointly learn the
representation and the labeling functions by minimizing a well-known upper
bound for the classification risk in the unseen domain. In practice, however,
methods based on this theoretical upper bound ignore a term that cannot be
directly optimized due to its dual dependence on both the representation
mapping and the unknown optimal labeling function in the unseen domain. To
bridge this gap between theory and practice, we introduce a new upper bound
that is free of terms having such dual dependence, resulting in a fully
optimizable risk upper bound for the unseen domain. Our derivation leverages
classical and recent transport inequalities that link optimal transport metrics
with information-theoretic measures. Compared to previous bounds, our bound
introduces two new terms: (i) the Wasserstein-2 barycenter term that aligns
distributions between domains, and (ii) the reconstruction loss term that
assesses the quality of representation in reconstructing the original data.
Based on this new upper bound, we propose a novel DG algorithm named
Wasserstein Barycenter Auto-Encoder (WBAE) that simultaneously minimizes the
classification loss, the barycenter loss, and the reconstruction loss.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current
state-of-the-art DG algorithms on several datasets.

introducing a simple and effective method for improving robustness while

improvements under distribution shift, while preserving high accuracy on the
target distribution. On ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, WiSE-FT
improves accuracy under distribution shift by 4 to 6 percentage points (pp)
over prior work while increasing ImageNet accuracy by 1.6 pp. WiSE-FT achieves
similarly large robustness gains (2 to 23 pp) on a diverse set of six further
distribution shifts, and accuracy gains of 0.8 to 3.3 pp compared to standard
fine-tuning on seven commonly used transfer learning datasets. These
improvements come at no additional computational cost during fine-tuning or
inference.

problems in high-profile sectors. To perform counterfactual inference, one
requires knowledge of the underlying causal mechanisms. However, causal
mechanisms cannot be uniquely determined from observations and interventions
alone. This raises the question of how to choose the causal mechanisms so that
resulting counterfactual inference is trustworthy in a given domain. This
question has been addressed in causal models with binary variables, but the
case of categorical variables remains unanswered. We address this challenge by
introducing for causal models with categorical variables the notion of
counterfactual ordering, a principle that posits desirable properties causal
mechanisms should posses, and prove that it is equivalent to specific
functional constraints on the causal mechanisms. To learn causal mechanisms
satisfying these constraints, and perform counterfactual inference with them,
we introduce deep twin networks. These are deep neural networks that, when
trained, are capable of twin network counterfactual inference -- an alternative
to the abduction, action, & prediction method. We empirically test our approach
on diverse real-world and semi-synthetic data from medicine, epidemiology, and
finance, reporting accurate estimation of counterfactual probabilities while
demonstrating the issues that arise with counterfactual reasoning when
counterfactual ordering is not enforced.

can be operated in an event-driven manner and have internal states to retain
information over time, providing opportunities for energy-efficient
neuromorphic computing, especially on edge devices. Note, however, many
representative works on SNNs do not fully demonstrate the usefulness of their
inherent recurrence (membrane potentials retaining information about the past)
for sequential learning. Most of the works train SNNs to recognize static
images by artificially expanded input representation in time through rate
coding. We show that SNNs can be trained for sequential tasks and propose
modifications to a network of LIF neurons that enable internal states to learn
long sequences and make their inherent recurrence resilient to the vanishing
gradient problem. We then develop a training scheme to train the proposed SNNs
with improved inherent recurrence dynamics. Our training scheme allows spiking
neurons to produce multi-bit outputs (as opposed to binary spikes) which help
mitigate the mismatch between a derivative of spiking neurons' activation
function and a surrogate derivative used to overcome spiking neurons'
non-differentiability. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed SNN
architecture on TIMIT and LibriSpeech 100h dataset yields accuracy comparable

entities. We can think of them as idealized, infinite-mass subsystems which
decouple from the rest of the system. In nature, however, all reference frames
are realized through finite-mass systems that are subject to the laws of
quantum mechanics and must be included in the dynamical evolution. A
fundamental physical theory should take this fact seriously. In this paper, we
further develop a symmetry-inspired approach to describe physics from the
perspective of quantum reference frames. We find a unifying framework allowing
us to systematically derive a broad class of perspective dependent descriptions
and the transformations between them. Working with a translational-invariant
toy model of three free particles, we discover that the introduction of
relative coordinates leads to a Hamiltonian structure with two non-commuting
constraints. This structure can be said to contain all observer-perspectives at
once, while the redundancies prevent an immediate operational interpretation.
We show that the operationally meaningful perspective dependent descriptions
are given by Darboux coordinates on the constraint surface and that reference
frame transformations correspond to reparametrizations of the constraint
surface. We conclude by constructing a quantum perspective neutral structure,
via which we can derive and change perspective dependent descriptions without
referring to the classical theory. In addition to the physical findings, this
work illuminates the interrelation of first and second class constrained
systems and their respective quantization procedures.

pitch angles close to 90$^\circ$ and indicate DOBs are a cause of butterfly
pitch angle distributions within the night-time sector. The convective electric
field, not included in previous DOB studies, is found to have a significant
effect on the resultant long term transport, and losses to the magnetopause and

sufficient crystalline quality, so far mostly available in the form of

directly on large-scale epitaxial hBN. In this work we address this problem and
demonstrate that MoSe2 of high optical quality can be directly grown on

free-streaming and trapped regimes which are separated by a temperature of a
few MeV. The formalism is based on covariant density functional (CDF) theory
for the full baryon octet with density-dependent couplings, suitably adjusted
in the hypernuclear sector. The softening of the EoS with the introduction of
the hyperons is quantified under various conditions of lepton fractions and
temperatures. We find that $\Lambda$, $\Xi^-$, and $\Xi^0$ hyperons appear in
the given order with a sharp density increase at zero temperature at the
threshold being replaced by an extended increment over a wide density range at
high temperatures. The $\Lambda$ hyperon survives in the deep subnuclear
regime. The triplet of $\Sigma$s is suppressed in cold hypernuclear matter up
to around seven times the nuclear saturation density, but appears in
significant fractions at higher temperatures, $T\geq 20$ MeV, in both supernova

exists where the baryon abundances within each of the three isospin multiplets
are equal to each other as a result of (approximate) isospin symmetry. At that
point, the charge chemical potential of the system vanishes. We find that under

trimeric and hexameric V atoms is accompanied by the stabilization of
quasimolecular states, which gives rise to the opening of CDW gaps for the
V-derived multibands lying around the Fermi level. This Jahn-Teller-like
instability having the local lattice distortion and its derived quasimolecular
states is a driving force of the CDW order. Specifically, the saddle points of
multiple Dirac bands near the Fermi level, located at the $M$ point, are
hybridized to disappear along the $k_z$ direction, therefore not supporting the
widely accepted Peierls-like electronic instability due to Fermi surface
nesting. It is further demonstrated that applied hydrostatic pressure
significantly reduces the interlayer spacing to destabilize the quasimolecular
states, leading to a disappearance of the CDW phase at a pressure of ${\sim}$2
GPa. The presently proposed underlying mechanism of the CDW order in

the effect of disorder in the emergence of QD and find that a highly disordered

darwinistic measure, implicating the existence of a critical degree of disorder
beyond which the degree of objectivity rises the larger the environment is. The
latter hints the key role that disorder may play when the environment is of a

Their proof makes use of zonotopal subdivisions and the bijections
$g_{\sigma,\sigma^*}$ are called \emph{geometric bijections}. In this paper, we
extend the geometric bijections to subgraph-orientation correspondences.
Moreover, we extend the geometric constructions accordingly. Our proofs are
purely combinatorial, even for the geometric constructions. We also provide
geometric proofs for partial results, which make use of zonotopal tiling,
relate to Backman, Baker, and Yuen's method, and motivate our combinatorial
constructions. Finally, we explain that the main results hold for \emph{regular

understand how people's behaviors are affected by their network peers. However,
it is well known that identification and estimation of causal peer effects are
challenging in observational studies for two reasons. The first is the
identification challenge due to unmeasured network confounding, for example,
homophily bias and contextual confounding. The second issue is network
dependence of observations, which one must take into account for valid
statistical inference. Negative control variables, also known as placebo
variables, have been widely used in observational studies including peer effect
analysis over networks, although they have been used primarily for bias
detection. In this article, we establish a formal framework which leverages a
pair of negative control outcome and exposure variables (double negative
controls) to nonparametrically identify causal peer effects in the presence of
unmeasured network confounding. We then propose a generalized method of moments
estimator for causal peer effects, and establish its consistency and asymptotic
normality under an assumption about $\psi$-network dependence. Finally, we
provide a network heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance
estimator. Our methods are illustrated with an application to peer effects in

changes in how people relate and communicate, convey and exchange ideas.
Moreover, social media has evolved into critical knowledge networks for

an integral part of political campaigning to reach a greater audience and
gather more support. The 2019 Lok Sabha election saw a massive spike in the
usage of online social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp;
with every major political party launching its own organized social media
campaigns. In 2014, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) took one step ahead in
organizing the campaign by launching its app - NaMo App. We focus our research
on Twitter and NaMo App during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and CAA protests.
Twitter is a platform where every individual can express their views and is not
biased. In contrast, NaMo App is one of the first apps centered around a
specific political party. It acted as a digital medium for BJP for organizing
the political campaign to make people's opinion in their favour. This research
aims to characterize the role of the NaMo App in a more traditional network as
Twitter in shaping political discourse and studies the existence of an online
echo chamber. We began by analyzing the amount and type of content shared using
the NaMo App on Twitter. We performed content and network analysis for the
existence of the echo chamber. We also applied Hawkes process to see the
influence that NaMo App has on Twitter. Through this research, we can conclude
that the users who share content using NaMo App, may be part of an online echo
chamber and are likely to be BJP workers. We show the reach and influence that

low-lying energy gaps, of a large family of free-fermionic and
free-parafermionic quantum chains. The method is suitable for some
generalizations of the quantum Ising and XY models with multispin interactions.
We illustrate the method by considering the Ising quantum chains with uniform
and random coupling constants. The mass gaps of these quantum chains are
obtained from the largest root of a characteristic polynomial. We also show
that the Laguerre bound, for the largest root of a polynomial, used as an
initial guess for the largest root in the method, gives us estimates for the
mass gaps sharing the same leading finite-size behavior as the exact results.
This opens an interesting possibility of obtaining precise critical properties
very efficiently which we explore by studying the critical point and the
paramagnetic Griffiths phase of the quantum Ising chain with random couplings.
In this last phase, we obtain the effective dynamical critical exponent as a
function of the distance-to-criticality. Finally, we compare the mass gap
estimates derived from the Laguerre bound and the strong-disorder
renormalization-group method. Both estimates require comparable computational
efforts, with the former having the advantage of being more accurate and also
being applicable away from infinite-randomness fixed points. We believe this
method is a relevant tool for tackling critical quantum chains with and without
quenched disorder.

address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of
upto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64
training examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors
contributing to these gains.

curves over a cross-section of locations. We start by using clustering methods
for functional data to identify potential heterogeneity in the curves and their
functional derivatives. This first stage is an unconditional descriptive
analysis, as we do not use any covariate to estimate the clusters. The
estimated clusters are analyzed as ""levels of alert"" to identify cities in a
possible critical situation. In the second and final stage, we propose a
functional quantile regression model of the death curves on a number of scalar
socioeconomic and demographic indicators in order to investigate their
functional effects at different levels of the cumulative number of deaths over

better curve fit at different levels of the cumulative number of deaths

physical conditions in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), the birthplace of planets.
The large radial and vertical temperature as well as density gradients in these
PPDs lead to a complex chemical composition, making chemistry an important step
to understand the variety of planetary systems. We aimed to study the chemical
content of the protoplanetary disk surrounding GG Tau A, a well-known triple T
Tauri system. We used NOEMA with the new correlator PolyFix to observe
rotational lines at 2.6 to 4 mm from a few dozen molecules. We analysed the
data with a radiative transfer code to derive molecular densities and the
abundance relative to $^{13}$CO, which we compare to those of the TMC1 cloud
and LkCa15 disk. We report the first detection of CCS in PPDs. We also
marginally detect OCS and find 16 other molecules in the GG Tauri outer disk.
Ten of them had been found previously, while seven others ($^{13}$CN,
N$_2$H$^+$, HNC, DNC, HC$_3$N, CCS, and C$^{34}$S) are new detections in this
disk. The analysis confirms that sulphur chemistry is not yet properly
understood. The D/H ratio, derived from DCO$^{+}$/HCO$^{+}$, DCN/HCN, and
DNC/HNC ratios, points towards a low temperature chemistry. The detection of
the rare species CCS confirms that GG Tau is a good laboratory to study the
protoplanetary disk chemistry, thanks to its large disk size and mass.

specifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art
saliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the
saliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,
including: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that
camouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,
which warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually
collapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect
akin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully
replace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting
effects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system
(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to
harmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),
and, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the
pretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision. We present results
on a variety of natural images and conduct a perceptual study to evaluate and
validate the changes in viewers' eye-gaze between the original images and our

  This revision fixes typos and minor errors",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning hierarchical structures in sequential data -- from simple
algorithmic patterns to natural language -- in a reliable, generalizable way
remains a challenging problem for neural language models. Past work has shown
that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out
algorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias.
To remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various
differentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata
(PDAs). In this paper, we improve the performance of our recently proposed
Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN), which uses a differentiable data structure
that simulates a nondeterministic PDA, with two important changes. First, the
model now assigns unnormalized positive weights instead of probabilities to
stack actions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training.
Second, the model can directly observe the state of the underlying PDA. Our
model achieves lower cross-entropy than all previous stack RNNs on five
context-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05 nats of the
information-theoretic lower bound), including a task on which the NS-RNN
previously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline. Finally, we
propose a restricted version of the NS-RNN that incrementally processes
infinitely long sequences, and we present language modeling results on the Penn
Treebank.

allowed. In this setting, many methods directly attack surrogate models and
transfer the obtained adversarial examples to fool the target model. Plenty of
previous works investigated what kind of attacks to the surrogate model can
generate more transferable adversarial examples, but their performances are
still limited due to the mismatches between surrogate models and the target
model. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel angle -- instead of
using the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM)
such that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to other models? We
show that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a well-posed
(bi-level-like) optimization problem and design a differentiable attacker to
make training feasible. Given one or a set of surrogate models, our method can
thus obtain an MSM such that adversarial examples generated on MSM enjoy
eximious transferability. Comprehensive experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet
demonstrate that by attacking the MSM, we can obtain stronger transferable
adversarial examples to fool black-box models including adversarially trained
ones, with much higher success rates than existing methods. The proposed method
reveals significant security challenges of deep models and is promising to be
served as a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating the robustness of deep
models in the black-box setting.

zero and finite temperatures. The approach makes use of Hartree-Fock theory and
exploits the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and of the order parameters yielding a
closed system of transcendental equations for the free energy, fully avoiding
the use of selfconsistency. Our results are consistent with recent experiments
and allow us to explain qualitatively the different types of observed quench
dynamics. In addition, we found that similar phenomena should occur in
antiferromagnetic spinor condensates with a sudden change in the temperature.

specifying models for the treatment assignment mechanism, which is unknown in
observational studies. This leaves researchers to choose the proper weighting
method and the appropriate covariate functions for these models without knowing
the correct combination to achieve distributional balance. In response to these
difficulties, we propose a nonparametric generalization of several other
weighting schemes found in the literature: Causal Optimal Transport. This new
method directly targets distributional balance by minimizing optimal transport
distances between treatment and control groups or, more generally, between any
source and target population. Our approach is semiparametrically efficient and
model-free but can also incorporate moments or any other important functions of
covariates that a researcher desires to balance. Moreover, our method can
provide nonparametric estimate the conditional mean outcome function and we
give rates for the convergence of this estimator. Moreover, we show how this
method can provide nonparametric imputations of the missing potential outcomes
and give rates of convergence for this estimator. We find that Causal Optimal
Transport outperforms competitor methods when both the propensity score and
outcome models are misspecified, indicating it is a robust alternative to
common weighting methods. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method in
an external control trial examining the effect of misoprostol versus oxytocin
for the treatment of post-partum hemorrhage.

  network inference",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microbes can affect processes from food production to human health. Such
microbes are not isolated, but rather interact with each other and establish
connections with their living environments. Understanding these interactions is
essential to an understanding of the organization and complex interplay of
microbial communities, as well as the structure and dynamics of various
ecosystems. A common and essential approach toward this objective involves the
inference of microbiome interaction networks. Although network inference
methods in other fields have been studied before, applying these methods to
estimate microbiome associations based on compositional data will not yield
valid results. On the one hand, features of microbiome data such as
compositionality, sparsity and high-dimensionality challenge the data
normalization and the design of computational methods. On the other hand,
several issues like microbial community heterogeneity, external environmental
interference and biological concerns also make it more difficult to deal with
the network inference. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
emerging microbiome interaction network inference methods. According to various
assumptions and research targets, estimated networks are divided into four main
categories: correlation networks, conditional correlation networks, mixture
networks and differential networks. Their scope of applications, advantages and
limitations are presented in this review. Since real microbial interactions can
be complex and dynamic, no unifying method has captured all the aspects of
interest to date. In addition, we discuss the challenges now confronting
current microbial associations study and future prospects. Finally, we
highlight that the research in microbial network inference requires the joint
promotion of statistical computation methods and experimental techniques.

inversion of an environment-dependent atomistic tight binding description of

superior performance. These properties significantly limit the ionization rate
of one carrier type, either holes or electrons, making the avalanche
multiplication process unipolar in nature. The unipolar behavior in turn
reduces the stochasticity of the multiplication gain. The effects of band
folding on carrier transport are studied using the Non-Equilibrium Green's
Function Method that accounts for quantum tunneling, and Boltzmann Transport
Equation model for scattering. It is shown here that carrier transport by
intraband tunneling and optical phonon scattering are reduced in materials with

technique under multisource streaming processes, namely automatic online

existence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary
information sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different

of outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation

understand the entropy production of a continuously measured, zero-temperature

zero temperature, if one uses the classical definition of inverse temperature
$\beta$, then the entropy production becomes divergent. Our analysis shows that
the entropy production can be well defined at zero temperature by considering
the entropy produced in the measurement record leading to an effective inverse
temperature $\beta_{\rm eff}$ which does not diverge. We link this result to
the Cram\'er-Rao inequality and show that the product of the Fisher information
of the work distribution with the entropy production is bounded below by half
of the square of the effective inverse temperature $\beta_{\rm eff}$. This
inequality indicates that there is a minimal amount of entropy production that

invariants of ""double brane"" and ""ghost brane"" solutions in $a$-gauge seem to

promising performance for speech enhancement (SE), while one intractable
shortcoming of these CycleGAN-based SE systems is that the noise components
propagate throughout the cycle and cannot be completely eliminated.
Additionally, conventional CycleGAN-based SE systems only estimate the spectral
magnitude, while the phase is unaltered. Motivated by the multi-stage learning
concept, we propose a novel two-stage denoising system that combines a
CycleGAN-based magnitude enhancing network and a subsequent complex spectral
refining network in this paper. Specifically, in the first stage, a
CycleGAN-based model is responsible for only estimating magnitude, which is
subsequently coupled with the original noisy phase to obtain a coarsely
enhanced complex spectrum. After that, the second stage is applied to further
suppress the residual noise components and estimate the clean phase by a
complex spectral mapping network, which is a pure complex-valued network
composed of complex 2D convolution/deconvolution and complex temporal-frequency
attention blocks. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that
the proposed approach consistently surpasses previous one-stage CycleGANs and
other state-of-the-art SE systems in terms of various evaluation metrics,
especially in background noise suppression.

function that provides a non-interactively public verifiable proof for the
correctness of its output. Recently, VRFs have found essential applications in
blockchain design, such as random beacons and proof-of-stake consensus
protocols. To our knowledge, the first generation of blockchain systems used
inherently inefficient proof-of-work consensuses, and the research community
tried to achieve the same properties by proposing proof-of-stake schemes where
resource-intensive proof-of-work is emulated by cryptographic constructions.
Unfortunately, those most discussed proof-of-stake consensuses (e.g., Algorand
and Ouroborous family) are not future-proof because the building blocks are
secure only under the classical hard assumptions; in particular, their designs
ignore the advent of quantum computing and its implications. In this paper, we
propose a generic compiler to obtain the post-quantum VRF from the simple VRF
solution using symmetric-key primitives (e.g., non-interactive zero-knowledge
system) with an intrinsic property of quantum-secure. Our novel solution is
realized via two efficient zero-knowledge systems ZKBoo and ZKB++,
respectively, to validate the compiler correctness. Our proof-of-concept
implementation indicates that even today, the overheads introduced by our
solution are acceptable in real-world deployments. We also demonstrate
potential applications of a quantum-secure VRF, such as quantum-secure
decentralized random beacon and lottery-based proof of stake consensus

contribution from the final Higgs boson radiation off the top quark in the
loop, which is {more than} three orders of magnitudes over the charm quark at
tree level, the production of prompt $J/\psi$ associated with Higgs boson has
great potential to be detected. The prompt $J/\psi$ production includes the
direct production and indirect production via radiative or hadronic decays of
high excited charmonium states. For the direct $J/\psi + H$ production via
gluon fusion loop-induced, the ${}^{3}S^{(8)}_1$ Fock state gives dominant
contribution to the cross section, which is about 95\% to the total direct
production. The indirect contribution via loop-induced is appreciable, since
the summation of which from $\psi(2S) + H$, $\chi_{c1} + H$ and $\chi_{c2} + H$
is about $34\%$ to the total cross section of prompt $J/\psi + H$. While the
indirect contribution from $\chi_{c0} + H$ is tiny, which can be neglected.
With the great potential to be detected, prompt $J/\psi$ production in

features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the
hierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of
the scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph
classification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity

own experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph
recurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial
observability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph,
use the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication
between neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record
historical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we
design a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a
configurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we
proposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic
variant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks
and one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves
clear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the
interpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model.

  some minor shortcomings. Main statements are unchanged",,,,"math.AG math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complex Chern-Simons bundles are line bundles with connection, originating in
the study of quantization of moduli spaces of flat connections with complex
gauge groups. In this paper we introduce and study these bundles in the
families setting.
  The central object is a functorial direct image of characteristic classes of
vector bundles with connections, for which we develop a formalism. Our strategy
elaborates on Deligne-Elkik's intersection bundles, and a refined Chern-Simons
theory which parallels the use of Bott-Chern classes in Arakelov geometry. In
the context of moduli spaces, we are confronted with flat relative connections
on families of Riemann surfaces. To be able to rely on the functorial approach,
we prove canonical extension results to global connections, inspired by the
deformation theory of harmonic maps in non-abelian Hodge theory.
  The relative complex Chern-Simons bundle $\mathcal{L}_{CS}$ is then defined
as a functorial direct image of the second Chern class on the relative moduli
space of flat vector bundles. We establish the crystalline nature of
$\mathcal{L}_{CS}$, and the existence of a holomorphic extension of natural
metrics from Arakelov geometry. The curvature of $\mathcal{L}_{CS}$ can be
expressed in terms of the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman form, in agreement with the
classical topological approach.
  To highlight a few applications, we first mention a characterization of
projective structures of Riemann surfaces in terms of connections on
intersection bundles. In particular, we settle a conjecture of
Bertola-Korotkin-Norton on the comparison between the Bergman and the Bers
projective structures. This is the problem of determining the accessory
parameters of quasi-Fuchsian uniformizations. A conjecture of Cappell-Miller is
also established, to the effect that their holomorphic torsion satisfies a
Riemann-Roch formula.

robustness of deep learning models against distribution shifts. However,
existing works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization,
domain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of
deep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal
performance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture
based on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor
generalization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural
Architecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the
architecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient
descent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by
maximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal
for architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that
minimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural
architecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax
training process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize
well for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show
that NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization
benchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In
addition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the
error rate by more than 70% compared with the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating the proposed method's practicality for real applications.

integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to
improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic

networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR).
CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and

historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR
utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually
provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive

Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental
results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent

spontaneously break the translation and rotation symmetry of their response
functions -- an archetypal example of unsupervised learning. The dominant
framework for unsupervised learning in biology is Hebb's principle, but how
Hebbian learning could break such symmetries is a longstanding biophysical
riddle. Theoretical studies agree that this should require inputs to visual
cortex to invert the relative magnitude of their correlations at long
distances. Empirical measurements have searched in vain for such an inversion,
and report the opposite to be true. We formally approach the question through
the hermitianization of a multi-layer model, which maps it into a problem of
zero-temperature phase transitions. In the emerging phase diagram, both
symmetries break spontaneously as long as (1) recurrent interactions are
sufficiently long-range and (2) Hebbian competition is duly accounted for. The
relevant mechanism for symmetry breaking is competition among connections
sprouting from the same afferent cell. Such competition, and not the structure
of the inputs, is capable of triggering the broken-symmetry phase required by
image processing. We provide analytic predictions on the relative magnitudes of
the relevant length-scales needed for this novel mechanism to occur. These
results reconcile experimental observations to the Hebbian paradigm, shed light
on a new mechanism for visual cortex development, and contribute to our growing
understanding of the relationship between learning and symmetry breaking.

recombination and fast trapping within 2.7 ns, followed by slower multiple
trapping events. The latter are less pronounced on polyimide, which leads to
the higher bandwidth. We show that all devices are RC-time limited and that
improvements of the photoresistance are the key to further increasing the
bandwidth.

Value (SV)-based techniques have been widely adopted to provide fair evaluation

computation costs, making them difficult to apply in practice. In this paper,
we propose the Guided Truncation Gradient Shapley (GTG-Shapley) approach to

calculation instead of repeatedly training with different combinations of FL
participants. In addition, we design a guided Monte Carlo sampling approach

demonstrate that GTG-Shapley can closely approximate actual Shapley values,

photons is spontaneous four-wave mixing in optical fibers, allowing for a
well-defined spatial mode, for high efficiency integration into optical fiber
networks. These fibers are typically pumped using large, commercial, pulsed
lasers requiring high-power (~10 W) pump lasers and are limited to ~MHz
repetition rate. Here we propose a cost-efficient, compact and mobile
alternative. Photon pairs at 660 nm and 960 nm will be created using four-wave
mixing in commercial birefringent optical fiber, pumped using transform limited
picosecond pulses with GHz repetition rates derived from a 785 nm CW laser
diode using cavity-enhanced optical frequency comb generation. The pulses are
predicted to have average power of 275 mW, a peak power of >40 W, and predicted
photon yield of >2000 pairs detected per second. This design will be later

studied on the heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple types of nodes and
edges, posing great challenges for modeling the high-order relationship between
nodes. With the surge of graph embedding mechanism, it has also been adopted to
community detection. A remarkable group of works use the meta-path to capture
the high-order relationship between nodes and embed them into nodes' embedding
to facilitate community detection. However, defining meaningful meta-paths
requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications,
especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. To
alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose to exploit the context path to
capture the high-order relationship between nodes, and build a Context
Path-based Graph Neural Network (CP-GNN) model. It recursively embeds the
high-order relationship between nodes into the node embedding with attention
mechanisms to discriminate the importance of different relationships. By
maximizing the expectation of the co-occurrence of nodes connected by context
paths, the model can learn the nodes' embeddings that both well preserve the
high-order relationship between nodes and are helpful for community detection.
Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets show that CP-GNN
outperforms the state-of-the-art community detection methods.

for describing software requirements. However, there are many ways to express
such conditionals in natural language and also many ways how they can be

source of ambiguity, potentially affecting downstream activities such as test
case generation negatively. Objective: Our goal is to understand how specific
conditionals are interpreted by readers who work with requirements. Method: We
conduct a descriptive survey with 104 RE practitioners and ask how they
interpret 12 different conditional clauses. We map their interpretations to
logical formulas written in Propositional (Temporal) Logic and discuss the
implications. Results: The conditionals in our tested requirements were
interpreted ambiguously. We found that practitioners disagree on whether an
antecedent is only sufficient or also necessary for the consequent.
Interestingly, the disagreement persists even when the system behavior is known
to the practitioners. We also found that certain cue phrases are associated
with specific interpretations. Conclusion: Conditionals in requirements are a
source of ambiguity and there is not just one way to interpret them formally.
This affects any analysis that builds upon formalized requirements (e.g.,
inconsistency checking, test-case generation). Our results may also influence

different choices of quasiperiodic parameters $\beta$ to be a member of the
metallic mean family. We find that when the power-law exponent is in the $a<1$
regime, the system displays a delocalized-to-multifractal (DM) edge in its
eigenstate spectrum. For the $a>1$ case, a delocalized-to-localized (DL) edge
exists, also called the mobility edge. While a striking feature of the
Hermitian AA model with long-range hopping is that the fraction of delocalized
states can be obtained from a general sequence manifesting a mathematical
feature of the metallic mean family, we find that the DM or DL edge for the
non-Hermitian cases is independent of the mathematical feature of the metallic
mean family. To understand this difference, we consider a specific case of the
non-Hermitian long-range AA model with $a=2$, for which we can apply the Sarnak
method to analytically derive its localization transition points and the exact
expression of the DL edge. Our analytical result clearly demonstrates that the

embedded in so-called generalized parton distributions, which are accessible
from deeply virtual Compton scattering. In this process, a high energy electron
is scattered off a nucleon by exchanging a virtual photon. Then, a
highly-energetic real photon is emitted from one of the quarks inside the
nucleon, which carries information on the quark's transverse position and
longitudinal momentum. By measuring the cross-section of deeply virtual Compton
scattering, Compton form factors related to the generalized parton
distributions can be extracted. Here, we report the observation of unpolarized
deeply virtual Compton scattering off a deuterium target. From the measured
photon-electroproduction cross-sections, we have extracted the cross-section of
a quasi-free neutron and a coherent deuteron. Due to the approximate isospin
symmetry of quantum chromodynamics, we can determine the contributions from the
different quark flavours to the helicity-conserved Compton form factors by
combining our measurements with previous ones probing the proton's internal
structure. These results advance our understanding of the description of the
nucleon structure, which is important to solve the proton spin puzzle.

autonomous behavior so that humans are aware of what is happening in the

complex multi-robot environments, especially those in which the robots are

currents in a solid-state magnetic medium by a stimulated spin pumping process.
The first is synchronous and consists of phase-locked pulses that perturb a
precessing magnetic moment. The second is asynchronous and is driven by DC spin
currents. The amplification relies on a non-adiabatic interaction taking place
in a ferromagnetic medium in which the magnetic moment emits spin angular
momentum in the form of spin current before equilibrating with the environment.
The pumped spin current amplifies or absorbs the injected AC spin current
mimicking the operation of the optical gain medium as readily seen from the
gain saturation profiles. The mechanisms we propose are a first step towards a

thermal, non-thermal and reflection components vary significantly in
transitions from LHS to HIMS. Also the quasi periodic oscillation (QPO) shows a
peculiar behavior during the state transition between LHS and HIMS: the RMS
drop of type C fundamental QPO is accompanied with showing-up of the second

representative nonequilibrium features in circuit quantum electrodynamics
systems. Here, we investigate quantum heat flow and two-photon correlation
function at steady-state in a composite qubit-resonator model, where one qubit
shows both transverse and longitudinal couplings to a single-mode optical
resonator. With weak qubit-resonator interaction, we unravel two microscopic
transport pictures, i.e., cotunneling and cyclic heat exchange processes,
corresponding to transverse and longitudinal couplings respectively. At strong
qubit-resonator coupling, the heat current exhibits nonmonotonic behavior by
increasing qubit-resonator coupling strength, which tightly relies on the
scattering processes between the qubit and corresponding thermal bath.
Furthermore, the longitudinal coupling is preferred to enhance heat current in
strong qubit-resonator coupling regime. For two-photon correlation function, it
exhibits an antibunching-to-bunching transition, which is mainly dominated by
the modulation of energy gap between the first and second excited eigenstates.
Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of nonequilibrium thermal
transport and nonclassical photon radiation based on the circuit quantum

prediction via the use of spatially correlated observation error covariance
information in data assimilation systems. In this case, the observation
weighting matrices (inverse error covariance matrices) used in the assimilation
may be full matrices rather than diagonal. Thus, the computation of
matrix-vector products in the variational minimization problem may be very
time-consuming, particularly if the parallel computation of the matrix-vector
product requires a high degree of communication between processing elements.
Hence, we introduce a well-known numerical approximation method, called the
fast multipole method (FMM), to speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in
data assimilation. We explore a particular type of FMM that uses a singular
value decomposition (SVD-FMM) and adjust it to suit our new application in data
assimilation. By approximating a large part of the computation of the
matrix-vector product, the SVD-FMM technique greatly reduces the computational
complexity compared with the standard approach. We develop a novel possible
parallelization scheme of the SVD-FMM for our application, which can reduce the
communication costs. We investigate the accuracy of the SVD-FMM technique in
several numerical experiments: we first assess the accuracy using covariance
matrices that are created using different correlation functions and
lengthscales; then investigate the impact of reconditioning the covariance
matrices on the accuracy; and finally examine the feasibility of the technique
in the presence of missing observations. We also provide theoretical
explanations for some numerical results. Our results show that the SVD-FMM
technique has potential as an efficient technique for assimilation of a large
volume of observational data within a short time interval.

to solve unconstrained and constrained problems of nonsmooth optimization by
using tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation. Both
methods are coderivative-based and employ generalized Hessians (coderivatives
of subgradient mappings) associated with objective functions, which are either
of class $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$, or are represented in the form of convex
composite optimization, where one of the terms may be extended-real-valued. The
proposed globally convergent algorithms are of two types. The first one extends
the damped Newton method and requires positive-definiteness of the generalized
Hessians for its well-posedness and efficient performance, while the other
algorithm is of {the regularized Newton type} being well-defined when the
generalized Hessians are merely positive-semidefinite. The obtained convergence
rates for both methods are at least linear, but become superlinear under the

theoretical model that is used to map susceptibility distributions from

developed by starting with the so-called Lorentz sphere on a microscopic scale.
After averaging over a macroscopic sample, it is assumed that the magnetic flux
density vanishes in the center of the sample. For the macroscopic problem of a
homogeneous sphere in a uniform field, we show that at the surface the normal
component of the flux density is not continuous, which contradicts Maxwell's

low-temperature properties of a second-order Dirac semimetal in terms of the

rotation symmetry is broken even in the continuum limit, and thus the
low-energy physics is controlled by two dimensionless parameters: the
dimensionless coupling constant and the ratio of the anisotropy parameters. We
show that the former flows to zero and the latter flows to a fixed value at low
energies. Thus, one may calculate physical quantities in terms of the
renormalized perturbation theory. As an application, we determine the
temperature dependence of the specific heat by solving the
renormalization-group equations. Following from the breaking of the full
rotation symmetry, there exists a crossover temperature scale $T_c$ (and a
length scale $L_c$). Physical quantities approach the values for the
first-order Dirac semimetal only when the temperature is much smaller than
$T_c$. Similarly, the screened Coulomb potential will become anisotropic when
the distance is smaller than $L_c$, while the unscreened form is recovered at

rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its

neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal
quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision
weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.
This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable
differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution
designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and
ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward
pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we
additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the
standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by
imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate
our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also
support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization
levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from

algebra satisfies $S^{2}=\operatorname*{id}$ (where $S^{2}=S\circ S$).
Recently, similar results have been obtained by Aguiar, Lauve and Mahajan for
connected graded Hopf algebras: Namely, if $H$ is a connected graded Hopf
algebra with grading $H=\bigoplus_{n\geq0}H_n$, then each positive integer $n$
satisfies $\left( \operatorname*{id}-S^2\right)^n \left( H_n\right) =0$ and
(even stronger) \[ \left( \left( \operatorname{id}+S\right) \circ\left(
\operatorname{id}-S^2\right)^{n-1}\right) \left( H_n\right) = 0. \] For some
specific $H$'s such as the Malvenuto--Reutenauer Hopf algebra
$\operatorname{FQSym}$, the exponents can be lowered.
  In this note, we generalize these results in several directions: We replace
the base field by a commutative ring, replace the Hopf algebra by a coalgebra
(actually, a slightly more general object, with no coassociativity required),
and replace both $\operatorname{id}$ and $S^2$ by ""coalgebra homomorphisms"" (of
sorts). Specializing back to connected graded Hopf algebras, we show that the
exponent $n$ in the identity $\left( \operatorname{id}-S^2\right) ^n \left(
H_n\right) =0$ can be lowered to $n-1$ (for $n>1$) if and only if $\left(
\operatorname{id} - S^2\right) \left( H_2\right) =0$. (A sufficient condition
for this is that every pair of elements of $H_1$ commutes; this is satisfied,
e.g., for $\operatorname{FQSym}$.)

differential equations $y_{xx}=J(x,y,y_{x})$ modulo fibre-preserving point
transformations $x\longmapsto \varphi(x)$, $y\longmapsto \psi(x,y)$ by using
Moser's method of normal forms. We first compute a basis of the Lie algebra
${\frak{g}}_{{\{y_{xx}=0\}}}$ of fibre-preserving symmetries of $y_{xx}=0$. In
the formal theory of Moser's method, this Lie algebra is used to give an
explicit description of the set of normal forms $\mathcal{N}$, and we show that
the set is an ideal in the space of formal power series. We then show the
existence of the normal forms by studying flows of suitable vector fields with
appropriate corrections by the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem. As an application,
we show how normal forms can be used to prove that the identical vanishing of
Hsu-Kamran primary invariants directly imply that the second order differential
equation is fibre-preserving point equivalent to $y_{xx}=0$.

as those of strange metal, bad metal or Planckian metal. However, a unified
description of metallic resistivity is still missing. An empirical analysis of
a large variety of metals shows that the parallel resistor formalism used in
the cuprates, which includes T-linear and T-quadratic dependence of the
electron scattering rates, can be used to provide a phenomenological
description of the electrical resistivity in all metals, where these two
contributions are shown to correspond to the two first terms of a Taylor
expansion of the resistivity, detached of their physics origin, and thus, valid
for any metal. Here we show that the different metallic classes are then
determined by the relative magnitude of these two components and the magnitude
of the extrapolated residual resistivity. These two parameters allow to
categorize a few systems that are notoriously hard to ascribe to one of the
currently accepted metallic classes. This approach also reveals that the
T-linear term has a common origin in all cases, strengthening the arguments
that propose the universal character of the Planckian dissipation bound.

problems that can be solved by the training of probabilistic models on a first
dataset with subsequent likelihood evaluation on a second dataset, where data
distributions differ. By defining the generalization of probabilistic models in
terms of likelihood we show that, in the case of image models, the OOD
generalization ability is dominated by local features. This motivates our
proposal of a Local Autoregressive model that exclusively models local image
features towards improving OOD performance. We apply the proposed model to OOD
detection tasks and achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised OOD detection
performance without the introduction of additional data. Additionally, we
employ our model to build a new lossless image compressor: NeLLoC (Neural Local
Lossless Compressor) and report state-of-the-art compression rates and model

entropic and geometric measures of discord under the influence of dissipative
channels for widely used two qubit X state with maximally mixed marginals.
Identifying the phenomena of the preservation, sudden change and revival of
quantum correlation quantifiers, we determine their hierarchy of robustness
under memory-less decoherence channels. We find the analytical expressions of
decoherence probabilities at which sudden change occur when the first qubit is
subjected to the decoherence channels for multiple times. We deduce the exact
analytical expression for the preservation time, the duration for which quantum
correlations remain unaffected by noise. We also find the time duration between
the two sudden change phenomena of trace distance discord, and show its inverse
proportionality to the number of times a channel operates on the state. The
constraint relations of decoherence probabilities corresponding to the sudden
change region and preservation phenomena are obtained when both the qubits are
subjected to locally independent quantum channels for multiple times. Our
investigation provides physical insights and possible practical implementation
of the discord measures in noisy environments.

molecular dynamics simulations predicted elastic behavior that reveals twinning
assisted pseudoelastic behavior. While mostly unexplored in body-centered-cubic

dislocation slip in crystalline solids. This alloy shows identical cyclic
deformation characteristics during uniaxial $\lt$100$\gt$ loading, i.e., the
pseudoelasticity is isotropic in loading direction. Additionally, a temperature
increase from 77 to 1500 K enhances the elastic strain recovery in load-unload

imaging platform, termed spectrally extended line field (SELF) OCTA that
provides advanced solutions to the above-mentioned challenges. SELF-OCTA breaks
the speed limitations and achieves two-fold gain in FOV without sacrificing
signal strength through parallel image acquisition. Towards quantitative
angiography, the 'frequency flow' imaging mechanism overcomes the imaging speed
bottleneck by obviating the requirement for superfluous B-scans. In addition,
the 'frequency flow' imaging mechanism facilitates OCTA-data based motion
tracking with overlap between adjacent line fields. Since it can be implemented
in any existing OCT device without significant hardware modification or
affecting existing functions, we expect that SELF-OCTA will make non-invasive,
wide field, quantitative, and low-cost angiographic imaging available to larger
patient populations.

formed from $G$ by deleting edges and vertices and by contracting edges. If $G$
does not have a graph $H$ as a minor, then we say that $G$ is $H$-free.
Hadwiger conjecture claim that the chromatic number of $G$ may be closely
related to whether it contains $K_{n+1}$ minors. To study the coloring of a
$K_{n+1}$-free $G$, we propose a new concept of reducible partition of vertex
set $V_G$ of $G$. A reducible partition(RP) of a graph $G$ with $K_n$ minors
and without $K_{n+1}$ minors is defined as a two-tuples $\{S_1 \subseteq
V_G,S_2\subseteq V_G\}$ which satisfy the following condisions:\\ (1) $S_1 \cup
S_2 = V_G, S_1 \cap S_2 = \emptyset $\\ (2) $S_2$ is dominated by $S_1$, \\ (3)
the induced subgraph $G\left[S_1\right]$ is a forest,\\ (4) the induced
subgraph $G\left[S_2\right]$ is $K_{n}$-free.\\ Further, one can obtain a
special reducible partition(SRP) $\{S_1,S_2\}$ of $V_G$, which satisf the
following condisions:\\ (1) $S_1 \cup S_2 = V_G, S_1 \cap S_2 = \emptyset $ \\
(2) $S_1$ is an independent set,\\ (4) the induced subgraph $G\left[S_2\right]$

graph. With the SRP of a $K_{n+1}$-free graph $G$, one can obtain some usefull

field (the \O{}rsted magnetic field), which can be calculated using the

Maxwell-Ampere equation is an established physical law that has can reproduce a
range of experimental observations. A key implication of this equation is that
the induction of \O{}rsted magnetic field is only a result of the displacement
of charge. A possible microscopic origin of \O{}rsted magnetic induction was
suggested in [J. Mag. Mag. Mat. 504, 166660 (2020)] (will be called the current
magnetization hypothesis (CMH) thereupon). The present work establishes
computationally, using simplified wire models, that the CMH reproduces the
results of the Maxwell-Ampere equation for wires with a square cross section. I
demonstrate that CMH could resolve the apparent contradiction between the
observed induced magnetic field and that predicted by the Maxwell-Ampere
equation in nanowires, as was reported in [Phys. Rev. B 99, 014436 (2019)]. The
CMH shows that a possible reason for such contradiction is the presence of
non-conductive surface layers in conductors.

general theory of relativity and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.
Over the years, it has been shown that the violation of the null energy
condition leads to instability and violation of causality. In quantum field
theory, violation of the energy condition also depends on the quantum states
apart from the geometry of curved spacetime. Hence, the quantum effects play an
important role in the violation of the null energy condition. We show that the
set of all the coherent states does not violate the null energy condition.
Further, we also show that under certain conditions, the null energy condition
is violated either by a pure state or a mixed state. Furthermore, the dynamical
violation of the null energy condition by the quantum states is also discussed
here.
