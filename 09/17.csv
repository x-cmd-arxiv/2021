spin-orbit coupling, is frequently observed in magnetically polarized systems.
Its realization in non-magnetic systems, however, remains elusive. Here, we
report on the observation of anomalous Hall effect in nominally non-magnetic
KTaO3. Anomalous Hall effect emerges in reduced KTaO3 and shows an extrinsic to
intrinsic crossover. A paramagnetic behavior is observed in reduced samples
using first principles calculations and quantitative magnetometry. The observed
anomalous Hall effect follows the oxygen vacancy-induced magnetization
response, suggesting that the localized magnetic moments of the oxygen
vacancies scatter conduction electrons asymmetrically and give rise to
anomalous Hall effect. The anomalous Hall conductivity becomes insensitive to
scattering rate in the low temperature limit (T<5 K), implying that the Berry
curvature of the electrons on the Fermi surface controls the anomalous Hall
effect. Our observations describe a detailed picture of many-body interactions,
triggering anomalous Hall effect in a non-magnetic system.

  System Resilience with Wind Power Penetration",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new deep learning (DL) based model-free robust method
for bulk system on-line load restoration with high penetration of wind power.
Inspired by the iterative calculation of the two-stage robust load restoration
model, the deep neural network (DNN) and deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) are respectively designed to find the worst-case system condition of a
load pickup decision and evaluate the corresponding security. In order to find
the optimal result within a limited number of checks, a load pickup checklist
generation (LPCG) algorithm is developed to ensure the optimality. Then, the
fast robust load restoration strategy acquisition is achieved based on the
designed one-line strategy generation (OSG) algorithm. The proposed method
finds the optimal result in a model-free way, holds the robustness to handle
uncertainties, and provides real-time computation. It can completely replace
conventional robust optimization and supports on-line robust load restoration
which better satisfies the changeable restoration process. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is validated using the IEEE 30-bus system and the IEEE
118-bus system, showing high computational efficiency and considerable
accuracy.

  Non-Profits in Improving Maternal and Child Health",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The widespread availability of cell phones has enabled non-profits to deliver
critical health information to their beneficiaries in a timely manner. This
paper describes our work to assist non-profits that employ automated messaging
programs to deliver timely preventive care information to beneficiaries (new
and expecting mothers) during pregnancy and after delivery. Unfortunately, a
key challenge in such information delivery programs is that a significant
fraction of beneficiaries drop out of the program. Yet, non-profits often have
limited health-worker resources (time) to place crucial service calls for live
interaction with beneficiaries to prevent such engagement drops. To assist
non-profits in optimizing this limited resource, we developed a Restless
Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) system. One key technical contribution in this
system is a novel clustering method of offline historical data to infer unknown
RMAB parameters. Our second major contribution is evaluation of our RMAB system
in collaboration with an NGO, via a real-world service quality improvement
study. The study compared strategies for optimizing service calls to 23003
participants over a period of 7 weeks to reduce engagement drops. We show that
the RMAB group provides statistically significant improvement over other
comparison groups, reducing ~ 30% engagement drops. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the utility of RMABs in real
world public health settings. We are transitioning our RMAB system to the NGO
for real-world use.

meson effective theories and the flavored couplings of charmed and light mesons
in the definition of their effective Lagrangians. We point out how
nonperturbative continuum QCD approaches based on Dyson-Schwinger and
Bethe-Salpeter equations can be used to calculate strong and leptonic decays of
open-charm mesons and heavy quarkonia. The strong decay $D^*\to D\pi$ serves as
a benchmark, as it is the only physical open-charm observable that can be
related to the effective Lagrangian's couplings. Nonetheless, a quantitative
comparison of $D^*D\pi$, $\rho DD$, $\rho D^*D$ and $\rho D^* D^*$ couplings
for a range of off-shell momenta of the $\rho$-meson invalidates SU(4)$_F$
symmetry relations between these couplings. Thus, besides the breaking of
flavor symmetry by mass terms in the Lagrangians, the flavor-symmetry breaching
in couplings and their dependence on the $\rho$-meson virtuality cannot be
ignored. We also take the opportunity to present new results for the effective
$J/\psi DD$ and $J/\psi D^*D$ couplings. We conclude this contribution with a
discussion on how the description of pseudoscalar and vector $D$, $D_s$, $B$
and $B_s$ meson properties can be drastically improved with a modest
modification of the flavor-dependence in the Bethe-Salpeter equation.

the proposed framework, each neuron of the neural networks corresponds to a

network to learn the wGSTL operators and then train a second neural network to
learn the parameters in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We use a COVID-19

chaotic and complex, meaning that strong reducing hypotheses are required to

Gallavotti and Cohen states that the large-scale dynamics of high-dimensional
systems are effectively uniformly hyperbolic, which implies many felicitous
statistical properties. We obtain direct and reliable numerical evidence,
contrary to the chaotic hypothesis, of the existence of non-hyperbolic
large-scale dynamical structures in a mean-field coupled system. To do this we
reduce the system to its thermodynamic limit, which we approximate numerically
with a Chebyshev basis transfer operator discretisation. This enables us to
obtain a high precision estimate of a homoclinic tangency, implying a failure
of uniform hyperbolicity. Robust non-hyperbolic behaviour is expected under
perturbation. As a result, the chaotic hypothesis should not be {\it a priori}
assumed to hold in all systems, and a better understanding of the domain of its
validity is required.

such dynamical systems often requires to reason about complex spatio-temporal
properties of physical and/or computational entities that are dynamically
interconnected and arranged in a particular spatial configuration.
Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL) is a recent logic-based formal
language designed to specify and to reason about spatio-temporal properties.
STREL considers each system's entity as a node of a dynamic weighted graph
representing their spatial arrangement. Each node generates a set of
mixed-analog signals describing the evolution over time of computational and
physical quantities characterising the node's behavior. While there are offline
algorithms available for monitoring STREL specifications over logged simulation
traces, here we investigate for the first time an online algorithm enabling the
runtime verification during the system's execution or simulation. Our approach
extends the original framework by considering imprecise signals and by
enhancing the logics' semantics with the possibility to express partial
guarantees about the conformance of the system's behavior with its
specification. Finally, we demonstrate our approach in a real-world
environmental monitoring case study.

to improve interface sharpness in AlSb/GaSb short-period superlattices. These
interventions include substrate temperature, III:Sb flux ratio, and the use of
a bismuth surfactant. Superlattices are characterized by high-resolution x-ray

queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no two queens can attack one
another. The toroidal $n$-queens problem asks the same question where the board
is considered on the surface of the torus and was asked by P\'{o}lya in 1918.
Let $Q(n)$ denote the number of $n$-queens configurations on the classical
board and $T(n)$ the number of toroidal $n$-queens configurations. P\'{o}lya
showed that $T(n)>0$ if and only if $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$ and much more
recently, in 2017, Luria showed that $T(n)\leq ((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n$ and
conjectured equality when $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$. Our main result is a proof of
this conjecture, thus answering P\'{o}lya's question asymptotically.
Furthermore, we also show that $Q(n)\geq((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n$ for all $n$
sufficiently large, which was independently proved by Luria and Simkin.
Combined with our main result and an upper bound of Luria, this completely
settles a conjecture of Rivin, Vardi and Zimmmerman from 1994 regarding both
$Q(n)$ and $T(n)$. Our proof combines a random greedy algorithm to count
'almost' configurations with a complex absorbing strategy that uses ideas from
the recently developed methods of randomised algebraic construction and
iterative absorption.

scientific and technological importance, from investigations of topologically
protected edge states in condensed matter systems to wavefront engineering,
isolation, and unidirectional communication. When dealing with large networks
of oscillators, the control over the chirality of the bulk states becomes
significantly more complicated and requires complex apparatus for generating
asymmetric coupling or artificial gauge fields. Here we present a new approach
for precise control over the chirality of a triangular array of hundreds of
symmetrically-coupled lasers, by introducing a weak non-Hermitian complex
potential, requiring only local on-site control of loss and frequency. In the
unperturbed network, lasing states with opposite chirality (staggered vortex
and staggered anti-vortex) are equally probable. We show that by tuning the
complex potential to an exceptional point, a nearly pure chiral lasing state is
achieved. While our approach is applicable to any oscillators network, we
demonstrate how the inherent non-linearity of the lasers effectively pulls the
network to the exceptional point, making the chirality extremely resilient
against noises and imperfections.

$n$-point correlators in $SU(N)$ ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills
theory are determined. The analysis generalises previous results on the
integrated correlator of four superconformal primaries and is based on
supersymmetric localisation. The integrated correlators are functions of $N$
and $\tau=\theta/(2\pi)+4\pi i/g_{_{YM}}^2$, and are expressed as
two-dimensional lattice sums that are modular forms with holomorphic and
anti-holomorphic weights $(w,-w)$ where $w=n-4$. The correlators satisfy
Laplace-difference equations that relate the $SU(N+1)$, $SU(N)$ and $SU(N-1)$
expressions and generalise the equations previously found in the $w=0$ case.
The correlators can be expressed as infinite sums of Eisenstein modular forms
of weight $(w,-w)$. For any fixed value of $N$ the perturbation expansion of
this correlator is found to start at order $( g_{_{YM}}^2 N)^w$. The
contributions of Yang--Mills instantons of charge $k>0$ are of the form $q^k\,
f(g_{_{YM}})$, where $q=e^{2\pi i \tau}$ and $f(g_{_{YM}})= O(g_{_{YM}}^{-2w})$
when $g_{_{YM}}^2 \ll 1$. Anti-instanton contributions have charge $k<0$ and
are of the form $\bar q^{|k|} \, \hat f(g_{_{YM}})$, where $\hat f(g_{_{YM}}) =
O(g_{_{YM}}^{2w})$ when $g_{_{YM}}^2 \ll 1$. Properties of the large-$N$
expansion are in agreement with expectations based on the low energy expansion
of flat-space type IIB superstring amplitudes. We also comment on the
identification of $n$-point free-field MUV correlators with the integrands of
$(n-4)$-loop perturbative contributions to the four-point correlator. In
particular, we emphasise the important r\^ole of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$-covariance

$H$ is the magnetic field, with $\rho_H$ and $\rho_0$ being the resistivity at
$H$ and zero field, respectively. Here we report a violation originating from
thermally-induced change in the carrier density. We find that the
magnetoresistance of the Weyl semimetal, TaP, follows an extended Kohler$^,$s
rule $MR = f[H/(n_T\rho_0)]$, with $n_T$ describing the temperature dependence
of the carrier density. We show that $n_T$ is associated with the Fermi level
and the dispersion relation of the semimetal, providing a new way to reveal
information on the electronic bandstructure. We offer a fundamental
understanding of the violation and validity of Kohler$^,$s rule in terms of
different temperature-responses of $n_T$. We apply our extended Kohler$^,$s

SE, such as requirements engineers, stakeholders and other developers, and it
is thus a highly human dependent process in software engineering (SE).
Identifying how human aspects such as personality, motivation, emotions,
communication, gender, culture and geographic distribution might impact RE
would assist us in better supporting successful RE. The main objective of this
paper is to systematically review primary studies that have investigated the
effects of various human aspects on RE. A systematic literature review (SLR)
was conducted and identified 474 initial primary research studies. These were
eventually filtered down to 74 relevant, high-quality primary studies. Among
the studies, the effects of communication have been considered in many RE
studies. Other human aspects such as personality, motivation and gender have
mainly been investigated to date related to SE studies including RE as one
phase. Findings show that studying more than one human aspect together is
beneficial, as this reveals relationships between various human aspects and how
they together impact the RE process. However, the majority of these studied
combinations of human aspects are unique. From 56.8% of studies that identified
the effects of human aspects on RE, 40.5% identified the positive impact, 30.9%

related to the presence of bright active regions and darker coronal holes. The
variations of the FUV/EUV source radiation can be expected to affect the
Lyman-alpha backscatter glow measured by spaceborne instruments. In particular,
inferring the heliolatitudinal structure of the solar wind from helioglow
variations in the sky can be quite challenging if the heliolatitudinal
structure of the solar FUV/EUV radiation is not properly included in the
modeling of the heliospheric glow. We present results of analysis of the
heliolatitudinal structure of the solar Lyman-alpha radiation as inferred from
comparison of SOHO/SWAN satellite observations of the helioglow intensity with
modeling results obtained from the recently-developed WawHelioGlow model. We
find that in addition to time-dependent heliolatitudinal anisotropy of the
solar wind, also time-dependent heliolatitudinal variations of the intensity of
the solar Lyman-alpha and photoionizing emissions must be taken into account to
reproduce the observed helioglow modulation in the sky. We present a particular
latitudinal and temporal dependence of the solar Lyman-alpha flux obtained as a
result of our analysis. We analyze also differences between polar-equatorial
anisotropies close to the solar surface and seen by an observer located far
from the Sun. We discuss the implications of these findings for the
interpretation of heliospheric-glow observations.

transition of dual structure and system. The reform of its economic system has
brought off a long period of transformation. The allocation of factors is
subjected to the dualistic regulation of planning or administration and market
due to the dualistic system, and thus the signal distortion will be a commonly

institutional distortions of population birth, population flow, land
transaction and housing supply, with the changing of export, may cause great
influences on the production demand, which includes the iterative contraction
of consumption, the increase of export competitive cost, the widening of
urban-rural income gap, the transferring of residents' income and the crowding
out of consumption. In view of the worldwide shift from a conservative model
with more income than expenditure to the debt-based model with more expenditure
than income and the need for loose monetary policy, we must explore a basic
model that includes variables of debt and land assets that affecting money
supply and price changes, especially in China, where the current debt ratio is
high and is likely to rise continuously. Based on such a logical framework of

This sensor combines the phase detection capability of a conical optical fiber,
with velocity measurements from the Doppler signal induced by an interface
approaching the extremity of a single-mode fiber. The analysis of the probe
functioning and of its response in controlled situations, have shown that the
Doppler probe provides the translation velocity of bubbles projected along the
probe axis. A reliable signal processing routine has been developed that
exploits the Doppler signal arising at the gas-to-liquid transition: the
resulting uncertainty on velocity is at most 14\%. Such a Doppler probe
provides statistics on velocity and on size of gas inclusions, as well as local
variables including void fraction, gas volumetric flux, number density and its
flux. That sensor has been successfully exploited in an air-tap water bubble
column 0.4m in diameter for global gas hold-up from 2.5 to 30\%. In the
heterogeneous regime, the transverse profiles of the mean bubble velocity
scaled by the value on the axis happen to be self-similar in the quasi fully

addition, on the axis, the standard deviation of bubble velocity scaled by the
mean velocity increases with Vsg in the homogeneous regime, and it remains
stable, close to 0.55, in the heterogeneous regime.

from four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and give a unified action for a class
of these models. We begin with a review of recent work by several authors on
the classical generation of integrable sigma models from four dimensional
Chern-Simons theory. This approach involves introducing classes of
two-dimensional defects into the bulk on which the gauge field must satisfy
certain boundary conditions. One finds integrable sigma models from
four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory by substituting the solutions to its
equations of motion back into the action. The integrability of these sigma
models is guaranteed because the gauge field is gauge equivalent to the Lax
connection of the sigma model. By considering a theory with two
four-dimensional Chern-Simons fields coupled together on two-dimensional
surfaces in the bulk we are able to introduce new classes of `gauged' defects.
By solving the bulk equations of motion we find a unified action for a set of
genus zero integrable gauged sigma models. The integrability of these models is
guaranteed as the new coupling does not break the gauge equivalence of the
gauge fields to their Lax connections. Finally, we consider a couple of
examples in which we derive the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten and nilpotent gauged
Wess-Zumino-Witten models. This latter model is of note given one can find the

face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice was suggested to unveil an octupolar order
offering a rare example in $d$-orbital systems. The proposed order requires a
ferromagnetic (FM) octupolar interaction, since the antiferromagnetic (AFM)
Ising model is highly frustrated on the fcc lattice. A microscopic model was
recently derived for various lattices: for an edge-sharing octahedra geometry,
AFM Ising octupolar and bond-dependent quadrupolar interactions were found when

together with tight-binding parameters obtained by density functional theory,
we estimate the exchange interactions for the osmium double perovskites,
Ba$_2$BOsO$_6$ (B=Mg,Cd, and Ca). Using classical Monte Carlo simulations, we
find that these systems are close to the phase boundary between AFM type-I

group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behavior that generates
collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its
own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behavior
within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in
proportion to their fitness. Finally, cooperative behavior may also spread
globally. As expected, we find that cooperation and institutions are mutually
reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioral source-sink dynamics when
cooperation generated in institutional groups spreads to non-institutional
groups, boosting their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of
cooperation creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the
evolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a
group-structured society, large-scale change in behavior and institutions (i.e.
social change) can be best achieved when the two remain correlated, such as

a part of the blazar multi-wavelength studies, several methods of analyses, e.
g., flux distribution and RMS-flux relation, are performed on the observations
with an aim to compare the results with the similar ones in the \gama-ray band
presented in Bhatta & Dhital 2020. It is found that, similar to $\gamma$-ray
band, blazars display significant variability in the optical band that can be
characterized with log-normal flux distribution and a power-law dependence of
RMS on flux. It could be an indication of possible inherent linear RMS-flux
relation, yet the scatter in the data does not allow to rule out other
possibilities. When comparing variability properties in the two bands, the
blazars in the \gama-rays are found to exhibit stronger variability with
steeper possible linear RMS-flux relation and the flux distribution that is
more skewed towards higher fluxes. The cross-correlation study shows that
except for the source 3C 273, the overall optical and the $\gamma$-ray emission
in the sources are highly correlated, suggesting a co-spatial existence of the
particles responsible for both the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission. Moreover,
the sources S5 0716+714, Mrk 421, Mrk 501, PKS 1424-418 and PKS 2155-304

state $\omega ^{\ast }$. We apply the slow-roll approximation in the high
energy limit to constrain the parameters of D-term hybrid potential. We show
also that some inflationary parameters, in particular, the spectral index
$n_{s}$ demand that the potential parameter $\alpha$ is bounded as $\alpha \geq
1$ to be consistent with $Planck$'s data, while the ratio $r$ is in agreement
with observation for $ \alpha \leq 1 $ considering high inflationary e-folds.
We also propose an investigation of the brane tension effect on the reheating
temperature. Comparing our results to recent CMB measurements, we study
preheating and reheating parameters $N_{re}$, $T_{re}$ and $N_{pre}$ in the
Hybrid D-term inflation model in the range $0.8\leq \alpha\leq 1.1$\, and
conclude that $T_{re}$ and $N_{re}$ require $\alpha \leq 1$, while for
$N_{pre}$ the condition $\alpha \leq 0.9$ must be satisfied, to be compatible
with $Planck$'s results.

generation phase and ii) a two-stage stochastic program. For the first block, a
set of scenarios is selected with a simulation-based approach that captures the
behavior of the demand and allows us to come up with different solutions that

several novel ideas within our methodology: problem specific cuts that serve as
an approximation of the expected second stage costs as a function of first
stage decisions; an activation paradigm that guides our main optimization
procedure; and, a way of mapping feasible routes from one second-stage problem
data into another; among others. We performed experiments for two cases: the
first case considers the expected value of the demand, and the second case
considers the right tail of the demand distribution, seeking a conservative
solution. By using acceleration techniques we obtain solutions within 1 to 6

Clearly, these methods fail in real-world scenarios where the ground truth

methods focus on solving individual problems from scratch with an offline

can pool large amounts of data collected in various scenarios for solving
different tasks, and utilize all of this data to learn behaviors for all the
tasks more effectively rather than training each one in isolation. However,
sharing data across all tasks in multi-task offline RL performs surprisingly
poorly in practice. Thorough empirical analysis, we find that sharing data can
actually exacerbate the distributional shift between the learned policy and the
dataset, which in turn can lead to divergence of the learned policy and poor
performance. To address this challenge, we develop a simple technique for
data-sharing in multi-task offline RL that routes data based on the improvement
over the task-specific data. We call this approach conservative data sharing

states of target Hamiltonians on near-term quantum devices. None the less, it
remains necessary to limit the evolution time and circuit depth as much as
possible, since otherwise decoherence will degrade the computation. And even
where this is done, there always exists a non-negligible error in estimates of
the ground state energy. Here we present a scalable extrapolation approach to
mitigating this error, which significantly improves estimates obtained using
three of the most popular optimization algorithms: quantum annealing (QA), the
variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and quantum imaginary time evolution
(QITE), at fixed evolution time or circuit depth. The approach is based on
extrapolating the annealing time to infinity, or the variance of estimates to
zero. The method is reasonably robust against noise, and for Hamiltonians which
only involve few-body interactions, the additional computational overhead is an

methods in a range of NLP problems. Among them, dense phrase retrieval-the most
fine-grained retrieval unit-is appealing because phrases can be directly used
as the output for question answering and slot filling tasks. In this work, we
follow the intuition that retrieving phrases naturally entails retrieving
larger text blocks and study whether phrase retrieval can serve as the basis
for coarse-level retrieval including passages and documents. We first observe
that a dense phrase-retrieval system, without any retraining, already achieves
better passage retrieval accuracy (+3-5% in top-5 accuracy) compared to passage
retrievers, which also helps achieve superior end-to-end QA performance with
fewer passages. Then, we provide an interpretation for why phrase-level
supervision helps learn better fine-grained entailment compared to
passage-level supervision, and also show that phrase retrieval can be improved
to achieve competitive performance in document-retrieval tasks such as entity
linking and knowledge-grounded dialogue. Finally, we demonstrate how phrase
filtering and vector quantization can reduce the size of our index by 4-10x,
making dense phrase retrieval a practical and versatile solution in
multi-granularity retrieval.

prescriptive notion of optimal play, its applicability as a prescriptive tool
beyond that setting is limited. Consequently, the study of decentralized
learning dynamics that guarantee convergence to correlated solution concepts in
multiplayer, general-sum extensive-form (i.e., tree-form) games has become an
important topic of active research. The per-iteration complexity of the
currently known learning dynamics depends on the specific correlated solution
concept considered. For example, in the case of extensive-form correlated
equilibrium (EFCE), all known dynamics require, as an intermediate step at each
iteration, to compute the stationary distribution of multiple Markov chains, an
expensive operation in practice. Oppositely, in the case of normal-form coarse
correlated equilibrium (NFCCE), simple no-external-regret learning dynamics
that amount to a linear-time traversal of the tree-form decision space of each
agent suffice to guarantee convergence. This paper focuses on extensive-form
coarse correlated equilibrium (EFCCE), an intermediate solution concept that is
a subset of NFCCE and a superset of EFCE. Being a superset of EFCE, any
learning dynamics for EFCE automatically guarantees convergence to EFCCE.
However, since EFCCE is a simpler solution concept, this begs the question: do
learning dynamics for EFCCE that avoid the expensive computation of stationary
distributions exist? This paper answers the previous question in the positive.
Our learning dynamics only require the orchestration of no-external-regret
minimizers, thus showing that EFCCE is more akin to NFCCE than to EFCE from a
learning perspective. Our dynamics guarantees that the empirical frequency of
play after $T$ iteration is a $O(1/\sqrt{T})$-approximate EFCCE with high
probability, and an EFCCE almost surely in the limit.

with channel gains as the input and returns transmit powers as the output.
While the BS allocates the transmit powers to the UEs to maximize rates for all

be an external transmitter that aims to manipulate the inputs to the DNN by
interfering with the pilot signals that are transmitted to measure the channel

channel estimates to the BS. In both cases, the adversary carefully crafts
adversarial perturbations to manipulate the inputs to the DNN of the BS subject
to an upper bound on the strengths of these perturbations. We consider the
attacks targeted on a single UE or all UEs. We compare these attacks with a

We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find,

a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very

resolution smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of isolated dwarf
galaxies as part of the GRIFFIN project. The simulations at sub-parsec spatial
resolution and a minimum particle mass of 4 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ incorporate
non-equilibrium heating, cooling and chemistry processes, and realise
individual massive stars. All the simulations follow feedback channels of
massive stars that include the interstellar-radiation field, that is variable
in space and time, the radiation input by photo-ionisation and supernova
explosions. Varying the star formation efficiency per free-fall time in the
range $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ = 0.2 - 50$\%$ neither changes the star formation
rates nor the outflow rates. While the environmental densities at star
formation change significantly with $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$, the ambient
densities of supernovae are independent of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ indicating a
decoupling of the two processes. At low $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$, more massive,
and increasingly more bound star clusters are formed, which are typically not
destroyed. With increasing $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ there is a trend for
shallower cluster mass functions and the cluster formation efficiency $\Gamma$
for young bound clusters decreases from $50 \%$ to $\sim 1 \%$ showing evidence
for cluster disruption. However, none of our simulations form low mass ($<
10^3$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) clusters with structural properties in perfect
agreement with observations. Traditional star formation models used in galaxy
formation simulations based on local free-fall times might therefore not be
able to capture low mass star cluster properties without significant
fine-tuning.

star can be much larger than the angular Einstein ring radius of the lens. For
such extreme finite source effect (EFSE) events, finite source effects dominate
throughout the duration of the event. Here, we demonstrate and explore a
continuous degeneracy between multiple parameters of such EFSE events. The
first component in the degeneracy arises from the fact that the
directly-observable peak change of the flux depends on both the ratio of the
angular source radius to the angular Einstein ring radius and the fraction of
the baseline flux that is attributable to the lensed source star. The second
component arises because the directly-observable duration of the event depends
on both the impact parameter of the event and the relative lens-source proper
motion. These two pairwise degeneracies become coupled when the detailed
morphology of the light curve is considered, especially when including a
limb-darkening profile of the source star. We derive these degeneracies
mathematically through analytic approximations and investigate them further
numerically with no approximations. We explore the likely physical situations
in which these mathematical degeneracies may be realized and potentially
broken. As more and more low-mass lensing events (with ever decreasing Einstein
ring radii) are detected with improving precision and increasing cadence from
microlensing surveys, one can expect that more of these EFSE events will be
discovered. In particular, the detection of EFSE microlensing events could
increase dramatically with the Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain
Survey.

the upper Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and determine the black hole mass

the ionising flux. Thirdly, the wind directly intervenes with the stellar
envelope structure, which is decisive for both single star and binary
evolution, affecting predictions for gravitational wave events. Key findings of
current hot-star research include:
  * The traditional line-driven wind theory is being updated with Monte Carlo
and co-moving frame computations, revealing a rich multi-variate behaviour of
the mass-loss rate dM/dt in terms of M, L, Eddington Gamma, Teff , and chemical
composition Z. Concerning the latter, dM/dt is shown to depend on the iron (Fe)
opacity, making Wolf-Rayet populations, and gravitational wave events dependent
on host galaxy Z.
  * On top of smooth mass-loss behaviour, there are several transitions in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, involving bi-stability jumps around Fe
recombination temperatures, leading to quasi-stationary episodic, and not
necessarily eruptive, Luminous Blue Variable and pre-SN mass loss.
  * Moreover, there are kinks. At 100 Solar Masses, a high Gamma mass-loss
transition implies that hydrogen-rich very massive stars have higher mass-loss
rates than commonly considered. At the other end of the mass spectrum, low-mass
stripped helium stars no longer appear as Wolf-Rayet stars, but as
optically-thin stars. These stripped stars, in addition to very massive stars,
are two newly identified sources of ionising radiation that could play a key
role in local star formation as well as at high-redshift.

dataset enables us to test the theoretical prediction of inflected
color$-$metallicity relations (CMRs). The nonlinear-CMR hypothesis entails an
alternative explanation for the widely observed GC color bimodality, in which
even a unimodal metallicity spread yields a bimodal color distribution by
virtue of nonlinear metallicity-to-color conversion. The newly derived CMRs of
old, high-signal-to-noise-ratio GCs in M87 (the $V-I$ CMR of 83 GCs and the

Furthermore, from a combined catalog with the previous study on M87 GC

Cosmic rays (CRs) play an important role in the chemistry and
dynamics of the interstellar medium. In dense environments, they represent the
main ionising agent, driving the rich chemistry of molecular ions and
determining the ionisation fraction, which regulates the degree of coupling
between the gas and magnetic fields. Estimates of the CR ionisation rate
($\zeta_2$) span several orders of magnitude, depending on the targeted sources
and on the used method.
  Aims. Recent theoretical models have characterised the CR attenuation with
increasing density. We aim to test these models for the attenuation of CRs in
the low-mass pre-stellar core L1544.
  Methods. We use a state-of-the-art gas-grain chemical model, which accepts
the CR ionisation rate profile as input, to predict the abundance profiles of
four ions: $\rm N_2H^+$, $\rm N_2D^+$, $\rm HC^{18}O^+$, and $\rm DCO^+$.
Non-LTE radiative transfer is performed to produce synthetic spectra based on
the derived abundances. These are compared with observations obtained with the
Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30m telescope.
  Results. Our results indicate that a model with $\zeta_2 > 10^{-16} \rm \,
s^{-1}$ is excluded by the observations. Also the model with the standard
$\zeta_2 = 1.3 \times 10^{-17} \rm \, s^{-1}$ produces a worse agreement with
respect to the attenuation model based on Voyager observations, which has an
average $\zeta_2 = 3 \times 10^{-17} \rm \, s^{-1}$ at the column densities
typical of L1544. The single-dish data, however, are not sensitive to the
attenuation of the CR profile, which changes only by a factor of two in the
range of column densities spanned by the core model. Interferometric
observations at higher spatial resolution, combined with observations of
transitions with lower critical density are needed to observe a decrease of
$\zeta_2$ with density.

counterpart to decoding based on the classical belief propagation algorithm,
which has found wide success in classical coding theory when used in
conjunction with LDPC or Turbo codes. More recently Rengaswamy et al. [npj
Quantum Information 7 97 (2021)] observed that BPQM implements the optimal
decoder on a small example code. Here we significantly expand the
understanding, formalism, and applicability of the BPQM algorithm with the
following contributions. First, we prove analytically that BPQM realizes
optimal decoding for any binary linear code with tree Tanner graph. We also
provide the first formal description of the BPQM algorithm in full detail and
without any ambiguity. In so doing, we identify a key flaw overlooked in the
original algorithm and subsequent works which implies quantum circuit
realizations will be exponentially large in the code dimension. Although BPQM
passes quantum messages, other information required by the algorithm is
processed globally. We remedy this problem by formulating a truly
message-passing algorithm which approximates BPQM and has quantum circuit
complexity $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly } n, \text{polylog } \frac{1}{\epsilon})$,
where $n$ is the code length and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error.
Finally, we also propose a novel method for extending BPQM to factor graphs
containing cycles by making use of approximate cloning. We show some promising
numerical results that indicate that BPQM on factor graphs with cycles can
significantly outperform the best possible classical decoder.

utilizes a resource-friendly Transformer to capture global information by
exploiting the long-distance visual relation modeling. By aggregating the

bounded sequences in \emph{inhomogeneous} Sobolev spaces, where bounded
sequences might fail to be compact due to an isometric group action, that is,
\emph{translation}. It will be proved that every bounded sequence $(u_n)$ has
(possibly infinitely many) \emph{profiles}, and then the sequence is
asymptotically decomposed into a sum of translated profiles and a
double-suffixed residual term, where the residual term becomes arbitrarily
small in appropriate Lebesgue or Sobolev spaces of lower order. To this end,
functional analytic frameworks are established in an abstract way by making use
of a group action $G$, in order to characterize profiles by $(u_n)$ and $G$.
One also finds that a decomposition of the Sobolev norm into profiles is
bounded by the supremum of the norm of $u_n$. Moreover, the profile
decomposition leads to results of decomposition of integral functionals of
subcritical order. It is noteworthy that the space where the decomposition of
integral functionals holds is the same as that where the residual term is
vanishing.

the fuel capsule, and the reaction products can be measured to determine the
flux of fusion neutrons. $^{86}$Kr cross sections also provide model
constraints for the $^{85}$Kr branching point in the s-process and the neutron
flux in stars. In this work, experimental data on the neutron production,
radiative capture, inelastic scattering, and total cross sections of $^{86}$Kr
were used in conjunction with the fast region nuclear reaction code EMPIRE and
a new resonance-region evaluation to produce a new evaluation of
neutron-induced reactions on $^{86}$Kr. For the EMPIRE calculations, we fitted
the optical model potential up to 12 MeV to simultaneously reproduce the
experimental data for the total cross section and the main inelastic gamma
transition from the $2^+$ state to the $0^+$ ground state. For energies above
12 MeV, due to large fluctuations and uncertainties in the total cross section
data, we preferred to adopt the Koning-Delaroche global spherical optical model
potential. With these models and corrections to the structure of $^{86}$Kr, the
evaluated cross sections matched the experimental data. The new evaluation has
been submitted for incorporation in the next release of the ENDF/B nuclear

recent advancements in fabricating high-performance TE films and superlattice
structures, from the aspects of microstructure control, doping, defects,
composition, surface roughness, substrate effect, interface control,
nanocompositing, and crystal preferred orientation realized by regulating
various deposition parameters and subsequent heat treatment. The review begins
with a brief account of heat conduction mechanism, quantum confinement effect
in periodic layers, film deposition processes, thin film configurations and
design consideration for TE in-plane devices, and characterization techniques.
It then proceeds to alayzing the latest findingd on the TE properties of
Bi2(Te,Se)3 and (Bi,Sb)2Te3, PbTe, GeTe, SnSe, SnTe, Cu2-xSe, and skutterudite
films, including superlattices and the performance of TE generators, sensors,

characteristics of films in relation to temperature are also analyzed. In the
context of spin Seebeck effect (SSE) based systems, SSE mechanism analysis,
developments in enhancing the spin Seebeck signal since its first observation,
and recent developments are covered from the facets of new system design,
signal collection, magnetic manipulation, interface conditions,
thickness-dependent longitudinal spin Seebeck signal, and length scale of
phonon and magnon transport in longitudinal SSE (LSSE) in different bi-layer
systems. At the end, possible strategies for further enhancing zT of TE films

Optimization over a large square matrix is expensive in memory and in time.
Therefore an economic approximation is needed. Conventional approximation
approaches factorize the square matrix into a number matrices of much lower
ranks. However, the low-rank constraint is a performance bottleneck if the
approximated matrix is intrinsically high-rank or close to full rank. In this
paper, we propose to approximate a large square matrix with a product of sparse
full-rank matrices. In the approximation, our method needs only $N(\log N)^2$
non-zero numbers for an $N\times N$ full matrix. We present both non-parametric
and parametric ways to find the factorization. In the former, we learn the
factorizing matrices directly, and in the latter, we train neural networks to
map input data to the non-zero matrix entries. The sparse factorization method
is tested for a variety of synthetic and real-world square matrices. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method gives a better approximation

use our parametric method as a scalable attention architecture that performs

provide full privacy by moving all data and processing logic to clients -- but
which is prohibitively expensive for both clients and servers. In this work, we
devise a new framework called PrivateFetch for building practical ad-delivery
pipelines that rely on cryptographic hardness and best-case privacy, rather
than syntactic privacy guarantees or reliance on real-world anonymization
tools. PrivateFetch utilizes local computation of preferences followed by
high-performance single-server private information retrieval (PIR) to ensure
that clients can pre-fetch ad content from servers, without revealing any of
their inherent characteristics to the content provider. When considering an

less than 1% of average ad revenue. As such, our system is capable of
pre-fetching ads for clients based on behavioral and contextual user

systems that usually arises from a combination of ballistic motion with random
reorientations. A subset of these systems, autophoretic droplet swimmers that
move as a result of Marangoni stresses, have additionally been shown to respond
to local, self-produced chemical gradients that can mediate self-avoidance or
self-attraction. Via this mechanism, we present a mathematical model
constructed to encode experimentally observed self-avoidant memory and
numerically study the effect of this particular memory on the enhanced
diffusion of such swimming droplets. To disentangle the enhanced diffusion due
to the random reorientations from the enhanced diffusion due to the
self-avoidant memory, we compare to the widely-used active Brownian model.
Paradoxically, we find that the enhanced diffusion is substantially suppressed
by the self-avoidant memory relative to that predicted by only an equivalent
reorientation persistence timescale in the active Brownian model. We attribute
this to transient self-caging that we propose is novel for self-avoidant
systems. Additionally, we further explore the model parameter space by
computing emergent parameters that capture the velocity and reorientation
persistence, thus finding a finite parameter domain in which enhanced diffusion
is observable.

paramount importance. This work proposes the parameterization of a modified
embedded atomic model (MEAM) interatomic potential through density functional
theory (DFT) calculations for investigating the role of dislocations and defect
interaction governing the mechanical behavior of Au-Ag and Ag-Au Core-shell
nanostructures under tensile and fatigue loading using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. A comparative analysis between the Core-shell structures and their
pristine counterparts is also conducted. Throughout this work, pseudo-potential
and all-electron full potential DFT schemes are used for parameterizing MEAM by
calculating cohesive energy, lattice parameter, and bulk modulus of pure Au, Ag
and their alloy. Using the new force-field for MD simulations, the tensile
behavior of pristine and core-shell nanowires is explored for temperatures
between 300K to 600K. The fatigue properties of two pristine and two core-shell
nanowires in a strain range of -15% to 15% for 10 cycles is also conducted. Our
results suggest that Ag-Au Core-shell nanowire shows the best reversibility
under fatigue loading among the structures examined. Moreover, Ag-Au exhibit
the highest dislocation formation and complete annihilation of defects
consistently. While, Au-Ag present improved fatigue properties than its
pristine counterparts but have some residual defects leading to lower
reversibility when compared to Ag-Au. For tensile loading, all four structures
exhibited deterioration in strength with increasing temperature. Thermal
softening is seen to be more prominent in Au-Ag core-shell nanowires compared
to Ag-Au.

  Implementation and Public Problem Resolution through Network Science",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Public administration has yet to examine networks in terms of intervention,
where network mechanisms are manipulated to promote behavioral change and
improve social, organizational, and community outcomes. We argue that to
fulfill the potential of network scholarship in public administration, the
field requires a framework for intervention approaches tailored to the
relational and interdependent context of public problems. Building on Valente's
(2012) typology, we develop a framework for strategies of public sector network
intervention. First, we describe the core concepts in the theory of network
interventions found primarily in public health. Next, we expand the existing
typology of interventions to include macro-institutional strategies suited to
public administration settings. We then identify extant public sector
literature that provides the building blocks for a framework for intervention.
Finally, we classify the modes of intervention along three dimensions: (i) the
processes targeted for change (network formation versus network effects), (ii)
the types of nodes in the network (organizations versus individuals), and (iii)
the level at which the intervention operates (macro versus micro). We provide
scholars and practitioners with a useful way to conceptualize where, why, and
how network interventions might be deployed.

leptons they produce in transit through the Earth is an essential component to
determine neutrino flux sensitivities of underground, sub-orbital and

astrophysical neutrino sources are expected to produce nearly equal fluxes of
electron, muon and tau neutrinos. Of particular interest are tau neutrinos that
interact in the Earth at modest slant depths to produce $\tau$-leptons. Some
$\tau$-leptons emerge from the Earth and decay in the atmosphere to produce
extensive air showers. Future balloon-borne and satellite-based optical
Cherenkov neutrino telescopes will be sensitive to upward air showers from tau
neutrino induced $\tau$-lepton decays. We present nuPyProp, a python code that
is part of the nuSpaceSim package. nuPyProp generates look-up tables for exit
probabilities and energy distributions for $\nu_\tau\to \tau$ and $\nu_\mu\to

for a set of occupied orbitals by specifying a classical position for each
electron. These positions are known as Fermi-orbital descriptors (FODs), and
they have a clear relation to chemical bonding. In this study, we show how FLOs
and FODs can be used to initialize, interpret and justify SIC solutions in a
common chemical picture, both within FLO-SIC and in traditional variational
SIC, and to locate distinct local minima in either of these approaches.
  We demonstrate that FLOs based on Lewis' theory lead to symmetry breaking for
benzene -- the electron density is found to break symmetry already at the
symmetric molecular structure -- while ones from Linnett's double-quartet
theory reproduce symmetric electron densities and molecular geometries.
Introducing a benchmark set of 16 planar, cyclic molecules, we show that using
Lewis' theory as the starting point can lead to artifactual dipole moments of
up to 1 Debye, while Linnett SIC dipole moments are in better agreement with
experimental values. We suggest using the dipole moment as a diagnostic of
symmetry breaking in SIC and monitoring it in all SIC calculations. We show
that Linnett structures can often be seen as superpositions of Lewis structures
and propose Linnett structures as a simple way to describe aromatic systems in
SIC with reduced symmetry breaking. The role of hovering FODs is also briefly
discussed.

optimization of expensive real-world functions. Contrary to a common
expectation that BO is suited to optimizing black-box functions, it actually
requires domain knowledge about those functions to deploy BO successfully. Such
domain knowledge often manifests in Gaussian process (GP) priors that specify
initial beliefs on functions. However, even with expert knowledge, it is
non-trivial to quantitatively define a prior. This is especially true for
hyperparameter tuning problems on complex machine learning models, where
landscapes of tuning objectives are often difficult to comprehend. We seek an
alternative practice for setting these functional priors. In particular, we
consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allow us
to pre-train a tighter distribution a priori.
  In this work, we detail what pre-training entails for GPs using a KL
divergence based loss function, and propose a new pre-training based BO
framework named HyperBO. Theoretically, we show bounded posterior predictions

a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of thousands

of settings. This is mainly caused by their ability to achieve a level of
predictive performance that is hard to match by human experts in this new era
of big data. With this usage growth comes an increase of the requirements for
accountability and understanding of the models' predictions. However, the
degree of sophistication of the most successful models (e.g. ensembles, deep
learning) is becoming a large obstacle to this endeavour as these models are
essentially black boxes. In this paper we describe two general approaches that
can be used to provide interpretable descriptions of the expected performance
of any black box classification model. These approaches are of high practical
relevance as they provide means to uncover and describe in an interpretable way
situations where the models are expected to have a performance that deviates
significantly from their average behaviour. This may be of critical relevance
for applications where costly decisions are driven by the predictions of the
models, as it can be used to warn end users against the usage of the models in
some specific cases.

applications, but the multi-objective nature of optimization in MTL leads to
difficulties in balancing training between tasks. The best MTL optimization
methods require individually computing the gradient of each task's loss
function, which impedes scalability to a large number of tasks. In this paper,
we propose Scaled Loss Approximate Weighting (SLAW), a method for multi-task
optimization that matches the performance of the best existing methods while
being much more efficient. SLAW balances learning between tasks by estimating
the magnitudes of each task's gradient without performing any extra backward
passes. We provide theoretical and empirical justification for SLAW's
estimation of gradient magnitudes. Experimental results on non-linear
regression, multi-task computer vision, and virtual screening for drug
discovery demonstrate that SLAW is significantly more efficient than strong
baselines without sacrificing performance and applicable to a diverse range of
domains.

  https://github.com/placeforyiming/Divide-and-Merge-LiDAR-Panoptic-Cluster",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering objects from the LiDAR point cloud is an important research
problem with many applications such as autonomous driving. To meet the
real-time requirement, existing research proposed to apply the
connected-component-labeling (CCL) technique on LiDAR spherical range image
with a heuristic condition to check if two neighbor points are connected.
However, LiDAR range image is different from a binary image which has a
deterministic condition to tell if two pixels belong to the same component. The
heuristic condition used on the LiDAR range image only works empirically, which
suggests the LiDAR clustering algorithm should be robust to potential failures
of the empirical heuristic condition. To overcome this challenge, this paper
proposes a divide-and-merge LiDAR clustering algorithm. This algorithm firstly
conducts clustering in each evenly divided local region, then merges the local
clustered small components by voting on edge point pairs. Assuming there are
$N$ LiDAR points of objects in total with $m$ divided local regions, the time
complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(N)+O(m^2)$. A smaller $m$ means the
voting will involve more neighbor points, but the time complexity will become
larger. So the $m$ controls the trade-off between the time complexity and the
clustering accuracy. A proper $m$ helps the proposed algorithm work in
real-time as well as maintain good performance. We evaluate the
divide-and-merge clustering algorithm on the SemanticKITTI panoptic
segmentation benchmark by cascading it with a state-of-the-art semantic
segmentation model. The final performance evaluated through the leaderboard
achieves the best among all published methods. The proposed algorithm is
implemented with C++ and wrapped as a python function. It can be easily used
with the modern deep learning framework in python.

paper we evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of posit arithmetic in contrast
to the traditional IEEE 754 32-bit floating-point (FP32) arithmetic. We first
design and implement a Posit Arithmetic Unit (PAU), called POSAR, with flexible
bit-sized arithmetic suitable for applications that can trade accuracy for
savings in chip area. Next, we analyze the accuracy and efficiency of POSAR
with a series of benchmarks including mathematical computations, ML kernels,
NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), and Cifar-10 CNN. This analysis is done on our
implementation of POSAR integrated into a RISC-V Rocket Chip core in comparison
with the IEEE 754-based Floting Point Unit (FPU) of Rocket Chip. Our analysis
shows that POSAR can outperform the FPU, but the results are not spectacular.
For NPB, 32-bit posit achieves better accuracy than FP32 and improves the
execution by up to 2%. However, POSAR with 32-bit posit needs 30% more FPGA
resources compared to the FPU. For classic ML algorithms, we find that 8-bit
posits are not suitable to replace FP32 because they exhibit low accuracy
leading to wrong results. Instead, 16-bit posit offers the best option in terms
of accuracy and efficiency. For example, 16-bit posit achieves the same Top-1
accuracy as FP32 on a Cifar-10 CNN with a speedup of 18%.

the input (single frame vs. multiple consecutive frames), loss function (MSE,
MAE, or perceptual losses), and network architecture. We evaluate these
solutions by surveying ten experts - surgeons who routinely perform endoscopic
surgery. We run two separate reader studies: one evaluating individual frames
and the other evaluating fully reconstructed 3D video played on a VR headset.
In the first reader study, a variant of the U-Net that takes as input multiple
consecutive video frames and outputs the missing view performs best. We draw
two conclusions from this outcome. First, motion information coming from
multiple past frames is crucial in recreating stereo vision. Second, the
proposed U-Net variant can indeed exploit such motion information for solving
this task. The result from the second study further confirms the effectiveness
of the proposed U-Net variant. The surgeons reported that they could
successfully perceive depth from the reconstructed 3D video clips. They also
expressed a clear preference for the reconstructed 3D video over the original
2D video. These two reader studies strongly support the usefulness of the
proposed task of stereo reconstruction for minimally invasive surgical video
and indicate that deep learning is a promising approach to this task. Finally,
we identify two automatic metrics, LPIPS and DISTS, that are strongly
correlated with expert judgement and that could serve as proxies for the latter

RL systems unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To
address this challenge, we propose a reconfigurable architecture with
preemptive exits for efficient deep RL (RAPID-RL). RAPID-RL enables conditional
activation of DNN layers based on the difficulty level of inputs. This allows
to dynamically adjust the compute effort during inference while maintaining
competitive performance. We achieve this by augmenting a deep Q-network (DQN)
with side-branches capable of generating intermediate predictions along with an
associated confidence score. We also propose a novel training methodology for
learning the actions and branch confidence scores in a dynamic RL setting. Our
experiments evaluate the proposed framework for Atari 2600 gaming tasks and a
realistic Drone navigation task on an open-source drone simulator (PEDRA). We
show that RAPID-RL incurs 0.34x (0.25x) number of operations (OPS) while
maintaining performance above 0.88x (0.91x) on Atari (Drone navigation) tasks,
compared to a baseline-DQN without any side-branches. The reduction in OPS
leads to fast and efficient inference, proving to be highly beneficial for the

We develop a simple extension to the MDP framework which provides for the

they are sometimes used ""off-label"": data published for one task are used for
training algorithms for a different one. This work aims to highlight that in
some cases, this common practice may lead to biased, overly-optimistic results.
We demonstrate this phenomenon for inverse problem solvers and show how their
biased performance stems from hidden data preprocessing pipelines. We describe
two preprocessing pipelines typical of open-access databases and study their
effects on three well-established algorithms developed for Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) reconstruction: Compressed Sensing (CS), Dictionary Learning

Our results demonstrate that the CS, DictL and DL algorithms yield
systematically biased results when naively trained on seemingly-appropriate

the preprocessing extent, showing an artificial increase of 25%-48% in some
cases. Since this phenomenon is generally unknown, biased results are sometimes
published as state-of-the-art; we refer to that as subtle data crimes. This
work hence raises a red flag regarding naive off-label usage of Big Data and
reveals the vulnerability of modern inverse problem solvers to the resulting

Along the way, key recommendations are made for responsible AER. The objective
of the sheet is to facilitate and encourage more thoughtfulness on why to

1-2% of the global population. Patients with bicuspid valves frequently develop
dilation and aneurysms of the ascending aorta. Both hemodynamic and genetic
factors are believed to contribute to dilation, yet the precise mechanism
underlying this progression remains under debate. Controlled comparisons of
hemodynamics in patients with different forms of bicuspid valve disease are
challenging because of confounding factors, and simulations offer the
opportunity for direct and systematic comparisons. Using fluid-structure
interaction simulations, we simulate flows through multiple aortic valve models
in a patient-specific geometry. The aortic geometry is based on a healthy
patient with no known aortic or valvular disease, which allows us to isolate
the hemodynamic consequences of changes to the valve alone. Four fully-passive,
elastic model valves are studied: a tricuspid valve and bicuspid valves with
fusion of the left- and right-, right- and non-, and non- and left-coronary
cusps. The resulting tricuspid flow is relatively uniform, with little
secondary or reverse flow, and little to no pressure gradient across the valve.
The bicuspid cases show localized jets of forward flow, excess streamwise
momentum, elevated secondary and reverse flow, and clinically significant
levels of stenosis. Localized high flow rates correspond to locations of
dilation observed in patients, with the location related to which valve cusps
are fused. Thus, the simulations support the hypothesis that chronic exposure
to high local flow contributes to localized dilation and aneurysm formation.

challenges using the theory of differential privacy, which allows us to (i)
design controllers with bounded sensitivity to errors in state estimates, and
(ii) bound the amount of state information used for control (i.e., to impose
bounded rationality). The resulting framework approximates the separation
principle and allows us to derive an upper-bound on the cost incurred with a

and unites photonic crystal (PhC) and whispering gallery mode (WGM) concepts.
This `microgear' photonic crystal ring (MPhCR) is created by applying a
periodic modulation to the inside boundary of a microring resonator to open a
large bandgap, as in a PhC cavity, while maintaining the ring's circularly
symmetric outside boundary and high quality factor ($Q$), as in a WGM cavity.
The MPhCR targets a specific WGM to open a large PhC bandgap up to tens of free
spectral ranges, compressing the mode spectrum while maintaining the high-$Q$,
angular momenta, and waveguide coupling properties of the WGM modes. In
particular, near the dielectric band-edge, we observe modes whose group
velocity is slowed down by 10 times relative to conventional microring modes
while supporting $Q~=~(1.1\pm0.1)\times10^6$. This $Q$ is $\approx$50$\times$
that of the previous record in slow light devices. Using the slow light design
as a starting point, we further demonstrate the ability to localize WGMs into
photonic crystal defect (dPhC) modes for the first time, enabling a more than
10$\times$ reduction of mode volume compared to conventional WGMs while
maintaining high-$Q$ up to (5.6$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^5$. Importantly, this
additional dPhC localization is achievable without requiring detailed
electromagnetic design. Moreover, controlling their frequencies and waveguide
coupling is straightforward in the MPhCR, thanks to its WGM heritage. By using
a PhC to strongly modify fundamental properties of WGMs, such as group velocity
and localization, the MPhCR provides an exciting platform for a broad range of
photonics applications, including sensing/metrology, nonlinear optics, and
cavity quantum electrodynamics.

low confidence in task completion. To detect the latter, we introduce a novel
metric for estimating risk under the current robot policy. Experiments in

used to predict the visit probabilities. Specifically, by crossing the user and
tourist attraction information of photos, we define four visual similarity
levels and introduce a corresponding quintuplet loss to embed the visual
contents of photos. In addition, to capture the significances of different
photos, we exploit the self-attention mechanism to obtain the visual
representations of users and tourist attractions. We conducted experiments on a
dataset crawled from Flickr, and the experimental results proved the advantage
of this method.

for stability could be formed in the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers,
enjoying a short life of metastability before losing centrifugal support and
collapsing to a black hole. It is suggested here that a similar scenario could
take place when the remnant's excess mass is supported by an ultra-strong
$(\gtrsim 10^{17}\,\mbox{G})$ magnetic field that could be generated during,
and shortly after, coalescence. We show that such 'magnetically supramassive'
neutron stars could stave off collapse and survive for a few years before their
magnetic energy is sufficiently dissipated due to ambipolar diffusion. In
addition, we speculate on multi-messenger signatures of such objects and
discuss the robustness of our results against limitations placed by neutron

in answer set computation may be attained, if the program can be split into two

movements for agents to reach their assigned location without collision.
Centralized algorithms usually give optimal solutions, but have difficulties to
scale without employing various techniques - usually with a sacrifice of
optimality; but solving MAPF problems with the number of agents greater than a
thousand remains a challenge nevertheless. To tackle the scalability issue, we
present DMAPF - a decentralized and distributed MAPF solver, which is a
continuation of our recently published work, ros-dmapf. We address the issues
of ros-dmapf where it (i) only works in maps without obstacles; and (ii) has a
low success rate with dense maps. Given a MAPF problem, both ros-dmapf and
DMAPF divide the map spatially into subproblems, but the latter further divides
each subproblem into disconnected regions called areas. Each subproblem is
assigned to a distributed solver, which then individually creates an abstract
plan - a sequence of areas that an agent needs to visit - for each agent in it,
and interleaves agent migration with movement planning. Answer Set Programming,
which is known for its performance in small but complex problems, is used in
many parts including problem division, abstract planning, border assignment for
the migration, and movement planning. Robot Operating System is used to
facilitate communication between the solvers and to enable the opportunity to
integrate with robotic systems. DMAPF introduces a new interaction protocol
between the solvers, and mechanisms that together result in a higher success
rate and better solution quality without sacrificing much of the performance.
We implement and experimentally validate DMAPF by comparing it with other
state-of-the-art MAPF solvers and the results show that our system achieves
better scalability.

has been strongly supported both scientifically and technologically by several
solvers, ongoing active research, and implementations in many different fields.
However, although researchers acknowledged long ago the necessity of epistemic
operators in the language of ASP for better introspective reasoning, this
research venue did not attract much attention until recently. Moreover, the
existing epistemic extensions of ASP in the literature are not widely approved
either, due to the fact that some propose unintended results even for some
simple acyclic epistemic programs, new unexpected results may possibly be
found, and more importantly, researchers have different reasonings for some
critical programs. To that end, Cabalar et al. have recently identified some
structural properties of epistemic programs to formally support a possible
semantics proposal of such programs and standardise their results. Nonetheless,
the soundness of these properties is still under debate, and they are not
widely accepted either by the ASP community. Thus, it seems that there is still
time to really understand the paradigm, have a mature formalism, and determine
the principles providing formal justification of their understandable models.
In this paper, we mainly focus on the existing semantics approaches, the
criteria that a satisfactory semantics is supposed to satisfy, and the ways to
improve them. We also extend some well-known propositions of here-and-there
logic (HT) into epistemic HT so as to reveal the real behaviour of programs.
Finally, we propose a slightly novel semantics for epistemic ASP, which can be
considered as a reflexive extension of Cabalar et al.'s recent formalism called
autoepistemic ASP.

whole answer set which is stripped of all the associations between the various

Similarly, goal-directed implementations of ASP will only find concepts
directly relevant to a query. We present the DiscASP system that will find the

operations given a sequential data structure specification and knowledge about
concurrent behavior. Designing concurrent code is a non-trivial task even in
simplest of cases. Humans often design concurrent data structure operations by
transforming sequential versions into their respective concurrent versions.
This requires an understanding of the data structure, its sequential behavior,
thread interactions during concurrent execution and shared memory
synchronization primitives. We mechanize this design process using automated
commonsense reasoning. We assume that the data structure description is
provided as axioms alongside the sequential code of its algebraic operations.
This information is used to automatically derive concurrent code for that data
structure, such as dictionary operations for linked lists and binary search
trees. Knowledge in our case is expressed using Answer Set Programming (ASP),
and we employ deduction and abduction -- just as humans do -- in the reasoning
involved. ASP allows for succinct modeling of first order theories of pointer
data structures, run-time thread interactions and shared memory
synchronization. Our reasoner can systematically make the same judgments as a
human reasoner, while constructing provably safe concurrent code. We present
several reasoning challenges involved in transforming the sequential data
structure into its equivalent concurrent version. All the reasoning tasks are
encoded in ASP and our reasoner can make sound judgments to transform
sequential code into concurrent code. To the best of our knowledge, our work is
the first one to use commonsense reasoning to automatically transform
sequential programs into concurrent code. We also have developed a tool that we
describe that relies on state-of-the-art ASP solvers and performs the reasoning
tasks involved to generate concurrent code.

central in different tasks concerning both our daily life and several working

specialized kind of planning known as Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP).
Epistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the agent
reasons in the space of knowledge/beliefs states and tries to find a plan to
reach a desirable state from a starting one. Its general form, the MEP problem,
involves multiple agents who need to reason about both the state of the world
and the information flows between agents. To tackle the MEP problem several
tools have been developed and, while the diversity of approaches has led to a
deeper understanding of the problem space, each proposed tool lacks some
abilities and does not allow for a comprehensive investigation of the
information flows. That is why, the objective of our work is to formalize an
environment where a complete characterization of the agents' knowledge/beliefs
interaction and update is possible. In particular, we aim to achieve such goal
by defining a new action-based language for multi-agent epistemic planning and
to implement an epistemic planner based on it. This solver should provide a
tool flexible enough to reason on different domains, e.g., economy, security,
justice and politics, where considering others' knowledge/beliefs could lead to
winning strategies.

tends to solve the ABSA task in a unified way with end-to-end frameworks. Yet,

functional local linear regressions. The nonparametric regression of functional
data is extended from its multivariate counterpart, and is known to be
sensitive to the choice of $J$, where $J$ is the dimension of the projection
subspace of the data. Under multivariate setting, a roughness penalty is
helpful for variance reduction. However, among the limited works covering
roughness penalty under the functional setting, most only use a single scalar
for tuning. Our new approach proposes a class of data-adaptive ridge penalties,
meaning that the model automatically adjusts the structure of the penalty
according to the data sets. This structure has $J$ free parameters and enables
a quadratic programming search for optimal tuning parameters that minimize the
estimated mean squared error (MSE) of prediction, and is capable of applying
different roughness penalty levels to each of the $J$ basis.
  The strength of the method in prediction accuracy and variance reduction with
finite data is demonstrated through multiple simulation scenarios and two
real-data examples. Its asymptotic performance is proved and compared to the
unpenalized functional local linear regressions.

and sample mismatch between different data domains hinder the generalisation of
semi-supervised learning. In this study, we alleviate these problems by
proposing an Adaptive Hierarchical Dual Consistency (AHDC) for the
semi-supervised LA segmentation on cross-domain data. The AHDC mainly consists
of a Bidirectional Adversarial Inference module (BAI) and a Hierarchical Dual
Consistency learning module (HDC). The BAI overcomes the difference of
distributions and the sample mismatch between two different domains. It mainly
learns two mapping networks adversarially to obtain two matched domains through
mutual adaptation. The HDC investigates a hierarchical dual learning paradigm
for cross-domain semi-supervised segmentation based on the obtained matched
domains. It mainly builds two dual-modelling networks for mining the
complementary information in both intra-domain and inter-domain. For the
intra-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the
dual-modelling targets to exploit the complementary modelling information. For
the inter-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the LAs
modelled by two dual-modelling networks to exploit the complementary knowledge
among different data domains. We demonstrated the performance of our proposed
AHDC on four 3D late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MR (LGE-CMR) datasets from
different centres and a 3D CT dataset. Compared to other state-of-the-art

In RBN, the processes communicate by selective broadcast: a process can
broadcast a message which is received by all of its neighbors, and the set of
neighbors of a process can change arbitrarily over time. In ASMS, the processes
communicate by shared memory: a process can either write to or read from a

are given two (possibly infinite) sets of configurations C and C' defined by
upper and lower bounds on the number of processes in each state and we would

stochastic behavior and are a common tool in control, verification and
synthesis of reactive systems facing uncertainty. Multi-objective stochastic
games are natural in situations where several - possibly conflicting -
performance criteria like time and energy consumption are relevant. Such
conjunctive combinations are the most studied multi-objective setting in the
literature. In this paper, we consider the dual disjunctive problem. More
concretely, we study turn-based stochastic two-player games on graphs where the
winning condition is to guarantee at least one reachability or safety objective
from a given set of alternatives. We present a fine-grained overview of
strategy and computational complexity of such disjunctive queries (DQs) and
provide new lower and upper bounds for several variants of the problem,
significantly extending previous works. We also propose a novel value
iteration-style algorithm for approximating the set of Pareto optimal
thresholds for a given DQ.

probabilistic systems that are similar to trees or paths. It introduces the
parameters directed tree-partition width (dtpw) and directed path-partition
width (dppw) and shows that computing minimal witnesses remains NP-hard for
Markov chains with bounded dppw (and hence also for Markov chains with bounded
dtpw). By observing that graphs of bounded dtpw have bounded width with respect
to all known tree similarity measures for directed graphs, the hardness result
carries over to these other tree similarity measures. Technically, the
reduction proceeds via the conceptually simpler matrix-pair chain problem,
which is introduced and shown to be NP-complete for nonnegative matrices of
fixed dimension. Furthermore, an algorithm which aims to utilise a given

battery cell state of charge (SOC) estimation in a large-scale battery pack
under minimal sensing, where only pack-level voltage and current are measured.
For battery packs consisting of up to thousands of cells in electric vehicle or
stationary energy storage applications, it is desirable to estimate individual
cell SOCs without cell local measurements in order to reduce sensing costs.
Mathematically, pure series connected cells yield dynamics given by ordinary
differential equations under classical full voltage sensing. In contrast,
parallel--series connected battery packs are evidently more challenging because
the dynamics are governed by a nonlinear differential--algebraic equations
(DAE) system. The majority of the conventional studies on SOC estimation for
battery packs benefit from idealizing the pack as a lumped single cell which
ultimately lose track of cell-level conditions and are blind to potential risks
of cell-level over-charge and over-discharge. This work explicitly models a
battery pack with high fidelity cell-by-cell resolution based on the
interconnection of single cell models, and examines the observability of
cell-level state with only pack-level measurements. A DAE-based state observer
with linear output error injection is formulated, where the individual cell SOC
and current can be reconstructed from minimal number of pack sensing. The
mathematically guaranteed asymptotic convergence of differential and algebraic
state estimates is established by considering local Lipschitz continuity
property of system nonlinearities. Simulation results for Graphite/NMC cells
illustrate convergence for cell SOCs, currents, and voltages.

in the periodic lattice. In particular, by mapping eigen-states of three
correlated bosons to modes of the designed threedimensional electric circuit,
non-Hermitian many-body skin effects in Hilbert space is verified by measuring
the spatial impedance response. Our finding not only discloses a new physical

conclusion, we propose a notion called conductive homogeneity under which one

regular conformal dimension of the space. In particular, if $p = 2$, then we
construct a local regular Dirichlet form and show that the heat kernel

partially observable stochastic game has become a trend recently. Among them,
the one-sided two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic game
(OTZ-POSG) has emerged as a popular model because it allows players to compete
for multiple stages based on partial knowledge of the system. All existing work
on OTZ-POSG has focused on the simultaneous move scenario and assumed that one
player's actions are private in the execution process. However, this assumption
may become questionable since one player's action may be detected by the
opponent through deploying action detection strategies. Hence, in this paper,
we propose a turn-based OTZ-POSG with the assumption of public actions and
investigate the existence and properties of a Stackelberg equilibrium for this
game. We first prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium for the
one-stage case and show that the one-stage game can be converted into a
linear-fractional programming problem and therefore solved by linear
programming. For multiple stages, the main challenge is the information leakage
issue as the public run-time action reveals certain private information to the
opponent and allows the opponent to achieve more rewards in the future. To deal
with this issue, we adopt the concept of $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium and
prove that this equilibrium can be achieved for finite-horizon OTZ-POSGs. We
propose a space partition approach to solve the game iteratively and show that
the value function of the leader is piece-wise linear and the value function of
the follower is piece-wise constant for multiple stages. Finally, examples are
given to illustrate the space partition approach and show that value functions
are piece-wise linear and piece-wise constant.

to improve a controller's ability to transfer from a neural network dream
environment to reality at little additional cost. These improvements are gained
by drawing on inspiration from Domain Randomization, where the basic idea is to
randomize as much of a simulator as possible without fundamentally changing the
task at hand. Generally, Domain Randomization assumes access to a pre-built
simulator with configurable parameters but oftentimes this is not available. By
training the World Model using dropout, the dream environment is capable of
creating a nearly infinite number of different dream environments. Previous use
cases of dropout either do not use dropout at inference time or averages the
predictions generated by multiple sampled masks (Monte-Carlo Dropout).
Dropout's Dream Land leverages each unique mask to create a diverse set of

an effective technique to bridge the reality gap between dream environments and

formulate the problem of training fair models in VFL, where the learning task

updates per communication round to effectively reduce the number of
communication rounds. The messages that the server sends to passive parties are
deliberately designed such that the information necessary for local updates is
released without intruding on the privacy of data and sensitive attributes. We
rigorously study the convergence of the algorithm when applied to general
nonconvex-concave min-max problems. We prove that the algorithm finds a
$\delta$-stationary point of the dual objective in $\mathcal{O}(\delta^{-4})$

stacking effect and electron-electron correlation in the layered vdW material

the Coulomb correlation, two energetically favorable out-of-plane stacking
configurations are identified: one is a metallic phase with a single-layer
stacking pattern, another is a band insulator with a paired-bilayer stacking
configuration. Even though the Coulomb correlation is taken into account, the
two energetic favorable stacking orders are still far more stable than other
stacking orders. Furthermore, increasing the Coulomb interaction, the
paired-bilayer stacking configuration transforms from nonmagnetic band
insulator to antiferromagnetic insulator, while the single-layer stacking
undergoes a Slater-Mott metal-insulator transition, which indicates the
non-negligible role of electron-electron correlation interactions. In addition,
the electronic structure and magnetic ground state change drastically among
different stacking configurations, providing a platform to tune the electronic
structures and interlayer magnetic interactions by altering the stacking order.
In contrast to the widely accepted scenario of Mott localization as the driving
force behind the gap formation in the CDW phase of layered transition metal
dichalcogenides, our results not only highlight the crucial role of stacking
order in the electronic structures of 1T-NbS2, but also shed fresh light on the

modelling and temporal network analysis. The data set contained 751,003
shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. 165,593 premises were involved:
144,118 farms, 138 industrials, 21,337 traders, and 51 markets. On annual
average, 124,976 premises (75%) received or sent one movement with 1.5 pigs, in
contrast, 166 (0.01%) with 1,372 movements and 11,607 pigs. Simulations
resulted in CSF mean prevalence of 29.93%; Targeted selection strategy reduced
the prevalence to 3.3%, while 24% with random selection. Selection of high-risk
premises in every province was the best strategy using available surveillance
infrastructure. Notably, selecting 10 traders/markets reduced the CSF
prevalence to 4%, evidencing their prime influence over the network. Temporal
analysis showed an overestimation of 38% (causal fidelity) in the number of
transmission paths; The steps to cross the network were 4.3 (average path
length), but take approximately 233 days. In conclusion, surveillance
strategies applied by the NVS could be more efficient to find cases, reduce the
spread of diseases and enable the implementation of risk-based surveillance. To
focus the efforts on target selection of high-risk premises, special attention
should be given to markets/traders which proved similar disease spread
potential.

(EPs) in various domains, including photonics, acoustics and electronics.
However, EPs have mainly been realized based on the degeneracy of resonances of
physical systems; distinct degeneracies occur relating to the absorption
properties of waves, with distinct physical manifestations. Here we demonstrate
this physically different kind of exceptional point, by engineering
degeneracies in the absorption spectrum of optical microcavities with
dissipation. We experimentally distinguish the conditions to realize a resonant
EP and an absorbing EP. Furthermore, when the optical loss is optimized to
achieve perfect absorption at such an EP, we observe an anomalously broadened
lineshape in the absorption spectra, as predicted by theory. The distinct
scattering properties enabled by this type of EP creates new opportunities for
both the fundamental study and applications of non-Hermitian singularities.

implementation. Although some commercial products already exist, with
vehicle-based methods most commonly implemented by automotive manufacturers,
these systems may not have the level of accuracy required to properly predict

a superior approach. Current setbacks to implementing these methods include
late detection, intrusiveness and subject diversity. In particular,
physiological monitoring methods such as Electroencephalography (EEG) are
intrusive to drivers; while behavioural monitoring is least robust, affected by
external factors such as lighting, as well as being subject to privacy
concerns. Drowsiness detection models are often developed and validated based
on subjective measures, with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale being the most
popular. Subjective and incoherent labelling of drowsiness, lack of on road

to be addressed to progress drowsiness detection for reliable on-road use.

rigs. A face rig must be accurate and, at the same time, fast to compute. One
of the most common rigging models is the blendshape model. We propose a novel
algorithm for solving the nonconvex inverse rig problem in facial animation.
Our approach is model-based, but in contrast with previous model-based
approaches, we use a quadratic instead of the linear approximation to the
higher order rig model. This increases the accuracy of the solution by 8
percent on average and, confirmed by the empirical results, increases the
sparsity of the resulting parameter vector -- an important feature for
interpretability by animation artists. The proposed solution is based on a
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, applied to a nonconvex constrained problem
with sparsity regularization. In order to reduce the complexity of the
iterates, a paradigm of Majorization Minimization (MM) is further invoked,
which leads to an easy to solve problem that is separable in the parameters at
each algorithm iteration. The algorithm is evaluated on a number of animation
datasets, proprietary and open-source, and the results indicate the superiority
of our method compared to the standard approach based on the linear rig
approximation. Although our algorithm targets the specific problem, it might
have additional signal processing applications.

collection in intelligent transportation systems. Despite extensive research
regarding traffic data imputation, there still exist two limitations to be
addressed: first, existing approaches fail to capture the complex
spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic data, especially the dynamic spatial
dependencies evolving with time; second, prior studies mainly focus on randomly
missing patterns while other more complex missing scenarios are less discussed.
To fill these research gaps, we propose a novel deep learning framework called
Dynamic Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DSTGCN) to impute
missing traffic data. The model combines the recurrent architecture with
graph-based convolutions to model the spatiotemporal dependencies. Moreover, we
introduce a graph structure estimation technique to model the dynamic spatial
dependencies from real-time traffic information and road network structure.
Extensive experiments based on two public traffic speed datasets are conducted
to compare our proposed model with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in
four types of missing patterns. The results show that our proposed model
outperforms existing deep learning models in all kinds of missing scenarios and
the graph structure estimation technique contributes to the model performance.
We further compare our proposed model with a tensor factorization model and
find distinct behaviors across different model families under different
training schemes and data availability.

the attention map, could serve as interpretable factors. The experimental
results show the efficacy of the proposed method in two DTI datasets.
Additionally, we show that gated cross-attention can sensitively react to the

of its detection and traces out a `c' shaped profile in the HID, similar to the
`mini'-outbursts of the recurrent BHB 4U 1630-472. Energy spectrum is obtained
in the $0.5-10$ keV band with \textit{NICER} and \textit{Swift-XRT}, and
$0.5-25$ keV with \textit{AstroSat}. The spectra can be modelled using a
multicolour disc emission (\textit{diskbb}) convolved with a thermal
Comptonisation component (\textit{thcomp}). The disc temperature decreases from
0.6 keV to 0.1 keV during the decay with a corresponding decrease in photon
index ($\Gamma$) from 4.6 to 1.8. The fraction of Compton scattered photons
($f_{cov}$) remains $<$ 0.3 during the decay upto mid-January 2020 and
gradually increases to 1 as the source reaches hard state. Power Density
Spectra (PDS) generated in the 0.01-100 Hz range display no Quasi-periodic
Oscillations (QPOs) although band-limited noise (BLN) is seen towards the end
of January 2020. During \textit{AstroSat} observations, $\Gamma$ lies in the
range $2.3-2.6$ and rms increases from 11 to 20\%, suggesting that the source
was in an intermediate state till 21 November 2019. Spectral fitting with the

proposed by some authors as an explanation for the very efficient perpendicular
transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs). This process, however, competes
with perpendicular diffusion caused by magnetic turbulence, which can also
disrupt the drift patterns and reduce the efficiency of drift effects. The
latter phenomenon is well known in cosmic ray studies, but not yet considered
in SEP models. Additionally, SEP models which do not include drifts, especially
for electrons, use turbulent drift reduction as a justification of this
omission, without critically evaluating or testing this assumption. This
article presents the first theoretical step for a theory of drift suppression
in SEP transport. This is done by deriving the turbulence-dependent drift
reduction function with a pitch-angle dependence, as applicable for anisotropic
particle distributions, and by investigating to what extent drifts will be
reduced in the inner heliosphere for realistic turbulence conditions and
different pitch-angle dependencies of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient.
The influence of the derived turbulent drift reduction factors on the transport
of SEPs are tested, using a state-of-the-art SEP transport code, for several
expressions of theoretically-derived perpendicular diffusion coefficients. It
is found, for realistic turbulence conditions in the inner heliosphere, that
cross-field diffusion will have the largest influence on the perpendicular
transport of SEPs, as opposed to particle drifts.

there is still room for analysis of algorithm selection for black-box

addition, a benchmarking methodology for algorithm selection systems has not
been well investigated in the literature. In this context, this paper analyzes
algorithm selection systems on the 24 noiseless black-box optimization

performance measure is more reliable than the expected runtime measure for
benchmarking algorithm selection systems. Then, we examine the influence of
randomness on the performance of algorithm selection systems. We also show that
the performance of algorithm selection systems can be significantly improved by
using sequential least squares programming as a pre-solver. We point out that
the difficulty of outperforming the single-best solver depends on algorithm
portfolios, cross-validation methods, and dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate
that the effectiveness of algorithm portfolios depends on various factors.

fully autonomous vehicles. The main control challenge in a SBW system is to
follow the steering commands in the face of parametric uncertainties, external
disturbances and actuator delay; crucially, perturbations in inertial
parameters and damping forces give rise to state-dependent uncertainties, which
cannot be bounded a priori by a constant. However, the state-of-the-art control
methods of SBW system rely on a priori bounded uncertainties, and thus, become
inapplicable when state-dependent dynamics become unknown. In addition,
ensuring tracking accuracy under actuator delay is always a challenging task.
This work proposes two control frameworks to overcome these challenges.
Firstly, an adaptive controller is proposed to tackle the state-dependent
uncertainties and external disturbances in a typical SBW system without any a
priori knowledge of their structures and of their bounds. The stability of the
closed-loop system is studied analytically via uniformly ultimately bounded
notion and the effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified via
simulations against the state-of-the-art solution. While this proposed
controller handles the uncertainties and external perturbations, it does not
consider the actuator delay which sometimes result in decreased accuracy.
Therefore, a new adaptive-robust control framework is devised to tackle the
same control problem of an SBW system under the influence of time-varying input
delay. In comparison to the existing strategies, the proposed framework removes
the conservative assumption of a priori bounded uncertainty and, in addition,
the Razumikhin theorem based stability analysis allows the proposed scheme to
deal with arbitrary variation in input delay. The effectiveness of the both
controllers is proved using comparative simulation studies.

In e-commerce, accurate time-series sales forecasting (TSSF) can significantly

millions of products. The trend and seasonality of products vary a lot, and the
promotion activity heavily influences sales. Besides the above difficulties, we
can know some future knowledge in advance except for the historical statistics.
Such future knowledge may reflect the influence of the future promotion
activity on current sales and help achieve better accuracy. However, most
existing TSF methods only predict the future based on historical information.
In this work, we make up for the omissions of future knowledge. Except for
introducing future knowledge for prediction, we propose Aliformer based on the
bidirectional Transformer, which can utilize the historical information,

design a knowledge-guided self-attention layer that uses known knowledge's

frequency response of the DEM adequately matches that of the detailed WF model
around the frequency of oscillation modes of concern. Focusing on the concerned
oscillation modes in the small-signal model of the whole WF, closely
distributed modes of them on the complex plane are classified into a cluster
and then represented by a single mode. By the linear superposition principle,
the modal participation factor (MPF) regarding each of modal clusters are
superimposed, generating a feature vector for each wind turbine (WT). Based on
the feature vectors, the oscillation feature similarity of the WTs as well as
their aggregation can be evaluated and performed easily. Taking the DC-link

positive definite problems for the primary variable without using Lagrangian
multipliers.
  We start from the usual way of changing the given equation into a mixed
system using the Darcy's law, $\bu=-{\cal

chosen test spaces on each element, we define new mixed virtual volume methods
of all orders. We show that these new schemes are equivalent to the
nonconforming virtual element methods for the primal variable $p$.
  Once the primary variable is computed solving the symmetric, positive
definite system, all the degrees of freedom for the Darcy velocity are locally
computed. Also, the $L^2$-projection onto the polynomial space is easy to
compute. Hence our work opens an easy way to compute Darcy velocity on the
polygonal/polyhedral grids. For the lowest order case, we give a formula to
compute a Raviart-Thomas space like representation which satisfies the
conservation law.

unexplored. In the present paper, we consider Landauer's principle in
qubit-cavity QFT interaction perturbatively, in which the initial state of the
cavity QFT is chosen to be a vacuum or thermal state. In the vacuum case, the
QFT always absorbs heat and jumps to excited states. For the qubit at rest, its
entropy decreases, whereas if the qubit accelerates, it may also gain energy
and it increases its entropy due to the Unruh effect. For the thermal state,
the QFT can both absorb and release heat, depending on its temperature and the
initial state of the qubit, and the higher-order perturbations can excite or
deexcite the initial state to a higher or lower state. Landauer's principle is
valid in all the cases we consider. We hope that this paper will pave the way

the model that corrects it in the most simple way, the complex 2HDM; we study
its phenomenology in the lowest order of perturbation theory and describe its
renormalization in the following order. Motivated by this renormalization, we
analyze in detail tadpole schemes that allow the selection of the true vacuum
expectation value in models with spontaneous symmetry breaking, and we propose
a theorem regarding the finitude of Green's functions with corrections to the
external legs. Given the complexity of the calculations involved, it is crucial
to dispose of an appropriate software. We therefore present FeynMaster, which
calculates, among other things, Feynman rules, radiative corrections and
counterterms in a simultaneously automatic and flexible way. We use the
potential of FeynMaster to investigate two new projects related to multiple
scalar bosons: first, we consider the class of models with a generic number of
scalar doublets and singlets, and investigate radiative corrections to the $Z
\to b \bar{b}$ process in this context; then, we explore the phenomenology of a
model based on the linear seesaw hypothesis, which, in addition to two scalar
doublets, includes a complex singlet.

visual understanding tasks, including video-based facial expression recognition
(FER). By modeling visual relations effectively, Transformer has shown its
power for describing complicated patterns. However, Transformer still performs
unsatisfactorily to notice subtle facial expression movements, because the
expression movements of many videos can be too small to extract meaningful
spatial-temporal relations and achieve robust performance. To this end, we
propose to decompose each video into a series of expression snippets, each of
which contains a small number of facial movements, and attempt to augment the
Transformer's ability for modeling intra-snippet and inter-snippet visual
relations, respectively, obtaining the Expression snippet Transformer (EST). In
particular, for intra-snippet modeling, we devise an attention-augmented
snippet feature extractor (AA-SFE) to enhance the encoding of subtle facial
movements of each snippet by gradually attending to more salient information.
In addition, for inter-snippet modeling, we introduce a shuffled snippet order
prediction (SSOP) head and a corresponding loss to improve the modeling of
subtle motion changes across subsequent snippets by training the Transformer to
identify shuffled snippet orders. Extensive experiments on four challenging
datasets (i.e., BU-3DFE, MMI, AFEW, and DFEW) demonstrate that our EST is
superior to other CNN-based methods, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.

unable to correct the mistakes in the predicted words, which may mislead the
subsequent prediction and result in error accumulation problem. Secondly, such
a framework can only leverage the already generated words but not the possible
future words, and thus lacks the ability of global planning on linguistic

Drafting Model first generates a draft caption according to an input image, and
a Deliberation Model then performs the polishing process to refine the draft

image features and filter out error information from the draft captions. We
integrate CMA with the decoder of our Deliberation Model and name it as Cross

symmetric top CH$_3$X (X = F, Cl, Br, I) molecules is investigated, with
particular emphasis on the effect of halogen substitution on the rotational
constants, dipole moments, and polarizabilities of these species, as these
quantities determine the A&O dynamics. Insight into possible control schemes
for preferred A&O dynamics of halogenated molecules and best practices for A&O
simulations are provided, as well. It is shown that for accurate A&O-dynamics
simulations it is necessary to employ large basis sets and high levels of
electron correlation when computing the rotational constants, dipole moments,
and polarizabilities. The benchmark-quality values of these molecular
parameters, corresponding to the equilibrium, as well as the vibrationally
averaged structures are obtained with the help of the focal-point analysis
(FPA) technique and explicit electronic-structure computations utilizing the
gold-standard CCSD(T) approach, basis sets up to quintuple-zeta quality,
core-correlation contributions and, in particular, relativistic effects for
CH$_3$Br and CH$_3$I. It is shown that the different A&O behavior of the
CH$_3$X molecules in the optical regime is mostly caused by the differences in
their polarizability anisotropy, in other terms, the size of the halogen atom.
In contrast, the A&O dynamics of the CH$_3$X series induced by an intense
few-cycle THz pulse is mostly governed by changes in the rotational constants,
due to the similar dipole moments of the CH$_3$X molecules. The A&O dynamics is
most sensitive to the $B$ rotational constant: even the difference between its
equilibrium and vibrationally-averaged values results in noticeably different
A&O dynamics. The contribution of rotational states having different symmetry,
weighted by nuclear-spin statistics, to the A&O dynamics is also studied.

evolution of tolerance by lag in bacterial populations that are periodically

distribution of single-cell lag times evolves its average value to
approximately fit the antibiotic-exposure time. Moreover, the distribution
develops right skewed heavy tails, revealing the presence of individuals with

Individuals are characterized by a single phenotypic trait: their intrinsic lag

ejections (CMEs), but hot debates remain on whether the MFR forms before or
during solar eruptions. Furthermore, how flare reconnection shapes the erupting
MFR is still elusive in three dimensions. Here we studied a new MHD simulation
of CME initiation by tether-cutting magnetic reconnection in a single magnetic
arcade. The simulation follows the whole life, including the birth and
subsequent evolution, of an MFR during eruption. In the early phase, the MFR is
partially separated from its ambient field by a magnetic quasi-separatrix layer
(QSL) that has a double-J shaped footprint on the bottom surface. With the
ongoing of the reconnection, the arms of the two J-shaped footprints
continually separate from each other, and the hooks of the J shaped footprints
expand and eventually become closed almost at the eruption peak time, and
thereafter the MFR is fully separated from the un-reconnected field by the QSL.
We further studied the evolution of the toroidal flux in the MFR and compared
it with that of the reconnected flux. Our simulation reproduced an evolution
pattern of increase-to-decrease of the toroidal flux, which is reported
recently in observations of variations in flare ribbons and transient coronal
dimming. The increase of toroidal flux is owing to the flare reconnection in
the early phase that transforms the sheared arcade to twisted field lines,
while its decrease is a result of reconnection between field lines in the
interior of the MFR in the later phase.

unprecedented situations needing crisis management. After natural disasters and
during wartime, people must repurpose the materials and processes available to
make shelter, distribute food, etc. Repurposing is equally important in
professional life (e.g. clinicians often repurpose medicines off-license) and
in addressing societal challenges (e.g. finding new roles for waste products,).
Despite the importance of repurposing, the topic has received little academic
attention. By considering examples from a variety of domains such as every-day
activities, drug repurposing and natural disasters, we identify some principle
characteristics of the process and describe some technical challenges that
would be involved in modelling and simulating it. We consider cases of both
substitution, i.e. finding an alternative for a missing resource, and
exploitation, i.e. identifying a new role for an existing resource. We argue
that these ideas could be developed into general formal theory of repurposing,

originally used to provide two-point string amplitudes, correctly fixes the

expression for general $n$-point tree amplitudes with an insertion of this

  arXiv:2105.13034",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) is an extended gamma-ray source in the
central region of the Galaxy found in Fermi Large Area Telescope data. In
recent years it has become apparent that the GCE may not be spherically
symmetric, but may be spatially correlated with the distribution of stellar
mass in the Galactic bulge, potentially favoring an unresolved population of
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) scenario. In this thesis, we perform detailed
modelling of the Galactic MSP population. Including in our model the spin down
between formation and observation, we find a model in which luminosity $L
\propto E_{\rm cut}^{1.2 \pm 0.3} B^{0.1 \pm 0.4} \dot{E}^{0.5 \pm 0.1}$
provides the best fit to the data, where $E_{\rm cut}$ is spectral energy
cutoff, $B$ is magnetic field strength, and $\dot{E}$ is the spin-down power.
Due to differing star formation histories it is expected that the MSPs in the
Galactic bulge are older and therefore dimmer than those in the Galactic disk.
Our results demonstrate that we do not require that there is anything
systematically different about the inner Galaxy MSPs to explain the GCE. In the
""recycling"" channel of MSP formation the neutron star forms from a core
collapse supernovae that undergoes a random ""kick"" due to the asymmetry of the
explosion. This would imply a smoothing out of the spatial distribution of the
MSPs. We use N-body simulations to model how the MSP spatial distribution
changes. We estimate the probability distribution of natal kick velocities
using the resolved gamma-ray MSP proper motions, where MSPs have velocities
relative to circular motion of 77 +/- 6 km/s, as determined as part of our
Galactic MSP population model. We find that, due to the natal kicks, there is
an approximately 10% increase in each of the bulge MSP spatial distribution
dimensions and also the bulge MSP distribution becomes less boxy but is still
far from being spherical.

simple model system that exhibits non-additive behaviour: a two-level dipole
coupled to both a vibrational and an optical bath. Although not directly
coupled, there is an effective interaction between the baths mediated by the
system that can lead to population inversion in the matter system when the
vibrational coupling is strong. We benchmark and validate multi-bath TEMPO
against two approximate methods - one based on a polaron transformation, the
other on an identification of a reaction coordinate - before exploring the
regime of simultaneously strong vibrational and optical coupling where the
approximate techniques break down. Here we uncover a new regime where the

include lobes that are exceptionally asymmetric, where the upper lobe is much

of the upper lobe. This complex structure of the upper lobe hints at the
presence of another source, in close proximity to the edge of the lobe, which
resembles a bent-double, or distorted bent tail (DBT) radio galaxy. Both the
upper lobe and the lower lobe have a steep spectrum, and the synchrotron age of

experience heterogeneous download times. This behavior has direct impact on
peer and system performance, such as high variability of download times,
unfairness with respect to peer arrival order, bursty departures and content
synchronization. Detailed packet-level simulations and prototype-based

also develop a mathematical model that accurately predicts the heterogeneous
download rates of the homogeneous peers as a function of their content. In
addition, we apply the model to calculate lower and upper bounds to the number
of departures that occur in a burst. The heterogeneous download rates are more
prevalent in unpopular swarms (very few peers). Although few works have
addressed this kind of swarm, these by far represent the most common type of
swarm in BT.

states localized at the edge of graphene nanoribbon that only exists in certain

the chiral symmetry with topology well described by coupled

predict a fixed set of predefined categories, limiting their transferable
ability on new datasets with unseen concepts. In this paper, we provide a new
perspective on action recognition by attaching importance to the semantic
information of label texts rather than simply mapping them into numbers.
Specifically, we model this task as a video-text matching problem within a
multimodal learning framework, which strengthens the video representation with
more semantic language supervision and enables our model to do zero-shot action
recognition without any further labeled data or parameters requirements.
Moreover, to handle the deficiency of label texts and make use of tremendous
web data, we propose a new paradigm based on this multimodal learning framework
for action recognition, which we dub ""pre-train, prompt and fine-tune"". This
paradigm first learns powerful representations from pre-training on a large
amount of web image-text or video-text data. Then it makes the action
recognition task to act more like pre-training problems via prompt engineering.
Finally, it end-to-end fine-tunes on target datasets to obtain strong
performance. We give an instantiation of the new paradigm, ActionCLIP, which
not only has superior and flexible zero-shot/few-shot transfer ability but also
reaches a top performance on general action recognition task, achieving 83.8%

Therefore, they require high labor cost to design and maintain rules in all

promising results in urban driving scenarios. However, DRL is known to be
sample inefficient, and most previous works assume perfect observations such as
ground-truth locations and motions of vehicles without considering noises and
occlusions, which might be a too strong assumption for policy deployment. In
this work, we use DRL to train lidar-based end-to-end driving policies that
naturally consider imperfect partial observations. We further use unsupervised
contrastive representation learning as an auxiliary task to improve the sample
efficiency. The comparative evaluation results reveal that our method achieves
higher success rates than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) lidar-based end-to-end

a given image, is a challenging task that requires models to reason the complex
dependencies among visual content, dialog history, and current questions. Graph
neural networks are recently applied to model the implicit relations between
objects in an image or dialog. However, they neglect the importance of 1)
coreference relations among dialog history and dependency relations between
words for the question representation; and 2) the representation of the image
based on the fully represented question. Therefore, we propose a novel
relation-aware graph-over-graph network (GoG) for visual dialog. Specifically,
GoG consists of three sequential graphs: 1) H-Graph, which aims to capture
coreference relations among dialog history; 2) History-aware Q-Graph, which
aims to fully understand the question through capturing dependency relations
between words based on coreference resolution on the dialog history; and 3)
Question-aware I-Graph, which aims to capture the relations between objects in
an image based on fully question representation. As an additional feature
representation module, we add GoG to the existing visual dialogue model.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms the strong baseline in
both generative and discriminative settings by a significant margin.

by imaging sequence (n=17) and plane (n=10). Single vendor training (SVT) on
single centre images (n=234 patients) and multi-vendor training (MVT) with
multicentre images (n = 479 patients, 3 centres) was performed. Model accuracy
was compared to manual ground truth labels by an expert radiologist on a

A deep learning network was developed on multivendor data to classify MRI

this work demonstrates site-dependence of properties of bright,

that the optical properties of defects depend strongly on the hybridization of
the defect states with the surface states and on the structural changes allowed
by proximity to the surfaces. Additionally, the analysis of the first

the free run experiment without DA under-estimates flooding. On the other hand,
the validation of DA results with respect to independent SAR-derived flood
extent allows to diagnose a model-observation bias that leads to over-flooding.
Once this bias is taken into account, DA provides a sequential correction of
area-based friction coefficients and inflow discharge, yielding a better flood

flood forecasting over poorly gauged catchments, thanks to available remote

has been a rise in research that focuses on learned indexes for different
domains and with different functionalities. While the effectiveness of learned
indexes as an alternative to traditional index structures such as B+Trees have
already been demonstrated by several studies, previous work tend to focus on
higher-level performance metrics such as throughput and index size. In this
paper, our goal is to dig deeper and investigate how learned indexes behave at
a micro-architectural level compared to traditional indexes.
  More specifically, we focus on previously proposed learned index structure
ALEX, which is a tree-based in-memory index structure that consists of a
hierarchy of machine learned models. Unlike the original proposal for learned
indexes, ALEX is designed from the ground up to allow updates and inserts.
Therefore, it enables more dynamic workloads using learned indexes. In this
work, we perform a micro-architectural analysis of ALEX and compare its
behavior to the tree-based index structures that are not based on learned
models, i.e., ART and B+Tree.
  Our results show that ALEX is bound by memory stalls, mainly stalls due to
data misses from the last-level cache. Compared to ART and B+Tree, ALEX
exhibits fewer stalls and a lower cycles-per-instruction value across different
workloads. On the other hand, the amount of instructions required to handle
out-of-bound inserts in ALEX can increase the instructions needed per request
significantly (10X) for write-heavy workloads. However, the micro-architectural
behavior shows that this increase in the instruction footprint exhibit high
instruction-level parallelism, and, therefore, does not negatively impact the
overall execution time.

weak hybridization at the interface where the anisotropic characteristics of

variability is reportedly large. Based on observations at two widely separated
frequencies, 55 MHz (NenuFAR) and 1.4 GHz (Westerbork Synthesis Radio

they are more similar to ordinary pulses of radio emission than to a special
kind of short and bright Giant Pulses, observed from only a handful of pulsars.
We argue that temporal variation of properties of interstellar medium along the

contribution to observed single-pulse fluence variability. We further present
interesting structures in the low-frequency single-pulse spectra that resemble
the ""sad trombones"" seen in Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs); although for PSR B0950+08
the upward frequency drift is also routinely present. We explain these spectral
features with radius-to-frequency mapping, similar to the model developed by

unnecessary assumption on the type of the gauge theory involved which has

this assumption, we allow heavy fermions of the KSVZ-like models to carry

dominated by the axial anomaly of magnetic currents. Finally, we derive the

dependence $\mathcal D=\mathcal D(\mathcal E)$ is nonlinear the quasilinear
problem $\nabla\cdot\mathcal D(\mathcal E)=0$ is hence to be solved. In many
applications, e.g. in the modelling of wave-packets, an approximative
asymptotic ansatz of the electric field $\mathcal E$ is used, which satisfies
this divergence condition at $t=0$ only up to a small residual. We search then
for a small correction of the ansatz to enforce $\nabla\cdot\mathcal D(\mathcal

the usual case of a power type nonlinearity in $\mathcal D(\mathcal E)$ this
leads to the sum of the Laplace and $p$-Laplace operators. We also allow for
the medium to consist of two different materials so that a transmission problem
across an interface is produced. We prove the existence of the correction term
for a general class of nonlinearities and provide regularity estimates for its
derivatives, independent of the $L^2$-norm of the original ansatz. In this way,
when applied to the wave-packet setting, the correction term is indeed
asymptotically smaller than the original ansatz. We also provide numerical

nonlinearity of the radiation-pressure interaction combined with
photon-counting measurements to generate this entangled non-Gaussian mechanical

experimental characterisation of bipartite mechanical quantum states and
allowing a broad range of inseparability criteria to be evaluated. Key
experimental factors, such as optical loss and open-system dynamics, are
carefully analyzed and we show that the scheme is feasible with only minor
improvements to current experiments that operate outside the resolved-sideband

mechanical oscillators and offers significant potential for further research
and development that utilizes such non-Gaussian states for quantum-information

Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are robust emitters due to their
photostability, and offer the possibility of understanding the fundamental
photophysics between one emitter and one metal nanoparticle. A key enabling
challenge is the formation of systems containing both QDs and plasmonic
nanoparticles in high purity. We present the translation of DNA-based
self-assembly techniques to assemble metal and semiconductor nanocrystals into
discrete hybrid structures, including dimers, of high purity. This method gives
control over the interparticle separation, geometry, and ratio of QD:metal
nanoparticle, as well as the spectral properties of the metal/QD components in
the assembly to allow investigation of plasmon-exciton interaction. The hybrid
assemblies show the expected enhancement in steady-state photoluminescence
accompanied by an increase in the QD emission rate for assemblies with a strong
overlap between the QD emission and localised surface plasmon resonance. In
contrast, lengthening of the QD emission lifetime (a reduction of the emission
rate) of up to 1.7-fold, along with an enhancement in steady-state PL of 15-75%
is observed upon detuning of the QD and metal nanoparticle spectral properties.
This understood in terms of the Purcell effect, where the gold nanoparticle
acts as a damped, nanoscale cavity. Considering the metal nanoparticle using
generalised nonlocal optical response theory (GNOR) and the QD as an open
quantum system, the response is driven by the interference experienced by the
emitter for parallel and perpendicular field orientations. This provides a
mechanism for control of the emission rate of a QD by a metal nanoparticle
across a much wider range of lifetimes than previously understood.

develops ferromagnetic order often experiences a sharp drop in the resistivity.
Despite the universality of this phenomenon, a direct observation of the impact
of ferromagnetic order on the electronic quasiparticles in a magnetic metal is
still lacking. Here we demonstrate that quasiparticles experience a significant
enhancement of their lifetime in the ferromagnetic state of the low-density
magnetic semimetal EuCd2As2, but this occurs only in selected bands and
specific energy ranges. This is a direct consequence of the magnetically
induced band splitting and the multi-orbital nature of the material. Our

variety of formats. Accessing this information with different systems requires
a standardized machine-readable format that is capable of encoding
presentational and semantic information. Even though MathML is an official
recommendation by W3C and an ISO standard for representing mathematical
expressions, we could identify only very few systems which use the full
descriptiveness of MathML. MathML's high complexity results in a steep learning
curve for novice users. We hypothesize that this complexity is the reason why
many community-driven projects refrain from using MathML, and instead develop
problem-specific data formats for their purposes. We provide a user-friendly,
open-source application programming interface for controlling MathML data. Our
API is written in JAVA and allows to create, manipulate, and efficiently access
commonly needed information in presentation and content MathML. Our interface
also provides tools for calculating differences and similarities between MathML
expressions. The API also allows to determine the distance between expressions
using different similarity measures. In addition, we provide adapters for
numerous conversion tools and the canonicalization project. Our toolkit
facilitates processing of mathematics for digital libraries, without the need
to obtain XML expertise.

of materials. In the context of indirect band-gap semiconductors such as
silicon, strain lifts the valley degeneracy of the six conduction band minima,
and by extension the valley states of electrons bound to phosphorus donors.
Here, single phosphorus atoms are embedded in an engineered thin layer of
silicon strained to 0.8% and their wave function imaged using spatially
resolved spectroscopy. A prevalence of the out-of-plane valleys is confirmed
from the real-space images, and a combination of theoretical modelling tools is
used to assess how this valley repopulation effect can yield isotropic exchange
and tunnel interactions in the $xy$-plane relevant for atomically precise donor
qubit devices. Finally, the residual presence of in-plane valleys is evidenced
by a Fourier analysis of both experimental and theoretical images, and
atomistic calculations highlight the importance of higher orbital excited
states to obtain a precise relationship between valley population and strain.
Controlling the valley degree of freedom in engineered strained epilayers
provides a new competitive asset for the development of donor-based quantum
technologies in silicon.

and operation of many computing and communication systems, such as job routing
in data center clusters, multipath communication, Big Data and queueing
systems. In essence, the decision-making agent maps each arriving job to one of
the possibly heterogeneous servers while aiming at an optimization goal such as
load balancing, low average delay or low loss rate. One main difficulty in
finding optimal load balancing policies here is that the agent only partially
observes the impact of its decisions, e.g., through the delayed
acknowledgements of the served jobs. In this paper, we provide a partially
observable (PO) model that captures the load balancing decisions in parallel
buffered systems under limited information of delayed acknowledgements. We
present a simulation model for this PO system to find a load balancing policy
in real-time using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. We numerically
show that the resulting policy outperforms other limited information load
balancing strategies such as variants of Join-the-Most-Observations and has
comparable performance to full information strategies like:
Join-the-Shortest-Queue, Join-the-Shortest-Queue(d) and
Shortest-Expected-Delay. Finally, we show that our approach can optimise the

  1117-1180","10.1613/jair.1.14033",,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Algorithms and models are increasingly deployed to inform decisions about
people, inevitably affecting their lives. As a consequence, those in charge of
developing these models must carefully evaluate their impact on different
groups of people and favour group fairness, that is, ensure that groups
determined by sensitive demographic attributes, such as race or sex, are not
treated unjustly. To achieve this goal, the availability (awareness) of these
demographic attributes to those evaluating the impact of these models is
fundamental. Unfortunately, collecting and storing these attributes is often in
conflict with industry practices and legislation on data minimisation and
privacy. For this reason, it can be hard to measure the group fairness of
trained models, even from within the companies developing them. In this work,
we tackle the problem of measuring group fairness under unawareness of
sensitive attributes, by using techniques from quantification, a supervised
learning task concerned with directly providing group-level prevalence
estimates (rather than individual-level class labels). We show that
quantification approaches are particularly suited to tackle the
fairness-under-unawareness problem, as they are robust to inevitable
distribution shifts while at the same time decoupling the (desirable) objective
of measuring group fairness from the (undesirable) side effect of allowing the
inference of sensitive attributes of individuals. More in detail, we show that
fairness under unawareness can be cast as a quantification problem and solved
with proven methods from the quantification literature. We show that these
methods outperform previous approaches to measure demographic parity in five
experimental protocols, corresponding to important challenges that complicate
the estimation of classifier fairness under unawareness.

advantages: It is easy to implement and tune, does not need negative samples

convective envelope. Tidal flows generated therein by the tidal potential of
the companion can be dissipated through viscous friction, leading to the
redistribution and exchange of angular momentum within the convective shell and
with the companion, respectively. In the tightest systems, nonlinear effects
are likely to have a significant impact on the tidal dissipation and trigger
differential rotation in the form of zonal flows, as has been shown in previous
studies. In this context, we investigate how the addition of nonlinearities
affect the tidal flow properties, and energy and angular momentum balances,
using 3D nonlinear simulations of an adiabatic and incompressible convective
shell. In our study, we have chosen a body forcing where the equilibrium tide
(the quasi-hydrostatic tidal flow component) acts via an effective forcing to
excite tidal inertial waves in a spherical shell. Within this set-up, we show
new results for the amplitude of the energy stored in zonal flows, angular

Owning to the rank-reduced form of the triple excitation amplitudes tensor, the
computational cost of evaluating the correction scales as $N^7$ with the system

significantly reduces the dimension of the parent triple excitation subspace

larger, yet still reasonable, dimension of the parent excitation subspace. This

verify on a case-by-case basis that all polynomial Stein operators in the
literature with coefficients of degree at most two are characterising. For $X$
denoting a standard Gaussian random variable and $H_p$ the $p$-th Hermite
polynomial, we also prove, amongst other examples, that the Stein operators for
$H_p(X)$, $p=3,4,\ldots,8$, with coefficients of minimal possible degree
characterise their target distribution, and that the Stein operators for the
products of $p=3,4,\ldots,8$ independent standard Gaussian random variables are
characterising (in both settings the Stein operators for the cases $p=1,2$ are
already known to be characterising). We leverage our Stein characterisations of
$H_3(X)$ and $H_4(X)$ to derive characterisations of these target distributions
in terms of iterated Gamma operators from Malliavin calculus, that are natural
in the context of the Malliavin-Stein method.

components build on top of recent developments in self-supervised

an (artificially) imbalanced version of CIFAR-10 and we demonstrate our
proposed method outperforms standard neural networks, while using $27\times$
less parameters. To validate our assumption on a naturally imbalanced dataset,
we also conduct experiments on ChestMNIST and COVID-19 X-ray. The results
demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in imbalanced datasets, while

excitations (RR-CCSD) introduced recently [Parrish \emph{et al.}, J. Chem.
Phys. {\bf 150}, 164118 (2019)]. The main feature of this method is the
decomposed form of the doubly-excited amplitudes which are expanded in the
basis of largest magnitude eigenvectors of the MP2 or MP3 amplitudes. This
approach enables a substantial compression of the amplitudes with only minor
loss of accuracy. However, the formal scaling of the computational costs with
the system size ($N$) is unaffected in comparison with the conventional CCSD
theory ($\propto N^6$) due to presence of some terms quadratic in the
amplitudes. We show how to solve this problem, exploiting the fact that their
effective rank increases only linearly with the system size and reduce the
scaling of the RR-CCSD iterations down to the level of $N^5$. This is combined
with an iterative method of finding dominant eigenpairs of the MP2 or MP3
amplitudes which eliminates the necessity to perform the complete
diagonalization. Next, we consider the evaluation of the perturbative
corrections to the CCSD energies resulting from triply excited configurations.
The triply-excited amplitudes present in the CCSD(T) method are decomposed to
the Tucker-3 format using the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI)
procedure. This enables to compute the energy correction due to triple
excitations non-iteratively with $N^6$ cost. The accuracy of the resulting
rank-reduced CCSD(T) method is studied both for total and relative correlation
energies of a diverse set of molecules. Accuracy levels better than 99.9\% can
be achieved with a substantial reduction of the computational costs. Concerning
the computational timings, break-even point between the rank-reduced and

organized in hierarchical space, is a significant task lacking in investigation
in natural language processing. Existing methods usually encode the entire
hierarchical structure and fail to construct a robust label-dependent model,
making it hard to make accurate predictions on sparse lower-level labels and
achieving low Macro-F1. In this paper, we propose a novel PAMM-HiA-T5 model for
HTC: a hierarchy-aware T5 model with path-adaptive mask mechanism that not only
builds the knowledge of upper-level labels into low-level ones but also
introduces path dependency information in label prediction. Specifically, we
generate a multi-level sequential label structure to exploit hierarchical
dependency across different levels with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and T5
model. To further improve label dependency prediction within each path, we then
propose an original path-adaptive mask mechanism (PAMM) to identify the label's
path information, eliminating sources of noises from other paths. Comprehensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our novel PAMM-HiA-T5 model
greatly outperforms all state-of-the-art HTC approaches especially in Macro-F1.
The ablation studies show that the improvements mainly come from our innovative
approach instead of T5.

argue that merely using curiosity for fast environment exploration or as a

towards retaining the behaviours which emerge during curiosity-based learning.
We posit that these self-discovered behaviours serve as valuable skills in an

provides a strategy to train machine learning models while respecting users'

approaches for enforcing fairness in machine learning models have considered
the centralized setting, in which the algorithm has access to the users' data.
This paper introduces an algorithm to enforce group fairness in private
federated learning, where users' data does not leave their devices. First, the
paper extends the modified method of differential multipliers to empirical risk
minimization with fairness constraints, thus providing an algorithm to enforce
fairness in the central setting. Then, this algorithm is extended to the
private federated learning setting. The proposed algorithm, \texttt{FPFL}, is
tested on a federated version of the Adult dataset and an ""unfair"" version of
the FEMNIST dataset. The experiments on these datasets show how private
federated learning accentuates unfairness in the trained models, and how FPFL
is able to mitigate such unfairness.

been a mystery. One mechanism suggested as a solution for hot Jupiters is the
heating of the deep atmosphere via the vertical advection of potential
temperature resulting in an increased internal entropy. Here we intend to
explore if this mechanism can also explain the observed brown dwarf radii
trend: a general increase in radius with irradiation, with an exception for
highly-irradiated brown dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs. We use a 3D GCM,
DYNAMICO, to run a series of long-timescale models of the atmospheres of
Kepler-13Ab, KELT-1b, and SDSS1411B. These models allow us to explore not only
if a stable advective adiabat can develop, but also the associated dynamics. We
find that our models fall into two distinct regimes: Kepler-13Ab and KELT-1b
both show signs of significant deep heating and hence maintain adiabats that
are hotter than 1D models predict. On the other hand, SDSS1411B exhibits a much
weaker downward heating profile which not only struggles to heat the interior
under ideal conditions, but is highly sensitive to the presence of deep
radiative dynamics. We find that the vertical advection of potential
temperature by large-scale atmospheric circulations represents a robust
mechanism to explain the trend of increasing inflation with irradiation,
including the exception for highly irradiated brown dwarfs orbiting white
dwarfs. This can be understood as occurring due to the role that increasing
rotational influence plays on mid- to-high latitude advective dynamics.
Furthermore, when paired with a suitable parametrisation of the outer
atmosphere irradiation profile, this mechanism alone could potentially provide
a complete explanation for the observed levels of inflation in our brown
dwarfs.

The central insight is that the reflection matrix, being unitary for a bulk

that reflection processes off the boundaries of systems supporting higher-order
topological phases (HOTPs) simulate non-trivial Floquet phases. So far, this
method was shown to work for one-dimensional Floquet topological phases
protected by local symmetries. Here, we extend the range of applicability by
studying reflection off three-dimensional HOTPs with corner and hinge modes. We
show that the reflection processes can simulate both first-order and
second-order Floquet phases, protected by a combination of local and spatial
symmetries. For every phase, we discuss appropriate topological invariants

and systematically categorized a comprehensive collection of the morphological

manually labeled a generative lexicon containing nearly 10,000 verb, noun and
adjective stems, named entities, and other types of word stems. We used these
rule sets and resources to implement CKMorph Analyzer based on finite-state
transducers. In order to provide a benchmark for future research, we collected,
manually labeled, and publicly shared test sets for evaluating accuracy and
coverage of the analyzer. CKMorph was able to correctly analyze 95.9% of the
accuracy test set, containing 1,000 CK words morphologically analyzed according

chemical and biological systems. Understanding emergent patterns in such

In this work, we analytically and numerically study a symmetric ring of N
coupled self-oscillators of Van der Pol type under external stochastic forcing.
The system is proposed as a model of the thermo- and aeroacoustic interactions
of sound fields in rigid enclosures with compact source regions in a
can-annular combustor. The oscillators are connected via linear resistive
coupling with nonlinear saturation. After transforming the system to
amplitude-phase coordinates, deterministic and stochastic averaging is
performed to eliminate the fast oscillating terms. By projecting the potential
of the slow-flow dynamics onto the phase-locked quasi-limit cycle solutions, we
obtain a compact, low-order description of the (de-)synchronization transition
for an arbitrary number of oscillators. The stationary probability density
function of the state variables is derived from the Fokker--Planck equation,
studied for varying parameter values and compared to time series simulations.
We leverage our analysis to offer explanations for features of acoustic
pressure spectrograms observed in real-world gas turbines.

introduction of Special Relativity. William Lane Craig disagrees and argues
that although relativity is empirically adequate within a domain of
application, relativity should be supplanted by a Neo-Lorentzian alternative
that allows for absolute time. Meanwhile, Craig and co-author Sinclair have
argued that physical cosmology supports the conclusion that physical reality
began to exist at a finite time in the past. However, on their view, the
beginning of physical reality requires the objective passage of absolute time,
so that the beginning of physical reality stands or falls with Craig's
Neo-Lorentzian metaphysics. I raise doubts about whether, given Craig's
NeoLorentzian metaphysics, physical cosmology could adequately support a
beginning of physical reality within the finite past. Craig and Sinclair's
conception of the beginning of the universe requires a past boundary to the
universe. A past boundary to the universe cannot be directly observed and so
must be inferred from the observed matter-energy distribution in conjunction
with auxilary hypotheses drawn from a substantive physical theory. Craig's
brand of Neo Lorentzianism has not been sufficiently well specified so as to
infer either that there is a past boundary or that the boundary is located in
the finite past. Thus, Neo Lorentzianism implicitly introduces a form of
skepticism that removes the ability that we might have otherwise had to infer a
beginning of the universe. Furthermore, in analyzing traditional big bang
models, I develop criteria that Neo-Lorentzians should deploy in thinking about
the direction and duration of time in cosmological models generally. For my
last task, I apply the same criteria to bounce cosmologies and show that Craig

  Methods: We use the appropriate transformations to convert the observations

  Results: The forward model validates the analysis techniques which we use to
derive the electron bulk parameters. The calculation of the statistical moments

a suitable estimator can be different for each application setting. It is often
unknown for practitioners which estimator to use for their specific

Our representation preserves causal relationships allowing for justification

explore two different approaches based on the graph representation: bottom-up

along with the topological order, while the top-down approach generates models

capacity, maximum transmitting power, maximum buffer capacity, and minimum data
rate of primary users (PU) and SSUs. Due to the non-convexity of this
optimization problem and the stochastic nature of the wireless environment, we
propose a distributed multidimensional resource management algorithm based on
deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Considering the continuity of the resources
to be managed, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is
adopted, based on which each agent (SSU) can manage its own multidimensional

  Completion",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent interest in Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) has led to a plethora of
approaches based on reinforcement learning, inductive logic programming and
graph embeddings. In particular, rule-based KBC has led to interpretable rules
while being comparable in performance with graph embeddings. Even within
rule-based KBC, there exist different approaches that lead to rules of varying
quality and previous work has not always been precise in highlighting these
differences. Another issue that plagues most rule-based KBC is the
non-uniformity of relation paths: some relation sequences occur in very few
paths while others appear very frequently. In this paper, we show that not all
rule-based KBC models are the same and propose two distinct approaches that
learn in one case: 1) a mixture of relations and the other 2) a mixture of
paths. When implemented on top of neuro-symbolic AI, which learns rules by
extending Boolean logic to real-valued logic, the latter model leads to
superior KBC accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based KBC by 2-10% in
terms of mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, to address the non-uniformity of
relation paths, we combine rule-based KBC with graph embeddings thus improving
our results even further and achieving the best of both worlds.

system wherein particle-laden liquid metal flow about a cylindrical obstacle
was studied. We present the image processing methodology developed for particle
detection in images with disparate and often low signal- and contrast-to-noise
ratios, and the application of our MHT-X tracing algorithm for particle
trajectory reconstruction within and about the wake flow of the obstacle.
Preliminary results indicate that the utilized methods enable consistent
particle detection and recovery of long, representative particle trajectories
with high confidence. However, we also underline the necessity of implementing
a more advanced particle position extrapolation approach for increased tracking
accuracy. We also show that the utilized particles exhibit the Stokes number
range that suggests good flow tracking accuracy, and that the particle time
scales extracted from reconstructed trajectories are consistent with
expectations based a priori estimates.

homochirality - the specific molecular handedness of biomolecules - is a
phenomenon only produced by life. The unraveling of its origin requires
interdisciplinary research, by exploring fundamental physics, chemistry,
astrophysics and biology. Here, we consider the origin of biological
homochirality in the context of astrophysics and particle physics. The weak
force, one of the fundamental forces operating in nature, is parity-violating.
On Earth, at ground level, most of our cosmic radiation dose comes from
polarized muons formed in a decay involving the weak force. We discuss how the
magnetic polarization is transmitted in cosmic showers within several different
environments which are prime targets in the search for the origin of life. We
consider how this polarization could have induced a biological preference for
one type of chirality over the other, and discuss the implications for the
search of life in other worlds.

astrobiology. Extremophiles gain equal value by being part of a framework for
high-level characterisation of the evolutionary mechanisms that must
necessarily restrict or promote their emergence and presence on solar system
bodies. Thus, extremophiles exist in extreme environments, and therein lies the
paradox: extremophiles can only live in extreme environments but yet are not
able to originate in such environments. Therefore, even though the range of
extremophile capabilities in extreme environments is wider than that in
mesophiles, the range of their emergence possibilities is still equally
restricted. Therefore, even if one locates an extreme exoworld where
terrestrial extremophiles could live here-and-now, it can be predicted that no
extremophile analogues are present anyway. Furthermore, it is possible for a
world to be uninhabited, yet be habitable, and therein arises the extreme
environment paradox: an extreme environment can sustain chemical evolution as
well as arriving non-native life, yet native life cannot be built up in that
very environment. Thus, life may exist on an extraterrestrial extreme world (if
imported there), and chemical evolution may be present on that world. However,
it can be predicted that there is no native life anyway. This situation can be
predicted to function as a chemosignature and eventually as a biosignature.
However, the fact that a non-native extremopile in principle can exist in
extreme environments may demonstrate that the intermediate step between
chemical evolution and extremophiles can still occur in the form of a
statistical deviation.

the electromagnetic response for complex and random metasurfaces, without any
specific applications in mind. For simplicity, we focus on a simple pure
reflection problem of a broadband electromagnetic (EM) plane wave incident
normally on such complex metasurfaces in the frequency regime of 2 to 12 GHz.
In doing so, we create a deep learning (DL) based framework called metasurface
design deep convolutional neural network (MSDCNN) for both the forward and
inverse design of three different classes of complex metasurfaces: (a)
Arbitrary connecting polygons, (b) Basic pattern combination, and (c) Fully
random binary patterns. The performance of each metasurface is evaluated and
cross-benchmarked. Dependent on the type of complex metasurfaces, sample size,
and DL algorithms used, MSDCNN is able to provide good agreements and can be a
faster design tool for complex metasurfaces as compared to the traditional
full-wave electromagnetic simulation methods. However, no single universal deep
convolutional neural network (DCNN) model can work well for all metasurface
classes based on detailed statistical analysis (such as mean, variance,
kurtosis, mean squared error). Our findings report important information on the
advantages and limitation of current DL models in designing these ultimately
complex metasurfaces.

Phys. 42 035403 (2021)",,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fact that the nucleus is lighter than its constituents, seems rather
strange. How can the whole have a smaller mass than its components? To get some
intuition about how this is possible, one can look at a simpler more familiar
system exhibiting the same phenomena; the hydrogen atom. It turns out that the
same is true here; the hydrogen atom is a little bit lighter than the sum of
its constituents. This difference corresponds to the ionisation energy of
hydrogen. This observation allows a simple explanation for how this is
possible; the destructive interference between the electric fields of the
proton and electron causes a reduction in the energy of the electric field and
hence a reduction in the contribution to the mass of the system from the
electric field energy. The same explanation can be extended to the nucleus,
thus giving some intuition about how this mass reduction happens. In the
process, the idea of classical particles being ball-like objects with localised
properties, is challenged.
