  Magnetic Side Channel","14 pages, accepted to USENIX Security 2022",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural network applications have become popular in both enterprise and
personal settings. Network solutions are tuned meticulously for each task, and
designs that can robustly resolve queries end up in high demand. As the
commercial value of accurate and performant machine learning models increases,
so too does the demand to protect neural architectures as confidential
investments. We explore the vulnerability of neural networks deployed as black
boxes across accelerated hardware through electromagnetic side channels. We
examine the magnetic flux emanating from a graphics processing unit's power
cable, as acquired by a cheap $3 induction sensor, and find that this signal
betrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters of a black-box neural network
model. The attack acquires the magnetic signal for one query with unknown input
values, but known input dimensions. The network reconstruction is possible due
to the modular layer sequence in which deep neural networks are evaluated. We
find that each layer component's evaluation produces an identifiable magnetic
signal signature, from which layer topology, width, function type, and sequence
order can be inferred using a suitably trained classifier and a joint
consistency optimization based on integer programming. We study the extent to
which network specifications can be recovered, and consider metrics for
comparing network similarity. We demonstrate the potential accuracy of this
side channel attack in recovering the details for a broad range of network
architectures, including random designs. We consider applications that may
exploit this novel side channel exposure, such as adversarial transfer attacks.
In response, we discuss countermeasures to protect against our method and other
similar snooping techniques.

the 3D Euler fluid equations in several instances of interest, via the
construction of constants of motion and infinitesimal symmetries, without
recourse to Noether's theorem. We show that the vorticity field is a symmetry
of the flow, so if the flow admits another symmetry then a Lie algebra of new
symmetries can be constructed. For steady Euler flows this leads directly to
the distinction of (non-)Beltrami flows: an example is given where the topology
of the spatial manifold determines whether extra symmetries can be constructed.
Next, we study the stagnation-point-type exact solution of the 3D Euler fluid
equations introduced by Gibbon et al. (Physica D, vol.132, 1999, pp.497-510)
along with a one-parameter generalisation of it introduced by Mulungye et al.

these models allows for the explicit integration of the fields along pathlines,
revealing a fine structure of blowup for the vorticity, its stretching rate,
and the back-to-labels map, depending on the value of the free parameter and on
the initial conditions. Finally, we produce explicit blowup exponents and

data in an unsupervised manner is a highly desirable yet unrealized goal in
computational physics. This work explores the use of variational autoencoders
(VAEs) for non-linear dimension reduction with the specific aim of {\em
disentangling} the low-dimensional latent variables to identify independent
physical parameters that generated the data. A disentangled decomposition is
interpretable, and can be transferred to a variety of tasks including
generative modeling, design optimization, and probabilistic reduced order
modelling. A major emphasis of this work is to characterize disentanglement
using VAEs while minimally modifying the classic VAE loss function (i.e. the
Evidence Lower Bound) to maintain high reconstruction accuracy. The loss
landscape is characterized by over-regularized local minima which surround
desirable solutions. We illustrate comparisons between disentangled and
entangled representations by juxtaposing learned latent distributions and the
true generative factors in a model porous flow problem. Hierarchical priors are
shown to facilitate the learning of disentangled representations. The
regularization loss is unaffected by latent rotation when training with
rotationally-invariant priors, and thus learning non-rotationally-invariant
priors aids in capturing the properties of generative factors, improving
disentanglement. Finally, it is shown that semi-supervised learning -
accomplished by labeling a small number of samples ($O(1\%)$) - results in
accurate disentangled latent representations that can be consistently learned.

preserves the orientations between manifold of bounded geometry, we define a
$\rho$-class in the K-theory group of the structure algebra of the codomain
which is related to the lipschitz-homotopy. This class only depends on the

heavily depends on a large amount of labeled data to supervise the training. On
the other hand, the annotation of biomedical images requires domain knowledge

potential in learning latent representation of images even without any label.
Existing works have explored its application to biomedical image segmentation
where only a small portion of data is labeled, through a pre-training phase
based on self-supervised contrastive learning without using any labels followed
by a supervised fine-tuning phase on the labeled portion of data only. In this
paper, we establish that by including the limited label in formation in the
pre-training phase, it is possible to boost the performance of contrastive
learning. We propose a supervised local contrastive loss that leverages limited
pixel-wise annotation to force pixels with the same label to gather around in
the embedding space. Such loss needs pixel-wise computation which can be
expensive for large images, and we further propose two strategies, downsampling
and block division, to address the issue. We evaluate our methods on two public

these results can be understood via a generalization of the recently-introduced
entanglement membrane theory, by allowing for a spacetime entropy current,
which in the case of a generic QCA is fixed by the index. We work out the
implications of this current on the entanglement ""membrane tension"" and show
that the results for random QCA are recovered by identifying the topological

generating output spikes stochastically with a voltage-dependent hazard rate
(""escape noise""). While input noise lends itself to modeling biophysical noise
processes, the phenomenological escape noise is mathematically more tractable.
Using the level-crossing theory for differentiable Gaussian processes, we
derive an approximate mapping between colored input noise and escape noise in
leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This mapping requires the first-passage-time
(FPT) density of an overdamped Brownian particle driven by colored noise with
respect to an arbitrarily moving boundary. Starting from the Wiener-Rice series
for the FPT density, we apply the second-order decoupling approximation of
Stratonovich to the case of moving boundaries and derive a simplified
hazard-rate representation that is local in time and numerically efficient.
This simplification requires the calculation of the non-stationary
auto-correlation function of the level-crossing process: For exponentially
correlated input noise (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), we obtain an exact formula
for the zero-lag auto-correlation as a function of noise parameters, mean
membrane potential and its speed, as well as an exponential approximation of
the full auto-correlation function. The theory well predicts the FPT and
interspike interval densities as well as the population activities obtained
from simulations with time-dependent stimulus or boundary. The agreement with
simulations is strongly enhanced compared to a first-order decoupling
approximation that neglects correlations between level crossings. The
second-order approximation also improves upon a previously proposed theory in
the subthreshold regime. Depending on a simplicity-accuracy trade-off, all
considered approximations represent useful mappings from colored input noise to
escape noise.

probability in standard Transformer architectures, for every representation
(anchor), we generate augmented altered views. A supervised contrastive loss is
then utilized to maximize the system's capability of pulling together similar
samples (e.g., anchors and their altered views) and pushing apart the samples
belonging to the other classes. Despite its simplicity, SupCLSeq leads to large
gains in many sequence classification tasks on the GLUE benchmark compared to a
standard BERTbase, including 6% absolute improvement on CoLA, 5.4% on MRPC,
4.7% on RTE and 2.6% on STSB. We also show consistent gains over self

bands so as not to rely on ambiguous IR emission measurements. Methods. The
ratio is determined by analyzing archival spectra and literature data.
Information on the cation population is obtained from published characteristics
of the main diffuse interstellar bands attributed to C60+ and absorption cross
sections already reported for the vibronic bands of the cation. The population
of neutral molecules is described in terms of upper limit because the relevant
vibronic bands of C60 are not brought out by observations. We revise the
oscillator strengths reported for C60 and measure the spectrum of the molecule
isolated in Ne ice to complete them. Results. We scale down the oscillator
strengths for absorption bands of C60 and find an upper limit of approximately
1.3 for the C60:C60+ ratio. Conclusions. We conclude that the fraction of
neutral molecules in the buckminsterfullerene population of diffuse and
translucent interstellar clouds may be notable despite the non-detection of the
expected vibronic bands. More certainty will require improved laboratory data

  ""Towards a Game-Theoretic Security Analysis of Off-Chain Protocols""",,,,"cs.CR cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Off-chain protocols constitute one of the most promising approaches to solve
the inherent scalability issue of blockchain technologies. The core idea is to
let parties transact on-chain only once to establish a channel between them,
leveraging later on the resulting channel paths to perform arbitrarily many
peer-to-peer transactions off-chain. While significant progress has been made
in terms of proof techniques for off-chain protocols, existing approaches do
not capture the game-theoretic incentives at the core of their design, which
led to overlooking significant attack vectors like the Wormhole attack in the
past. In this work we take a first step towards a principled game-theoretic
security analysis of off-chain protocols by introducing the first
game-theoretic model that is expressive enough to reason about their security.
We advocate the use of Extensive Form Games (EFGs) and introduce two instances
of EFGs to capture security properties of the closing and the routing of the
Lightning Network. Specifically, we model the closing protocol, which relies on
punishment mechanisms to disincentivize parties to upload old channel states
on-chain. Moreover, we model the routing protocol, thereby formally
characterizing the Wormhole attack, a vulnerability that undermines the
fee-based incentive mechanism underlying the Lightning Network.

of simultaneous estimation of two parameters that are respectively associate
with the length and direction of the Bloch vector for identically prepared
qubit states that is confined to a plane, where in order to obtain the optimal
estimation precision for both parameters, collective measurements on multiple
qubits are necessary. Upon treating $N$ qubits as an ensemble of spin-1/2
systems, we show that simultaneous optimal estimation for both parameters can
be attained asymptotically with a simple collective measurement strategy --
first, we estimate the length parameter by measuring the populations in spaces
corresponding to different total angular momentum values $j$, then we estimate
the direction parameter by performing a spin projection onto an optimal basis.
Furthermore, we show that when the state is nearly pure, for sufficiently but
not arbitrarily large $N$, most information will be captured in the largest
three $j$-subspaces. Then, we study how the total angular-momentum measurement
can be realized by observing output signatures from a Bell multiport setup,
either exactly for $N=2,3$, or approximately when the qubits are nearly pure
for other $N$ values. We also obtain numerical results that suggest that using
a Bell multiport setup, one can distinguish between projection onto the $j=N/2$

output.

errors and deviations in policy if there is uncertainty in identifying a state.
This can happen due to the human agent's cognitive limitations and/or
perceptual errors. So an algorithm that computes a policy for a human to
execute ought to consider these effects in its computations. An optimal Markov
Decision Process (MDP) policy that is poorly executed (because of a human
agent) maybe much worse than another policy that is suboptimal in the MDP, but
considers the human-agent's execution behavior. In this paper we consider two
problems that arise from state uncertainty; these are erroneous
state-inference, and extra-sensing actions that a person might take as a result
of their uncertainty. We present a framework to model the human agent's
behavior with respect to state uncertainty, and can be used to compute MDP
policies that accounts for these problems. This is followed by a hill climbing

end-task and auxiliary objectives results in significantly better downstream
task performance than the widely-used task-agnostic continued pre-training

attack - the worst attack on longest-chain protocols - the security gained from
using SSLE is substantial: the settlement time is decreased by roughly 25% for
a 33% or 25% adversary. Furthermore, when considering grinding attacks, we find
that the security threshold is increased by 10% (from 0.26 in the PLE case to
0.36 inthe SSLE case) and the settlement time is decreased by roughly 70% for a

privacy-preserving way. Creating a differentially private algorithm is a
process that often starts with a noise-free (non-private) algorithm. The
designer then decides where to add noise, and how much of it to add. This can
be a non-trivial process -- if not done carefully, the algorithm might either
violate differential privacy or have low utility.
  In this paper, we present DPGen, a program synthesizer that takes in
non-private code (without any noise) and automatically synthesizes its
differentially private version (with carefully calibrated noise). Under the
hood, DPGen uses novel algorithms to automatically generate a sketch program
with candidate locations for noise, and then optimize privacy proof and noise
scales simultaneously on the sketch program. Moreover, DPGen can synthesize
sophisticated mechanisms that adaptively process queries until a specified
privacy budget is exhausted. When evaluated on standard benchmarks, DPGen is
able to generate differentially private mechanisms that optimize simple utility
functions within 120 seconds. It is also powerful enough to synthesize adaptive
privacy mechanisms.

Region Of Interest (RoI) usually consists of performing a binned log-likelihood
fit in order to determine the sky model that, after convolution with the
instrument response, best accounts for the distribution of observed counts.
While tools are available to perform such a fit, it is not easy to check the
goodness-of-fit. The difficulty of the assessment of the data/model agreement
is twofold. First of all, the observed and predicted counts are binned in three
dimensions (two spatial dimensions and one energy dimension) and comparing two
3D maps is not straightforward. Secondly, gamma-ray source spectra generally
decrease with energy as the inverse of the energy square. As a consequence the
number of counts above several GeV generally falls into the Poisson regime,
which precludes performing a simple $\chi^2$ test. We propose a method that
overcomes these two obstacles by producing and comparing spatially integrated
count spectra for data and model at each pixel of the analysed RoI. The
comparison is performed following a log-likelihood approach that extends the
$\chi^2$ test to histograms with low statistics. This method can take into
account likelihood weights that are used to account for systematic
uncertainties. We optimize the new method so that it provides a fast and
reliable tool to assess the goodness-of-fit of Fermi-LAT data and we use it to
check the latest gamma-ray source catalog on 10~years of data.

proposed to use pixel-aligned features to generalize radiance fields to

first introduce a temporal transformer that aggregates tracked visual features

is proposed to perform cross-attention between the temporally-fused features

we investigate the question of singularity avoidance in loop quantum gravity

obtained results with already existing ones. Our analysis focuses on the
dynamical operators, denoted by q(r), whose products are the analogue of the
inverse scale factor in LQG and also play a pivotal role for other dynamical
operators such as matter Hamiltonians or the Hamiltonian constraint. For graphs
of cubic topology and linear powers in q(r), we obtain the correct classical
limit and demonstrate how higher order corrections can be computed with this
method. This extends already existing techniques in the way how the involved
fractional powers are handled. We also extend already existing formalisms to
graphs with higher-valent vertices. For generic graphs and products of q(r),
using estimates becomes inevitable and we investigate upper bounds for these
semiclassical expectation values. Compared to existing results, our method
allows to keep fractional powers involved in q(r) throughout the computations,
which have been estimated by integer powers elsewhere. Similar to former
results, we find a non-zero upper bound for the inverse scale factor at the
initial singularity. Additionally, our findings provide some insights into
properties and related implications of the results that arise when using
estimates and can be used to look for improved estimates.

core-collapse SNe are preferentially located along the resolved galactic
star-forming main sequence, whereas Type Ia SNe are extended to lower values of
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at fixed $\Sigma_\star$, indicative of locations inside
quiescent galaxies or quiescent regions of galaxies. We also test how well the
radial distribution of each SN type matches the radial distributions of UV and
IR light in each host galaxy. We find that, to first order, the distributions
of all types of SNe mirror that of both near-IR light (3.4 and 4.5 microns,
tracing the stellar mass distribution) and mid-IR light (12 and 22 microns,
tracing emission from hot, small grains), and also resemble our best-estimate
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. All types of SNe appear more radially concentrated than the
UV emission of their host galaxies. In more detail, the distributions of Type
II SNe show small statistical differences from that of near-IR light. We
attribute this overall structural uniformity to the fact that within any

the time until both energy and data are available grows above a certain
threshold. The distribution of the AoI is fully characterized under such a
policy. This is then used to analyze the performance of the multiple sources
case under maximum-age-first scheduling, in which the sensor's resources are
dedicated to the source with the maximum AoI at any given time. The achievable
collective long-term average AoI is derived in closed-form. Multiple numerical
evaluations are demonstrated to show how the optimal threshold value behaves as
a function of the system parameters, and showcase the benefits of a
threshold-based waiting policy with intermittent energy and data arrivals.

as BERT and RoBERTa, provide strong performance across a wide range of tasks
and are ubiquitous in modern NLP. It has been observed that fine-tuning these
models on tasks involving data from domains different from that on which they
were pretrained can lead to suboptimal performance. Recent work has explored
approaches to adapt pretrained language models to new domains by incorporating
additional pretraining using domain-specific corpora and task data. We propose
an alternative approach for transferring pretrained language models to new
domains by adapting their tokenizers. We show that domain-specific subword
sequences can be efficiently determined directly from divergences in the
conditional token distributions of the base and domain-specific corpora. In
datasets from four disparate domains, we find adaptive tokenization on a
pretrained RoBERTa model provides >97% of the performance benefits of domain
specific pretraining. Our approach produces smaller models and less training
and inference time than other approaches using tokenizer augmentation. While
adaptive tokenization incurs a 6% increase in model parameters in our
experimentation, due to the introduction of 10k new domain-specific tokens, our
approach, using 64 vCPUs, is 72x faster than further pretraining the language

sieve can be improved.
  An important ingredient in our proof is a dispersion estimate for cubic Gauss

illustrated by simulations and validated by a comparison with experimental data

simultaneously collected deep imaging in the g and r Sloan filters using the

expected from the future Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Here we show
the first results of our pilot programme targeting NGC1042 (an M33 analogue at
a distance of 13.5 Mpc) and its surroundings. The depth of the images allowed
us to detect an asymmetric stellar halo in the outskirts of this galaxy whose
mass (1.4+-0.4x10^8 Msun) is in agreement with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter

reveals low mass satellites (a few times 10^5 Msun) with very faint central
surface brightness muV(0)~27 mag/arcsec^2 (i.e. similar to Local Group dwarf
spheroidals, such as Andromeda XIV or Sextans, but at distances well beyond the

open up a unique opportunity to explore the `missing satellites' problem in a

to alleviate the pressure from DM null detection results. As a concrete
example, we consider the vector portal DM and focus on the mass evolution of
the dark photon. When the Universe cools down, the gauge boson mass can
increase monotonically and go across several important thresholds; opening new
transient annihilation channels in the early Universe. Those channels are
either forbidden or weakened at the late Universe which helps to evade the
indirect searches. In particular, the transient resonant channel can survive
direct detection (DD) without tuning the DM to be half of the dark photon mass
and can be soon tested by future DD or collider experiments. A feature of the
scenario is the existence of a light dark scalar.

Supernovae (ASAS-SN) in the galaxy SDSS J171955.84+414049.4 on UT 2017 July 27
at a redshift of $z=0.1641$. The transient peaked at an absolute $B$-band
magnitude of $M_{B,{\rm peak}}=-22.81$, corresponding to a bolometric
luminosity of $L_{\rm bol,peak}=8.3\times10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, and exhibited
late-time ultraviolet emission that was still ongoing in our latest
observations. Integrating the full light curve gives a total emitted energy of
$E_{\rm tot}=(1.36\pm0.08)\times10^{52}$~erg, with
$(0.80\pm0.02)\times10^{52}$~erg of this emitted within 200 days of peak light.
This late-time ultraviolet emission is accompanied by increasing X-ray emission
that becomes softer as it brightens. ASASSN-17jz exhibited a large number of
spectral emission lines most commonly seen in active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
with little evidence of evolution. It also showed transient Balmer features
which became fainter and broader over time, and are still being detected
$>1000$ days after peak brightness. We consider various physical scenarios for
the origin of the transient, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption
events (TDEs), AGN outbursts, and ANTs. We find that the most likely
explanation is that ASASSN-17jz was an SN~IIn occurring in or near the disk of
an existing AGN, and that the late-time emission is caused by the AGN
transitioning to a more active state.

investigating possible links to other species of isolated NSs, such as the

investigate the spin evolution of magnetars. Two avenues of evolution are
considered: one with exponentially decaying B-fields, the other with sub- and
super-exponential decay. Using Monte Carlo methods, we synthesize magnetar
populations using different input distributions and physical parameters, such
as for the initial spin period, its time derivative and the B-field decay
timescale. Additionally, we introduce a fade-away procedure that can account
for the fading of old magnetars, and we briefly discuss the effect of alignment
of the B-field and spin axes. Imposing the Galactic core-collapse supernova
rate of ~20 kyr^-1 as a strict upper limit on the magnetar birthrate and
comparing the synthetic populations to the observed one using both manual and
automatic optimization algorithms for our input parameter study, we find that
the B-field must decay exponentially or super-exponentially with a
characteristic decay timescale of 0.5-10 kyr (with a best value of ~4 kyr). In
addition, the initial spin period must be less than 2 sec. If these constraints
are kept, we conclude that there are multiple choices of input physics that can
reproduce the observed magnetar population reasonably well. We also conclude
that magnetars may well be evolutionary linked to the population of XDINSs,

fitting process with $S\acute{e}rsic$ functions and cross-correlation method.

emission is observed, which further confirms the existence of shock waves in
RRc pulsators. The shock-triggered emission lasts over $15\%$ of the pulsation

simulations in the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects

track the evolution of the Milky Way (MW) and M31 along with ~100 dwarfs in the
LG, reveal the total gas mass and stellar properties (velocity dispersion,
evolution history, etc.) of present-day LG dwarfs to be similar to field
systems. However, relative to field galaxies, LG dwarfs have more cold gas in
their central parts and more metal-rich gas in the halo stemming from
interactions with other dwarfs living in a high-density environment like the
LG. Interestingly, the direct impact of massive MW/M31 analogues on the
metallicity evolution of LG dwarfs is minimal; LG dwarfs accrete
high-metallicity gas mostly from other dwarfs at late times. We have also
tested for the impact of metal diffusion on the chemical evolution of LG
dwarfs, and found that it does not affect the stellar or gaseous content of LG
dwarfs. Our simulations suggest that the stellar components of LG dwarfs offer
a unique and unbiased local laboratory for galaxy-formation tests and
comparisons, especially against the overall dwarf population in the Universe.

massive core (MMC) as a function of infrared brightness, i.e. a clump
evolutionary tracer. Using ALMA 12 m and ACA we surveyed 6 infrared-dark hubs
in 2.9mm continuum at $\sim$3"" resolution. To put our sample into context, we
also re-analysed published ALMA data from a sample of 29 high mass-surface
density ATLASGAL sources. We characterise the size, mass, morphology, and
infrared brightness of the clumps using Herschel and Spitzer data. Within the 6
newly observed hubs, we identify 67 cores, and find that the MMCs have masses
between 15-911 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within a radius of 0.018-0.156 pc. The MMC
of each hub contains 3-24% of the clump mass ($f_\mathrm{MMC}$), becoming 5-36%
once core masses are normalised to the median core radius. Across the 35
clumps, we find no significant difference in the median $f_\mathrm{MMC}$ values
of hub and non-hub systems, likely the consequence of a sample bias. However,
we find that $f_\mathrm{MMC}$ is $\sim$7.9 times larger for infrared-dark
clumps compared to infrared-bright ones. This factor increases up to $\sim$14.5
when comparing our sample of 6 infrared-dark hubs to infrared-bright clumps. We
speculate that hub-filament systems efficiently concentrate mass within their
MMC early on during its evolution. As clumps evolve, they grow in mass, but
such growth does not lead to the formation of more massive MMCs.

that pseudo-random states can arise from isolated quantum dynamics, opening up
new ways to design applications for quantum state tomography and benchmarking.

Lagrangians for the IR SCFTs that arise from the circle reduction of a large
class of Argyres-Douglas theories. The resultant Lagrangian gives a realization
of the Higgs branch of the 4d SCFT as a quiver variety, up to a set of
decoupled interacting SCFTs with empty Higgs branches. As representative
examples, we focus on the families $(A_{p-N-1}, A_{N-1})$ and $D_p(SU(N))$. The
Lagrangian in question is generically a non-ADE-type quiver gauge theory
involving only unitary gauge nodes with fundamental and bifundamental
hypermultiplets, as well as hypermultiplets which are only charged under the
$U(1)$ subgroups of certain gauge nodes. Our starting point is the Lagrangian
3d mirror of the circle-reduced Argyres-Douglas theory, which can be read off
from the class $\mathcal{S}$ construction. Using the toolkit of the $S$-type
operations, developed in \cite{Dey:2020hfe}, we show that the mirror of the 3d
mirror for any Argyres-Douglas theory in the aforementioned families is
guaranteed to be a Lagrangian theory of the above type, up to some decoupled
free sectors. We comment on the extension of this procedure to other families
of Argyres-Douglas theories. In addition, for the case of $D_p(SU(N))$
theories, we compare these 3d Lagrangians to the ones found in
\cite{Closset:2020afy} and propose that the two are related by an IR duality.
We check the proposed IR duality at the level of the three-sphere partition
function for specific examples. In contrast to the 3d Lagrangians in
\cite{Closset:2020afy}, which are linear chains involving unitary-special
unitary nodes, we observe that the Coulomb branch global symmetries are
manifest in the 3d Lagrangians that we find.

Chaotic orbits have been found in essentially all (non-St\""ackel) axisymmetric

received with their friends. Such a phenomenon is usually unobserved, causing a
misallocation of individuals in the two treatment arms: some of the initially
untreated units might have actually received the treatment by diffusion.
Treatment misclassification can, in turn, introduce a bias in the estimation of
the causal effect. Inspired by a recent field experiment on the effect of
different types of school incentives aimed at encouraging students to attend
cultural events, we present a novel approach to deal with a hidden diffusion
process on observed or partially observed networks.Specifically, we develop a

contrastive pre-training on unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning with a small

In this work, we propose FedMoCo, a robust federated contrastive learning (FCL)
framework, which makes efficient use of decentralized unlabeled medical data.
FedMoCo has two novel modules: metadata transfer, an inter-node statistical
data augmentation module, and self-adaptive aggregation, an aggregation module
based on representational similarity analysis. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first FCL work on medical images. Our experiments show that FedMoCo
can consistently outperform FedAvg, a seminal federated learning framework, in
extracting meaningful representations for downstream tasks. We further show
that FedMoCo can substantially reduce the amount of labeled data required in a
downstream task, such as COVID-19 detection, to achieve a reasonable
performance.

relatively high Galactic latitude (b $\gt$ 14$^{\circ}$) in the Cepheus Flare
region. We study the relationship between the motion of the cloud with respect
to the magnetic field and the clump orientations with respect to both the
magnetic field and the motion. We estimated the motion of the molecular clouds
using the proper motion and the distance estimates of the young stellar objects
(YSOs) associated with them using the Gaia EDR3 data. By assuming that the YSOs
are associated with the clouds and share the same velocity, the projected
direction of motion of the clouds are estimated. We estimated a distance of
371$\pm$22 pc for L1228 and 340$\pm$ 7 pc for L1251 implying that all four
complexes are located at almost the same distance. Assuming that both the
clouds and YSOs are kinematically coupled, we estimated the projected direction
of motion of the clouds using the proper motions of the YSOs. All the clouds in
motion are making an offset of $\sim$ 30$^{\circ}$ with respect to the ambient
magnetic fields except in L1172/1174 where the offset is $\sim$ 45$^{\circ}$.
In L1147/1158, the starless clumps are found to be oriented predominantly
parallel to the magnetic fields while prestellar clumps show random
distribution. In L1172/1174, L1228 and L1251,the clumps are oriented randomly

is a marginal trend that the starless clumps are oriented more parallel in

randomly. In L1251, we find a bimodal trend in case of starless clumps.

the population of binaries in UFDs is poorly constrained by observations, with
preferred binary fractions for individual galaxies ranging from a few percent
to nearly unity. Searching for wide binaries through nearest neighbor (NN)
statistics (or the two-point correlation function) has been suggested in the
literature, and we apply this method for the first time to detect wide binaries
in a UFD. By analyzing the positions of stars in Reticulum II (Ret II) from
Hubble Space Telescope images, we search for angularly resolved wide binaries
in Ret II. We find that the distribution of their NN distances shows an

wide~binary fraction of $f_b\approx0.007^{+0.008}_{-0.003}$ at separations of
more than 3000 AU. Under the assumption that the binary separation distribution
is similar to that in the Milky Way, the total binary fraction in Ret II may be

processes (involving star forming regions, accretion disk coronas and winds,
and jets), the powering of the radio loudest quasars must involve very strong
jets, presumably launched by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism incorporating the
magnetically arrested disk (MAD) scenario. We focus on the latter and
investigate the dependence of their fraction on redshift. We also examine the
dependence of the radio-loud fraction (RLF) on BH mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and
Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) while excluding the redshift bias by
narrowing its range. In both these investigations we remove the bias associated
with: (1) the diversity of source selection by constructing two well-defined,
homogeneous samples of quasars (first within $0.7 \leq z < 1.9$, second within
$0.5 \leq z < 0.7$); (2) a strong drop in the RLF of quasars at smaller BH
masses by choosing those with BH masses larger than $10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$. We
confirm some previous results showing the increase in the fraction of
radio-loud quasars with cosmic time and that this trend can be even steeper if
we account for the bias introduced by the dependence of the RLF on BH mass
whereas the bias introduced by the dependence of the RLF on Eddington ratio is
shown to be negligible. Assuming that quasar activities are triggered by galaxy
mergers we argue that such an increase can result from the slower drop with
cosmic time of mixed mergers than of wet mergers.

{many-to-many} matching between $S$ and $T$ is a set of pairs $(p,q)$ such that
$p\in S$, $q\in T$ and for each $r\in S\cup T$, $r$ appears in at least one
such pair. The {cost of a pair} $(p,q)$ is the (Euclidean) distance between $p$
and $q$. In the {minimum-cost many-to-many matching} problem, the goal is to
compute a many-to-many matching such that the sum of the costs of the pairs is
minimized. This problem is a restricted version of minimum-weight edge cover in
a bipartite graph, and hence can be solved in $O(n^3)$ time. In a more
restricted setting where all the points are on a line, the problem can be
solved in $O(n\log n)$ time [Colannino, Damian, Hurtado, Langerman, Meijer,
Ramaswami, Souvaine, Toussaint; Graphs Comb., 2007]. However, no progress has
been made in the general planar case in improving the cubic time bound. In this
paper, we obtain an $O(n^2\cdot poly(\log n))$ time exact algorithm and an $O(
n^{3/2}\cdot poly(\log n))$ time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in the planar
case. Our results affirmatively address an open problem posed in [Colannino et

requires dynamic, configuration-dependent recalculation of surface charges and
is therefore typically approximated by assuming constant net charge on
particles. Various computational methods exist that address this. We present an
alternative, particularly efficient charge regulation Monte Carlo method
(CR-MC), which explicitly models the redistribution of individual charges and
accurately samples the correct grand-canonical charge distribution. In
addition, we provide an open-source implementation in the LAMMPS molecular

method. This implementation is designed to handle a wide range of
implicit-solvent systems that model discreet ionizable groups or surface sites.
The computational cost of the method scales linearly with the number of
ionizable groups, thereby allowing accurate simulations of systems containing

with radius that initially grows and then saturates at ${\sim}30~{\rm au}$. The
disc is gravitationally unstable with prominent large-amplitude spiral arms. We
use our simulation results and a series of physical arguments to construct a
predictive and quantitative physical picture of Class 0/I protostellar disc
evolution from several aspects, including (i) the angular-momentum
redistribution in the disc, self-regulated by gravitational instability to make
most of the disc marginally unstable; (ii) the thermal profile of the disc,
well-approximated by a balance between radiative cooling and accretion heating;
and (iii) the magnetic-field strength and magnetic-braking rate inside the
disc, regulated by non-ideal magnetic diffusion. Using these physical insights,
we build a simple 1D semi-analytic model of disc evolution. We show that this
1D model, when coupled to a computationally inexpensive simulation for the
evolution of the surrounding pseudodisc, can be used reliably to predict disc
evolution in the Class 0/I phase. The predicted long-term evolution of disc
size, which saturates at ${\sim}30~{\rm au}$ and eventually shrinks, is
consistent with a recent observational survey of Class 0/I discs. Such

  Race-Freedom",,,,,"cs.PL cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dynamic languages like Erlang, Clojure, JavaScript, and E adopted data-race
freedom by design. To enforce data-race freedom, these languages either deep
copy objects during actor (thread) communication or proxy back to their owning
thread. We present Dala, a simple programming model that ensures data-race
freedom while supporting efficient inter-thread communication. Dala is a
dynamic, concurrent, capability-based language that relies on three core
capabilities: immutable values can be shared freely; isolated mutable objects
can be transferred between threads but not aliased; local objects can be
aliased within their owning thread but not dereferenced by other threads.
Objects with capabilities can co-exist with unsafe objects, that are unchecked
and may suffer data races, without compromising the safety of safe objects. We
present a formal model of Dala, prove data race-freedom and state and prove a
dynamic gradual guarantee. These theorems guarantee data race-freedom when
using safe capabilities and show that the addition of capabilities is semantics
preserving modulo permission and cast errors.

method exploits the tree structure of the robot to train appropriate embeddings
to the given robot data. To avoid overfitting, we formulate multi-task learning

rotation curves to $3\times R_e$. The disk-halo decomposition includes a
stellar, DM, gas, and occasionally a bulge component. The DM component
primarily uses the generalized $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ profile or a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. The disk stellar masses $M_\star$ obtained
from the [OII] disk-halo decomposition agree with the values inferred from the
spectral energy distributions. While the rotation curves show diverse shapes,
ranging from rising to declining at large radii, the DM fractions within the
half-light radius $f_{\rm DM}(<R_e)$ are found to be 60\% to 95\%, extending to
lower masses (densities) recent results on massive SFGs with
$M_\star>10^{10}~M_\odot$. The DM halos show constant surface densities of
$\sim100~M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. Half of the sample shows a strong preference for
cored over cuspy DM profiles. The presence of DM cores appears to be related to
galaxies with stellar-to-halo mass $\log M_\star/M_{\rm vir}\approx-2.5$. In

fractional-flow velocity-pressure-saturation formulation is proposed. The
solver, which is under the framework of the full approximation scheme (FAS),
extends our previous work on nonlinear multigrid for heterogeneous diffusion
problems. The coarse spaces in the multigrid hierarchy are constructed by first
aggregating degrees of freedom, and then solving some local flow problems. The
mixed formulation and the choice of coarse spaces allow us to assemble the
coarse problems without visiting finer levels during the solving phase, which
is crucial for the scalability of multigrid methods. Specifically, a natural
generalization of the upwind flux can be evaluated directly on coarse levels
using the precomputed coarse flux basis vectors. The resulting solver is
applicable to problems discretized on general unstructured grids. The
performance of the proposed nonlinear multigrid solver in comparison with the
standard single level Newton's method is demonstrated through challenging
numerical examples. It is observed that the proposed solver is robust for
highly nonlinear problems and clearly outperforms Newton's method in the case
of high Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers.

quantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic

accurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal
resolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution,
which yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed
sensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly,
sparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce
artifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient
artifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the
parameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained
deep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the
accuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty
term in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a
lower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain
the lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS
reconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results
in kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers
estimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional
analysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the

The inputs to these layers are mainly the three default descriptors of a graph,

integrates Machine Learning (ML) model training and the generation of

attempt to find the smallest modification to the feature values of an instance
that changes the prediction of the ML model on that instance to a predefined
output. Prior techniques for generating CF explanations suffer from two major
limitations: (i) they generate CF explanations by solving separate
time-intensive optimization problems for every single input instance (which
slows their running time); and (ii) they are post-hoc methods which are
designed for use with proprietary black-box ML models - as a result, their
procedure for generating CF explanations is uninformed by the training
procedure of the black-box ML model, which leads to misalignment of objectives
between model predictions and explanations. These two limitations result in
significant shortcomings in the quality of the generated CF explanations.
CounterNet, on the other hand, integrates both prediction and explanation in
the same framework, which enables the optimization of the CF explanation
generation only once together with the predictive model. We adopt a
theoretically sound block-wise coordinate descent procedure which helps in
effectively training CounterNet's network architecture. Finally, we evaluate
CounterNet's performance by conducting extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets. Our results show that CounterNet generates high-quality
predictions, and corresponding CF explanations (with well-balanced
cost-invalidity trade-offs) for any new input instance significantly faster
than existing state-of-the-art baselines.

specific fluence, external dispersion measure ($\rm DM_E$), and inferred

track the accumulated stars throughout history describes the data better but
still cannot meet both the $\rm DM_E$ and the energy criteria. The data seem to

are also available, a model should take into account the uncertainty of the
estimates themselves as well as the uncertainty in the estimation of variances.
In addition, if there exists a strong association between estimates and their
variances, the correlation between these two quantities should also be
considered. In this paper, we propose a bivariate hierarchical Bayesian model
that jointly models the estimates and their estimated variances assuming a
correlation between these two measures. We conduct simulations to explore the
performance of the proposed bivariate Bayesian model and compare it to other
commonly used methods under different correlation scenarios. The proposed

unknown black-box functions. Bayesian optimization provides a framework which
allows us to build surrogate models based on sequential samples drawn from the
function and find the optimum. Tuning algorithmic parameters to optimize the
performance of large, complicated ""black-box"" application codes is a specific
important application, which aims at finding the optima of black-box functions.
Within the Bayesian optimization framework, the Gaussian process model produces
smooth or continuous sample paths. However, the black-box function in the
tuning problem is often non-smooth. This difficult tuning problem is worsened
by the fact that we usually have limited sequential samples from the black-box
function. Motivated by these issues encountered in tuning, we propose a novel
additive Gaussian process model called clustered Gaussian process (cGP), where
the additive components are induced by clustering. In the examples we studied,
the performance can be improved by as much as 90% among repetitive experiments.
By using this surrogate model, we want to capture the non-smoothness of the
black-box function. In addition to an algorithm for constructing this model, we
also apply the model to several artificial and real applications to evaluate
it.

effects are arise due to the star's response to their companion's tidal field,
leaving a characteristic imprint in the emitted GW signal. This unique
signature allows us to constrain the cold neutron star equation of state. At GW
frequencies above $\gtrsim 800$Hz, however, subdominant tidal effects known as

neglecting dynamical tidal effects associated with the fundamental ($f$-) mode
leads to large systematic biases in the measured tidal deformability of the

find that $f$-mode dynamical tides will already be relevant for Advanced LIGO's

lead to errors on the neutron radius of $\mathcal{O}(1{\rm km})$, with dramatic

generated predominantly during compression stages of heavy-ion collisions by
the strong repulsive interaction due to high baryon densities. In contrast, in
the expansion stages of the collision, the negative directed flow is generated
more strongly than the positive one by the tilted expansion and shadowing by
the spectator matter. At lower collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}<10$ GeV, the
positive flow wins against the negative flow because of a long compression

transition beam energy from positive to negative flow is highly sensitive to
the strength of the interaction.

explanation of the fundamentals of this research which I hope the reader will
find helpful. The next goal broadly speaking has been to further develop the
mathematics behind the currently used pulsar timing models for detecting
gravitational waves with pulsar timing experiments. I classify four regimes of
interest, governed by frequency evolution and wavefront curvature effects
incorporated into the timing residual models. Of these four regimes the
plane-wave models are well established in previous literature. I add a new
regime which I label ""Fresnel,"" as I show it becomes important for significant
Fresnel numbers describing the curvature of the gravitational wavefront. Then I
give two in-depth studies. The first forecasts the ability of future pulsar
timing experiments to probe and measure these Fresnel effects. The second
further generalizes the models to a cosmologically expanding universe, and I
show how the Hubble constant can be measured directly in the most generalized
pulsar timing residual model. This offers future pulsar timing experiments the
possibility of being able to procure a purely gravitational wave-based
measurement of the Hubble constant. The final chapter shows the initial steps
taken to extend this work in the future toward Doppler tracking experiments.

very simple generalization of this DM-based algorithm from a density-function

generalization allows us to combine sparsified weighted Rips filtration to

and then to 78.7 K, respectively. The low-temperature behavior of
$\lambda\left(T\right)$ evolves from a $T-$linear in pristine state to a
$T^{2}-$behavior after the irradiation, expected for a line-nodal $d-$wave
superconductor. However, the original theory that explained such behavior had
assumed a unitary limit of the scattering potential, whereas usually in normal
metals and semiconductors, Born scattering is sufficient to describe the
experiment. To estimate the scattering potential strength, we calculated the
normalized superfluid density,
$\rho_{s}\left(t=T/T_{c}\right)=\lambda^{2}\left(0\right)/\lambda^{2}\left(t\right)$,
varying the amount and the strength of non-magnetic scattering using a
self-consistent $t-$matrix theory. Fitting the obtained curves to a power-law,
$\rho_{s}=1-Rt^{n}$, and to a polynomial, $\rho_{s}=1-At-Bt^{2}$, and comparing
the coefficients $n$ in one set, and $A$ and $B$ in another with the
experimental values, we estimate the phase shift to be around 70$^{\circ}$ and
65$^{\circ}$, respectively. We correlate this result with the evolution of the
density of states with non-magnetic disorder.

relations differ between two related time series, is of interest in many
scientific applications. Modeling each time series by a vector autoregressive

the corresponding transition matrices in high dimensions. Key to the new method
is an estimating equation constructed based on the Yule-Walker equation that
links the difference in transition matrices to the difference in the

direct estimator is shown to be consistent in estimation and support recovery
under mild assumptions. These results also lead to novel consistency results

precision matrices of i.i.d observations under weaker assumptions than existing

Considering the case where the magnetic length $l_B=\sqrt{\hbar/eB}$ is
comparable to the mean-free path $l_{ee}$ for electron-electron interaction in
graphene, the MO conductivities are obtained by taking a momentum balance
equation approach on the basis of the Boltzmann equation. We find that when
$l_B\sim l_{ee}$, the viscous effect in a HEL can weaken significantly the THz
MO effects such as cyclotron resonance and Faraday rotation. The upper hybrid
and cyclotron resonance magnetoplasmon modes $\omega_\pm$ are also obtained
through the RPA dielectric function. The magnetoplasmons of graphene HEL at
large wave-vector regime are affected by the viscous effect, and results in
red-shifts of the magnetoplasmon frequencies. We predict that the viscosity in

that interactions may be ruled by space-dependent laws in a way that
connections are continuously switched on and off in the course of the time.

phenomena in low-Reynolds number fluid mechanics. These approximations
typically use a line of singularity solutions to represent the flow. These
singularities can be difficult to implement numerically because they diverge at
their origin. Hence people have regularized these singularities to overcome
this issue. This regularization blurs the force over a small blob therefore
removing the divergent behaviour. However it is unclear how best to regularize
the singularities to minimize errors. In this paper we investigate if a line of
regularized Stokeslets can describe the flow around a slender body. This is
achieved by comparing the asymptotic behaviour of the flow from the line of
regularized Stokeslets with the results from slender-body theory. We find that
the flow far from the body can be captured if the regularization parameter is
proportional to the radius of the slender body. This is consistent with what is
assumed in numerical simulations and provides a choice for the proportionality
constant. However more stringent requirements must be placed on the
regularization blob to capture the near field flow outside a slender body. This
inability to replicate the local behaviour indicates that many regularizations
cannot satisfy the non-slip boundary conditions on the bodies surface to
leading order, with one of the most commonly used regularizations showing an
angular dependency of velocity along any cross section. This problem can be
overcome with compactly supported blobs { and we construct one such example
blob which could be effectively used to simulate the flow around a slender body

algorithmic chorale harmonization typically adopt a black-box, ""data-driven""
approach: they do not explicitly integrate principles from music theory but
rely on a complex learning model trained with a large amount of chorale data.
We propose instead a new harmonization model, called BacHMMachine, which
employs a ""theory-driven"" framework guided by music composition principles,
along with a ""data-driven"" model for learning compositional features within
this framework. As its name suggests, BacHMMachine uses a novel Hidden Markov
Model based on key and chord transitions, providing a probabilistic framework
for learning key modulations and chordal progressions from a given melodic

chorale harmonizations; integrating compositional principles allows for a much
simpler model that results in vast decreases in computational burden and
greater interpretability compared to state-of-the-art algorithmic harmonization
methods, at no penalty to quality of harmonization or musicality. We
demonstrate this improvement via comprehensive experiments and Turing tests

are among the most important goals in nuclear physics. In recent years,
diffractive vector meson production measured in ultra-peripheral collisions
(UPCs) at heavy-ion colliders has provided a new tool for probing the gluon
density. In this Letter, we report the first measurement of $J/\psi$
photoproduction off the deuteron in UPCs at the center-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=200~\rm GeV$ in d$+$Au collisions. The differential cross
section as a function of momentum transfer $-t$ is measured. In addition, data
with a neutron tagged in the deuteron-going Zero-Degree Calorimeter is
investigated for the first time, which is found to be consistent with the
expectation of incoherent diffractive scattering at low momentum transfer.
Theoretical predictions based on the Color Glass Condensate saturation model
and the gluon shadowing model are compared with the data quantitatively. A
better agreement with the saturation model has been observed. With the current
measurement, the results are found to be directly sensitive to the gluon
density distribution of the deuteron and the deuteron breakup, which provides
insights into the nuclear gluonic structure.

method is preferred as each client has their own personalized model as a result
of federated learning. It usually requires a local model and a federated model,
but this approach is either limited to partial parameter exchange or requires
additional local updates, each of which is helpless to novel clients and
burdensome to the client's computational capacity. As the existence of a
connected subspace containing diverse low-loss solutions between two or more
independent deep networks has been discovered, we combined this interesting
property with the model mixture-based personalized federated learning method
for improved performance of personalization. We proposed SuPerFed, a
personalized federated learning method that induces an explicit connection

boosting each other. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark

personalization performance and robustness to problematic scenarios possible in

(evolutionary trees). However, despite decades of widespread application, it
remains difficult to judge how well a given Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) run explores the space of phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we
investigate the Monte Carlo error of phylogenies, focusing on high-dimensional
summaries of the posterior distribution, including variability in estimated
edge/branch (known in phylogenetics as ""split"") probabilities and tree
probabilities, and variability in the estimated summary tree. Specifically, we
ask if there is any measure of effective sample size (ESS) applicable to
phylogenetic trees which is capable of capturing the Monte Carlo error of these
three summary measures. We find that there are some ESS measures capable of
capturing the error inherent in using MCMC samples to approximate the posterior
distributions on phylogenies. We term these tree ESS measures, and identify a
set of three which are useful in practice for assessing the Monte Carlo error.
Lastly, we present visualization tools that can improve comparisons between
multiple independent MCMC runs by accounting for the Monte Carlo error present
in each chain. Our results indicate that common post-MCMC workflows are
insufficient to capture the inherent Monte Carlo error of the tree, and
highlight the need for both within-chain mixing and between-chain convergence
assessments.

canonical models. While optimal control of known systems has a rich literature,
the problem is technically hard under model uncertainty and there are hardly

function. Indeed, this work is the first that comprehensively addresses the
crucial challenge of balancing exploration versus exploitation in
continuous-time systems. We present online policies that learn optimal actions
fast by carefully randomizing the parameter estimates, and establish their
performance guarantees: a regret bound that grows with square-root of time
multiplied by the number of parameters. Implementation of the policy for a
flight-control task demonstrates its efficacy. Further, we prove sharp
stability results for inexact system dynamics and tightly specify the
infinitesimal regret caused by sub-optimal actions. To obtain the results, we
conduct a novel eigenvalue-sensitivity analysis for matrix perturbation,
establish upper-bounds for comparative ratios of stochastic integrals, and
introduce the new method of policy differentiation. Our analysis sheds light on
fundamental challenges in continuous-time reinforcement learning and suggests a
useful cornerstone for similar problems.

the system with some form of disorder, was observed in the ThCr2Si2-type
compound PrAu2Si2 at a temperature of ~3 K. This puzzling phenomenon was later
explained based on a novel dynamic frustration model that does not involve
static disorder. We present the results of re-verification of the reported
spin-glass behaviors by measuring the physical properties of three
polycrystalline PrAu2Si2 samples annealed under different conditions. Indeed,
in the sample annealed at 827 C for one week, a spin-glass transition does
occur at a temperature of Tf=2.8 K as that reported previously in the
literature. However, it is newly found that the spin-glass effect is actually
more pronounced in the as-cast sample, and almost completely disappears in the
well-annealed (at 850 C for 4 weeks) sample. The apparent sample dependence of
the magnetic characteristics of PrAu2Si2 is discussed by comparing it with
similar phenomena observed in the isomorphic compounds URh2Ge2 and CeAu2Si2.
Our experimental results strongly suggest that the spin-glass behavior observed
in the as cast and insufficient annealed samples is most likely due to the
presence of small amount of crystalline impurities and/or partial site disorder
on the Au and Si sublattices, and thus is not the inherent characteristic of
ideal ThCr2Si2-type PrAu2Si2. The perfectly ordered PrAu2Si2 should be regarded
as a paramagnetic system with obvious crystal-field effects.

evolution of the population of each type using a two-type Feller diffusion with
immigration, and we study the frequency of one of the types, in each island,
when the total population size in each island is forced to be constant at a
dense set of times. This leads to the solution of a SDE which we call the
asymmetric two-island frequency process. We derive properties of this process
and obtain a large population limit when the total size of each island tends to
infinity. Additionally, we compute the fluctuations of the process around its
deterministic limit. We establish conditions under which the asymmetric
two-island frequency process has a moment dual. The dual is a continuous-time
two-dimensional Markov chain that can be interpreted in terms of mutation,
branching, pairwise branching, coalescence, and a novel mixed
selection-migration term. Also, we conduct a stability analysis of the limiting

reservoirs increase the genetic variability, we find that if a population that

simultaneous endogeneity and non-linearities. We perform an application based
on a tax on electricity consumption in the Colombian economy. Our results
suggest that there are four clusters due to unobserved preference
heterogeneity; although 95% of our sample belongs to one cluster. This suggests
that observable variables describe preferences in a good way under the EASI

goods with non-linear Engel curves. Joint predictive distributions indicate
that electricity tax generates substitution effects between electricity and
other non-utility goods. These distributions as well as Slutsky matrices

However, there are heterogeneous effects with higher socioeconomic strata

to examine whether discussions vary across user characteristics. Results:
Overall, 26.70% of the Twitter users discuss wisdom tooth pain/jaw hurt, 23.86%
tweet about dental service/cavity, 18.97% discuss chipped tooth/tooth break,
16.23% talk about dental pain, and the rest are about tooth decay/gum bleeding.

two breaks corresponding to spatial sales of 1845 AU and 7346 AU, indicative of
a two-level clustering phenomenon, along with a linear regime below 1845 AU,

viewed as a statistical mechanical systems in the grand canonical ensemble.
Circulant $L$-ensembles are the subclass which are locally translationally
invariant and furthermore subject to periodic boundary conditions. Existing
theory can very simply be specialised to this setting, allowing for the
derivation of formulas for the system pressure, and the correlation kernel, in
the thermodynamic limit. For a one-dimensional domain, this is possible when
the circulant matrix is both real symmetric, or complex Hermitian. The special
case of the former having a Gaussian functional form for the entries is shown
to correspond to free fermions at finite temperature, and be generalisable to
higher dimensions. A special case of the latter is shown to be the statistical
mechanical model introduced by Gaudin to interpolate between Poisson and
unitary symmetry statistics in random matrix theory. It is shown in all cases
that the compressibility sum rule for the two-point correlation is obeyed, and
the small and large distance asymptotics of the latter are considered. Also, a
conjecture relating the asymptotic form of the hole probability to the pressure
is verified.

Fusion Network (DFNet), which adopts a two-stream structure, in which two
non-shared convolution kernels are employed in each layer to extract individual
features. Besides, DFNet has shared convolution kernels for each layer to
extract common features. Non-shared convolution kernels and shared convolution
kernels are adaptively weighted and summed according to different image pairs,
so that DFNet can deal with different contributions for different sequences.
DFNet has a fast speed, which is 28.658 FPS. The experimental results show that
when DFNet only increases the Mult-Adds of 0.02% than the

reasonable scattering phase shifts even at the leading order of the derivative
expansion, and they give more accurate results as the order of the expansion
increases. By comparing the above results with those from the formal derivative
expansion for the separable potential, we conclude that the derivative
expansion is not a way to obtain the potential but a method to extract physical
observables such as phase shifts and binding energies, and that the scattering
phase shifts from the derivative expansion in the HAL QCD method converge to
the exact ones much faster than those from the formal derivative expansion of

of the energy of the lowest crystal-field excitation of Er$^{3+}$

cooling from 10K to 1.5K through the magnetic ordering temperature of Er$^{3+}$
at 4.1 K. A crystal-field model was proposed to explain the observed crystal
field excitations in this work. The model indicates the lowest-energy
crystal-field excitation in ErFeO$_3$ is the first Kramers doublet above the
ground state. Its energy substantially shifts by the internal field induced by
the ordered Er$^{3+}$ magnetic moments. Further magnetic-field-dependent
measurements provide strong supportive evidence for this scenario. By fitting
the external magnetic-field dependency of the crystal-field excitation energy,
the internal field generated by Er$^{3+}$ magnetic moments was derived to be
~0.33meV. The result indicates that the internal field of Er$^{3+}$ magnetic
moments contribute to the energy shift of the crystal-field excitations. The
giant energy shift under fields could be attributed to the anisotropy of the
large effective g-factor.

the magnetic field. Here we study the effect of grain alignment and grain
motion on grain growth in molecular clouds (MCs). We first discuss the
characteristic timescales of alignment of the grain axis of maximum inertia
($\hat{a}_{1}$) with its angular momentum (${\bf J}$) (i.e., {\it internal
alignment}) and alignment of ${\bf J}$ with the magnetic field (${\bf B}$,
i.e., {\it external alignment}). We determine the maximum grain size with
efficient internal ($a_{\rm max,aJ}$) and external alignment ($a_{\rm max,JB}$)
for composite grains. For the MC density of $n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{3}-10^{8}\rm
cm^{-3}$, we find that external alignment can occur for very large grains, but
internal alignment only occurs for grains smaller than $a_{\rm max,aJ}\sim 2\mu
m$. The presence of iron clusters within dust grains or suprathermal rotation
increase $a_{\max,aJ}$ to $\sim 10-50\mu m$. We then study the growth of
aligned grains drifting through the gas. Due to the motion of aligned grains
across the magnetic field, gas accretion would increase the grain elongation
rather than decrease as expected from the growth of randomly oriented grains.
Coagulation by grain collisions also increases grain elongation, leading to the
increase of elongation with the grain size. The coagulation of aligned grains
forms dust aggregates that contain elongated binaries comprising a pair of
grains with parallel short axes. Grains within dust aggregates in
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko obtained by {\it Rosetta} have the grain elongation
increasing with the grain radius, implying that such dust aggregates might form
from aligned grains.

thickness and pitch angle enhances the normalized swimming speed (i.e., ratio

Strikingly, unlike the Newtonian fluid, the viscoelastic flow around the

characterized by a strong negative wake downstream of the swimmer. Evidently,
the strength of the negative wake is inversely proportional to the normalized
swimming speed. Three-dimensional simulations of the swimmer with FENE-P model
with conditions that match those of experiments, confirm formation of a similar

systematically in the framework of the density dependent relativistic mean
field (DDRMF) model. The $\phi$-meson shifts hyperon threshold to a higher
density and reduces the hyperon fractions in neutron star cores. It also
strongly stiffens the equation of state (EoS) calculated with various DDRMF
effective interactions and increases the maximum mass of hyperon stars, but
only a few effective interactions survive under the constraints from recent
astrophysical observations. In the DDRMF model, the conformal limit of sound
velocity is still in a strong tension with the fact that the maximum mass of
neutron stars obtained in theoretical calculations reaches about two solar
masses. Based on different interior composition assumptions, we discuss the
possibility of the secondary object of GW190814 as a neutron star. When
$\phi$-meson is considered, DD-ME2 and DD-MEX support that the secondary object
of GW190814 is a hyperon star rapidly rotating with Kepler frequency.

large-scale dataset by first aligning four popular CSKBs, and then presenting a
high-quality human-annotated evaluation set to probe neural models' commonsense
reasoning ability. We also propose a novel inductive commonsense reasoning

non-thermal Band component. The synchrotron radiation in the popular internal
shock model is generally put forward to explain such a non-thermal component.
However, the low-energy photon index $\alpha \sim -1.5$ predicted by the
synchrotron radiation is inconsistent with the observed value $\alpha \sim -1$.
Here, we investigate the evolution of a magnetic field during propagation of
internal shocks within an ultrarelativistic outflow, and revisit the fast
cooling of shock-accelerated electrons via synchrotron radiation for this
evolutional magnetic field. We find that the magnetic field is first nearly
constant and then decays as $B'\propto t^{-1}$, which leads to a reasonable
range of the low-energy photon index, $-3/2 < \alpha < -2/3$. In addition, if a
rising electron injection rate during a GRB is introduced, we find that
$\alpha$ reaches $-2/3$ more easily. We thus fit the prompt emission spectra of
GRB 080916c and GRB~080825c.

were located several degrees to the southwest of the comet's head and reported
independently by four observers, including J. F. J. Schmidt and E. E. Barnard,
over a period of ten days nearly one month after perihelion, when the comet was
0.7 AU to 1 AU from the Sun. I conclude that none of the nebulous companions
was ever sighted more than once and that, contrary to his belief, Schmidt
observed unrelated objects on the four consecutive mornings. Each nebulous
companion is proposed to have been triggered by a fragment at most a few tens
of meters across, released from the comet's nucleus after perihelion and seen
only because it happened to be caught in the brief terminal outburst, when its
mass was suddenly shattered into a cloud of mostly microscopic debris due
possibly to rotational bursting triggered by sublimation torques. The
fragment's motion was affected by a strong outgassing-driven nongravitational
acceleration with a significant out-of-plane component. Although fragmentation
events were common, only a small fraction of nebulous companions was detected
because of their transient nature. The observed brightness of the nebulous
companions is proposed to have been due mainly to C2 emissions, with a
contribution from scattering of sunlight by the microscopic dust. By their
nature, the fragments responsible for the nebulous companions bear a strong
resemblance to the dwarf Kreutz sungrazers detected with the coronagraphs
aboard the SOHO space probe. Only their fragmentation histories are different
and the latter display no terminal outburst, a consequence of extremely short
lifetimes of the sublimating icy and refractory material in the Sun's corona.

systems. Detecting road segments is challenging as they are of varying widths,
bifurcated throughout the image, and are often occluded by terrain, cloud, or
other weather conditions. Using just convolution neural networks (ConvNets) for
this problem is not effective as it is inefficient at capturing distant
dependencies between road segments in the image which is essential to extract
road connectivity. To this end, we propose a Spatial and Interaction Space
Graph Reasoning (SPIN) module which when plugged into a ConvNet performs
reasoning over graphs constructed on spatial and interaction spaces projected
from the feature maps. Reasoning over spatial space extracts dependencies
between different spatial regions and other contextual information. Reasoning
over a projected interaction space helps in appropriate delineation of roads
from other topographies present in the image. Thus, SPIN extracts long-range
dependencies between road segments and effectively delineates roads from other
semantics. We also introduce a SPIN pyramid which performs SPIN graph reasoning
across multiple scales to extract multi-scale features. We propose a network
based on stacked hourglass modules and SPIN pyramid for road segmentation which
achieves better performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, our method
is computationally efficient and significantly boosts the convergence speed
during training, making it feasible for applying on large-scale high-resolution

deriving an upper bound under a new metric called the element-wise gradient

federated optimization over sparse data, while the conventional metric of
squared gradient norm used in FedAvg and its variants cannot. We extensively

strict hierarchies of multi-tasks and robot's physical inequality constraints
during whole-body compliance. However, for the one-step HQP, the solution can
oscillate when it is close to the boundary of constraints. It is because the
abrupt hit of the bounds gives rise to unrealisable jerks and even infeasible
solutions. This paper proposes the mixed control, which blends the single-axis
model predictive control (MPC) and proportional derivate (PD) control for the
whole-body compliance to overcome these deficiencies. The MPC predicts the
distances between the bounds and the control target of the critical tasks, and
it provides smooth and feasible solutions by prediction and optimisation in
advance. However, applying MPC will inevitably increase the computation time.
Therefore, to achieve a 500 Hz servo rate, the PD controllers still regulate
other tasks to save computation resources. Also, we use a more efficient null
space projection (NSP) whole-body controller instead of the HQP and distribute
the single-axis MPCs into four CPU cores for parallel computation. Finally, we
validate the desired capabilities of the proposed strategy via Simulations and

setting is a daunting task, especially when the data distribution at the users
is heterogeneous. As our main contribution, we propose Basil, a fast and
computationally efficient Byzantine robust algorithm for decentralized training
systems, which leverages a novel sequential, memory assisted and
performance-based criteria for training over a logical ring while filtering the
Byzantine users. In the IID dataset distribution setting, we provide the
theoretical convergence guarantees of Basil, demonstrating its linear
convergence rate. Furthermore, for the IID setting, we experimentally
demonstrate that Basil is robust to various Byzantine attacks, including the
strong Hidden attack, while providing up to ${\sim}16 \%$ higher test accuracy
over the state-of-the-art Byzantine-resilient decentralized learning approach.
Additionally, we generalize Basil to the non-IID dataset distribution setting
by proposing Anonymous Cyclic Data Sharing (ACDS), a technique that allows each
node to anonymously share a random fraction of its local non-sensitive dataset
(e.g., landmarks images) with all other nodes. We demonstrate that Basil
alongside ACDS with only $5\%$ data sharing provides effective toleration of
Byzantine nodes, unlike the state-of-the-art Byzantine robust algorithm that
completely fails in the heterogeneous data setting. Finally, to reduce the
overall latency of Basil resulting from its sequential implementation over the
logical ring, we propose Basil+. In particular, Basil+ provides scalability by
enabling Byzantine-robust parallel training across groups of logical rings, and
at the same time, it retains the performance gains of Basil due to sequential
training within each group. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the
scalability gains of Basil+ through different sets of experiments.

recent ideas for building efficient convolutional neural networks. They are
seemingly incompatible: the vast majority of operations in depthwise separable
CNNs are in pointwise convolutional layers, but pointwise layers use 1x1
kernels, which do not benefit from frequency transformation. This paper unifies
these two ideas by transforming the activations, not the kernels. Our key
insights are that 1) pointwise convolutions commute with frequency
transformation and thus can be computed in the frequency domain without
modification, 2) each channel within a given layer has a different level of
sensitivity to frequency domain pruning, and 3) each channel's sensitivity to
frequency pruning is approximately monotonic with respect to frequency. We
leverage this knowledge by proposing a new technique which wraps each pointwise
layer in a discrete cosine transform (DCT) which is truncated to selectively
prune coefficients above a given threshold as per the needs of each channel. To
learn which frequencies should be pruned from which channels, we introduce a
novel learned parameter which specifies each channel's pruning threshold. We
add a new regularization term which incentivizes the model to decrease the
number of retained frequencies while still maintaining task accuracy. Unlike
weight pruning techniques which rely on sparse operators, our contiguous
frequency band pruning results in fully dense computation. We apply our
technique to MobileNetV2 and in the process reduce computation time by 22% and
incur <1% accuracy degradation.

secure search. Compared to other secure search systems, no costly setup
procedure is necessary; it is sufficient for the client merely to upload the
encrypted database to the server. Confidentiality is provided because the
server works only on the encrypted query and records. While the search
functionality is enabled by the full homomorphism of the encryption scheme.
  For this reason, researchers have been paying increasing attention to this
problem. Since Akavia et al. (CCS 2018) presented a framework for secure search
on FHE encrypted data and gave a working implementation called SPiRiT, several
more efficient realizations have been proposed.
  In this paper, we identify the main bottlenecks of this framework and show
how to significantly improve the performance of FHE-base secure search. In
particular,
  1. To retrieve $\ell$ matching items, the existing framework needs to repeat
the protocol $\ell$ times sequentially. In our new framework, all matching
items are retrieved in parallel in a single protocol execution.
  2. The most recent work by Wren et al. (CCS 2020) requires $O(n)$
multiplications to compute the first matching index. Our solution requires no
homomorphic multiplication, instead using only additions and scalar
multiplications to encode all matching indices.
  3. Our implementation and experiments show that to fetch 16 matching records,
our system gives an 1800X speed-up over the state of the art in fetching the
query results resulting in a 26X speed-up for the full search functionality.

sparsity in the forward and backward passes are correlated. In that context, we
investigate two types of sparsity (input and output type) inherent in gradient

outperform traditional radiomics-based survival prediction models. Deep
survival models usually use image patches covering the whole target regions

signal that is modulated by the fiber nonlinearity to become a periodic lattice
of pulse solitons which can be described by elliptic functions. We carry out a
linear stability analysis of the soliton-crystal structure and establish that
the correlation of centers of mass of interacting pulses broadens their
internal-mode spectrum, some modes of which are mutually degenerate. While it
has long been known that high-intensity periodic pulse trains in optical fibers
are generated from the phenomenon of modulational instability of continuous
waves, the present study provides evidence that they can also be generated via
temporal multiplexing of an infinitely large number of equal-intensity single
pulses to give rise to stable elliptic solitons.

Compression method, R-PCC, which can reconstruct the point cloud with uniform

into small and compact regions for spatial redundancy and salient region
classification. Compared with other voxel-based or image-based compression

in the reconstructed point cloud. It can also control the maximum
reconstruction error for each point through a quantization module. In the
experiments, we prove that our easier FPS-based segmentation method can achieve
better performance than instance-based segmentation methods such as DBSCAN. To
verify the advantages of our proposed method, we evaluate the reconstruction
quality and fidelity for 3D object detection and SLAM, as the downstream tasks.
The experimental results show that our elegant framework can achieve 30$\times$
compression ratio without affecting downstream tasks, and our non-uniform
compression framework shows a great improvement on the downstream tasks

non-parametric methods such as the inverse probability weighting methods have
limitations that hinder their use in many practical settings where the values

present several appealing properties of PSR, including the consistency and
asymptotical normality, and in particular the existence of an explicit variance

assessed. Simulation studies indicate that PSR outperform existing methods in

targeted attacks through real-time manipulation of the agent's observation, and

the feasibility of targeted attacks through visually learned patterns placed on

demonstrate that a pre-trained policy can be hijacked within a time window,
e.g., performing an unintended self-parking, when an adversarial object is

vulnerabilities, which may be exploited by adversaries to cause considerable
harm. An important approach for mitigating this threat is remote attestation,
which enables the defender to remotely verify the integrity of devices and
their software. There are a number of approaches for remote attestation, and
each has its unique advantages and disadvantages in terms of detection accuracy
and computational cost. Further, an attestation method may be applied in
multiple ways, such as various levels of software coverage. Therefore, to
minimize both security risks and computational overhead, defenders need to
decide strategically which attestation methods to apply and how to apply them,
depending on the characteristic of the devices and the potential losses.
  To answer these questions, we first develop a testbed for remote attestation
of IoT devices, which enables us to measure the detection accuracy and
performance overhead of various attestation methods. Our testbed integrates two
example IoT applications, memory-checksum based attestation, and a variety of
software vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to inject arbitrary code into
running applications. Second, we model the problem of finding an optimal
strategy for applying remote attestation as a Stackelberg security game between
a defender and an adversary. We characterize the defender's optimal attestation
strategy in a variety of special cases. Finally, building on experimental
results from our testbed, we evaluate our model and show that optimal strategic
attestation can lead to significantly lower losses than naive baseline
strategies.

conventional physical layer security, referred to as hierarchical information
accessibility (HIA). A main feature of the HIA model is that a network has a
hierarchy in information accessibility, wherein decoding feasibility is
determined by a priority of users. Under this HIA model, we formulate a sum
secrecy rate maximization problem with regard to precoding vectors. This
problem is challenging since multiple non-smooth functions are involved into
the secrecy rate to fulfill the HIA conditions and also the problem is
non-convex. To address the challenges, we approximate the minimum function by
using the LogSumExp technique, thereafter obtain the first-order optimality
condition. One key observation is that the derived condition is cast as a
functional eigenvalue problem, where the eigenvalue is equivalent to the
approximated objective function of the formulated problem. Accordingly, we show
that finding a principal eigenvector is equivalent to finding a local optimal
solution. To this end, we develop a novel method called generalized power
iteration for HIA (GPI-HIA). Simulations demonstrate that the GPI-HIA
significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the secrecy rate.

compare stellar mass assembly histories and SF look-back time annular profiles
between CALIFA survey tidally and non-tidally perturbed galaxies. We pair their
respective star-forming regions at the closest stellar mass surface densities
to reduce the influence of stellar mass. The assembly histories and annular
profiles show statistically significant differences so that higher star
formation rates characterize regions in tidally perturbed galaxies. These
regions underwent a more intense (re)activation of SF in the last 1 Gyr.
Varying shapes of the annular profiles also reflect fluctuations between
suppression and (re)activation of SF. Since gas-phase abundances use to be
lower in more actively than in less actively star-forming galaxies, we further
explore the plausible presence of metal-poor gas inflows able to dilute such
abundances. The resolved relations of oxygen (O) abundance, with stellar mass
density and with total gas fraction, show slightly lower O abundances for
regions in tidally perturbed galaxies. The single distributions of O abundances
statistically validate that so. Moreover, from a metallicity model based on
stellar feedback, the mass rate differentials (inflows$-$outflows) show
statistically valid higher values for regions in tidally perturbed galaxies.
These differentials, and the metal fractions from the population synthesis,
suggest dominant gas inflows in these galaxies. This dominance, and the
differences in SF through time, confirm the previously reported effects of
tidal interactions on SF.

simply averaging the information of the support samples to generate a single
prototype per category, our method can better utilize the information of each
support sample by treating each support sample as an individual prototype.
Specifically, we introduce two types of attention mechanisms for aggregating
the query and support feature maps. The first is to refine the information of
few-shot samples by extracting shared information between the support samples
through attention. Second, each support sample is used as a class code to
leverage the information by comparing similarities between each support feature
and query features. Our proposed method is complementary to the previous
methods, making it easy to plug and play for further improvement. We have
evaluated our method on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks, and the results verify
the effectiveness of our method. In particular, the advantages of our method
are maximized when there is more diversity among support data.

combinatorial construct called an `agreement event'. We explicitly obtain the
agreement probability for $n$ agent noisy game with l\geq 2 support noise
distribution. For a user-given satisfaction value on this probability, we
identify the noise regimes for which an estimated partition is noise robust;
that is, it is PAC core-stable in both noisy and noise-free games. We obtain
similar robustness results when the estimated partition is not PAC core-stable.
These noise regimes correspond to the level sets of the agreement probability
function and are non-convex sets. Moreover, an important fact is that the
prediction probability can be high even if high noise values occur with a high

the bounds on the extra noisy samples required to get noise robustness with a

  We completely solve the noise robustness problem of a $2$ agent hedonic game.

probability, but the noise robust regime is non-convex. Its minimum value,
called the safety value, is 0.62; so, below 0.62, the noise robust regime is
the entire probability simplex. However, for l \geq 3, the prediction

competition where 20 competing teams designed advanced machine learning
pipelines for predicting the brain connectivity evolution from a single

of data pre-processing, dimensionality reduction, and learning methods.
Utilizing an inclusive evaluation approach, we ranked the methods based on two
complementary evaluation metrics (mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson

for a microstate of a macroscopic system, we present here the simple example of
the free expansion of a one dimensional gas of non-interacting point particles.
The construction requires one to define macrostates, corresponding to
macroscopic variables. We define a macrostate $M$ by specifying the fraction of
particles in rectangular boxes $\Delta x \Delta v$ of the single particle
position-velocity space $\{x,v\}$. We verify that when the number of particles
is large the Boltzmann entropy, $S_B(t)$, of a typical microstate of a
nonequilibrium ensemble coincides with the Gibbs entropy of the coarse-grained
time-evolved one-particle distribution associated with this ensemble. $S_B(t)$
approaches its maximum possible value for the dynamical evolution of the given
initial state. The rate of approach depends on the size of $\Delta v$ in the
definition of the macrostate, going to zero at any fixed time $t$ when $\Delta
v \to 0$. Surprisingly the different curves $S_B(t)$ collapse when time is
scaled with $\Delta v$ as: $t \sim \tau/\Delta v$. We find an explicit
expression for $S_B(\tau)$ in the limit $\Delta v \to 0$. We also consider a
different, more hydrodynamical, definition of macrostates for which $S_B(t)$ is
monotone increasing, unlike the previous one which has small decaying
oscillations near its maximum value. Our system is non-ergodic, non-chaotic and
non-interacting; our results thus illustrate that these concepts are not as
relevant as sometimes claimed, for observing macroscopic irreversibility and
entropy increase. Rather, the notions of initial conditions, typicality, large
numbers and coarse-graining are the important factors. We demonstrate these
ideas through extensive simulations as well as analytic results.

partially observable environments. We implemented the controller on the
quadrupedal Spot robot and evaluated it on three challenging tasks: adversarial
pedestrian avoidance, blind-spot obstacle avoidance, and elevator riding. The
experiments show that the proposed NN architecture significantly improves
navigation performance.

of a Gibbs distribution $\pi$ on R d , based on (over-damped) Langevin
diffusions. This method both inspired by [PP18] and [GMS + 20] relies on a
multilevel occupation measure, i.e. on an appropriate combination of R
occupation measures of (constant-step) discretized schemes of the Langevin
diffusion with respective steps $\gamma$r = $\gamma$02 --r , r = 0,. .. , R.
For a given diffusion, we first state a result under general assumptions which
guarantees an $\epsilon$-approximation (in a L 2-sense) with a cost
proportional to $\epsilon$ --2 (i.e. proportional to a Monte-Carlo method
without bias) or $\epsilon$ --2 | log $\epsilon$| 3 under less contractive
assumptions. This general result is then applied to over-damped Langevin
diffusions in a strongly convex setting, with a study of the dependence in the
dimension d and in the spectrum of the Hessian matrix D 2 U of the potential U
: R d $\rightarrow$ R involved in the Gibbs distribution. This leads to
strategies with cost in O(d$\epsilon$ --2 log 3 (d$\epsilon$ --2)) and in
O(d$\epsilon$ --2) under an additional condition on the third derivatives of U.
In particular, in our last main result, we show that, up to universal
constants, an appropriate choice of the diffusion coefficient and of the
parameters of the procedure leads to a cost controlled by ($\lambda$ U $\lor$1)
2 $\lambda$ 3 U d$\epsilon$ --2 (where$\lambda$U and $\lambda$ U respectively
denote the supremum and the infimum of the largest and lowest eigenvalue of D 2

low-cost and passive metamaterials with tunable reflection properties, have
been recently proposed as an enabler for programmable radio propagation
environments. However, the role of the channel conditions near the RISs on
their optimizability has not been analyzed adequately. In this paper, we
present an asymptotic closed-form expression for the mutual information of a
multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple RISs, in
the large-antenna limit, using the random matrix and replica theories. Under
mild assumptions, asymptotic expressions for the eigenvalues and the
eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrices are derived. We find that, when
the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle
spread, the communication link benefits significantly from the RIS
optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly
uncorrelated case. Furthermore, when the desired reflection from the RIS
departs significantly from geometrical optics, the surface can be optimized to
provide robust communication links. Building on the properties of the
eigenvectors of the covariance matrices, we are able to find the optimal
response of the RISs in closed form, bypassing the need for brute-force
optimization.

greatly developed in the past years, the Ultra-fine-grained visual

classifying objects from the same species (very similar categories), while the
Ultra-FGVC targets at more challenging problems of classifying images at an
ultra-fine granularity where even human experts may fail to identify the visual
difference. The challenges for Ultra-FGVC mainly comes from two aspects: one is
that the Ultra-FGVC often arises overfitting problems due to the lack of
training samples; and another lies in that the inter-class variance among
images is much smaller than normal FGVC tasks, which makes it difficult to
learn discriminative features for each class. To solve these challenges, a
mask-guided feature extraction and feature augmentation method is proposed in
this paper to extract discriminative and informative regions of images which
are then used to augment the original feature map. The advantage of the
proposed method is that the feature detection and extraction model only
requires a small amount of target region samples with bounding boxes for
training, then it can automatically locate the target area for a large number
of images in the dataset at a high detection accuracy. Experimental results on
two public datasets and ten state-of-the-art benchmark methods consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both visually and

prototype and extensively evaluates its potential gains in the field and under
realistic wireless communication settings. In particular, a 160-element
reconfigurable surface, operating at a 5.8GHz band, is first designed,
fabricated, and accurately measured in the anechoic chamber. This surface is
then integrated into a wireless communication system and the beamforming gains,
path-loss, and coverage improvements are evaluated in realistic outdoor
communication scenarios. When both the transmitter and receiver employ
directional antennas and with 5m and 10m distances between the transmitter-RIS
and RIS-receiver, the developed RIS achieves $15$-$20$dB gain in the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a range of $\pm60^\circ$ beamforming angles. In
terms of coverage, and considering a far-field experiment with a blockage
between a base station and a grid of mobile users and with an average distance
of $35m$ between base station (BS) and the user (through the RIS), the RIS
provides an average SNR improvement of $6$dB (max $8$dB) within an area $>
75$m$^2$. Thanks to the scalable RIS design, these SNR gains can be directly
increased with larger RIS areas. For example, a 1,600-element RIS with the same
design is expected to provide around $26$dB SNR gain for a similar deployment.
These results, among others, draw useful insights into the design and
performance of RIS systems and provide an important proof for their potential

Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) with heterogeneous blocklength constraints,
specified according to users' channel output signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We
assume the user with higher output SNR has a shorter blocklength constraint. We
show that with sufficiently large output SNR, the stronger user can perform the
\textit{early decoding} (ED) technique to decode and subtract the interference
via successive interference cancellation (SIC). To achieve it, we derive an
explicit lower bound on the necessary number of received symbols for a
successful ED, using an independent and identically distributed Gaussian input.
A second-order rate of the weaker user who suffers from an SNR change due to
the heterogeneous blocklength constraint, is also derived. Numerical results
show that ED can outperform the hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access scheme
when the stronger channel is sufficiently better than the weaker one. Under the

that ED with SIC is a promising technique for the future wireless networks.

become partitioned, there is a tradeoff between consistency and availability.
Consistency is agreement on the values of shared variables across a system, and
availability is the ability to respond to reads and writes accessing those
shared variables. We quantify these concepts, giving numerical values to
inconsistency and unavailability. Recognizing that network partitioning is not
an all-or-nothing proposition, we replace the P in CAP with L, a numerical
measure of apparent latency, and derive the CAL theorem, an algebraic relation
between inconsistency, unavailability, and apparent latency. This relation
shows that if latency becomes unbounded (e.g., the network becomes
partitioned), then one of inconsistency and unavailability must also become
unbounded, and hence the CAP theorem is a special case of the CAL theorem. We
describe two distributed coordination mechanisms, which we have implemented as
an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, that support arbitrary
tradeoffs between consistency and availability as apparent latency varies. With
centralized coordination, inconsistency remains bounded by a chosen numerical
value at the cost that unavailability becomes unbounded under network
partitioning. With decentralized coordination, unavailability remains bounded
by a chosen numerical quantity at the cost that inconsistency becomes unbounded
under network partitioning. Our centralized coordination mechanism is an
extension of techniques that have historically been used for distributed
simulation, an application where consistency is paramount. Our decentralized
coordination mechanism is an extension of techniques that have been used in
distributed databases when availability is paramount.

unpredictable environments in a collision-free manner. So far, this has only
been partially achieved in driverless cars and warehouse installations where
marked structures such as roads, lanes, and traffic signs simplify the motion
planning and collision avoidance problem. We are presenting a new control
approach for car-like vehicles that is based on an unprecedentedly fast-paced
A* implementation that allows the control cycle to run at a frequency of 30 Hz.
This frequency enables us to place our A* algorithm as a low-level replanning
controller that is well suited for navigation and collision avoidance in
virtually any dynamic environment. Due to an efficient heuristic consisting of
rotate-translate-rotate motions laid out along the shortest path to the target,
our Short-Term Aborting A* (STAA*) converges fast and can be aborted early in
order to guarantee a high and steady control rate. While our STAA* expands
states along the shortest path, it takes care of collision checking with the
environment including predicted states of moving obstacles, and returns the
best solution found when the computation time runs out. Despite the bounded
computation time, our STAA* does not get trapped in corners due to the
following of the shortest path. In simulated and real-robot experiments, we
demonstrate that our control approach eliminates collisions almost entirely and
is superior to an improved version of the Dynamic Window Approach with
predictive collision avoidance capabilities.

exponentially large Hilbert space and the fact that unitary transformations on

simulation of quantum algorithms difficult. Here we introduce higher-order
partial derivatives of a probability distribution of particle positions as a
new object that shares these basic properties of quantum mechanical states
needed for a quantum algorithm. Discretization of the positions allows one to
represent the quantum mechanical state of $n_\text{bit}$ qubits by
$2(n_\text{bit}+1)$ classical stochastic bits. Based on this, we demonstrate
many-particle interference and representation of pure entangled quantum states
via derivatives of probability distributions and find the universal set of
stochastic maps that correspond to the quantum gates in a universal gate set.
We prove that the propagation via the stochastic map built from those universal
stochastic maps reproduces up to a prefactor exactly the evolution of the
quantum mechanical state with the corresponding quantum algorithm, leading to
an automated translation of a quantum algorithm to a stochastic classical
algorithm. We implement several well-known quantum algorithms, analyse the
scaling of the needed number of realizations with the number of qubits, and
highlight the role of destructive interference for the cost of the emulation.
Foundational questions raised by the new representation of a quantum state are
discussed.

simultaneously construct the emotion consensus and utilize some external

Apply the trained FEM to acquire the novel data's features and recognize them.
FSL relies heavily on the design of the FEM. However, various FEMs have
distinct emphases. For example, several may focus more attention on the contour

noise. Deep learning generative models can be used to denoise these images and
in turn improve radiomics' reproducibility and performance. However, most
generative models are trained on paired data, which can be difficult or
impossible to collect. In this article, we investigate the possibility of
denoising low dose CTs using cycle generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
improve radiomics reproducibility and performance based on unpaired datasets.
Two cycle GANs were trained: 1) from paired data, by simulating low dose CTs
(i.e., introducing noise) from high dose CTs; and 2) from unpaired real low
dose CTs. To accelerate convergence, during GAN training, a slice-paired
training strategy was introduced. The trained GANs were applied to three
scenarios: 1) improving radiomics reproducibility in simulated low dose CT
images and 2) same-day repeat low dose CTs (RIDER dataset) and 3) improving
radiomics performance in survival prediction. Cycle GAN results were compared
with a conditional GAN (CGAN) and an encoder-decoder network (EDN) trained on
simulated paired data.The cycle GAN trained on simulated data improved
concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features from 0.87 to
0.93 on simulated noise CT and from 0.89 to 0.92 on RIDER dataset, as well
improving the AUC of survival prediction from 0.52 to 0.59. The cycle GAN
trained on real data increased the CCCs of features in RIDER to 0.95 and the
AUC of survival prediction to 0.58. The results show that cycle GANs trained on
both simulated and real data can improve radiomics' reproducibility and
performance in low dose CT and achieve similar results compared to CGANs and
EDNs.

unsolved. This might not be surprising given the complexity of the process that
includes various physical and chemical processes, and spans huge ranges of
length-scales, masses, and timescales. In addition, planet formation cannot be
directly observed but has to be inferred by gluing together different pieces of
information into one consistent picture. ""How do planets form?"" remains a
fundamental question in modern astrophysics. In this review we list some of the
key open questions in planet formation theory as well as the challenges and
upcoming opportunities.

relevant content from the overwhelming amount of literature available. Despite
the widespread adoption of LRS, there is a lack of research on the
user-perceived recommendation characteristics for fundamentally different
approaches to content-based literature recommendation. To complement existing
quantitative studies on literature recommendation, we present qualitative study
results that report on users' perceptions for two contrasting recommendation
classes: (1) link-based recommendation represented by the Co-Citation Proximity
(CPA) approach, and (2) text-based recommendation represented by Lucene's
MoreLikeThis (MLT) algorithm. The empirical data analyzed in our study with
twenty users and a diverse set of 40 Wikipedia articles indicate a noticeable
difference between text- and link-based recommendation generation approaches
along several key dimensions. The text-based MLT method receives higher
satisfaction ratings in terms of user-perceived similarity of recommended
articles. In contrast, the CPA approach receives higher satisfaction scores in
terms of diversity and serendipity of recommendations. We conclude that users
of literature recommendation systems can benefit most from hybrid approaches
that combine both link- and text-based approaches, where the user's information
needs and preferences should control the weighting for the approaches used. The
optimal weighting of multiple approaches used in a hybrid recommendation system
is highly dependent on a user's shifting needs.

Bayesian posterior are well-calibrated when the model is correctly-specified,
in the frequentist sense that their coverage probabilities tend to the nominal
values as data accrue. However, this conventional Bayesian framework is known
to lack robustness when the model is misspecified or only partly specified,
such as in quantile regression, risk minimization based supervised/unsupervised
learning and robust estimation. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new
Bayesian inferential approach that substitutes the (misspecified or partly
specified) likelihoods with proper exponentially tilted empirical likelihoods
plus a regularization term. Our surrogate empirical likelihood is carefully
constructed by using the first order optimality condition of the empirical risk
minimization as the moment condition. We show that the Bayesian posterior
obtained by combining this surrogate empirical likelihood and the prior is
asymptotically close to a normal distribution centering at the empirical risk
minimizer with covariance matrix taking an appropriate sandwiched form.
Consequently, the resulting Bayesian credible regions are automatically
calibrated to deliver valid uncertainty quantification. Computationally, the
proposed method can be easily implemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
algorithms. Our numerical results show that the proposed method tends to be
more accurate than existing state-of-the-art competitors.

create noise-like speckle patterns, hindering the object's visualization even
at a low-resolution level. Here, we propose a computational method relying on
the object's spatial and temporal fluctuation to visualize nanoscale objects
through scattering media non-invasively. The fluctuating object can be achieved
by random speckle illumination, illuminating through dynamic scattering media,
or flickering emitters. The optical memory effect allows us to derive the
object at diffraction limit resolution and estimate the point spreading
function (PSF). Multiple images of the fluctuating object are obtained by
deconvolution, then super-resolution images are achieved by computing the high
order cumulants. Non-linearity of high order cumulant significantly suppresses
the noise and artifacts in the resulting images and enhances the resolution by
a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the cumulant order. Our non-invasive

towards artificial general intelligence. Image captioning is a nomenclature for
describing meaningful information in an image using computer vision techniques.
Automated image captioning techniques utilize encoder and decoder architecture,
where the encoder extracts features from an image and the decoder generates a
transcript. In this work, we investigate two unexplored ideas for image
captioning using transformers: First, we demonstrate the enforcement of using
objects' relevance in the surrounding environment. Second, learning an explicit
association between labels and language constructs. We propose label-attention
Transformer with geometrically coherent objects (LATGeO). The proposed
technique acquires a proposal of geometrically coherent objects using a deep
neural network (DNN) and generates captions by investigating their
relationships using a label-attention module. Object coherence is defined using
the localized ratio of the geometrical properties of the proposals. The
label-attention module associates the extracted objects classes to the
available dictionary using self-attention layers. The experimentation results
show that objects' relevance in surroundings and binding of their visual
feature with their geometrically localized ratios combined with its associated
labels help in defining meaningful captions. The proposed framework is tested
on the MSCOCO dataset, and a thorough evaluation resulting in overall better
quantitative scores pronounces its superiority.

algorithms developed recently work in an inexact and variational manner to

Compared with quantum phase estimation, the Trotter step number, i.e. the

  Optimization in Ultra-Dense Heterogeneous Networks","12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Elsevier Physical Communication
  Journal (currently under review)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the major capacity boosters for 5G networks is the deployment of
ultra-dense heterogeneous networks (UDHNs). However, this deployment results in
tremendousincrease in the energy consumption of the network due to the large
number of base stations (BSs) involved. In addition to enhanced capacity, 5G
networks must also be energy efficient for it to be economically viable and
environmentally friendly. Dynamic cell switching is a very common way of
reducing the total energy consumption of the network but most of the proposed
methods are computationally demanding which makes them unsuitable for
application in ultra-dense network deployment with massive number of BSs. To
tackle this problem, we propose a lightweight cell switching scheme also known
as Threshold-based Hybrid cEllswItching Scheme (THESIS) for energy optimization
in UDHNs. The developed approach combines the benefits of clustering and
exhaustive search (ES) algorithm to produce a solution whose optimality is
close to that of the ES (which is guaranteed tobe optimal), but is
computationally more efficient than ES and as such can be applied for cell
switching in real networks even when their dimension is large. The performance
evaluation shows that the THESIS produces a significant reduction in the energy
consumption of the UDHN and is able to reduce the complexity of finding a
near-optimal solution from exponential to polynomial complexity.

main contribution is to propose a model-driven learning technique that exploits
the structure of the optimal downlink beamforming to design an effective hybrid
learning strategy with the aim to maximize the sum rate performance. This is
achieved by jointly considering the learning performance of the downlink
channel, the power and the sum rate in the training stage. The proposed
approach applies to generic cases in which the uplink channel information is
available, but its relation to the downlink channel is unknown and does not
require an explicit downlink channel estimation. We further extend the
developed technique to massive multiple-input multiple-output scenarios and
achieve a distributed learning strategy for multicell systems without an
inter-cell signalling overhead. Simulation results verify that our proposed
method provides the performance close to the state of the art numerical
algorithms with perfect downlink channel information and significantly
outperforms existing data-driven methods in terms of the sum rate.

exponential function. These two phases point to different physical mechanisms
such as: tether-cutting reconnection and a magnetic instability. While no X-ray
emission is reported, this event presents the classical eruption features like:
separation of double ribbons and the growth of flare loops. We report the
migration of the southern foot of the erupting filament flux rope due to the
interchange reconnection with encountered magnetic loops of a neighbouring AR.
Parallel to the erupting filament, a stable filament remains in the core of
active region. The specificity of this eruption is that coronal loops, located
above the nearly joining ends of the two filaments, first contract in phase,
then expand and reach a new stable configuration close to the one present at
the eruption onset. Both contraction and expansion phases last around 20 min.
The main difference with previous cases is that the PIL bent about 180 deg
around the end of the erupting filament because the magnetic configuration is
at least tri-polar. These observations are challenging for models which
interpreted previous cases of loop contraction within a bipolar configuration.
New simulations are required to broaden the complexity of the configurations

To construct the composite spectrum, we combined 216 GRQ's optical spectra from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). As a result, we obtained the composite
spectrum covering the wavelength range from 1400 {\AA} to 7000 {\AA}. We
calculated the power-law spectral slope for GRQ's composite, obtaining
$\alpha_{\lambda}=-1.25$ and compared it with that of the smaller-sized radio
quasars, as well as with the quasar composite spectrum obtained for large
sample of SDSS quasars. We obtained that the GRQ's continuum is flatter
(redder) than the continuum of comparison quasar samples. We also show that the
continuum slope depends on core and total radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz, being
steeper for higher radio luminosity bin. Moreover, we found the flattening of
the continuum with an increase of the projected linear size of radio quasar. We
show that $\alpha_{\lambda}$ is orientation-dependent, being steeper for a
higher radio core-to-lobe flux density ratio which is consistent with AGN
unified model predictions. For two GRQs, we fit the spectral energy
distribution using X-CIGALE code to compare the consistency of results obtained
in the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum with broad-band emission.
The parameters obtained from the SED fitting confirmed the larger dust

build an efficient algorithm called DiMSC to infer the community membership

equivalence algorithm which returns same estimations as DiMSC and the recent
development on row-wise singular vector deviation, we show that the proposed

bridge the gap between an apparently optimal policy learnt by an agent and its

Broadly speaking RL agents face two kinds of uncertainty, 1. aleatoric
uncertainty, which reflects randomness or noise in the dynamics of the world,
and 2. epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the bounded knowledge of the agent
due to model limitations and finite amount of information/data the agent has

the procedure with several examples where the characteristic data can be
explicitly integrated; for linear fields this also sheds light on the
twistorial description of Weyl double copy. Our second prescription applies to
all asymptotically flat fields at the level of their asymptotic equations of
motion: we give a map between any solution of the asymptotic Maxwell equations
and any solution of the asymptotic Einstein equations at null infinity. This
also extends to the asymptotic charges and their duals, preserves the soft and

ultrafast temporal effects on both spin-to-orbit and orbit-to-local-spin
conversions based on the time-assistant vectorial diffractive theory and the
fast Fourier transformation. Such interconversions depend upon whether the
incident hybridly vectorial light pulse carries vortex phase or not in a single
high numerical aperture geometry. For the case of the absence of vortex phase,
we find that it enables orbit angular momentum-carrying transverse component
fields, and the resultant orbit angular momentum embedded within focused light
fields remains constantly revolving as time elapses, which indicates that the
controllable spin-to-orbit conversion occurs. By contrast, it is revealed that
hybridly polarized vectorial-vortex light pulses allow access to the locally
excited circular polarization at the focus, and this induced local circular
polarization is independent of ultrafast varying time, whereas the resulting
spin angular momentum density components experience the alternation between the
appearance and annihilation over time, thus giving rise to the tunable
orbit-to-local-spin conversion. These exotic ultrafast interconversions not
only breathe a new life into the area of ultrafast photonics, but refresh our
understanding on the paradigm of photonic SOI.

  Preference-formation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-sided matching markets have long existed to pair agents in the absence of
regulated exchanges. A common example is school choice, where a matching
mechanism uses student and school preferences to assign students to schools. In
such settings, forming preferences is both difficult and critical. Prior work
has suggested various prediction mechanisms that help agents make decisions
about their preferences. Although often deployed together, these matching and
prediction mechanisms are almost always analyzed separately. The present work
shows that at the intersection of the two lies a previously unexplored type of
strategic behavior: agents returning to the market (e.g., schools) can attack
future predictions by interacting short-term non-optimally with their matches.
Here, we first introduce this type of strategic behavior, which we call an
`adversarial interaction attack'. Next, we construct a formal economic model
that captures the feedback loop between prediction mechanisms designed to
assist agents and the matching mechanism used to pair them. This economic model
allows us to analyze adversarial interaction attacks. Finally, using school
choice as an example, we build a simulation to show that, as the trust in and
accuracy of predictions increases, schools gain progressively more by
initiating an adversarial interaction attack. We also show that this attack
increases inequality in the student population.

The eFEDS field is partly embedded in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic

containing approximately 36 million galaxies. This galaxy catalogue is used to
construct a sample of 180 shear-selected galaxy clusters. In the common area to
both surveys, about 90 square degrees, we investigate the effects of selection
methods in the galaxy cluster detection by comparing the X-ray selected, eFEDS,

shear-selected clusters in the eFEDS footprint. The relation between X-ray
bolometric luminosity and weak-lensing mass is investigated, and it is found
that the normalization of the bolometric luminosity and mass relation of the
X-ray selected and shear-selected samples is consistent within $1\sigma$.
Moreover, we found that the dynamical state and merger fraction of the
shear-selected clusters is not different from the X-ray selected ones. Four
shear-selected clusters are undetected in X-rays. A close inspection reveals
that one is the result of projection effects, while the other three have an
X-ray flux below the ultimate eROSITA detection limit. Finally, 43% of the
shear-selected clusters lie in superclusters. Our results indicate that the
scaling relation between X-ray bolometric luminosity and true cluster mass of
the shear-selected cluster sample is consistent with the eFEDS sample. There is
no significant population of X-ray underluminous clusters, indicating that
X-ray selected cluster samples are complete and can be used as an accurate
cosmological probe.

supervised learning has been widely used in the field of EEG signal analysis,

Self-supervised learning (SSL), as a popular learning paradigm in computer
vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), can employ unlabeled data to
make up for the data shortage of supervised learning. In this paper, we propose
a self-supervised contrastive learning method of EEG signals for sleep stage

learning the general features of EEG signals. The robustness of the network
also gets improved in dealing with diverse data, that is, extracting constant
features from changing data. In detail, the network's performance depends on
the choice of transformations and the amount of unlabeled data used in the
training process of self-supervised learning. Empirical evaluations on the
Sleep-edf dataset demonstrate the competitive performance of our method on
sleep staging (88.16% accuracy and 81.96% F1 score) and verify the

nuclei (AGN) in the early stages of their evolution. Some dozens of them have
been found to host relativistic jets, whilst the majority has not even been
detected in radio, emphasising the heterogeneity of the class in this band. In
this paper, our aim is to determine the predominant source of radio emission in
a sample of 44 NLS1s, selected based on their extended kpc-scale radio
morphologies at 5.2 GHz. We accomplish this by analysing their spatially
resolved radio spectral index maps, centred at 5.2 GHz. In addition, we utilise
several diagnostics based on mid-infrared emission to estimate the star
formation activity of their host galaxies. These data are complemented by
archival data to draw a more complete picture of each source. We find an
extraordinary diversity among our sample. Approximately equal fractions of our
sources can be identified as AGN-dominated, composite, and host-dominated.
Among the AGN-dominated sources are a few NLS1s with very extended jets,
reaching distances of tens of kpc from the nucleus. One of these, J0814+5609,
hosts the most extended jets found in an NLS1 so far. We also identify five
NLS1s that could be classified as compact steep-spectrum sources. We further
conclude that due to the variety seen in NLS1s simple proxies, such as the star
formation diagnostics also employed in this paper, and the radio loudness
parameter, are not ideal tools for characterising NLS1s. We emphasise the
necessity of examining NLS1s as individuals, instead of making assumptions
based on their classification. When these issues are properly taken into
account, NLS1s offer an exceptional environment to study the interplay of the
host galaxy and several AGN-related phenomena, such as jets and outflows.

constant virus mutation into new forms and a general lack of test kits,
particularly in developing nations. In this research, a unique cloud-based
application for the early identification of individuals who may have COVID-19
infection is proposed. The application provides five modes of diagnosis from
possible symptoms (f1), cough sound (f2), specific blood biomarkers (f3), Raman
spectral data of blood specimens (f4), and ECG signal paper-based image (f5).
When a user selects an option and enters the information, the data is sent to
the cloud server. The deployed machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
models classify the data in real time and inform the user of the likelihood of
COVID-19 infection. Our deployed models can classify with an accuracy of 100%,

Moreover, the sensitivity for f2, f3, and f4 is 100%, which indicates the
correct identification of COVID positive patients. This is significant in
limiting the spread of the virus. Additionally, another ML model, as seen to
offer 92% accuracy serves to identify patients who, out of a large group of
patients admitted to the hospital cohort, need immediate critical care support

use stochastic decoding to derive a set of sentence completions, and estimate
the probability that the LM assigns to each interpretation based on the

semileptonic weak decays are formulated within the point form of relativistic
quantum mechanics to end up with relativistic invariant process amplitudes from
which meson transition currents and form factors are extracted in an
unambiguous way. For space-like momentum transfers, form factors depend on the
frame in which the $W M M^\prime$ vertex is considered. Such a frame dependence
is expected from a pure valence-quark picture, since a complete, frame
independent description of form factors is supposed to include non-valence
contributions. The most important of such contributions are the $Z$-graphs,
which are, however, suppressed in the infinite-momentum frame ($q^2<0$). On the
other hand, they can play a significant role in the Breit frame ($q^2<0$) and
in the direct decay calculation ($q^2>0$), as a comparison with the
infinite-momentum-frame form factors (analytically continued to $q^2>0$)
reveals. Numerical results for the analytically continued
infinite-momentum-frame form factors agree very well with lattice data in the
time-like momentum transfer region and the experimental value for the slope of
the $F^+_{B\rightarrow D}$ transition form factor at zero recoil is reproduced
satisfactorily. These predictions satisfy heavy-quark-symmetry constraints and
their $q^2$ dependence is well approximated by a pole fit, reminiscent of a
vector-meson-dominance-like decay mechanism. We discuss how such a decay
mechanism can be accommodated within an extension of our constituent-quark
model, by allowing for a non-valence component in the meson wave functions. We
also address the question of wrong cluster properties inherent in the
Bakamjian-Thomas formulation.

involve training and testing of virtual agents on datasets of static images or
short videos, considering sequences of distinct learning tasks. However, in
order to devise continual learning algorithms that operate in more realistic

controlled experimental playgrounds. Focussing on the specific case of vision,
we thus propose to leverage recent advances in 3D virtual environments in order
to approach the automatic generation of potentially life-long dynamic scenes
with photo-realistic appearance. Scenes are composed of objects that move along
variable routes with different and fully customizable timings, and randomness
can also be included in their evolution. A novel element of this paper is that
scenes are described in a parametric way, thus allowing the user to fully
control the visual complexity of the input stream the agent perceives. These
general principles are concretely implemented exploiting a recently published
3D virtual environment. The user can generate scenes without the need of having
strong skills in computer graphics, since all the generation facilities are
exposed through a simple high-level Python interface. We publicly share the

timely to consider the ways in which these stars can be deformed. Gravitational
waves provide a unique window through which to examine neutron-star interiors
and learn more about the equation of state of ultra-dense nuclear matter. In
this work, we study two relevant scenarios for gravitational-wave emission:
neutron stars that host (non-axially symmetric) mountains and neutron stars
deformed by the tidal field of a binary partner. Although they have yet to be
seen with gravitational waves, rotating neutron stars have long been considered
potential sources. By considering the observed spin distribution of accreting
neutron stars with a phenomenological model for the spin evolution, we find
evidence for gravitational radiation in these systems. We study how mountains
are modelled in both Newtonian and relativistic gravity and introduce a new
scheme to resolve issues with previous approaches to this problem. The crucial
component of this scheme is the deforming force that gives the star its
non-spherical shape. We find that the force (which is a proxy for the star's
formation history), as well as the equation of state, plays a pivotal role in
supporting the mountains. Considering a scenario that has been observed with
gravitational waves, we calculate the structure of tidally deformed neutron
stars, focusing on the impact of the crust. We find that the effect on the
tidal deformability is negligible, but the crust will remain largely intact up

challenge in artificial intelligence research. Today, this challenge is
especially relevant given the emergence of systems which appear to increasingly
outperform human beings. In some cases, this ""superhuman"" performance is
readily demonstrated; for example by defeating legendary human players in
traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to
evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance.
Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly
assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human
annotations. In reality, human annotators can make mistakes and be subjective.
Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle may be more
objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is expensive or
impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the
performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is
unobserved. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the
oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis
provides a simple recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in
this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of
current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds
and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with
known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by
meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an
oracle does not exist, and show that under our assumptions a number of models
from recent years are with high probability superhuman.

EUHFORIA predictions at Earth. We show that DTW can warp sequences in time,
aiming to align them with the minimum cost by using dynamic programming. It can
be applied in two ways for the evaluation of modeled solar wind time series.
The first, calculates the sequence similarity factor (SSF), a number that
provides a quantification of how good the forecast is, compared to an ideal and
a non-ideal prediction scenarios. The second way quantifies the time and
amplitude differences between the points that are best matched between the two
sequences. As a result, DTW can serve as a hybrid metric between continuous

sketch inputs. Existing solutions often require a user-provided binary mask to
specify a target hair shape. This not only costs users extra labor but also
fails to capture complicated hair boundaries. Those solutions usually encode
hair structures via orientation maps, which, however, are not very effective to
encode complex structures. We observe that colored hair sketches already
implicitly define target hair shapes as well as hair appearance and are more
flexible to depict hair structures than orientation maps. Based on these
observations, we present SketchHairSalon, a two-stage framework for generating
realistic hair images directly from freehand sketches depicting desired hair
structure and appearance. At the first stage, we train a network to predict a
hair matte from an input hair sketch, with an optional set of non-hair strokes.
At the second stage, another network is trained to synthesize the structure and
appearance of hair images from the input sketch and the generated matte. To
make the networks in the two stages aware of long-term dependency of strokes,
we apply self-attention modules to them. To train these networks, we present a
new dataset containing thousands of annotated hair sketch-image pairs and
corresponding hair mattes. Two efficient methods for sketch completion are
proposed to automatically complete repetitive braided parts and hair strokes,
respectively, thus reducing the workload of users. Based on the trained
networks and the two sketch completion strategies, we build an intuitive
interface to allow even novice users to design visually pleasing hair images
exhibiting various hair structures and appearance via freehand sketches. The
qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the advantages of the proposed
system over the existing or alternative solutions.

era, while some more knowledge is needed to improve their performance in
specific problems. In Chinese NER, character substitution is a complicated
linguistic phenomenon. Some Chinese characters are quite similar for sharing
the same components or having similar pronunciations. People replace characters
in a named entity with similar characters to generate a new collocation but
referring to the same object. It becomes even more common in the Internet age
and is often used to avoid Internet censorship or just for fun. Such character
substitution is not friendly to those pre-trained language models because the
new collocations are occasional. As a result, it always leads to unrecognizable
or recognition errors in the NER task. In this paper, we propose a new method,
Multi-Feature Fusion Embedding for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (MFE-NER),
to strengthen the language pattern of Chinese and handle the character
substitution problem in Chinese Named Entity Recognition. MFE fuses semantic,
glyph, and phonetic features together. In the glyph domain, we disassemble
Chinese characters into components to denote structure features so that
characters with similar structures can have close embedding space
representation. Meanwhile, an improved phonetic system is also proposed in our
work, making it reasonable to calculate phonetic similarity among Chinese
characters. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the overall
performance of Chinese NER and especially performs well in informal language
environments.

ways. While multiple motor control strategies can all lead to the desired
behavior, they result in different joint and muscle forces. This creates
opportunities to explore this redundancy, e.g., for pain avoidance or reducing
the risk of further injury. To assess the effect of different motor control
optimization strategies, a direct measurement of muscle and joint forces is
desirable, but problematic for medical and ethical reasons. Computational
modeling might provide a solution by calculating approximations of these
forces. In this study, we used a full-body computational musculoskeletal model
to (1) predict forces measured in knee prostheses during walking and squatting
and (2) to study the effect of different motor control strategies (i.e.,
minimizing joint force vs. muscle activation) on the joint load and prediction
error. We found that musculoskeletal models can accurately predict knee joint
forces with an RMSE of <0.5 BW in the superior direction and about 0.1 BW in
the medial and anterior directions. Generally, minimization of joint forces
produced the best predictions. Furthermore, minimizing muscle activation
resulted in maximum knee forces of about 4 BW for walking and 2.5 BW for
squatting. Minimizing joint forces resulted in maximum knee forces of 2.25 BW
and 2.12 BW, i.e., a reduction of 44% and 15%, respectively. Thus, changing the
muscular coordination strategy can strongly affect knee joint forces. Patients
with a knee prosthesis may adapt their neuromuscular activation to reduce joint
forces during locomotion.

The molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, located in the Galactic Centre, represents
an excellent candidate to search for new isocyanates since it exhibits high

complex isocyanates are ethyl isocyanate (C$_2$H$_5$NCO) and vinyl isocyanate

determined for HNCO:CH$_3$NCO:C$_2$H$_5$NCO is 1:1/55:1/447, which implies a
decrease by more than one order of magnitude going progressively from HNCO to
CH$_3$NCO and to C$_2$H$_5$NCO. This is similar to what has been found for e.g.
alcohols and thiols and suggests that C$_2$H$_5$NCO is likely formed on the
surface of dust grains. In addition, we have obtained column density ratios of
HNCO / NCO > 269, HNCO / H$_2$NCO$^+$ $\sim$ 2100 and C$_2$H$_3$NCO /
C$_2$H$_5$NCO~<~4. A comparison of the Methyl~/~Ethyl ratios for isocyanates
(-NCO), alcohols (-OH), formiates (HCOO-), nitriles (-CN) and thiols (-SH) is

can alleviate the laborious task of characterization and reporting on resected

CRC population screening programs, ongoing in many countries all around the

automated assessment of CRC histopathology whole-slide images. First, we
present an AI-based method to segment multiple tissue compartments in the
H\&E-stained whole-slide image, which provides a different, more perceptible
picture of tissue morphology and composition. We test and compare a panel of
state-of-the-art loss functions available for segmentation models, and provide
indications about their use in histopathology image segmentation, based on the
analysis of a) a multi-centric cohort of CRC cases from five medical centers in
the Netherlands and Germany, and b) two publicly available datasets on
segmentation in CRC. Second, we use the best performing AI model as the basis
for a computer-aided diagnosis system (CAD) that classifies colon biopsies into
four main categories that are relevant pathologically. We report the
performance of this system on an independent cohort of more than 1,000
patients. The results show the potential of such an AI-based system to assist
pathologists in diagnosis of CRC in the context of population screening. We

  If there exists a structure C with homomorphisms $A\to C\to B$, then

has been sampled in nature, it accounts for a tiny fraction of the possible
protein universe. If we could tap into this pool of unexplored protein
structures, we could search for novel proteins with useful properties that we
could apply to tackle the environmental and medical challenges facing humanity.
This is the purpose of protein design.
  Sequence design is an important aspect of protein design, and many successful
methods to do this have been developed. Recently, deep-learning methods that
frame it as a classification problem have emerged as a powerful approach.
Beyond their reported improvement in performance, their primary advantage over
physics-based methods is that the computational burden is shifted from the user
to the developers, thereby increasing accessibility to the design method.
Despite this trend, the tools for assessment and comparison of such models
remain quite generic. The goal of this paper is to both address the timely
problem of evaluation and to shine a spotlight, within the Machine Learning
community, on specific assessment criteria that will accelerate impact.
  We present a carefully curated benchmark set of proteins and propose a number
of standard tests to assess the performance of deep learning based methods. Our
robust benchmark provides biological insight into the behaviour of design
methods, which is essential for evaluating their performance and utility. We
compare five existing models with two novel models for sequence prediction.
Finally, we test the designs produced by these models with AlphaFold2, a
state-of-the-art structure-prediction algorithm, to determine if they are
likely to fold into the intended 3D shapes.

rate in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. Assume that a QKD protocol
generates symmetric private key pairs for secure communication over each link
in a network. The quantum key generation process is modeled using a stochastic
counting process. Packets are first encrypted with the quantum keys available
for each hop and then transmitted on a point-to-point basis over the links. A
fundamental problem in this setting is the design of a secure and
capacity-achieving routing policy that takes into account the time-varying
availability of the encryption keys and finite link capacities. In this paper,
we propose a new secure throughput-optimal policy called Tandem Queue
Decomposition (TQD). The TQD policy is derived by combining the QKD process
with the Universal Max Weight routing policy, proposed earlier by Sinha and
Modiano. We show that the TQD policy solves the problem of secure and efficient
packet routing for a broad class of traffic, including unicast, broadcast,
multicast, and anycast. The proposed decomposition reduces the problem to the
generalized network flow problem without the key availability constraints over

speech recognition (ASR) on singing voice, is an interesting and practical
topic in academia and industry. ALT has not been well developed mainly due to
the dearth of paired singing voice and lyrics datasets for model training.
Considering that there is a large amount of ASR training data, a
straightforward method is to leverage ASR data to enhance ALT training.
However, the improvement is marginal when training the ALT system directly with
ASR data, because of the gap between the singing voice and standard speech data
which is rooted in music-specific acoustic characteristics in singing voice. In
this paper, we propose PDAugment, a data augmentation method that adjusts pitch
and duration of speech at syllable level under the guidance of music scores to
help ALT training. Specifically, we adjust the pitch and duration of each
syllable in natural speech to those of the corresponding note extracted from
music scores, so as to narrow the gap between natural speech and singing voice.
Experiments on DSing30 and Dali corpus show that the ALT system equipped with
our PDAugment outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems by 5.9% and 18.1%

cadence and simultaneous optical and near-infrared coverage up to ~ 100 days,
together with late time (+ 1.7 yr) MIR observations. At 230 days after light
curve peak the SN is not detected in the optical, but shows a surprisingly
strong near-infrared excess, with r - J > 3 mag and r - Ks > 5 mag. The time
evolution of the infrared light curve enables us to investigate if the
mid-infrared emission is from newly formed dust inside the SN ejecta, from a
pre-existing circumstellar envelope, or interstellar material heated by the
radiation from the SN. We find the latter two scenarios can be ruled out, and a
scenario where new dust is forming in the SN ejecta at epochs > 200 days can
self-consistently reproduce the evolution of the SN flux. We can fit the
spectral energy distribution well at +230 d with 5 x 10^-4 solar mass of carbon
dust, increasing over the following several hundred days to 10^-2 solar mass by
+535 d. SN 2018bsz is the first SLSN showing evidence for dust formation within
the SN ejecta, and appears to form ten times more dust than normal
core-collapse SNe at similar epochs. Together with their preference for low
mass, low metallicity host galaxies, we suggest that SLSNe may be a significant
contributor to dust formation in the early Universe.

  Bias for Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recommender system usually suffers from severe popularity bias -- the
collected interaction data usually exhibits quite imbalanced or even
long-tailed distribution over items. Such skewed distribution may result from
the users' conformity to the group, which deviates from reflecting users' true
preference. Existing efforts for tackling this issue mainly focus on completely
eliminating popularity bias. However, we argue that not all popularity bias is
evil. Popularity bias not only results from conformity but also item quality,
which is usually ignored by existing methods. Some items exhibit higher
popularity as they have intrinsic better property. Blindly removing the
popularity bias would lose such important signal, and further deteriorate model
performance. To sufficiently exploit such important information for
recommendation, it is essential to disentangle the benign popularity bias
caused by item quality from the harmful popularity bias caused by conformity.
Although important, it is quite challenging as we lack an explicit signal to
differentiate the two factors of popularity bias. In this paper, we propose to
leverage temporal information as the two factors exhibit quite different
patterns along the time: item quality revealing item inherent property is
stable and static while conformity that depends on items' recent clicks is
highly time-sensitive. Correspondingly, we further propose a novel Time-aware
DisEntangled framework (TIDE), where a click is generated from three components
namely the static item quality, the dynamic conformity effect, as well as the
user-item matching score returned by any recommendation model. Lastly, we
conduct interventional inference such that the recommendation can benefit from
the benign popularity bias while circumvent the harmful one. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of
TIDE.

systems, the voltage power spectral density measured by the Radio and Plasma
waves receiver (RPW) on board Solar Orbiter needs to be converted into physical
quantities that depend on the intrinsic properties of the radiation itself.The
main goal of this study is to perform a calibration of the RPW dipole antenna
system that allows for the conversion of the voltage power spectral density
measured at the receiver's input into the incoming flux density. We used space
observations from the Thermal Noise Receiver (TNR) and the High Frequency
Receiver (HFR) to perform the calibration of the RPW dipole antenna system.
Observations of type III bursts by the Wind spacecraft are used to obtain a
reference radio flux density for cross-calibrating the RPW dipole antennas. The
analysis of a large sample of HFR observations (over about ten months), carried
out jointly with an analysis of TNR-HFR data and prior to the antennas'
deployment, allowed us to estimate the reference system noise of the TNR-HFR
receivers. We obtained the effective length of the RPW dipoles and the
reference system noise of TNR-HFR in space, where the antennas and
pre-amplifiers are embedded in the solar wind plasma. The obtained $l_{eff}$
values are in agreement with the simulation and measurements performed on the
ground. By investigating the radio flux intensities of 35 type III bursts
simultaneously observed by Solar Orbiter and Wind, we found that while the
scaling of the decay time as a function of the frequency is the same for the
Waves and RPW instruments, their median values are higher for the former. This
provides the first observational evidence that Type III radio waves still
undergo density scattering, even when they propagate from the source, in a
medium with a plasma frequency that is well below their own emission frequency.

  Question Generation","EMNLP 2021 Long Paper",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Question Generation (QG) is the task of generating a plausible question for a
given <passage, answer> pair. Template-based QG uses linguistically-informed
heuristics to transform declarative sentences into interrogatives, whereas
supervised QG uses existing Question Answering (QA) datasets to train a system
to generate a question given a passage and an answer. A disadvantage of the
heuristic approach is that the generated questions are heavily tied to their
declarative counterparts. A disadvantage of the supervised approach is that
they are heavily tied to the domain/language of the QA dataset used as training
data. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose an unsupervised QG
method which uses questions generated heuristically from summaries as a source
of training data for a QG system. We make use of freely available news summary
data, transforming declarative summary sentences into appropriate questions
using heuristics informed by dependency parsing, named entity recognition and
semantic role labeling. The resulting questions are then combined with the
original news articles to train an end-to-end neural QG model. We extrinsically
evaluate our approach using unsupervised QA: our QG model is used to generate
synthetic QA pairs for training a QA model. Experimental results show that,
trained with only 20k English Wikipedia-based synthetic QA pairs, the QA model
substantially outperforms previous unsupervised models on three in-domain
datasets (SQuAD1.1, Natural Questions, TriviaQA) and three out-of-domain
datasets (NewsQA, BioASQ, DuoRC), demonstrating the transferability of the
approach.

but the imaging process is slow and typically requires several breath-holds to
acquire sufficient k-space profiles to ensure good image quality. Several
undersampling-based reconstruction techniques have been proposed during the
last decades to speed up cine cardiac MRI acquisition. However, the
undersampling factor is commonly fixed to conservative values before
acquisition to ensure diagnostic image quality, potentially leading to
unnecessarily long scan times. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
quality-aware cine short-axis cardiac MRI framework that combines image
acquisition and reconstruction with downstream tasks such as segmentation,
volume curve analysis and estimation of cardiac functional parameters. The goal
is to reduce scan time by acquiring only a fraction of k-space data to enable
the reconstruction of images that can pass quality control checks and produce
reliable estimates of cardiac functional parameters. The framework consists of
a deep learning model for the reconstruction of 2D+t cardiac cine MRI images
from undersampled data, an image quality-control step to detect good quality
reconstructions, followed by a deep learning model for bi-ventricular
segmentation, a quality-control step to detect good quality segmentations and
automated calculation of cardiac functional parameters. To demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed approach, we perform simulations using a cohort of
selected participants from the UK Biobank (n=270), 200 healthy subjects and 70
patients with cardiomyopathies. Our results show that we can produce
quality-controlled images in a scan time reduced from 12 to 4 seconds per
slice, enabling reliable estimates of cardiac functional parameters such as
ejection fraction within 5% mean absolute error.

effects model, where the heterogeneity across the policyholders is assumed to
be time-invariant. One popular extension is the dynamic random effects (or

heterogeneity, its application to the credibility analysis should be conducted
with care due to the possibility of negative credibilities per period [see
Pinquet (2020a)]. Another important but under-explored topic is the ordering of
the credibility factors in a monotonous manner -- recent claims ought to have
larger weights than the old ones. This paper shows that the ordering of the
covariance structure of the random effects in the dynamic random effects model
does not necessarily imply that of the credibility factors. Subsequently, we

materials and should be respected in the description and modelling of material

wants to be able to prescribe certain classes of spatial symmetries and
invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while at the same time
demanding that the mean or expected value of the ensemble be subject to a
possibly 'higher' spatial invariance class. We formulate a modelling framework
which not only respects these two requirements$-$positive definiteness and
invariance$-$but also allows a fine control over orientation on one hand, and
strength/size on the other. As the set of positive definite tensors is not a
linear space, but rather an open convex cone in the linear space of physically
symmetric tensors, we consider it advantageous to widen the notion of mean to
the so-called Fr\'echet mean on a metric space, which is based on distance
measures or metrics between positive definite tensors other than the usual
Euclidean one. It is shown how the random ensemble can be modelled and
generated, independently in its scaling and orientational or directional
aspects, with a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation. The
parameters which describe the elements in this Lie algebra are then to be
considered as random fields on the domain of interest. As an example, a 2D and
a 3D model of steady-state heat conduction in a human proximal femur, a bone
with high material anisotropy, is modelled with a random thermal conductivity
tensor, and the numerical results show the distinct impact of incorporating
into the constitutive model different material uncertainties$-$scaling,

high-quality conversational flows. The out-of-domain detection recognizes that
the user diverges from the predefined flow and prevents the system from
producing a scripted response that might not make sense for unexpected user

context of the dialogue that correctly reacts to the unexpected user input and
returns the dialogue to the boundaries of hand-designed dialogues. The
innovations for engagement that we propose are mostly inspired by the famous
exploration-exploitation dilemma. To conduct an engaging conversation with the
dialogue partners, one has to learn their preferences and interests --
exploration. Moreover, to engage the partner, we have to utilize the knowledge
we have already learned -- exploitation. In this work, we present the

we characterize contract implementation, and we find necessary conditions for
the existence of an implementation. We also characterize contract refinement,

works dedicated to variable selection and this theme is still a challenge. In
this article, we propose a procedure for selecting variables in JMMD, based on
hypothesis testing and the quality of the model's fit. A criterion for checking
the goodness of fit is used, in each iteration of the selection process, as a
filter for choosing the terms that will be evaluated by a hypothesis test.
Three types of criteria were considered for checking the quality of the model
fit in our variable selection procedure. The criteria used were: the extended
Akaike information criterion, the corrected Akaike information criterion and a
specific criterion for the JMMD, proposed by us, a type of extended adjusted
coefficient of determination. Simulation studies were carried out to verify the
efficiency of our variable selection procedure. In all situations considered,
the proposed procedure proved to be effective and quite satisfactory. The
variable selection process was applied to a real example from an industrial

best initialize a relatively small-sized ensemble of numerical model
integrations to produce reliable forecasts at these timescales. Reliability in
this case means that the statistical properties of the ensemble forecast are
consistent with the actual uncertainties about the future state of the
geophysical system under investigation. In the present work, a method is
introduced to construct initial conditions that produce reliable ensemble
forecasts by projecting onto the eigenfunctions of the Koopman or the
Perron-Frobenius operators, which describe the time-evolution of observables
and probability distributions of the system dynamics, respectively. These
eigenfunctions can be approximated from data by using the Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) algorithm. The effectiveness of this approach is
illustrated in the framework of a low-order ocean-atmosphere model exhibiting
multiple characteristic timescales, and is compared to other ensemble
initialization methods based on the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of
the model trajectory and on the backward and covariant Lyapunov vectors of the
model dynamics. Projecting initial conditions onto a subset of the Koopman or
Perron-Frobenius eigenfunctions that are characterized by time scales with
fast-decaying oscillations is found to produce highly reliable forecasts at all
lead times investigated, ranging from one week to two months. Reliable
forecasts are also obtained with the adjoint covariant Lyapunov vectors, which
are the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator in the tangent space. The
advantages of these different methods are discussed.

people in safety-critical scenes, is shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples in the physical world (e.g., adversarial patches). Though harmful,
adversarial examples are also valuable for evaluating and better understanding
model robustness. However, existing adversarial example generation methods for
crowd counting lack strong transferability among different black-box models,
which limits their practicability for real-world systems. Motivated by the fact
that attacking transferability is positively correlated to the model-invariant
characteristics, this paper proposes the Perceptual Adversarial Patch (PAP)
generation framework to tailor the adversarial perturbations for crowd counting
scenes using the model-shared perceptual features. Specifically, we handcraft
an adaptive crowd density weighting approach to capture the invariant scale
perception features across various models and utilize the density guided
attention to capture the model-shared position perception. Both of them are
demonstrated to improve the attacking transferability of our adversarial
patches. Extensive experiments show that our PAP could achieve state-of-the-art
attacking performance in both the digital and physical world, and outperform
previous proposals by large margins (at most +685.7 MAE and +699.5 MSE).
Besides, we empirically demonstrate that adversarial training with our PAP can
benefit the performance of vanilla models in alleviating several practical
challenges in crowd counting scenarios, including generalization across
datasets (up to -376.0 MAE and -354.9 MSE) and robustness towards complex
backgrounds (up to -10.3 MAE and -16.4 MSE).

challenging task as the policy has to maintain its safety in all corner cases.
In order to secure safety in autonomous driving, the ability to detect
hazardous situations, which can be seen as an out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection problem, becomes crucial. However, most conventional datasets only
provide expert driving demonstrations, although some non-expert or uncommon
driving behavior data are needed to implement a safety guaranteed autonomous
driving platform. To this end, we present a novel dataset called the R3 Driving
Dataset, composed of driving data with different qualities. The dataset
categorizes abnormal driving behaviors into eight categories and 369 different
detailed situations. The situations include dangerous lane changes and
near-collision situations. To further enlighten how these abnormal driving
behaviors can be detected, we utilize different uncertainty estimation and
anomaly detection methods to the proposed dataset. From the results of the
proposed experiment, it can be inferred that by using both uncertainty
estimation and anomaly detection, most of the abnormal cases in the proposed
dataset can be discriminated. The dataset of this paper can be downloaded from

radio access network (RAN), edge, transport and core slicing.The evolving
network architecture requires the orchestration of multiple network resources
such as radio and cache resources. In recent years, machine learning (ML)
techniques have been widely applied for network management. However, most
existing works do not take advantage of the knowledge transfer capability in
ML. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer reinforcement learning (DTRL)
scheme for joint radio and cache resource allocation to serve 5G RAN slicing.
We first define a hierarchical architecture for joint resource allocation. Then
we propose two DTRL algorithms: Q-value-based deep transfer reinforcement
learning (QDTRL) and action selection-based deep transfer reinforcement
learning (ADTRL). In the proposed schemes, learner agents utilize expert
agents' knowledge to improve their performance on current tasks. The proposed
algorithms are compared with both the model-free exploration bonus deep
Q-learning (EB-DQN) and the model-based priority proportional fairness and
time-to-live (PPF-TTL) algorithms. Compared with EB-DQN, our proposed
DTRL-based method presents 21.4% lower delay for Ultra Reliable Low Latency
Communications (URLLC) slice and 22.4% higher throughput for enhanced Mobile
Broad Band (eMBB) slice, while achieving significantly faster convergence than

nonlinear term in the Navier-Stokes(NS) equations provides an intrinsic forcing
to the linear dynamics, a description inspired by control theory. The inverse
of the linear operator, defined as the resolvent, is interpreted as a transfer
function between the forcing and the velocity response. This inversion obscures
the physical interpretation of the governing equations and is prohibitive to
analytical manipulation, and for large systems leads to significant
computational cost and memory requirements. In this work we suggest an
alternative, inverse free, definition of the resolvent basis based on an
extension of the Courant-Fischer-Weyl min-max principle in which resolvent
modes are defined as stationary points of a constrained variational problem.
This leads to a straightforward approach to approximate the resolvent
(response) modes of complex flows as expansions in any basis. The proposed
method avoids matrix inversions and requires only the spectral decomposition of
a matrix of significantly reduced size as compared to the original system. To
illustrate this method and the advantages of the variational formulation we
present three examples. First, we consider streamwise constant fluctuations in
turbulent channel flow where an asymptotic analysis allows us to derive closed
form expressions for the optimal resolvent modes. Second, to illustrate the
cost saving potential, and investigate the limits, of the proposed method we
apply our method to both a 2-dimensional, 3-component equilibrium solution in
Couette flow and, finally, to a streamwise developing turbulent boundary layer.
For these larger systems we achieve a model reduction of up to two orders of
magnitude. Such savings have the potential to open RA to the investigation of
larger domains and more complex flow configurations.

be effectively tackled with a ""systems"" approach to AI which features a hybrid

Additionally, we argue that while neural network models with end-to-end

classification and language modelling, they cannot, on their own, successfully
perform algorithmic reasoning, especially if the task spans multiple domains.
We discuss a few notable exceptions and point out how they are still limited

However, deep learning, and machine learning in general, do play important
roles as components in the reasoning process. We propose an approach to
algorithm reasoning for QA, Deep Algorithmic Question Answering (DAQA), based

robustness which such an AI system should possess, and conclude that they are
best achieved with a combination of hybrid and compositional AI.

importance for current experiments, where inelastic collisions typically limit
the lifetime of molecular ensembles in optical traps. Here we present a broad
study of optically trapped ultracold RbCs molecules in collisions with one
another, in reactive collisions with Rb atoms, and in nonreactive collisions
with Cs atoms. For experiments with RbCs alone, we show that by modulating the
intensity of the optical trap, such that the molecules spend 75% of each
modulation cycle in the dark, we partially suppress collisional loss of the
molecules. This is evidence for optical excitation of molecule pairs mediated
via sticky collisions. We find that the suppression is less effective for
molecules not prepared in the spin-stretched hyperfine ground state. This may
be due either to longer lifetimes for complexes or to laser-free decay
pathways. For atom-molecule mixtures, RbCs+Rb and RbCs+Cs, we demonstrate that
the rate of collisional loss of molecules scales linearly with the density of
atoms. This indicates that, in both cases, the loss of molecules is

flexible since it can locate complicated activities via natural languages,

challenging since it requires both textual and visual understanding for
semantic alignment between two modalities(i.e., text and video). In this
survey, we give a comprehensive overview for TSGV, which i) summarizes the
taxonomy of existing methods, ii) provides a detailed description of the
evaluation protocols(i.e., datasets and metrics) to be used in TSGV, and iii)
in-depth discusses potential problems of current benchmarking designs and
research directions for further investigations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first systematic survey on temporal sentence grounding. More
specifically, we first discuss existing TSGV approaches by grouping them into
four categories, i.e., two-stage methods, end-to-end methods, reinforcement
learning-based methods, and weakly supervised methods. Then we present the
benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics to assess current research progress.
Finally, we discuss some limitations in TSGV through pointing out potential
problems improperly resolved in the current evaluation protocols, which may
push forwards more cutting edge research in TSGV. Besides, we also share our
insights on several promising directions, including three typical tasks with
new and practical settings based on TSGV.

  In this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage

with traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our
attack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but
not on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the

show that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we

in many countries in the world. The most watched American football league in
the world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where every
offensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus on
passes. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such as
receiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver to
passer, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completion
probability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is.
By using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible to
calculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the target
will be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in an
NFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learning
algorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018
NFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for pass
completion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on a
two-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensive
player being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predict
completion probability based on the random forest model. Finally, the general
completion probability can be calculated using the law of total probability. We
present animations for selected plays and show the pass completion probability
evolution.

their electronically stored information to find documents that are relevant to
the specific case and produce them to their opposing party. Negotiations over
the scope of these searches often reflect a fear that something will be missed
(Fear of Missing Out: FOMO). A Recall level of 80%, for example, means that 20%
of the relevant documents will be left unproduced. This paper makes the
argument that eDiscovery is the process of identifying responsive information,
not identifying documents. Documents are the carriers of the information; they
are not the direct targets of the process. A given document may contain one or
more topics or factoids and a factoid may appear in more than one document. The
coupon collector's problem, Heaps law, and other analyses provide ways to model
the problem of finding information from among documents. In eDiscovery,
however, the parties do not know how many factoids there might be in a
collection or their probabilities. This paper describes a simple model that
estimates the confidence that a fact will be omitted from the produced set (the
identified set), while being contained in the missed set. Two data sets are
then analyzed, a small set involving microaggressions and larger set involving
classification of web pages. Both show that it is possible to discover at least
one example of each available topic within a relatively small number of
documents, meaning the further effort will not return additional novel
information. The smaller data set is also used to investigate whether the
non-random order of searching for responsive documents commonly used in

in fact a hallmark of superconducting transport. Surprisingly, however, they

task specification. If either the controller or environment are composed of
""black-box"" components with unknown dynamics, we cannot rely on formal
verification to assess our system. Assessing robustness via exhaustive testing
is also often infeasible if the space of environments is large compared to
experiment cost.
  Given limited budget, we provide a method to choose experiment inputs which
give greatest insight into system performance against a given specification
across the domain. By combining smooth robustness metrics for signal temporal
logic with techniques from adaptive experiment design, our method chooses the
most informative experimental inputs by incrementally constructing a surrogate
model of the specification robustness. This model then chooses the next
experiment to be in an area where there is either high prediction error or
uncertainty.
  Our experiments show how this adaptive experimental design technique results
in sample-efficient descriptions of system robustness. Further, we show how to
use the model built via the experiment design process to assess the behaviour
of a data-driven control system under domain shift.

understanding, a prerequisite to forecast emerging variants, is of paramount

organism scales and regulated by the transmission pathways at the population
scale. In this review, we show that infectivity-based natural selection was
discovered as the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission in July
2020. In April 2021, we proved beyond all doubt that such a natural selection
via infectivity-based transmission pathway remained the sole mechanism for
SARS-CoV-2 evolution. However, we reveal that antibody-disruptive co-mutations
[Y449S, N501Y] debuted as a new vaccine-resistant transmission pathway of viral
evolution in highly vaccinated populations a few months ago. Over one year ago,
we foresaw that mutations spike protein RBD residues, 452 and 501, would ""have
high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains"".
Mutations on these residues underpin prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha,
Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Theta, Kappa, Lambda, and Mu at present and are
expected to be vital to emerging variants. We anticipate that viral evolution
will combine RBD co-mutations at these two sites, creating future variants that
are tens of times more infectious than the original SARS-CoV-2. Additionally,
two complementary transmission pathways of viral evolution: infectivity and
vaccine-resistant, will prolong our battle with COVID-19 for years. We predict
that RBD co-mutation [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [L452R,

infectivity and/or strong ability to break through current vaccines, calling

Switzerland, investigates the proton charge radius puzzle, lepton universality,
and two-photon exchange, via simultaneous measurements of elastic muon-proton
and electron-proton scattering. The experiment uses the PiM1 secondary beam
channel, which was designed for high precision pion scattering measurements. We
review the properties of the beam line established for pions. We discuss the
production processes that generate the electron and muon beams, and the
simulations of these processes. Simulations of the $\pi$/$\mu$/$e$ beams
through the channel using TURTLE and G4beamline are compared. The G4beamline
simulation is then compared to several experimental measurements of the
channel, including the momentum dispersion at the IFP and target, the shape of
the beam spot at the target, and timing measurements that allow the beam
momenta to be determined. We conclude that the PiM1 channel can be used for
high precision $\pi$, $\mu$, and $e$ scattering.

the nuclear ground state. They are typically studied by scattering an electron
from one nucleon in the pair and detecting its spectator correlated partner
(""spectator-nucleon tagging""). The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) should be able
to detect these nucleons, since they are boosted to high momentum in the lab
frame by the momentum of the ion beam. To determine the feasibility of these
studies with the planned EIC detector configuration, we have simulated
quasi-elastic scattering for two electron and ion beam energy configurations: 5
GeV $e^{-}$ and 41 GeV/A ions, and 10 GeV $e^{-}$ and 110 GeV/A ions. We show
that the knocked-out and recoiling nucleons can be detected over a wide range
of initial nucleon momenta. We also show that these measurements can achieve
much larger momentum transfers than current fixed target experiments. By
detecting both low and high initial-momentum nucleons, the EIC will provide the
data that should allow scientists to definitively show if the EMC effect and
short-range correlation are connected, and to improve our understanding of
color transparency.

  Mesh-Based Modeling of Physical Systems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NE physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulations of complex physical systems are typically realized by
discretizing partial differential equations (PDEs) on unstructured meshes.
While neural networks have recently been explored for surrogate and reduced
order modeling of PDE solutions, they often ignore interactions or hierarchical
relations between input features, and process them as concatenated mixtures. We
generalize the idea of conditional parameterization -- using trainable
functions of input parameters to generate the weights of a neural network, and
extend them in a flexible way to encode critical information. Inspired by
discretized numerical methods, choices of the parameters include physical
quantities and mesh topology features. The functional relation between the
modeled features and the parameters is built into the network architecture. The
method is implemented on different networks and applied to frontier scientific
machine learning tasks including the discovery of unmodeled physics,
super-resolution of coarse fields, and the simulation of unsteady flows with
chemical reactions. The results show that the conditionally-parameterized
networks provide superior performance compared to their traditional
counterparts. The CP-GNet - an architecture that can be trained on very few
data snapshots - is proposed as the first deep learning model capable of
standalone prediction of reacting flows on irregular meshes.

To investigate, we introduce a
class of partitioned cellular automata (PCAs) whose cellwise evolution is based
on the chaotic baker's map. After imposing a suitable initial condition and
restricting to a macroscopic view, we are left with a stochastic PCA (SPCA).
When the underlying PCA's dynamics are reversible, the corresponding SPCA
serves as a model of emergent time-reversal asymmetry. Specifically, we prove
that its transition probabilities are homogeneous in space and time, as well as
Markov relative to a Pearlean causal graph with timelike future-directed edges.
Consequently, SPCAs satisfy generalizations of the second law of
thermodynamics, which we term the Resource and Memory Laws. By subjecting
information-processing agents (e.g., human experimenters) to these laws, we
clarify issues regarding the Past Hypothesis, Landauer's principle, Boltzmann
brains, scientific induction, and the so-called psychological arrow of time.
Finally, by describing a theoretical agent powered by data compression, we
argue that the algorithmic entropy takes conceptual precedence over both the
Shannon-Gibbs and Boltzmann entropies.

phase coupled to a continuous fluid is expensive. Still, one can reduce the
cost by representing the evolving particle density function in terms of its
moments. In particular, quadrature-based moment methods (QBMMs) invert these
moments with a quadrature rule, approximating the required statistics. QBMMs
have been shown to accurately model sprays and soot with a relatively compact
set of moments. However, significantly non-Gaussian processes such as bubble
dynamics lead to numerical instabilities when extending their moment sets
accordingly. We solve this problem by training a recurrent neural network (RNN)
that adjusts the QBMM quadrature to evaluate unclosed moments with higher
accuracy. The proposed method is tested on a simple model of bubbles
oscillating in response to a temporally fluctuating pressure field. The
approach decreases model-form error by a factor of 10 when compared to
traditional QBMMs. It is both numerically stable and computationally efficient
since it does not expand the baseline moment set. Additional quadrature points
are also assessed, optimally placed and weighted according to an additional
RNN. These points further decrease the error at low cost since the moment set
is again unchanged.

perform dimensional analysis by the physicist. The law of excluded middle falls
short of explaining the contradictory meanings of the same symbols. The
statements like ``$r\to 0$'', ``$q\to 0$'', used by the physicist, are
inconsistent on dimensional grounds because ``$r$'', ``$q$'' represent {\it
quantities} with physical dimensions of $[L], [Q]$ respectively and ``$0$''
represents just a number devoid of physical dimension. Consequently, the
involvement of the statement ``$\lim_{q\to 0}$, where $q$ is the test charge''
in the definition of electric field leads to either circular reasoning or a
contradiction regarding the experimental verification of the smallest charge in
the Millikan-Fletcher oil drop experiment. Considering such issues as
problematic, by choice, I make an inquiry regarding the basic language in terms
of which physics is written, with an aim of exploring how truthfully the verbal
statements can be converted to the corresponding physico-mathematical
expressions (involving physical dimensions). Necessarily I demonstrate the
meaning of the terms ``self inquiry'', ``middle way'', ``dependent
origination'', ``emptiness/relational existence'', which signify the basic
tenets of Buddhism. In light of this, I explain my view of ``definition''; the
relation among quantity, physical dimension and number; the logico-linguistic
fallacy of ``zero quantity''; difference between unit and unity. I present a
critical analysis of the definitions of electric field due to Maxwell and
Jackson. A postulate regarding the existence of charges becomes necessary
which, however, resolves the contradiction regarding the oil drop experiment.
This work is an appeal for the dissociation of the categorical disciplines of
logic and physics and on the large, a fruitful merger of Eastern philosophy and
Western science.

possible, along with the realization of the essence of the middle that is

attitude towards the physicist, can then actively contribute to the betterment
of physics by improving the language through which the physicist expresses his
