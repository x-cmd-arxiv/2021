  Processing (EMNLP 2021, Oral)",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Video grounding aims to localize the temporal segment corresponding to a
sentence query from an untrimmed video. Almost all existing video grounding
methods fall into two frameworks: 1) Top-down model: It predefines a set of
segment candidates and then conducts segment classification and regression. 2)
Bottom-up model: It directly predicts frame-wise probabilities of the
referential segment boundaries. However, all these methods are not end-to-end,
i.e., they always rely on some time-consuming post-processing steps to refine
predictions. To this end, we reformulate video grounding as a set prediction
task and propose a novel end-to-end multi-modal Transformer model, dubbed as
GTR. Specifically, GTR has two encoders for video and language encoding, and a
cross-modal decoder for grounding prediction. To facilitate the end-to-end
training, we use a Cubic Embedding layer to transform the raw videos into a set
of visual tokens. To better fuse these two modalities in the decoder, we design
a new Multi-head Cross-Modal Attention. The whole GTR is optimized via a
Many-to-One matching loss. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive studies to
investigate different model design choices. Extensive results on three
benchmarks have validated the superiority of GTR. All three typical GTR
variants achieve record-breaking performance on all datasets and metrics, with
several times faster inference speed.

condition that prevents the energy minimum from being a critical point of the
Hamiltonian. A somewhat trivial example is the Schr\""odinger equation of a
harmonic oscillator. The Noether charge for its particle number coincides with
the square norm of the wave function, and the energy eigenvalue is a Lagrange
multiplier for the condition that the wave function is properly normalized. A
more elaborate example is the Gross-Pitaevskii equation that models vortices in
a cold atom Bose-Einstein condensate. In an oblate, essentially two dimensional
harmonic trap the energy minimum is a topologically protected timecrystalline
vortex that rotates around the trap center. Additional examples are constructed
using coarse grained Hamiltonian models of closed molecular chains. When
knotted, the topology of a chain can support a time crystal. As a physical
example, high precision all-atom molecular dynamics is used to analyze an
isolated cyclopropane molecule. The simulation reveals that the molecular
D$_{3h}$ symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. When the molecule is observed
with sufficiently long stroboscopic time steps it appears to rotate like a
simple Hamiltonian time crystal. When the length of the stroboscopic time step
is decreased the rotational motion becomes increasingly ratcheting and
eventually it resembles the back-and-forth oscillations of Sisyphus dynamics.
The stroboscopic rotation is entirely due to atomic level oscillatory shape
changes, so that cyclopropane is an example of a molecule that can rotate
without angular momentum. Finally, the article is concluded with a personal
recollection how Frank's and Betsy's Stockholm journey started.

improve dynamic grouping convolution (DGConv) to make group convolution
hyperparameters, and thus the overall network architecture, learnable during
network training. The proposed method therefore can theoretically adjust any
modern CNN models to any multi-source remote sensing data set, and can
potentially avoid sub-optimal solutions caused by manually decided architecture
hyperparameters. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to ResNet
and UNet, and the adjusted networks are verified on three very diverse
benchmark data sets (i.e., Houston2018 data, Berlin data, and MUUFL data).
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
single-stream CNNs, and in particular ResNet18-DGConv improves the
state-of-the-art classification overall accuracy (OA) on HS-SAR Berlin data set

findings. First, using DGConv generally reduces test OA variance. Second,
multi-stream is harmful to model performance if imposed to the first few
layers, but becomes beneficial if applied to deeper layers. Altogether, the
findings imply that multi-stream architecture, instead of being a strictly
necessary component in deep learning models for multi-source remote sensing

are similar enough in the generalizations they make. In this paper, we show
that NLMs with different initialization, architecture, and training data
acquire linguistic phenomena in a similar order, despite their different end
performance. These findings suggest that there is some mutual inductive bias

inspiration from psycholinguistics, we argue that studying this inductive bias
is an opportunity to study the linguistic representation implicit in NLMs.
  Leveraging these findings, we compare the relative performance on different
phenomena at varying learning stages with simpler reference models. Results
suggest that NLMs exhibit consistent ""developmental"" stages. Moreover, we find
the learning trajectory to be approximately one-dimensional: given an NLM with
a certain overall performance, it is possible to predict what linguistic

presents phenomena clusters (notably morphological ones), whose performance
progresses in unison, suggesting a potential link between the generalizations

instability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast
literature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution
to the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the
problem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure
based on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed
architecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable
(if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable
neural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the
stable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on
the input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for
stability.
  Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural
networks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the
question: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be
proven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in
mathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be
the case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how
neural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard
optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised

Adopting the recently developed Neural Tangent (NT) kernel theory, we prove
uniform generalization bounds for overparameterized neural networks in kernel
regimes, when the true data generating model belongs to the reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS) corresponding to the NT kernel. Importantly, our bounds
capture the exact error rates depending on the differentiability of the
activation functions. In order to establish these bounds, we propose the
information gain of the NT kernel as a measure of complexity of the learning
problem. Our analysis uses a Mercer decomposition of the NT kernel in the basis
of spherical harmonics and the decay rate of the corresponding eigenvalues. As
a byproduct of our results, we show the equivalence between the RKHS

In the first approach we consider Dirac quantisation and group averaging that
have been used by Ashtekar et. al. but only for integer powers of operators.
Our generalisation to fractional powers yields in the case of the toy model a
suitable set of coherent states. The second approach is inspired by coherent
states based on a fractional Poisson distribution introduced by Laskin, which
however turn out not to satisfy all properties to yield good semiclassical
results for the operators considered here and in particular do not satisfy a
resolution of identity as claimed. Therefore, we present a generalisation of
the standard harmonic oscillator coherent states to states involving fractional
labels, which approximate the fractional operators in our toy model
semiclassically more accurately and satisfy a resolution of identity. In
addition, motivated by the way the proof of the resolution of identity is
performed, we consider these kind of coherent states also for the polymerised
harmonic oscillator and discuss their semiclassical properties

automatically reverse-engineering semantics rules from an implementation is
very challenging, as found by Krishnamurthi et al. [2019]. In this paper, we
highlight that scaling methods with the size of the language is very difficult

possible to learn correct desugaring rules for the example source and core

followed the predictions of the d-band theory but -- surprisingly -- the
variations in the adsorption energy only depended on the area of the adsorption

did not modify the shape of Projected Density of State (PDOS) of the d-orbitals
of the transition metals but only led to a shift in the energy levels.
Moreover, the presence of the adsorbates on the surfaces led to negligible
changes in the PDOS. Thus, the adsorption energies were a function of the Fermi

through a general linear law that was valid for all metals. The information in

to handle multi-modal information, but also because it is just so hard to
collect sufficient training examples -- there are too many questions one can
ask about an image. As a result, a VQA model trained solely on human-annotated
examples could easily over-fit specific question styles or image contents that
are being asked, leaving the model largely ignorant about the sheer diversity
of questions. Existing methods address this issue primarily by introducing an
auxiliary task such as visual grounding, cycle consistency, or debiasing. In
this paper, we take a drastically different approach. We found that many of the
""unknowns"" to the learned VQA model are indeed ""known"" in the dataset
implicitly. For instance, questions asking about the same object in different
images are likely paraphrases; the number of detected or annotated objects in
an image already provides the answer to the ""how many"" question, even if the
question has not been annotated for that image. Building upon these insights,
we present a simple data augmentation pipeline SimpleAug to turn this ""known""

biomedical annotations (Disease, Chemical, Gene, Species, SNP&Mutation) in the
abstracts from 4,300 publications relevant to both neurodegenerative diseases

concepts from literature. A knowledge graph was created from these annotations.
Graph embeddings were then trained with the node2vec algorithm to support
potential concept clustering and similar concept identification. We found
several food-related species and chemicals that might come from diet and have
an impact on neurodegenerative diseases.

accepted by regulatory bodies and the public until they have much higher
confidence in their safety and reliability -- which can most practically and
convincingly be achieved by testing. But existing testing methods are
inadequate for checking the end-to-end behaviors of AV controllers against
complex, real-world corner cases involving interactions with multiple
independent agents such as pedestrians and human-driven vehicles. While
test-driving AVs on streets and highways fails to capture many rare events,
existing simulation-based testing methods mainly focus on simple scenarios and
do not scale well for complex driving situations that require sophisticated
awareness of the surroundings. To address these limitations, we propose a new
fuzz testing technique, called AutoFuzz, which can leverage widely-used AV
simulators' API grammars to generate semantically and temporally valid complex
driving scenarios (sequences of scenes). To efficiently search for traffic
violations-inducing scenarios in a large search space, we propose a constrained
neural network (NN) evolutionary search method to optimize AutoFuzz. Evaluation
of our prototype on one state-of-the-art learning-based controller, two
rule-based controllers, and one industrial-grade controller in five scenarios
shows that AutoFuzz efficiently finds hundreds of traffic violations in
high-fidelity simulation environments. For each scenario, AutoFuzz can find on
average 10-39% more unique traffic violations than the best-performing baseline
method. Further, fine-tuning the learning-based controller with the traffic
violations found by AutoFuzz successfully reduced the traffic violations found
in the new version of the AV controller software.

wider variety of applications are being ported to these platforms. Many
parallel applications contain fine-grained synchronization idioms; as such,
their correct execution depends on a degree of relative forward progress
between threads (or thread groups). Unfortunately, many GPU programming
specifications say almost nothing about relative forward progress guarantees
between workgroups. Although prior work has proposed a spectrum of plausible
progress models for GPUs, cross-vendor specifications have yet to commit to any
model.
  This work is a collection of tools experimental data to aid specification
designers when considering forward progress guarantees in programming
frameworks. As a foundation, we formalize a small parallel programming language
that captures the essence of fine-grained synchronization. We then provide a
means of formally specifying a progress model, and develop a termination oracle
that decides whether a given program is guaranteed to eventually terminate with
respect to a given progress model. Next, we formalize a constraint for
concurrent programs that require relative forward progress to terminate. Using
this constraint, we synthesize a large set of 483 progress litmus tests.
Combined with the termination oracle, this allows us to determine the expected
status of each litmus test -- i.e. whether it is guaranteed eventual
termination -- under various progress models. We present a large experimental
campaign running the litmus tests across 8 GPUs from 5 different vendors. Our
results highlight that GPUs have significantly different termination behaviors
under our test suite. Most notably, we find that Apple and ARM GPUs do not
support the linear occupancy-bound model, an intuitive progress model defined

TERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to
enable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can
benefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the tail
probability of losses. Our work makes rigorous connections between TERM and
related objectives, such as Value-at-Risk, Conditional Value-at-Risk, and
distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We develop batch and stochastic
first-order optimization methods for solving TERM, provide convergence

range of economic applications, including income inequality measurement,
financial risk management, and impact evaluation. They typically involve
truncating the outcome variable above or below certain quantiles of its
conditional distribution. In this paper, based on local linear methods, a
novel, two-stage, nonparametric estimator of such functions is proposed. In
this estimation problem, the conditional quantile function is a nuisance
parameter that has to be estimated in the first stage. The proposed estimator
is insensitive to the first-stage estimation error owing to the use of a
Neyman-orthogonal moment in the second stage. This construction ensures that
inference methods developed for the standard nonparametric regression can be
readily adapted to conduct inference on truncated conditional expectations. As
an extension, estimation with an estimated truncation quantile level is
considered. The proposed estimator is applied in two empirical settings: sharp
regression discontinuity designs with a manipulated running variable and
randomized experiments with sample selection.

The plasma in their core can produce neutrinos which escape from the star, thus
contributing to the energy loss. While in absence of a magnetic field the main
cooling mechanism is plasmon decay at high temperature and photon surface
emission at low temperature, a large magnetic field in the core hiding beneath
the surface even of ordinary WDs, and undetectable to spectropolarimetric
measurements, can potentially leave an imprint in the cooling. In this paper,
we revisit the contribution to WD cooling stemming from neutrino pair
synchrotron radiation and the effects of the magnetic field on plasmon decay.
Our key finding is that even if observations limit the magnetic field strength
at the stellar surface, magnetic fields in the interior of WDs -- with or
without a surface magnetic field -- can be strong enough to modify the cooling
rate, with neutrino pair synchrotron emission being the most important
contribution. This effect may not only be relevant for the quantification and
interpretation of cooling anomalies, but also suggests that the internal
magnetic fields of WDs should be smaller than $\sim 6\times 10^{11}\,\rm G$,
slightly improving bounds coming from a stability requirement. While our
simplified treatment of the WD structure implies that further studies are
needed to reduce the systematic uncertainties, the estimates based on comparing
the emissivities illustrate the potential of neutrino emission as a diagnostic
tool to study the interior of WDs.

hypothesized to be drivers and those corresponding to KPIs of interest,
business users currently need to perform lengthy exploratory analyses. This
involves considering multitudes of combinations and scenarios and performing
slicing, dicing, and transformations on the data accordingly, e.g., analyzing
customer retention across quarters of the year or suggesting optimal media
channels across strata of customers. However, the increasing complexity of
datasets combined with the cognitive limitations of humans makes it challenging
to carry over multiple hypotheses, even for simple datasets. Therefore mentally
performing such analyses is hard. Existing commercial tools either provide
partial solutions or fail to cater to business users altogether. Here we argue
for four functionalities to enable business users to interactively learn and
reason about the relationships between sets of data attributes thereby
facilitating data-driven decision making. We implement these functionalities in
SystemD, an interactive visual data analysis system enabling business users to
experiment with the data by asking what-if questions. We evaluate the system
through three business use cases: marketing mix modeling, customer retention
analysis, and deal closing analysis, and report on feedback from multiple

testing and validation of their hypotheses around their KPIs of interest,
addressing their unmet analysis needs. The feedback also suggests that the UX

extracting 3D information for downstream tasks such as scene understanding.
Recently, learning-based methods for depth estimation have received much
attention due to their high performance and flexibility in hardware choice.
However, collecting ground truth data for supervised training of these
algorithms is costly or outright impossible. This circumstance suggests a need
for alternative learning approaches that do not require corresponding depth
measurements. Indeed, self-supervised learning of depth estimation provides an
increasingly popular alternative. It is based on the idea that observed frames
can be synthesized from neighboring frames if accurate depth of the scene is
known - or in this case, estimated. We show empirically that - contrary to
common belief - improvements in image synthesis do not necessitate improvement
in depth estimation. Rather, optimizing for image synthesis can result in
diverging performance with respect to the main prediction objective - depth. We
attribute this diverging phenomenon to aleatoric uncertainties, which originate
from data. Based on our experiments on four datasets (spanning street, indoor,
and medical) and five architectures (monocular and stereo), we conclude that
this diverging phenomenon is independent of the dataset domain and not
mitigated by commonly used regularization techniques. To underscore the
importance of this finding, we include a survey of methods which use image
synthesis, totaling 127 papers over the last six years. This observed
divergence has not been previously reported or studied in depth, suggesting
room for future improvement of self-supervised approaches which might be
impacted the finding.

that one of them, under the assumption of square root branch points, describes
Hubbard model. Two more are based on SU(2|2) x SU(2|2). In the special subcase
of zero central charge, they both reduce to the unique nontrivial curve which
furthermore has analytic properties compatible with PSU(1,1|2) x PSU(1,1|2)

of AdS/CFT integrable system with AdS3 x S3 x T4 background supported by

massive sector of asymptotic Bethe equations in the large volume regime. For
this spectral curve, it is compulsory that branch points are not of the square

a labeled source domain to a different unlabeled target domain. Most existing
UDA methods focus on learning domain-invariant feature representation, either
from the domain level or category level, using convolution neural networks
(CNNs)-based frameworks. One fundamental problem for the category level based
UDA is the production of pseudo labels for samples in target domain, which are
usually too noisy for accurate domain alignment, inevitably compromising the
UDA performance. With the success of Transformer in various tasks, we find that
the cross-attention in Transformer is robust to the noisy input pairs for
better feature alignment, thus in this paper Transformer is adopted for the
challenging UDA task. Specifically, to generate accurate input pairs, we design
a two-way center-aware labeling algorithm to produce pseudo labels for target
samples. Along with the pseudo labels, a weight-sharing triple-branch
transformer framework is proposed to apply self-attention and cross-attention
for source/target feature learning and source-target domain alignment,
respectively. Such design explicitly enforces the framework to learn
discriminative domain-specific and domain-invariant representations
simultaneously. The proposed method is dubbed CDTrans (cross-domain
transformer), and it provides one of the first attempts to solve UDA tasks with
a pure transformer solution. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves
the best performance on public UDA datasets, e.g. VisDA-2017 and DomainNet.

correlation, recently, methods have been proposed that highlight what should be
minimally sufficient to justify the classification of an input (viz. pertinent
positives). While minimal sufficiency is an attractive property, the resulting
explanations are often too sparse for a human to understand and evaluate the
local behavior of the model, thus making it difficult to judge its overall
quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called
Path-Sufficient Explanations Method (PSEM) that outputs a sequence of
sufficient explanations for a given input of strictly decreasing size (or
value) -- from original input to a minimally sufficient explanation -- which
can be thought to trace the local boundary of the model in a smooth manner,
thus providing better intuition about the local model behavior for the specific
input. We validate these claims, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with
experiments that show the benefit of PSEM across all three modalities (image,

communicating the local behavior, where (many) users are able to correctly

strongly with ambient stellar clustering in six-dimensional stellar
position-velocity phase space, quantified by dividing planetary systems into
sub-samples with high or low phase space densities (`overdensity' and `field'
systems, respectively). We investigate the physical origins of the phase space
overdensities and, thereby, which environmental mechanisms may have impacted
the planetary systems. We consider the galactic-scale kinematic structure of
the Milky Way observed with Gaia and show that the overdensities correspond to
the well-known, kpc-scale kinematic ripples and streams in the Galactic disk,
which are thought to be generated by bar and spiral arm-driven resonances and
satellite galaxy passages. We also find indications that the planet
demographics may vary between individual phase space overdensities, which
potentially have differing physical origins and histories. Planetary systems
associated with the `phase space spiral' (a recent perturbation of the Galactic
disk) have a hot Jupiter-to-cold Jupiter ratio that is 10 times higher than in
field systems. Finally, the hot Jupiter-to-cold Jupiter ratio within
overdensities may increase with host stellar age over Gyr timescales. Because
the overdensities persist for several Gyr, we argue that late-time
perturbations of planetary systems most likely explain these trends, although
additional perturbations at birth may contribute too. This suggests that
planetary system properties are not just affected by stellar clustering in
their immediate surroundings, but by galaxy-scale processes throughout their
evolution. We conclude by discussing the main open questions towards
understanding the diversity of physical processes that together set planetary
system architectures.

field theory as dynamical reference frames, an often suggested interpretation
that we make entirely explicit. We focus on a bounded region $M$ with a
co-dimension one time-like boundary $\Gamma$, which we embed in a global
spacetime. Taking as input a variational principle at the global level, we
develop a systematic formalism inducing consistent variational principles (and
in particular, boundary actions) for the subregion $M$. This relies on a
post-selection procedure on $\Gamma$, which isolates the subsector of the
global theory compatible with a general choice of gauge-invariant boundary
conditions for the dynamics in $M$. Crucially, the latter relate the
configuration fields on $\Gamma$ to a dynamical frame field carrying
information about the spacetime complement of $M$; as such, they may be
equivalently interpreted as frame-dressed or relational observables.
Generically, the external frame field keeps an imprint on the ensuing dynamics
for subregion $M$, where it materializes itself as a local field on the
time-like boundary $\Gamma$; in other words, an edge mode. We identify boundary
symmetries as frame reorientations and show that they divide into three types,
depending on the boundary conditions, that affect the physical status of the
edge modes. Our construction relies on the covariant phase space formalism, and
is in principle applicable to any gauge (field) theory. We illustrate it on
three standard examples: Maxwell, Abelian Chern-Simons and non-Abelian
Yang-Mills theories. In complement, we also analyze a mechanical toy-model to
connect our work with recent efforts on (quantum) reference frames.

made possible with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 grism on the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). Using a similar but updated method to 3D-HST in the
field environment, we stack the H$\alpha$ maps in bins of stellar mass, measure
the half-light radius of the H$\alpha$ distribution and compare it to the
stellar continuum. The ratio of the H$\alpha$ to stellar continuum half-light
radius, $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]=\frac{R_{\mathrm{eff,
H}\alpha}}{R_{\mathrm{eff, Cont}}}$, is smaller in the clusters by $(6\pm9)\%$,
but statistically consistent within $1\sigma$ uncertainties. A negligible
difference in $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$ with environment is surprising,
given the higher quenched fractions in the clusters relative to the field. We
postulate that the combination of high quenched fractions and no change in
$R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$ with environment can be reconciled if
environmental quenching proceeds rapidly. We investigate this hypothesis by
performing similar analysis on the spectroscopically-confirmed recently
quenched cluster galaxies. 87% have H$\alpha$ detections, with star formation
rates $8\pm1$ times lower than star-forming cluster galaxies of similar stellar
mass. Importantly, these galaxies have a $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$ that
is $(81\pm8)\%$ smaller than coeval star-forming field galaxies at fixed
stellar mass. This suggests the environmental quenching process occurred
outside-in. We conclude that disk truncation due to ram-pressure stripping is
occurring in cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$, but more rapidly and/or efficiently
than in $z\lesssim0.5$ clusters, such that the effects on
$R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$ become observable just after the cluster

of galaxies (redshift-dependent mass metallicity relation - MZR, or
redshift-invariant fundamental metallicity relation - FMR), (ii) the
contribution of starburst galaxies and (iii) the slope of the MZR. We
empirically construct the FMR based on the low-redshift scaling relations,

the choice of metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) determination
techniques and discuss the related f$_{\rm SFR}$(Z,z) uncertainty. We indicate
factors that dominate the f$_{\rm SFR}$(Z,z) uncertainty in different

is poorly constrained even at low redshifts (even a factor of $\sim$200

shallower metallicity evolution than the extrapolated MZR, however, its effect
on the low metallicity part of the f$_{\rm SFR}$(Z,z) is counterbalanced by the
contribution of starbursts (assuming that they follow the FMR). A
non-negligible fraction of starbursts in our model may be necessary to satisfy

to a changing distribution of galaxy stellar masses with the local environment.
However, earlier studies were largely focused on slow rotators; the dynamical
properties of the overall population in relation to environment have received
less attention. We use the SAMI Galaxy Survey to investigate the dynamical
properties of $\sim$1800 early and late-type galaxies with
$\log(M_*/M_{\odot})>9.5$ as a function of mean environmental overdensity
($\Sigma_{5}$) and their rank within a group or cluster. By classifying
galaxies into fast and slow rotators, at fixed stellar mass above
$\log(M_*/M_{\odot})>10.5$, we detect a higher fraction ($\sim3.4\sigma$) of
slow rotators for group and cluster centrals and satellites as compared to
isolated-central galaxies. Focusing on the fast-rotator population, we also
detect a significant correlation between galaxy kinematics and their stellar
mass as well as the environment they are in. Specifically, by using
inclination-corrected or intrinsic $\lambda_{R_e}$ values, we find that, at
fixed mass, satellite galaxies on average have the lowest
$\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$, isolated-central galaxies have the highest
$\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$, and group and cluster centrals lie in between.
Similarly, galaxies in high-density environments have lower mean
$\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$ values as compared to galaxies at low environmental
density. However, at fixed $\Sigma_{5}$, the mean $\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$
differences for low and high-mass galaxies are of similar magnitude as when
varying $\Sigma_{5}$ {($\Delta \lambda_{\,R_e,intr} \sim 0.05$. Our results
demonstrate that after stellar mass, environment plays a significant role in
the creation of slow rotators, while for fast rotators we also detect an

study we perform a parameter study of cloud-cloud collisions, and investigate
how the resulting SFR depends on the details of set-up. Our parameter study
explores variations in: collision speed; magnetic field inclination (with
respect to the collisional axis); and resolution, as defined by the number of
cells per Jeans length. In all our collision simulations we find a factor of
2-3 increase in the SFR compared to our no collision simulation, with star
formation beginning sooner with a) high collisional velocities, b) parallel
orientation between the magnetic field and collision axis, c) and lower
resolution. The mean virial parameter of high density (and thus possible
star-forming) gas increases with collisional velocity, but has little variation
with magnetic field inclination. The alignment of the velocity and magnetic
field remains uniform in low density environments but becomes more
perpendicular with increasing density, indicating the compression of the
magnetic field by collapsing gas. Comparing the trends in the SFR with other
GMC collision studies, we find good agreement with studies that account for the
gravitational boundedness of the gas in their star formation algorithm, but not
with those that simply form stars above a prescribed density threshold. This
suggests that the latter approach should be used with caution when modelling
star formation on resolved cloud scales.

less efficient gas inflow into the central star-forming gas reservoirs. A
sufficiently high CGM angular momentum, as inherited from the larger-scale

different populations of large-scale cosmic filaments, using the IllustrisTNG

density profiles of filaments, and we characterise the distribution of the
baryon fraction in these structures. We find that baryons exactly follow the
underlying DM distribution only down to r~7 Mpc to the filament spines. At
shorter distances (r<7 Mpc), the baryon fraction profile of filaments departs
from the cosmic value $\Omega_\mathrm{b} / \Omega_\mathrm{m}$. While in the
r~0.7-7 Mpc radial domain this departure is due to the radial accretion of the
warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) towards the filament cores (creating an
excess of baryons with respect to the cosmic fraction), the cores of filaments
(r<0.7 Mpc) show a clear baryon depletion instead. The analysis of the
efficiency of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback events in filaments reveals
that they are potentially powerful enough to eject gas outside of the
gravitational potential wells of filaments. We show that the large-scale
environment (i.e. denser versus less dense, hotter versus colder regions) has a
non-negligible effect on the absolute values of the DM, gas, and stellar
densities around filaments. Nevertheless, the relative distribution of baryons
with respect to the underlying DM density field is found to be independent of
the filament population. Finally, we provide scaling relations between the gas
density, temperature, and pressure for the different populations of cosmic

density-temperature and density-pressure planes.

ultimate virialised products in mass and time. Hot baryons in the intracluster
medium (ICM) and cold baryons in galaxies inhabit a dark matter dominated halo.
Internal processes, accretion, and mergers can perturb the equilibrium, which
is established only at later times. However, the cosmic time when
thermalisation is effective is still to be assessed. Here we show that massive
clusters in the observed universe attained an advanced thermal equilibrium
$\sim~1.8~\text{Gyr}$ ago, at redshift $z =0.14\pm0.06$, when the universe was
$11.7\pm0.7~\text{Gyr}$ old. Hot gas is mostly thermalised after the time when
cosmic densities of matter and dark energy match. We find in a statistically
nearly complete and homogeneous sample of 120 clusters from the {\it Planck}
Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample that the kinetic energy traced by the
galaxy velocity dispersion is a faithful probe of the gravitational energy
since a look back time of at least $\sim5.4~\text{Gyr}$, whereas the efficiency
of hot gas in converting kinetic to thermal energy, as measured through X-ray
observations in the core-excised area within $r_{500}$, steadily increases with
time. The evolution is detected at the $\sim 98$ per cent probability level.
Our results demonstrate that halo mass accretion history plays a larger role
for cluster thermal equilibrium than radiative physics. The evolution of hot
gas is strictly connected to the cosmic structure formation.

modulations from the large-scale environment, yielding in-spiralling gas to
fuel the star-forming reservoir, while, on the other hand, is affected by the
feedback activities from the galaxy centre. As a result, a present-day

optical classes. The 1.5-GHz radio luminosity of their parsec-scale cores
($L_{\rm core}$) is found to scale with BH mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and [O~III]
luminosity. Below $M_{\rm BH} \sim$10$^{6.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, stellar processes
from non-jetted HII galaxies dominate with $L_{\rm core} \propto M_{\rm
BH}^{0.61\pm0.33}$ and $L_{\rm core} \propto L_{\rm [O~III]}^{0.79\pm0.30}$.
Above $M_{\rm BH} \sim$10$^{6.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, accretion-driven processes
dominate with $L_{\rm core} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{1.5-1.65}$ and $L_{\rm core}
\propto L_{\rm [O~III]}^{0.99-1.31}$ for active galaxies: radio-quiet/loud
LINERs, Seyferts and jetted HII galaxies always display (although low)
signatures of radio-emitting BH activity, with $L_{\rm 1.5\,
GHz}\gtrsim$10$^{19.8}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$,
on a broad range of Eddington-scaled accretion rates ($\dot{m}$). Radio-quiet
and radio-loud LINERs are powered by low-$\dot{m}$ discs launching
sub-relativistic and relativistic jets, respectively. Low-power slow jets and
disc/corona winds from moderately high to high-$\dot{m}$ discs account for the
compact and edge-brightened jets of Seyferts, respectively. Jetted HII galaxies
may host weakly active BHs. Fuel-starved BHs and recurrent activity account for
ALG properties. [abridged]

resolutions of $0.15^{\prime \prime}-0.2^{\prime \prime}$, which with the help
of strong gravitational lensing enable us to reach spatial resolutions down to
$\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$ and $\sim 100\,\mathrm{pc}$ in these two galaxies,
respectively. These resolutions are close to the resolution of observations of
nearby galaxies. We study the radial profiles of SFR, $M_\star$, and
$M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ surface densities of these high-redshift galaxies and
compare the corresponding exponential scale lengths with those of local
galaxies. We find that the scale lengths in the Cosmic Snake are about
$0.5\,\mathrm{kpc}-1.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and they are 3 to 10 times larger in
A521. This is a significant difference knowing that the two galaxies have
comparable integrated properties. These high-redshift scale lengths are
nevertheless comparable to those of local galaxies, which cover a wide

normalisation of the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ surface density profiles ($\Sigma
M_{\mathrm{mol}}$), which are offset by up to a factor of 20 with respect to
the profiles of $z=0$ counterparts. The SFR surface density profiles are also
offset by the same factor as $\Sigma M_{\mathrm{mol}}$, as expected from the

interactions on triangular plaquettes as the Newman-Moore (NM) model on the 2D
triangular lattice. However, in contrast to the NM model and its 3D
generalizations, their degenerate ground states and low-lying excitations
cannot be described in terms of scalar cellular automata (CA), because the
corresponding fractal structures lack a simplifying algebraic property, often
termed the 'Freshman's dream'. By identifying a link to matrix CAs -- that
makes essential use of the crystallographic structure -- we show that both
models exhibit fractal symmetries of a distinct class to the NM-type models. We
devise a procedure to explicitly construct low-energy excitations consisting of
finite sets of immobile defects or ""fractons"", by flipping arbitrarily large
self-similar subsets of spins, whose fractal dimensions we compute
analytically. We show that these excitations are associated with energetic
barriers which increase logarithmically with system size, leading to ""fragile""
glassy dynamics, whose existence we confirm via classical Monte Carlo
simulations. We also discuss consequences for spontaneous fractal symmetry
breaking when quantum fluctuations are introduced by a transverse magnetic
field, and propose multi-spin correlation function diagnostics for such
transitions. Our findings suggest that matrix CAs may provide a fruitful route
to identifying fractal symmetries and fracton-like behaviour in lattice models,
with possible implications for the study of fracton topological order.

higher star formation efficiencies and more compact star forming regions for

form in varied chemical environments both across disks and at different radii
within the same disk. Interior to 150 au, the majority of chemical
substructures across the MAPS disks are spatially coincident with substructures
in the millimeter continuum, indicative of physical and chemical links between
the disk midplane and warm, elevated molecular emission layers. Some chemical
substructures in the inner disk and most chemical substructures exterior to 150
au cannot be directly linked to dust substructure, however, which indicates
that there are also other causes of chemical substructures, such as snowlines,
gradients in UV photon fluxes, ionization, and radially-varying elemental

in the velocity is seen, with larger values as we move away from the cluster

transport in conducting materials. Nevertheless, the substantial challenge of
incorporating disorder systematically into the semiclassical model persists,
leading to quantitative inaccuracies and occasionally erroneous predictions for
the expectation values of physical observables. In the present work we provide
a general prescription for reformulating the semiclassical equations of motion
for carriers in disordered conductors by taking the quantum mechanical density
matrix as the starting point. We focus on external electric fields, without
magnetic fields, and spin-independent disorder. The density matrix approach
allows averaging over impurity configurations, and the trace of the velocity
operator with the disorder-averaged density matrix can be reinterpreted as the
semiclassical velocity weighted by the Boltzmann distribution function. Through
this rationale the well-known intrinsic group and anomalous velocities are
trivially recovered, while we demonstrate the existence of an extrinsic
interband velocity, namely a disorder correction to the semiclassical velocity
of Bloch electrons, mediated by the interband matrix elements of the Berry
connection. A similar correction is present in the non-equilibrium expectation
value of the spin operator, contributing to spin-orbit torques. To obtain
agreement with diagrammatic approaches the scattering term in the Boltzmann
equation is corrected to first order in the electric field, and the Boltzmann
equation is solved up to sub-leading order in the disorder potential. Our
prescription ensures all vertex corrections present in diagrammatic treatments
are taken into account, and to illustrate this we discuss model cases in
topological insulators, including the anomalous Hall effect as well as
spin-orbit torques.

formation. Cosmological simulations demonstrate that such quenching is expected
and is due to the harsh environmental conditions that satellites face when
joining the Local Group (LG). However, recent observations of Milky Way
analogues in the SAGA survey present a very different picture, showing the
majority of observed satellites to be actively forming stars, calling into
question the realism of current simulations and the typicality of the LG. Here
we use the ARTEMIS suite of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations to carry out a careful comparison with observations of dwarf
satellites in the LG, SAGA, and the Local Volume (LV) survey. We show that
differences between SAGA and the LG and LV surveys, as well as between SAGA and
the ARTEMIS simulations, can be strongly reduced by considering differences in
the host mass distributions and (more importantly) observational selection
effects, specifically that low-mass satellites which have only recently been
accreted are more likely to be star-forming, have a higher optical surface
brightness, and are therefore more likely to be included in the SAGA survey.
This picture is confirmed using data from the deeper LV survey, which shows
pronounced quenching at low masses, in accordance with the predictions of
LCDM-based simulations.

topic yet to be analyzed. Aims. The investigation of S in the Galactic bulge

our knowledge on S behavior in this component of the Milky Way. Methods. We
present S abundances of 74 dwarf and sub-giant stars in the Galactic bulge, 21
and 30 F and G thick and thin disk stars. We performed local thermodynamic
equilibrium analysis and applied corrections for non-LTE on high resolution and
high signal-to-noise UVES spectra. S abundances were derived from multiplets 1,
6 and 8 in the metallicity range $-2<$[Fe/H]$<$0.6, by spectrosynthesis or line
equivalent widths. Results. We confirm that S behaves like an $\alpha$-element
within the Galactic bulge. In the [S/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram, S presents a
plateau at low metallicity followed by a decreasing of [S/Fe] with the
increasing of [Fe/H], until reaching [S/Fe]$\sim0$ at super-solar metallicity.
We found that the Galactic bulge is S-rich with respect to both the thick and
thin disks at $-1<$[Fe/H]$<0.3$, supporting a more rapid formation and chemical
evolution of the Galactic bulge than the disk.

emitting surfaces for a suite of CO isotopologues, HCN, and C$_2$H. We find
that $^{12}$CO emission traces the most elevated regions with $z/r > 0.3$,
while emission from the less abundant $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O probes deeper
into the disk at altitudes of $z/r \lesssim 0.2$. C$_2$H and HCN have lower
opacities and SNRs, making surface fitting more difficult, and could only be

163296 and MWC 480 as part of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet Forming Scales
(MAPS) large program. Using the $J = 2-1$ transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO
and C$^{18}$O imaged at spatial resolutions of $\sim 0.^{\prime \prime}15$ and
with a channel spacing of $200$ ${\rm m\,s^{-1}}$, we find perturbations from
Keplerian rotation in the projected velocity fields of both disks
($\lesssim\!5\%$ of the local Keplerian velocity), suggestive of large-scale
(10s of au in size), coherent flows. By accounting for the azimuthal dependence
on the projection of the velocity field, the velocity fields were decomposed
into azimuthally averaged orthogonal components, $v_{\phi}$, $v_r$ and $v_z$.
Using the optically thick $^{12}$CO emission as a probe of the gas temperature,
local variations of $\approx\! 3$ K ($\approx\! 5 \%$ relative changes) were
observed and found to be associated with the kinematic substructures. The MWC
480 disk hosts a suite of tightly wound spiral arms. The spirals arms, in
conjunction with the highly localized perturbations in the gas velocity
structure (kinematic planetary signatures), indicate a giant planet, $\sim\! 1$
$M_{\rm Jup}$, at a radius of $\approx 245$ au. In the disk of HD 163296, the
kinematic substructures were consistent with previous studies of Pinte et al.
(2018a) and Teague et al. (2018a) advocating for multiple $\sim\! 1$ $M_{\rm
Jup}$ planets embedded in the disk. These results demonstrate that molecular
line observations that characterize the dynamical structure of disks can be
used to search for the signatures of embedded planets. This paper is part of

the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS) catalogue. While
this magnitude-limited survey has an unprecedented number of objects, it
suffers from large distance uncertainties and lacks an estimation of host
extinction. We bypass these issues by calculating the intrinsic luminosities
from the shape parameters of the light curve's $ g $ and $ r $ bands, with the
luminosities calibrated from the well observed SNe Ia sample of the Carnegie
Supernova Project, allowing us to construct, for the first time, the intrinsic
LF of SNe Ia. We then use a novel tight relation between the color stretch and
the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$, to determine the
$M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ distribution of SNe Ia. We find that the LFs are unimodal,
with their peaks in line with previous results, but have a much lower rate of
dim events and luminous events. We show that the features on top of the
unimodal LF-derived distributions are all compatible with statistical noise,
consistent with a single progenitor channel for the explosions. We further
derive, for the first time, the SNe Ia distribution of host galaxy extinction,
and find a mean selective extinction of $E(B-V)\approx0.1$ and a non-negligible
fraction with large, $ >1\,\text{mag} $, extinction in the optical bands. The
high extinction is typical for luminous SNe, supporting their young population
origin.

influences the compositions of the planets that form in it. We use the
Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) data to constrain the
elemental composition of the gas at the locations of potentially forming
planets. The elemental abundances are inferred by comparing source-specific
gas-grain thermochemical models, with variable C/O ratios and small-grain
abundances, from the DALI code with CO and C2H column densities derived from
the high-resolution observations of the disks of AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC
480. Elevated C/O ratios (~2.0), even within the CO ice line, are necessary to
match the inferred C2H column densities, over most of the pebble disk. Combined
with constraints on the CO abundances in these systems, this implies that both
the O/H and C/H ratios in the gas are substellar by a factor of 4-10, with the
O/H depleted by a factor of 20-50, resulting in the high C/O ratios. This
necessitates that even within the CO ice line, most of the volatile carbon and
oxygen is still trapped on grains in the midplane. Planets accreting gas in the
gaps of the AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480 disks will thus acquire very little
carbon and oxygen after reaching the pebble isolation mass. In the absence of
atmosphere-enriching events, these planets would thus have a strongly
substellar O/H and C/H and superstellar C/O atmospheric composition.

channels. Here, we use an upgraded version of our semi-analytic codes {\sc
fastcluster} and {\sc cosmo$\mathcal{R}$ate} to investigate the cosmic
evolution of four different BBH populations: isolated BBHs and dynamically
formed BBHs in nuclear star clusters (NSCs), globular clusters (GCs), and young
star clusters (YSCs). With our approach, we can study different channels
assuming the same stellar and binary input physics. We find that the merger
rate density of BBHs in GCs and NSCs is barely affected by stellar metallicity
($Z$), while the rate of isolated BBHs changes wildly with $Z$. BBHs in YSCs
behave in an intermediate way between isolated and GC/NSC BBHs. The local
merger rate density of Nth-generation black holes (BHs), obtained by summing up
hierarchical mergers in GCs, NSCs and YSCs, ranges from $\sim{1}$ to $\sim{4}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and is mostly sensitive to the spin parameter. We find
that the mass function of primary BHs evolves with redshift in GCs and NSCs,
becoming more top-heavy at higher $z$. In contrast, the primary BH mass
function almost does not change with redshift in YSCs and in the field. This
signature of the BH mass function has relevant implications for Einstein
Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Finally, our analysis suggests that multiple
channels contribute to the BBH population of the second gravitational-wave
transient catalog.

be responsible for most planet formation, especially around the water ice line

the exquisite sensitivity of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales
(MAPS) ALMA large program to construct radial surface brightness profiles with
a ~3 au effective resolution for the CO isotopologue J=2-1 lines using the line
velocity profile. IM Lup reveals a central depression in 13CO and C18O that is
ascribed to a pileup of ~500 $M_\oplus$ of dust in the inner 20 au, leading to
a gas-to-dust ratio of around <10. This pileup is consistent with efficient
drift of grains ($\gtrsim$ 100 $M_\oplus$ Myr$^{-1}$) and a local gas-to-dust
ratio that suggests that the streaming instability could be active. The CO
isotopologue emission in the GM Aur disk is consistent with a small (~15 au),
strongly depleted gas cavity within the ~40 au dust cavity. The radial surface
brightness profiles for both the AS 209 and HD 163296 disks show a local
minimum and maximum in the C18O emission at the location of a known dust ring
(~14 au) and gap (~10 au), respectively. This indicates that the dust ring has
a low gas-to-dust ratio ($>$ 10) and that the dust gap is gas-rich enough to
have optically thick C18O.

millimeter continuum emission have lent the impression that planet formation
generally proceeds within orderly, isolated systems. While deep observations of
spatially resolved molecular emission have been comparatively limited, they are
increasingly suggesting that some disks interact with their surroundings while
planet formation is underway. We present an analysis of complex features
identified around GM Aur in $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ images at a spatial resolution of
$\sim40$ au. In addition to a Keplerian disk extending to a radius of $\sim550$
au, the CO emission traces flocculent spiral arms out to radii of $\sim$1200
au, a tail extending $\sim1800$ au southwest of GM Aur, and diffuse structures
extending from the north side of the disk up to radii of $\sim1900$ au. The
diffuse structures coincide with a ""dust ribbon"" previously identified in
scattered light. The large-scale asymmetric gas features present a striking
contrast with the mostly axisymmetric, multi-ringed millimeter continuum
tracing the pebble disk. We hypothesize that GM Aur's complex gas structures
result from late infall of remnant envelope or cloud material onto the disk.
The morphological similarities to the SU Aur and AB Aur systems, which are also
located in the L1517 cloud, provide additional support to a scenario in which
interactions with the environment are playing a role in regulating the
distribution and transport of material in all three of these Class II disk
systems. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical

ongoing to improve performance and prepare for an upcoming camera upgrade. The
pSCT camera upgrade will replace the current camera modules with improved SiPMs

enable next-generation very-high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics through
excellent background rejection and angular resolution. In this presentation we

excitonic peak at the Mott-gap edge of $\text{Re}\sigma(\omega)$ not only for
the two-dimensional square lattice but also for two- and four-leg ladders. For

expected to easily suppress an excitonic peak since spectral width of an

band between the lower and upper cut-off energies shows distinctly different

Cosmology Telescope (ACT) measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
with data from either the WMAP or the Planck satellite, along with measurements
of the baryon acoustic oscillations and uncalibrated supernovae luminosity
distance. We study a phenomenological axion-like potential ('axEDE') and a
scalar field experiencing a first-order phase-transition ('NEDE'). We find that
for both models the 'Planck-free' analysis yields non-zero EDE at > 2 sigma and
an increased value for $H_0 \sim 70-74$ km/s/Mpc, compatible with local
measurements, without the inclusion of any prior on $H_0$. On the other hand,
the inclusion of Planck data restricts the EDE contribution to an upper-limit
only at 95% C.L. For axEDE, the combination of Planck and ACT leads to
constraints 30% weaker than with Planck alone, and there is no residual Hubble
tension. On the other hand, NEDE is more strongly constrained in a Planck+ACT
analysis, and the Hubble tension remains at $\sim 3\sigma$, illustrating the
ability for CMB data to distinguish between EDE models. We explore the apparent
inconsistency between the Planck and ACT data and find that it comes (mostly)
from a slight tension between the temperature power spectrum at multipoles
around $\sim 1000$ and $\sim 1500$. Finally, through a mock analysis of ACT
data, we demonstrate that the preference for EDE is not driven by a lack of
information at high-$\ell$ when removing Planck data, and that a LCDM fit to
the fiducial EDE cosmology results in a significant bias on $\{H_0,\omega_{\rm
cdm}\}$. More accurate measurements of the TT power spectra above $\ell\sim
2500$ and EE between $\ell \sim 300-500$ will play a crucial role in
differentiating EDE models.

diseases, including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. Concern is
rising in the US and abroad as the population and range of this species grow
and new diseases emerge. Herein I consider the potential for control of
$\textit{I. scapularis}$ using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), which acts
by reducing net fertility through release of sterile males. I construct a
population model with density-dependent and -independent growth, migration, and
an Allee effect (decline of the population when it is small), and use this
model to simulate sterile tick release in both single- and multi-patch
frameworks. I test two key concerns with implementing $\textit{I. scapularis}$
SIT: that the ticks' lengthy life course could make control take too long and
that low migration might mean sterile males need thorough manual dispersal to
all parts of the control area. Results suggest that typical $\textit{I.
scapularis}$ SIT programs will take about eight years, a prediction near the
normal range for the technique, but that thorough distribution of sterile ticks
over the control area is indeed critical, increasing expense substantially by
necessitating aerial release. With particularly high rearing costs also
expected for $\textit{I. scapularis}$, the latter finding suggests that
cost-effectiveness improvements to aerial release may be a prerequisite to
$\textit{I. scapularis}$ SIT.

on objects' shape, rather than their color or texture; this assumption is
called the shape bias. They are thought to learn this bias by observing that
their caregiver's language is biased towards shape based categories. This
presents a chicken and egg problem: if the shape bias must be present in the
language in order for children to learn it, how did it arise in language in the
first place? In this paper, we propose that communicative efficiency explains
both how the shape bias emerged and why it persists across generations. We
model this process with neural emergent language agents that learn to
communicate about raw pixelated images. First, we show that the shape bias
emerges as a result of efficient communication strategies employed by agents.
Second, we show that pressure brought on by communicative need is also
necessary for it to persist across generations; simply having a shape bias in
an agent's input language is insufficient. These results suggest that, over and
above the operation of other learning strategies, the shape bias in human
learners may emerge and be sustained by communicative pressures.

class are presented to an agent one after another, and the agent has to quickly
select a presumably best algorithm from a fixed set of candidate algorithms.
For decision problems such as satisfiability (SAT), quality typically refers to
the algorithm's runtime. As the latter is known to exhibit a heavy-tail
distribution, an algorithm is normally stopped when exceeding a predefined
upper time limit. As a consequence, machine learning methods used to optimize
an algorithm selection strategy in a data-driven manner need to deal with
right-censored samples, a problem that has received little attention in the
literature so far. In this work, we revisit multi-armed bandit algorithms for
OAS and discuss their capability of dealing with the problem. Moreover, we
adapt them towards runtime-oriented losses, allowing for partially censored
data while keeping a space- and time-complexity independent of the time
horizon. In an extensive experimental evaluation on an adapted version of the
ASlib benchmark, we demonstrate that theoretically well-founded methods based
on Thompson sampling perform specifically strong and improve in comparison to

for wind turbines in the full-load region by an effective robust-adaptive
control strategy. The developed controller compensates for the uncertainty in
the control input effectiveness caused by a pitch actuator fault, unmeasurable
wind disturbance, and nonlinearity in the model. Wind turbines have multi-layer
structures such that the high-level structure is nonlinearly coupled through an
aggregation of the low-level control authorities. Hence, the control design is
divided into two stages. First, an $\mathcal{L}_2$ controller is designed to
attenuate the influence of wind disturbance fluctuations on the rotor speed.
Then, in the low-level layer, a controller is designed using a proposed
adaptation mechanism to compensate for actuator faults. The theoretical results
show that the closed-loop equilibrium point of the regulated rotor speed
tracking error dynamics in the high level is finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_2$
stable, and the closed-loop error dynamics in the low level is globally
asymptotically stable. Simulation results show that the developed controller
significantly reduces the root mean square of the rotor speed error compared to
some well-known works, despite the largely fluctuating wind disturbance, and
the time-varying uncertainty in the control input effectiveness.

capture to capture collaborator painting motions which are then composed and

Comptonization up to a cutoff at $\simeq 100$ keV, characteristic of that seen

a denser midplane region where magnetic fields are dynamically important. For

the group of diffeomorphisms. Two metrics, that could even be the same, could
look completely different in different coordinates. This is the gauge problem.
The general gauge problem is extremely subtle for non-compact spaces. Often it
can be avoided if one uses some additional structure of the particular
situation. However, in many problems there is no additional structure. Instead
we solve the gauge problem directly in great generality.
  The techniques and ideas apply to many problems. We use them to solve a
well-known open problem in Ricci flow: Strong rigidity of cylinders. Strong
rigidity is an illustration of a {\it shrinker principle} that uniqueness
radiates out from a compact set. It implies that if one tangent flow at a
future singular point is a cylinder, then all tangent flows are.
  We solve the gauge problem by solving a nonlinear system of PDEs. The PDE
produces a diffeomorphism that fixes an appropriate gauge in the spirit of the
slice theorem for group actions. We then show optimal bounds for the
displacement function of the diffeomorphism. Strong rigidity relies on gauge
fixing and several other new ideas. One of these is ""propagation of almost
splitting"", another is quadratic rigidity in the right gauge, and a third is an
optimal polynomial growth bound for PDEs that holds in great generality.

rural and urban areas in southern Chile. We used Social Network Analysis (SNA)
to map students' friendships relations, academic prestige, and collaboration on
both courses. Later we combined the collaboration network with friendship and
academic prestige on the course, to separate strong from weak friendship
working ties, and those among students who enjoy or not academic prestige.
Multiple linear regression models showed, on average, positive effects of
collaboration on grades. Yet, when isolating the effects of the types of
collaboration, the positive effects are observed only between those who display
more strong friendship ties. Also, we found differences on the social networks
and their effects over grades between both courses, presumably due to their
pedagogical nature. With these results we contribute to the literature of
collaboration and its effectiveness based on the nature of students'
relationships, and advocate for the importance of instructional design in

clouds in M 100 (NGC 4321), which was observed as part of the Deciphering the
Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium
(DIISC) survey in HI 21 cm at 3.3 km s$^{-1}$ spectroscopic and 44
arcsec$\times$30 arcsec spatial resolution using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array. These clouds were identified as structures that show significant
kinematic offsets from the rotating disk of M100. The velocity offsets of 40 km
s$^{-1}$ observed in these clouds are comparable to the offsets seen in
intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the
Milky Way and nearby galaxies. We find that one anomalous cloud in M 100 is
associated with star-forming regions detected in H$\alpha$ and far-ultraviolet
imaging. Our investigation shows that anomalous clouds in M 100 may originate
from multiple mechanisms, such as star formation feedback-driven outflows,
ram-pressure stripping, and tidal interactions with satellite galaxies.
Moreover, we do not detect any cool CGM at 38.8 kpc from the center of M 100,
giving an upper limit of N(HI) $\le$ $1.7\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ (3$\sigma$).
Since M 100 is in the Virgo cluster, the non-existence of neutral/cool CGM is a
likely pathway for turning it into a red galaxy.

  https://github.com/nrenga/ghz_distillation_qec. Comments welcome!",,,,"quant-ph cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entanglement distillation is a well-studied problem in quantum information,
where one typically starts with $n$ noisy Bell pairs and distills $k$ Bell
pairs of higher fidelity. While distilling Bell pairs is the canonical setting,
it is important to study the distillation of multipartite entangled states
because these can be useful for realizing distributed algorithms on quantum
networks. In this paper, we study the distillation of GHZ states using quantum
error correcting codes (QECCs). Using the stabilizer formalism, we begin by
explaining the QECC-based Bell pair distillation protocol in arXiv:0708.3699,
which relies particularly on the transpose symmetry between Alice's and Bob's
qubits in Bell states. Extending this idea, we show that, given $n$ GHZ states,
performing a matrix on Alice's qubits is equivalent to performing a ""stretched""
version of the transpose of the matrix on the qubits of Bob and Charlie. We
call this mapping to the stretched version of the matrix the GHZ-map, and show
that it is an algebra homomorphism. Using this property, we show that Alice
projecting her qubits onto an $[[n,k]]$ stabilizer code implies the
simultaneous projection of Bob's and Charlie's qubits onto an induced
$[[2n,k]]$ stabilizer code. Guided by this insight, we develop a GHZ
distillation protocol based on local operations and classical communication
that uses any stabilizer code. Inspired by stabilizer measurements on GHZ
states, we also develop a new algorithm to generate logical Pauli operators of
any stabilizer code and use it in the protocol. Since quantum codes with finite
rate and almost linear minimum distance have recently been discovered, this
paper paves the way for high-rate high-output-fidelity GHZ distillation. We
provide simulation results on the $5$-qubit perfect code to emphasize the
importance of the placement of a certain local Clifford operation in the
protocol.

finest sand. Using high speed video and fluorescent markers, we measure the
ratio of pre- to post-impact horizontal and vertical velocity components, which
we refer to as coefficients of restitution, and the angle of deflection caused
by the impact in the horizontal plane. Coefficients of restitution are
sensitive to mean grain size with the ratio associated with the horizontal
velocity component about twice as large for our coarsest gravel as that for our
finest sand. This implies that coefficients for hydro-static-like, drag-like
and lift-like forces, used in empirical force laws, are sensitive to mean grain
size. The coefficient that is most strongly sensitive to grain size is the lift
coefficient which decreases by a factor of 3 between our coarsest and finest
media. The deflection angles are largest in the coarser media and their size
approximately depends on grain size to the 3/2 power. This scaling is matched
with a model where momentum transfer takes place via collisions with individual
grains. The dependence of impact mechanics on substrate size distribution
should be considered in future models for populations of objects that impact
granular asteroid surfaces.

While much work was done analyzing this phenomenon, primarily for

In this work, we analyze errors that cause major quality degradation with large

the implicit regularization comes from the weights that the $H^s$ norm imposes
on different frequency contents of an underlying image. We further analyze the

this work is four-fold. First, we build a standard benchmark containing 40k
C/C++ programs, each of which is translated to a circuit design with actual
hardware quality metrics, aiming to facilitate the development of effective
GNNs targeting this high-demand circuit design area. Second, 14
state-of-the-art GNN models are analyzed on the Program-to-Circuit problem. We
identify key design challenges of this problem, which should be carefully
handled but not yet solved by existing GNNs. The goal is to provide
domain-specific knowledge for designing GNNs with suitable inductive biases.
Third, we discuss three sets of real-world benchmarks for GNN generalization
evaluation, and analyze the performance gap between standard programs and the
real-case ones. The goal is to enable transfer learning from limited training
data to real-world large-scale circuit design problems. Fourth, the
Program-to-Circuit problem is a representative within the Program-to-X
framework, a set of program-based analysis problems with various downstream
tasks. The in-depth understanding of strength and weaknesses in applying GNNs
on Program-to-Circuit could largely benefit the entire family of Program-to-X.
Pioneering in this direction, we expect more GNN endeavors to revolutionize
this high-demand Program-to-Circuit problem and to enrich the expressiveness of
GNNs on programs.

challenging for typical users, such as DL developers and data scientists.
Manual tuning requires deep knowledge of the user-controllable parameters of DL
frameworks as well as the underlying hardware. It is a slow and tedious
process, and it typically delivers sub-optimal solutions.
  In this paper, we treat the problem of tuning parameters of DL frameworks to
improve training and inference performance as a black-box optimization problem.
We then investigate applicability and effectiveness of Bayesian optimization
(BO), genetic algorithm (GA), and Nelder-Mead simplex (NMS) to tune the
parameters of TensorFlow's CPU backend. While prior work has already
investigated the use of Nelder-Mead simplex for a similar problem, it does not
provide insights into the applicability of other more popular algorithms.
Towards that end, we provide a systematic comparative analysis of all three
algorithms in tuning TensorFlow's CPU backend on a variety of DL models. Our
findings reveal that Bayesian optimization performs the best on the majority of
models. There are, however, cases where it does not deliver the best results.

acknowledging each packet individually, imposing an overhead for each

interference, it may be beneficial to aggregate the acknowledgments for
multiple nodes and broadcast them in a compressed format to all nodes in the

proposes a novel group acknowledgment scheme with the goal to examine whether

that apart from a few cases, GACKs do not constitute a valid alternative to the

chemical properties. The distributions of molecules across disks regulate the
elemental compositions of planets, including C/N/O/S ratios and metallicity

Emission from molecules also encodes information on disk ionization levels,
temperature structures, kinematics, and gas surface densities, which are all
key ingredients of disk evolution and planet formation models. The Molecules
with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program was designed to
expand our understanding of the chemistry of planet formation by exploring disk
chemical structures down to 10 au scales. The MAPS program focuses on five
disks - around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480 - in which dust
substructures are detected and planet formation appears to be ongoing. We
observed these disks in 4 spectral setups, which together cover ~50 lines from

presenting an overview of the program motivation, disk sample, observational
details, and calibration strategy. We also highlight key results, including
discoveries of links between dust, gas, and chemical sub-structures, large
reservoirs of nitriles and other organics in the inner disk regions, and
elevated C/O ratios across most disks. We discuss how this collection of

First, STraTA uses task augmentation, a novel technique that synthesizes a

achieves comparable results to standard fine-tuning with 67K training examples.

PolyCube yields a valid hex mesh. A key challenge in these methods is to
maintain the bijectivity of the PolyCube deformation, thus reducing the
robustness of these algorithms. In this work, we present an interactive
pipeline for hex meshing that sidesteps this challenge by using a new
representation of PolyCubes as unions of cuboids. We begin by deforming the
input tetrahedral mesh into a near-PolyCube domain whose faces are close but
not perfectly aligned to the major axis directions. We then build a PolyCube by
optimizing the layout of a set of cuboids with user guidance to closely fit the
deformed domain. Finally, we construct an inversion-free pullback map from the
voxelized PolyCube to the input domain while optimizing for mesh quality
metrics. We allow extensive user control over each stage, such as editing the
voxelized PolyCube, positioning surface vertices, and exploring the trade-off
among competing quality metrics, while also providing automatic alternatives.
We validate our method on over one hundred shapes, including models that are
challenging for past PolyCube-based and frame-field-based methods. Our pipeline
reliably produces hex meshes with quality on par with or better than

a high-resolution calculation succeeds in reproducing the solar-like

important tool for operationally studying field properties. Here, we study the
response of an inertial UDW detector to a non-relativistic particle state of a
massive scalar field and we find that the transition probability of the
detector splits into the vacuum contribution and the matter contribution. We
show that the matter part oscillates with the interaction time duration and the
oscillation period depends on the difference between the mass of the particle

transition probability is found when such difference equals to zero. We compare
the matter part contribution with the non-relativistic probability density of
the particle and find that they provide qualitatively similar description of

well-defined models with parallelism returned by existing techniques are often

practical business context. We bridge this gap by introducing the Probabilistic
Inductive Miner (PIM) based on the Inductive Miner framework. PIM compares in

significantly higher accuracy. All design choices in PIM are based on business

ratios of the dense gas tracers, such as HCN (1-0) and HCO$^{+}$(1-0), to

explained by the deficiency of $^{13}$CO and high dense gas fractions suggested
by high HCN (1-0)/$^{12}$CO (1-0) ratios. We calculate the IR-to-HCN (1-0)
luminosity ratio as a proxy of the dense gas star formation efficiency. There
is no correlation between the IR/HCN ratio and the IR luminosity, while the
IR/HCN ratio varies from source to source (1.1-6.5) $\times 10^{3}$
$L_{\odot}$/(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$). Compared with the control sample, we find
that the average IR/HCN ratio of the merger remnants is higher by a factor of
2-3 than those of the early/mid-stage mergers and non-merging LIRGs, and it is
comparable to that of the late-stage mergers. The IR-to-$^{12}$CO (1-0) ratios
show a similar trend to the IR/HCN ratios. These results suggest that star
formation efficiency is enhanced by the merging process and maintained at high
levels even after the final coalescence. The dynamical interactions and mergers

  Using the Koopman representation and a recent theorem of Elek, we show that
when $\Gamma$ is a countably-infinite group having property (T) and $X$ is the
Cantor set, there exists a free and minimal action of $\Gamma$ on $X$ and a
$C^*$-norm $\eta$ on $C_c(\Gamma, C(X))$ such that $C(X)\rtimes_\eta\Gamma$
contains the compact operators as an exotic ideal. We use this example to
provide a positive answer to a question of A. Katavolos and V. Paulsen.

intersection with $C(X)$, and a result from arXiv:1901.09683 shows they
coincide when the action of $\Gamma$ is free, however the problem of whether
these ideals can be non-zero was left unresolved. We present an example of a
free action of $\Gamma$ on a compact Hausdorff space $X$ along with a

transmission averaged over 1 comoving $h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$ bins falls below 5%.
Nine ultra-long ($L > 80~h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$) dark gaps are identified at $z<6$.
In addition, we quantify the fraction of QSO spectra exhibiting gaps longer

$F_{30} \simeq 0.9$, 0.6, and 0.15 at $z = 6.0$, 5.8, and 5.6, respectively,
with the last of these long dark gaps persisting down to $z \simeq 5.3$.

that the data are consistent with models wherein reionization extends
significantly below redshift six. Models wherein the IGM is essentially fully
reionized that retain large-scale fluctuations in the ionizing UV background at
$z \lesssim 6$ are also potentially consistent with the data. Overall, our
results suggest that signature of reionization in the form of islands of

have excellent distribution properties. The approach we follow here is
motivated by recent work of Steinerberger and Pausinger who consider similar
greedy algorithms, where they minimize functionals that can be related to the
star discrepancy or energy of point sets. In contrast to many greedy algorithms
where the resulting elements of the sequence can only be given numerically, we
will find that in the one-dimensional case our algorithms yield rational
numbers which we can describe precisely. In particular, we will observe that
any initial segment of a sequence in $[0,1)$ can be naturally extended to a
uniformly distributed sequence where all subsequent elements are of the form
$x_N=\frac{2n-1}{2N}$ for some $n\in\{1,\dots,N\}$. We will also investigate

sufficient conditions for continuity of value functions and upper
semicontinuity of solution multifunctions. Berge's maximum theorem assumes that
the objective function is continuous and the multifunction of feasible sets is
compact-valued. These assumptions are not satisfied in many applied problems,

generalizes Berge's maximum theorem in three directions: (i) the objective

incorporating model-generated prefixes into training. However, it has been

inference time is correct, a form of catastrophic forgetting. We propose to use
Elastic Weight Consolidation to better balance mitigating exposure bias with

components: a sharp partial eclipse of the O3 secondary by the O2.5/WN6 star,
and tidally excited oscillations. Based on the light minima a new ephemeris for
the system is calculated. The system configuration is detached and the observed
eclipse corresponds to the periastron passage. During the eclipse, the light
curve shape suggests the presence of the heartbeat effect. The frequencies
derived for the tidally excited oscillations are harmonics of the orbital
period. Combining new and previously published radial velocity measurements, a
new spectroscopic orbital solution is also obtained. Using the \textsc{phoebe}

human expert when ML-based decisions are deemed unreliable. Existing
learning-to-defer frameworks are not designed for sequential settings. That is,
they defer at every instance independently, based on immediate predictions,
while ignoring the potential long-term impact of these interventions. As a
result, existing frameworks are myopic. Further, they do not defer adaptively,
which is crucial when human interventions are costly. In this work, we propose
Sequential Learning-to-Defer (SLTD), a framework for learning-to-defer to a
domain expert in sequential decision-making settings. Contrary to existing
literature, we pose the problem of learning-to-defer as model-based
reinforcement learning (RL) to i) account for long-term consequences of
ML-based actions using RL and ii) adaptively defer based on the dynamics
(model-based). Our proposed framework determines whether to defer (at each time
step) by quantifying whether a deferral now will improve the value compared to
delaying deferral to the next time step. To quantify the improvement, we
account for potential future deferrals. As a result, we learn a pre-emptive
deferral policy (i.e. a policy that defers early if using the ML-based policy
could worsen long-term outcomes). Our deferral policy is adaptive to the
non-stationarity in the dynamics. We demonstrate that adaptive deferral via
SLTD provides an improved trade-off between long-term outcomes and deferral
frequency on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data with non-stationary
dynamics. Finally, we interpret the deferral decision by decomposing the
propagated (long-term) uncertainty around the outcome, to justify the deferral
decision.

this work, we design quantum machine learning algorithms to model copulas. We

To bridge the two tasks together, we propose an approach to learning and

  The scaled second cumulant per site, i.e. the diffusion coefficient or the
scaled variance of the associated interface height, shows the $O(N^{-1/2})$
decay expected for models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class below
the critical density, while it is growing as $O(N^{3/2})$ and exponentially
times power law prefactor at the critical point and above. Also, we identify
the crossover regime and obtain the scaling functions for the uniform
asymptotics unifying the three regimes. These functions are compared to the
scaling functions describing crossover of the cumulants of the avalanche size,
obtained as statistics of the first return area under the time space trajectory

acquire neutral or positive values of electrical charge, these modes may couple
for certain values of wavenumber. It is also seen that the whistler and ion
cyclotron modes present null group velocity in a interval of small wavenumber,
and that the maximum value of wavenumber for which the waves are
non-propagating is reduced in the presence of the photoionization process. For
very small values of wavenumber, the damping rates of the modes could change
significantly from very small to very high values if the sign of the dust

perform sequential decisions while interacting with the environment. The

constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In the literature, various
algorithms are available to solve CMDP problems in a model-free manner to
achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with $\epsilon$ feasible policies.
An $\epsilon$-feasible policy implies that it suffers from constraint
violation. An important question here is whether we can achieve
$\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations or not. To
achieve that, we advocate the use of randomized primal-dual approach to solve
the CMDP problems and propose a conservative stochastic primal-dual algorithm
(CSPDA) which is shown to exhibit
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity to achieve
$\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations. In the
prior works, the best available sample complexity for the $\epsilon$-optimal
policy with zero constraint violation is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^5\right)$. Hence, the proposed algorithm
provides a significant improvement as compared to the state of the art.

results are compatible with existing linguistic observations that relate degree
semantics to polarity-sensitivity, including the main one: low degree semantics

From resonant X-ray scattering experiments, we observed an antiferromagnetic

is similar to that of the orthorhombic La2CuO4, implying that the asymmetric

constrained with high-resolution observations. In this work, we aim to merge
high- with low-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We present the analysis of
three primary transits of WASP-69b in the VIS channel of the CARMENES
instrument and perform a combined low- and high-resolution analysis using
additional data from HARPS-N, OSIRIS/GTC, and WFC3/HST already available in the
literature. During the first CARMENES observing night, we detected the planet
Na D$_{2}$ and D$_{1}$ lines at $\sim 7\sigma$ and $\sim 3\sigma$ significance
levels, respectively. We measured a D$_{2}$/D$_{1}$ intensity ratio of
2.5$\pm$0.7, which is in agreement with previous HARPS-N observations. Our
modelling of WFC3 and OSIRIS data suggests strong Rayleigh scattering, solar to
super-solar water abundance, and a highly muted Na feature in the atmosphere of
this planet, in agreement with previous investigations of this target. We use
the continuum information retrieved from the low-resolution spectroscopy as a
prior to break the degeneracy between the Na abundance, reference pressure, and
thermosphere temperature for the high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. We fit
the Na D$_{1}$ and D$_{2}$ lines individually and find that the posterior
distributions of the model parameters agree with each other within 1$\sigma$.
Our results suggest that local thermodynamic equilibrium processes can explain
the observed D$_{2}$/D$_{1}$ ratio because the presence of haze opacity mutes
the absorption features.

distance from the Sun. We compare the radial evolution of magnetic field
variances with that of the mean square amplitudes of switchbacks, and quantify
the radial evolution of the cumulative counts of switchbacks per km. We find
that the amplitudes of switchbacks decrease faster than the overall turbulent
fluctuations, in a way consistent with the radial decrease of the mean magnetic

signature of decay processes of large amplitude Alfv\'enic fluctuations in the
solar wind. We find that the evolution of switchback occurrence in the solar
wind is scale-dependent: the fraction of longer duration switchbacks increases
with radial distance whereas it decreases for shorter switchbacks. This implies
that switchback dynamics is a complex process involving both decay and in-situ

a recently introduced asymptotic symmetry group that includes arbitrary

of conserved charges parametrizing the non-radiative corner phase space. These
observables, related to the Weyl scalars, reveal a duality symmetry and a
spin-2 generator which allow us to recast the asymptotic evolution equations in
a simple and elegant form as conservation equations for a null fluid living at
null infinity. Finally we identify non-linear gravitational impulse waves that
describe transitions among gravitational vacua and are non-perturbative
solutions of the asymptotic Einstein's equations. This provides a new picture
of quantization of the asymptotic phase space, where gravitational vacua are
representations of the asymptotic symmetry group and impulsive waves are

that the filter order is large compared to the projection order of APA and we
make no assumptions on the input signal except for stationarity. Using these

During multi-island reconnection, the formation and merging of flux ropes in

nontrivial nonequilibrium steady states with intriguing phenomenology, such as

non-interacting particles in two dimensions, basing our analysis on the

Our primary result is an approximation strategy that explicitly connects
asymptotic solutions of the Smoluchowski equation to boundary conditions. We
test this approximation against the exact analytic solution in a 2d planar

find good agreement so long as the boundary conditions do not vary too rapidly

natural language processing. However, there is very limited work focusing on
the adversarial attack deployment and mitigation in energy systems. In this
regard, to better prepare the SESs against potential adversarial attacks, we
propose an innovative adversarial attack model that can practically compromise
dynamical controls of energy system. We also optimize the deployment of the
proposed adversarial attack model by employing deep reinforcement learning (RL)
techniques. In this paper, we present our first-stage work in this direction.

microrobotic technologies, from dynamically reconfigurable materials to
advanced lab-on-a-chip systems. However, there are few physical principles by
which particle trajectories can be specified and can be used to generate a wide
range of behaviors. Within the field of ray optics, a single principle for
controlling the trajectory of light -- Snell's law -- yields an intuitive
framework for engineering a broad range of devices, from microscopes to cameras
and telescopes. Here we show that the motion of self-propelled particles
gliding across a resistance discontinuity is governed by a variant of Snell's
law, and develop a corresponding ray optics for gliders. Just as the ratio of
refractive indexes sets the path of a light ray, the ratio of resistance
coefficients is shown to determine the trajectories of gliders. The magnitude
of refraction depends on the glider's shape, in particular its aspect ratio,
which serves as an analog to the wavelength of light. This enables the demixing
of a polymorphic, many-shaped, beam of gliders into distinct monomorphic,
single-shaped, beams through a friction prism. In turn, beams of monomorphic
gliders can be focused by spherical and gradient friction lenses.
Alternatively, the critical angle for total internal reflection can be used to
create shape-selective glider traps. Overall our work suggests that furthering
the analogy between light and microscopic gliders will result in a wide range
of new devices for sorting, concentrating, and analyzing self-propelled
particles.

  Reinforcement Learning and Global Convergence of Policy Gradient Methods","42 pages",,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When designing algorithms for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement
learning problems, a common approach is to introduce a fictitious discount
factor and use stationary policies for approximations. Empirically, it has been
shown that the fictitious discount factor helps reduce variance, and stationary
policies serve to save the per-iteration computational cost. Theoretically,
however, there is no existing work on convergence analysis for algorithms with
this fictitious discount recipe. This paper takes the first step towards
analyzing these algorithms. It focuses on two vanilla policy gradient (VPG)
variants: the first being a widely used variant with discounted advantage
estimations (DAE), the second with an additional fictitious discount factor in
the score functions of the policy gradient estimators. Non-asymptotic
convergence guarantees are established for both algorithms, and the additional
discount factor is shown to reduce the bias introduced in DAE and thus improve
the algorithm convergence asymptotically. A key ingredient of our analysis is
to connect three settings of Markov decision processes (MDPs): the
finite-time-horizon, the average reward and the discounted settings. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee on fictitious discount
algorithms for the episodic reinforcement learning of finite-time-horizon MDPs,
which also leads to the (first) global convergence of policy gradient methods
for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement learning.

  Realizing that an important missing piece is a reliable heatmap visualization

avoid local optima in heatmap generation, which improved the performance across
all resolutions. During the development of those visualizations, we realized
that for a significant number of images, the classifier has multiple different
paths to reach a confident prediction. This has lead to our recent development
of structured attention graphs (SAGs), an approach that utilizes beam search to
locate multiple coarse heatmaps for a single image, and compactly visualizes a
set of heatmaps by capturing how different combinations of image regions impact
the confidence of a classifier.

deep network explanations, the existence and frequency of multiple
explanations, and various tricks of the trade that make explanations work. In
this paper, we attempt to share those insights and opinions with the readers

protostellar jets is investigated in different star-forming cores with the
parameters of magnetic field strength and mass accretion rate. Powerful
high-velocity jets appear in strongly magnetized clouds when the mass accretion
rate onto the protostellar system is lower than $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. On the other hand, even at this mass accretion rate range,
no jets appear for magnetic fields of prestellar clouds as weak as $\mu_0
\gtrsim 5$--$10$, where $\mu_0$ is the mass-to-flux ratio normalized by the
critical value $(2\pi G^{1/2})^{-1}$. For $\dot{M}\gtrsim 10^{-3}\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, although jets usually appear just after protostar
formation independent of the magnetic field strength, they soon weaken and
finally disappear. Thus, they cannot help drive the low-velocity outflow when
there is no low-velocity flow just before protostar formation. As a result, no
significant mass ejection occurs during the early mass accretion phase either
when the prestellar cloud is weaky magnetized or when the mass accretion rate
is very high. Thus, protostars formed in such environments would trace
different evolutionary paths from the normal star formation process.

Javanmard and Nazerzadeh [2019] except that we expand the demand curve to a
semiparametric model and need to learn dynamically both parametric and
nonparametric components. We propose a dynamic statistical learning and
decision-making policy that combines semiparametric estimation from a
generalized linear model with an unknown link and online decision-making to
minimize regret (maximize revenue). Under mild conditions, we show that for a
market noise c.d.f. $F(\cdot)$ with $m$-th order derivative ($m\geq 2$), our
policy achieves a regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}_{d}(T^{\frac{2m+1}{4m-1}})$,
where $T$ is time horizon and $\tilde{O}_{d}$ is the order that hides
logarithmic terms and the dimensionality of feature $d$. The upper bound is
further reduced to $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ if $F$ is super smooth whose
Fourier transform decays exponentially. In terms of dependence on the horizon
$T$, these upper bounds are close to $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, the lower bound where
$F$ belongs to a parametric class. We further generalize these results to the
case with dynamically dependent product features under the strong mixing
condition.

express stop actions autonomously when the target is achieved. The asymptotic
stability to the target is proved. Secondly, the controller can adjust the

score predicting drugs by considering all cell clusters to address the
intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. We tested ASGARD on multiple
diseases, including breast cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On single-drug therapy, ASGARD shows
significantly better average accuracy (AUC of 0.92) compared to two other
bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods (AUC of 0.80 and 0.76). It is also
considerably better (AUC of 0.82) than other cell cluster level predicting
methods (AUC of 0.67 and 0.55). In addition, ASGARD is also validated by the
drug response prediction method TRANSACT with Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer
patient samples. Many top-ranked drugs are either approved by FDA or in
clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. In silico cell-type specific
drop-out experiments using triple-negative breast cancers show the importance
of T cells in the tumor microenvironment in affecting drug predictions. In
conclusion, ASGARD is a promising drug repurposing recommendation tool guided
by single-cell RNA-seq for personalized medicine. ASGARD is free for

Black-Scholes framework, where the consumption rate is subject to a lower bound
constraint that linearly depends on her wealth. It is a stochastic control
problem with state-dependent control constraint to which the standard
stochastic control theory cannot be directly applied. We overcome this by
transforming it into an equivalent stochastic control problem in which the
control constraint is state-independent so that the standard theory can be
applied. We give an explicit optimal consumption-investment strategy when the
constraint is homogeneous. When the constraint is non-homogeneous, it is shown
that the value function is third-order continuously differentiable by
differential equation approach, and a feedback form optimal
consumption-investment strategy is provided. According to our findings, if one
is concerned with long-term more than short-term consumption, then she should
always consume as few as possible; otherwise, she should consume optimally when
her wealth is above a threshold, and consume as few as possible when her wealth
is below the threshold.

serves for specific objectives and desires different properties of generated
text. The complexity makes automatic evaluation of NLG particularly
challenging. Previous work has typically focused on a single task and developed
individual evaluation metrics based on specific intuitions. In this paper, we
propose a unifying perspective that facilitates the design of metrics for a
wide range of language generation tasks and quality aspects. Based on the
nature of information change from input to output, we classify NLG tasks into
compression (e.g., summarization), transduction (e.g., text rewriting), and
creation (e.g., dialog). The information alignment, or overlap, between input,
context, and output text plays a common central role in characterizing the
generation. Using the uniform concept of information alignment, we develop a
family of interpretable metrics for various NLG tasks and aspects, often
without need of gold reference data. To operationalize the metrics, we train
self-supervised models to approximate information alignment as a prediction
task. Experiments show the uniformly designed metrics achieve stronger or
comparable correlations with human judgement compared to state-of-the-art
metrics in each of diverse tasks, including text summarization, style transfer,
and knowledge-grounded dialog. With information alignment as the intermediate
representation, we deliver a composable library for easy NLG evaluation and
future metric design.

The model-based image denoising approaches can achieve good generalization
ability over different noise levels and are with high interpretability.
Learning-based approaches are able to achieve better results, but usually with
weaker generalization ability and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a
wavelet-inspired invertible network (WINNet) to combine the merits of the
wavelet-based approaches and learningbased approaches. The proposed WINNet
consists of K-scale of lifting inspired invertible neural networks (LINNs) and
sparsity-driven denoising networks together with a noise estimation network.
The network architecture of LINNs is inspired by the lifting scheme in
wavelets. LINNs are used to learn a non-linear redundant transform with perfect
reconstruction property to facilitate noise removal. The denoising network
implements a sparse coding process for denoising. The noise estimation network
estimates the noise level from the input image which will be used to adaptively
adjust the soft-thresholds in LINNs. The forward transform of LINNs produce a
redundant multi-scale representation for denoising. The denoised image is
reconstructed using the inverse transform of LINNs with the denoised detail
channels and the original coarse channel. The simulation results show that the
proposed WINNet method is highly interpretable and has strong generalization
ability to unseen noise levels. It also achieves competitive results in the
non-blind/blind image denoising and in image deblurring.

options: from accelerators accessing off-chip memory directly, bypassing the
cache hierarchy, to accelerators having their own private cache. By running
real-size applications on FPGA-based prototypes of many-accelerator multi-core
SoCs, we show that the best cache-coherence mode for a given accelerator varies
at runtime, depending on the accelerator's characteristics, the workload size,
and the overall SoC status.
  Cohmeleon applies reinforcement learning to select the best coherence mode
for each accelerator dynamically at runtime, as opposed to statically at design
time. It makes these selections adaptively, by continuously observing the
system and measuring its performance. Cohmeleon is accelerator-agnostic,
architecture-independent, and it requires minimal hardware support. Cohmeleon

runtime solutions that are manually tuned for the target architecture.

alternative architectures of WFS are under consideration because there is a
tradeoff between detector size, speed, and noise that reduces the performance
of GSMT-ExAO wavefront control. One option under consideration for a GSMT-ExAO
wavefront sensor is a three-sided PWFS (3PWFS). The 3PWFS creates three copies
of the telescope pupil for wavefront sensing, compared to the conventional
four-sided PWFS (4PWFS) which uses four pupils. The 3PWFS uses fewer detector
pixels than the 4PWFS and should therefore be less sensitive to read noise.
Here we develop a mathematical formalism based on the diffraction theory
description of the Foucault knife edge test that predicts the intensity pattern
after the PWFS. Our formalism allows us to calculate the intensity in the pupil
images formed by the PWFS in the presence of phase errors corresponding to
arbitrary Fourier modes. We then use the Object Oriented MATLAB Adaptive Optics
toolbox (OOMAO) to simulate an end-to-end model of an adaptive optics system
using a PWFS with modulation and compare the performance of the 3PWFS to the
4PWFS. In the case of a low read noise detector, the Strehl ratios of the 3PWFS
and 4PWFS are within 0.01. When we included higher read noise in the
simulation, we found a Strehl ratio gain of 0.036 for the 3PWFS using Raw
Intensity over the 4PWFS using Slopes Maps at a stellar magnitude of 10. At the
same magnitude, the 4PWFS RI also outperformed the 4PWFS SM, but the gain was
only 0.012 Strehl. This is significant because 4PWFS using Slopes Maps is how
the PWFS is conventionally used for AO wavefront sensing. We have found that
the 3PWFS is a viable wavefront sensor that can fully reconstruct a wavefront
and produce a stable closed-loop with correction comparable to that of a 4PWFS,
with modestly better performance for high read-noise detectors.

We find sequential rationales by solving a combinatorial optimization: the best
rationale is the smallest subset of input tokens that would predict the same
output as the full sequence. Enumerating all subsets is intractable, so we
propose an efficient greedy algorithm to approximate this objective. The
algorithm, which is called greedy rationalization, applies to any model. For
this approach to be effective, the model should form compatible conditional
distributions when making predictions on incomplete subsets of the context.
This condition can be enforced with a short fine-tuning step. We study greedy
rationalization on language modeling and machine translation. Compared to
existing baselines, greedy rationalization is best at optimizing the
combinatorial objective and provides the most faithful rationales. On a new
dataset of annotated sequential rationales, greedy rationales are most similar

that in order to achieve the optimal error exponents, it suffices to consider
the empirical distributions of observed data sequences and encode them to the
transmission bits. With such a coding strategy, we develop a geometric approach
in the distribution spaces and establish an inner bound of error exponent

coding schemes for the following cases: (i) both nodes can transmit $\log_23$

and have values of surface gravity log g smaller than 3.5 dex. As in the case
of main-sequence (MS) stars, the intrinsic widths of loci of red giants are
also found to be quite narrow, a few mmag at maximum. There are however
systematic differences between the metallicity-dependent stellar loci of red
giants and MS stars. The colors of red giants are less sensitive to metallicity
than those of MS stars. With good photometry, photometric metallicities of red
giants can be reliably determined by fitting the u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z colors
simultaneously to an accuracy of 0.2 -- 0.25 dex, comparable to the precision
achievable with low-resolution spectroscopy for a signal-to-noise ratio of 10.

pixel-based representations of captured materials. In this paper, we present a
semi-automatic pipeline for general material proceduralization. Given
Spatially-Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (SVBRDFs)
represented as sets of pixel maps, our pipeline decomposes them into a tree of
sub-materials whose spatial distributions are encoded by their associated mask
maps. This semi-automatic decomposition of material maps progresses
hierarchically, driven by our new spectrum-aware material matting and
instance-based decomposition methods. Each decomposed sub-material is
proceduralized by a novel multi-layer noise model to capture local variations
at different scales. Spatial distributions of these sub-materials are modeled
either by a by-example inverse synthesis method recovering Point Process
Texture Basis Functions (PPTBF) or via random sampling. To reconstruct
procedural material maps, we propose a differentiable rendering-based
optimization that recomposes all generated procedures together to maximize the
similarity between our procedural models and the input material pixel maps. We
evaluate our pipeline on a variety of synthetic and real materials. We
demonstrate our method's capacity to process a wide range of material types,
eliminating the need for artist designed material graphs required in previous
work. As fully procedural models, our results expand to arbitrary resolution
and enable high level user control of appearance.

unimportant channels, channel pruning is considered as a special case of neural
architecture search in recent years. However, existing methods are either
complicated or prone to sub-optimal pruning. In this paper, we propose a
pruning framework that adaptively determines the number of each layer's

evaluate the importance of each block in the network based on the mean of the

allows to obtain pruned network quickly, accurately and efficiently, taking
into account both the structure and initialization weights. We prune the
currently popular CNN models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNetV2) on different image

directly predicts the probabilities for each frame as a boundary. However, the
performance of bottom-up model is inferior to the top-down counterpart as it
fails to exploit the segment-level interaction. In this paper, we propose an
Adaptive Proposal Generation Network (APGN) to maintain the segment-level

foreground-background classification upon the video and regress on the
foreground frames to adaptively generate proposals. In this way, the
handcrafted proposal design is discarded and the redundant proposals are
decreased. Then, a proposal consolidation module is further developed to
enhance the semantic of the generated proposals. Finally, we locate the target
moments with these generated proposals following the top-down framework.
Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks show that our proposed
APGN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

camera-tracklet-aware contrastive learning (CTACL) using the multi-camera

divides an unlabelled domain, i.e., entire vehicle images, into multiple
camera-level subdomains and conducts contrastive learning within and beyond the

defined using tracklet Ids of each camera. Additionally, the domain adaptation

compute driving decisions, and output control signals to the vehicles. To
smooth out the uncertainties brought by sensor outputs, they usually leverage
multi-sensor fusion (MSF) to fuse the sensor outputs and produce a more
reliable understanding of the surroundings. However, MSF cannot completely
eliminate the uncertainties since it lacks the knowledge about which sensor
provides the most accurate data and how to optimally integrate the data
provided by the sensors. As a result, critical consequences might happen
unexpectedly. In this work, we observed that the popular MSF methods in an
industry-grade ADAS can mislead the car control and result in serious safety
hazards. We define the failures (e.g., car crashes) caused by the faulty MSF as
fusion errors and develop a novel evolutionary-based domain-specific search
framework, FusED, for the efficient detection of fusion errors. We further
apply causality analysis to show that the found fusion errors are indeed caused
by the MSF method. We evaluate our framework on two widely used MSF methods in
two driving environments. Experimental results show that FusED identifies more

still difficult for RL to learn effective gaits from scratch, especially in
challenging tasks such as walking over the balance beam. To alleviate such
difficulty, we propose a novel RL-based approach that contains an evolutionary
foot trajectory generator. Unlike prior methods that use a fixed trajectory
generator, the generator continually optimizes the shape of the output
trajectory for the given task, providing diversified motion priors to guide the
policy learning. The policy is trained with reinforcement learning to output
residual control signals that fit different gaits. We then optimize the
trajectory generator and policy network alternatively to stabilize the training
and share the exploratory data to improve sample efficiency. As a result, our
approach can solve a range of challenging tasks in simulation by learning from

further verify the effectiveness of our approach, we deploy the controller
learned in the simulation on a 12-DoF quadrupedal robot, and it can

feedback explicitly. To alleviate selection bias due to the lack of feedback
loops in existing LRE learning paradigms, we developed a Gradient Imitation
Reinforcement Learning method to encourage pseudo label data to imitate the
gradient descent direction on labeled data and bootstrap its optimization
capability through trial and error. We also propose a framework called GradLRE,
which handles two major scenarios in low-resource relation extraction. Besides
the scenario where unlabeled data is sufficient, GradLRE handles the situation
where no unlabeled data is available, by exploiting a contextualized
augmentation method to generate data. Experimental results on two public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GradLRE on low resource relation
extraction when comparing with baselines.

with this, we propose a method that applies adversarial training to align two

to split the image into two regions (i.e., trusted and untrusted), which form
two distributions to align in the feature space. We term this approach
cross-region adaptation (CRA) to distinguish from the previous methods of
aligning different domain distributions, which we call cross-domain adaptation

Differential Equations (PDEs) in two spatial variables. PIEs are an algebraic
state-space representation of infinite-dimensional systems and have been used
to model 1D PDEs and time-delay systems without continuity constraints or
boundary conditions -- making these PIE representations amenable to stability
analysis using convex optimization. To extend the PIE framework to 2D PDEs, we
first construct an algebra of Partial Integral (PI) operators on the function
space L_2[x,y], providing formulae for composition, adjoint, and inversion. We
then extend this algebra to R^n x L_2[x] x L_2[y] x L_2[x,y] and demonstrate
that, for any suitable coupled, linear PDE in 2 spatial variables, there exists
an associated PIE whose solutions bijectively map to solutions of the original
PDE -- providing conversion formulae between these representations. Next, we
use positive matrices to parameterize the convex cone of 2D PI operators --
allowing us to optimize PI operators and solve Linear PI Inequality (LPI)
feasibility problems. Finally, we use the 2D LPI framework to provide
conditions for stability of 2D linear PDEs. We test these conditions on 2D heat

no conservatism.

phenomenon of self-interlocking structures takes place. A self-interlocking
structure is such a set of three-dimensional convex bodies with non-overlapping

In the present paper we discover a principally new phenomenon of 2-dimensional
self-interlocking structures: a family of 2-dimensional polygons in 3-space
where no infinitesimal move of any piece is possible. (Infinitely thin) tiles
are used to create {\em decahedra}, which, in turn, used to create columns,

work is the first appearance of the structure which is stable if we fix just
two tiles (and not all but one). Two-dimensional self-interlocking structures
naturally lead to three-dimensional structures possessing the same properties.

example when it appears in some applied problem, is known as the
\emph{Painlev\'e equivalence problem}, and the question that we consider here
is the Hamiltonian form of this problem. Making such identification explicit,
on the level of coordinate transformations, can be very helpful for an applied
problem, since it gives access to the wealth of known results about Painlev\'e
equations, such as the structure of the symmetry group, special solutions for
special values of the parameters, and so on. It can also provide an explicit

gives the mid-level features the primary role and the high-level features the
secondary role. In this paper, we reinterpret this widely employed approach by
redifining the roles of the multi-level features; we swap the primary and
secondary roles. Specifically, we regard that the current methods improve the
initial estimate generated from the high-level features using the mid-level
features. This reinterpretation suggests a new application of the current
methods: to apply the same network multiple times to iteratively update the
estimate of the object's region, starting from its initial estimate. Our
experiments show that this method is effective and has updated the previous
state-of-the-art on COCO-20$^i$ in the 1-shot and 5-shot settings and on
PASCAL-5$^i$ in the 1-shot setting.

in substructures and how dust growth may be favored or accelerated therein. We
use ALMA dust continuum observations of the Molecules with ALMA at
Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) disks and explore a large parameter space to
constrain the radial distribution of solid mass and maximum grain size in each
disk, including or excluding dust scattering. In the nonscattering model, the
dust surface density and maximum grain size profiles decrease from the inner
disks to the outer disks, with local maxima at the bright ring locations, as
expected from dust trapping models. The inferred maximum grain sizes from the
inner to outer disks decrease from ~1 cm to 1 mm. For IM Lup, HD 163296, and
MWC 480 in the scattering model, two solutions are compatible with their
observed inner disk emission: one solution corresponding to a maximum grain
size of a few millimeters (similar to the nonscattering model), and the other
corresponding to a few hundred micrometer sizes. Based on the estimated Toomre
parameter, only IM Lup -- which shows a prominent spiral morphology in
millimeter dust -- is found to be gravitationally unstable. The estimated
maximum Stokes number in all the disks lies between 0.01 and 0.3, and the
estimated turbulence parameters in the rings of AS 209 and HD 163296 are close
to the threshold where dust growth is limited by turbulent fragmentation. This
paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-3881/ac2148",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep near-infrared photometric surveys are efficient in identifying
high-redshift galaxies, however they can be prone to systematic errors in
photometric redshift. This is particularly salient when there is limited
sampling of key spectral features of a galaxy's spectral energy distribution
(SED), such as for quiescent galaxies where the expected age-sensitive
Balmer/4000 A break enter the $K$-band at $z>4$. With single filter sampling of
this spectral feature, degeneracies between SED models and redshift emerge. A
potential solution to this comes from splitting the $K$-band into multiple
filters. We use simulations to show an optimal solution is to add two
medium-band filters, $K_\mathrm{blue}$ ($\lambda_\mathrm{cen}$=2.06 $\mu$m,
$\Delta\lambda$=0.25 $\mu$m) and $K_\mathrm{red}$ ($\lambda_\mathrm{cen}$=2.31
$\mu$m, $\Delta\lambda$=0.27 $\mu$m), that are complementary to the existing
$K_\mathrm{s}$ filter. We test the impact of the $K$-band filters with
simulated catalogues comprised of galaxies with varying ages and
signal-to-noise. The results suggest that the $K$-band filters do improve
photometric redshift constraints on $z>4$ quiescent galaxies, increasing
precision and reducing outliers by up to 90$\%$. We find that the impact from
the $K$-band filters depends on the signal-to-noise, the redshift and the SED
of the galaxy. The filters we designed were built and used to conduct a pilot
of the FLAMINGOS-2 Extra-galactic Near-Infrared $K$-band Split (FENIKS) survey.
While no new $z>4$ quiescent galaxies are identified in the limited area pilot,
the $K_\mathrm{blue}$ and $K_\mathrm{red}$ filters indicate strong Balmer/4000
A breaks in existing candidates. Additionally we identify galaxies with strong
nebular emission lines, for which the $K$-band filters increase photometric
redshift precision and in some cases indicate extreme star-formation.

  Ranker",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pre-trained model such as BERT has been proved to be an effective tool for
dealing with Information Retrieval (IR) problems. Due to its inspiring
performance, it has been widely used to tackle with real-world IR problems such
as document ranking. Recently, researchers have found that selecting ""hard""
rather than ""random"" negative samples would be beneficial for fine-tuning
pre-trained models on ranking tasks. However, it remains elusive how to
leverage hard negative samples in a principled way. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy for document ranking,
namely Self-Involvement Ranker (SIR), to dynamically select hard negative
samples to construct high-quality semantic space for training a high-quality
ranking model. Specifically, SIR consists of sequential compressors implemented
with pre-trained models. Front compressor selects hard negative samples for
rear compressor. Moreover, SIR leverages supervisory signal to adaptively
adjust semantic space of negative samples. Finally, supervisory signal in rear
compressor is computed based on condition probability and thus can control
sample dynamic and further enhance the model performance. SIR is a lightweight
and general framework for pre-trained models, which simplifies the ranking
process in industry practice. We test our proposed solution on MS MARCO with
document ranking setting, and the results show that SIR can significantly
improve the ranking performance of various pre-trained models. Moreover, our
method became the new SOTA model anonymously on MS MARCO Document ranking

amounts of data that require accurate and real-time processing. Although
edge-based smart data processing can be enabled by deploying pretrained models,
the energy and memory constraints of edge devices necessitate distributed deep

propose a distributed AI system to exploit both the edge and the cloud for
training and inference. We propose a new architecture, MEANet, with a main
block, an extension block, and an adaptive block for the edge. The inference
process can terminate at either the main block, the extension block, or the
cloud. The MEANet is trained to categorize inputs into easy/hard/complex
classes. The main block identifies instances of easy/hard classes and
classifies easy classes with high confidence. Only data with high probabilities
of belonging to hard classes would be sent to the extension block for
prediction. Further, only if the neural network at the edge shows low
confidence in the prediction, the instance is considered complex and sent to
the cloud for further processing. The training technique lends to the majority
of inference on edge devices while going to the cloud only for a small set of
complex jobs, as determined by the edge. The performance of the proposed system
is evaluated via extensive experiments using modified models of ResNets and

propose to leverage harmony-aware learning for structure-enhanced pop music
generation. On the one hand, one of the participants of harmony, chord,
represents the harmonic set of multiple notes, which is integrated closely with
the spatial structure of music, the texture. On the other hand, the other
participant of harmony, chord progression, usually accompanies the development
of the music, which promotes the temporal structure of music, the form.
Moreover, when chords evolve into chord progression, the texture and form can
be bridged by the harmony naturally, which contributes to the joint learning of
the two structures. Furthermore, we propose the Harmony-Aware Hierarchical
Music Transformer (HAT), which can exploit the structure adaptively from the
music, and make the musical tokens interact hierarchically to enhance the
structure in multi-level musical elements. Experimental results reveal that
compared to the existing methods, HAT owns a much better understanding of the

  Independence",,,,,"cs.DS math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a framework for speeding up the time it takes to sample from
discrete distributions $\mu$ defined over subsets of size $k$ of a ground set
of $n$ elements, in the regime $k\ll n$. We show that having estimates of
marginals $\mathbb{P}_{S\sim \mu}[i\in S]$, the task of sampling from $\mu$ can
be reduced to sampling from distributions $\nu$ supported on size $k$ subsets
of a ground set of only $n^{1-\alpha}\cdot \operatorname{poly}(k)$ elements.
Here, $1/\alpha\in [1, k]$ is the parameter of entropic independence for $\mu$.
Further, the sparsified distributions $\nu$ are obtained by applying a sparse
(mostly $0$) external field to $\mu$, an operation that often retains
algorithmic tractability of sampling from $\nu$. This phenomenon, which we dub
domain sparsification, allows us to pay a one-time cost of estimating the
marginals of $\mu$, and in return reduce the amortized cost needed to produce
many samples from the distribution $\mu$, as is often needed in upstream tasks
such as counting and inference.
  For a wide range of distributions where $\alpha=\Omega(1)$, our result
reduces the domain size, and as a corollary, the cost-per-sample, by a
$\operatorname{poly}(n)$ factor. Examples include monomers in a monomer-dimer
system, non-symmetric determinantal point processes, and partition-constrained
Strongly Rayleigh measures. Our work significantly extends the reach of prior
work of Anari and Derezi\'nski who obtained domain sparsification for
distributions with a log-concave generating polynomial (corresponding to
$\alpha=1$). As a corollary of our new analysis techniques, we also obtain a
less stringent requirement on the accuracy of marginal estimates even for the
case of log-concave polynomials; roughly speaking, we show that constant-factor
approximation is enough for domain sparsification, improving over $O(1/k)$
relative error established in prior work.

underlying asset at a strike price by an expiration date. Standard exchanges
offer options of predetermined strike values and trade options of different
strikes independently, even for those written on the same underlying asset.
Such independent market design can introduce arbitrage opportunities and lead
to the thin market problem. The paper first proposes a mechanism that
consolidates and matches orders on standard options related to the same
underlying asset, while providing agents the flexibility to specify any custom
strike value. The mechanism generalizes the classic double auction, runs in
time polynomial to the number of orders, and poses no risk to the exchange,
regardless of the value of the underlying asset at expiration. Empirical
analysis on real-market options data shows that the mechanism can find new
matches for options of different strike prices and reduce bid-ask spreads.
  Extending standard options written on a single asset, we propose and define a
new derivative instrument -- combinatorial financial options that offer
contract holders the right to buy or sell any linear combination of multiple
underlying assets. We generalize our single-asset mechanism to match options
written on different combinations of assets, and prove that optimal clearing of
combinatorial financial options is coNP-hard. To facilitate market operations,
we propose an algorithm that finds the exact optimal match through iterative
constraint generation, and evaluate its performance on synthetically generated
combinatorial options markets of different scales. As option prices reveal the
market's collective belief of an underlying asset's future value, a
combinatorial options market enables the expression of aggregate belief about
future correlations among assets.

residual 1/f noise after the SVD mode subtraction is uncorrelated in frequency,

test existing defences has been used extensively to evaluate network security.
This is a time consuming process and requires in-depth knowledge for the
establishment of a strategy that resembles a real cyber-attack. This paper
presents a novel deep reinforcement learning architecture with hierarchically
structured agents called HA-DRL, which employs an algebraic action
decomposition strategy to address the large discrete action space of an
autonomous penetration testing simulator where the number of actions is
exponentially increased with the complexity of the designed cybersecurity
network. The proposed architecture is shown to find the optimal attacking
policy faster and more stably than a conventional deep Q-learning agent which
is commonly used as a method to apply artificial intelligence in automatic
penetration testing.

including energy efficiency and low latencies and challenges including the
non-differentiable nature of event spikes. Much of the initial research in this
area has converted deep neural networks to equivalent SNNs, but this conversion
approach potentially negates some of the advantages of SNN-based approaches
developed from scratch. One promising area for high-performance SNNs is
template matching and image recognition. This research introduces the first
high-performance SNN for the Visual Place Recognition (VPR) task: given a query
image, the SNN has to find the closest match out of a list of reference images.
At the core of this new system is a novel assignment scheme that implements a
form of ambiguity-informed salience, by up-weighting single-place-encoding
neurons and down-weighting ""ambiguous"" neurons that respond to multiple
different reference places. In a range of experiments on the challenging
Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, SPEDTest, Synthia, and St Lucia datasets, we show
that our SNN achieves comparable VPR performance to state-of-the-art and
classical techniques, and degrades gracefully in performance with an increasing

SNNs that can provide robust, energy-efficient, and low latency robot

design of a vaccination strategy to control a pandemic is an economic problem.
We use time-series and panel methods with real-world country-level data to
estimate effects on COVID-19 cases and deaths of two key elements of mass
vaccination - time between doses and vaccine type. We find that new infections
and deaths are both significantly negatively associated with the fraction of
the population vaccinated with at least one dose. Conditional on first-dose
coverage, an increased fraction with two doses appears to offer no further
reductions in new cases and deaths. For vaccines from China, however, we find
significant effects on both health outcomes only after two doses. Our results
support a policy of extending the interval between first and second doses of
vaccines developed in Europe and the US. As vaccination progresses, population
mobility increases, which partially offsets the direct effects of vaccination.
This suggests that non-pharmaceutical interventions remain important to contain
transmission as vaccination is rolled out.

N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratios at high resolution. DCN/HCN varies considerably
for different parts of the disks, ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$. In
particular, the inner disk regions generally show significantly lower HCN
deuteration compared with the outer disk. In addition, our analysis confirms
that two deuterium fractionation channels are active, which can alter the D/H
ratio within the pool of organic molecules. N$_2$D$^+$ is found in the cold
outer regions beyond $\sim$50 au, with N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ranging between

indispensable requirement for building high-quality conversational agents. In
order to generate better responses, some approaches have been proposed, such as
feeding extra information by collecting large-scale datasets with human
annotations, designing neural conversational models (NCMs) with complex
architecture and loss functions, or filtering out untrustworthy samples based
on a dialogue attribute, e.g., Relatedness or Genericness. In this paper, we
follow the third research branch and present a data filtering method for
open-domain dialogues, which identifies untrustworthy samples from training
data with a quality measure that linearly combines seven dialogue attributes.
The attribute weights are obtained via Bayesian Optimization (BayesOpt) that
aims to optimize an objective function for dialogue generation iteratively on
the validation set. Then we score training samples with the quality measure,
sort them in descending order, and filter out those at the bottom. Furthermore,
to accelerate the ""filter-train-evaluate"" iterations involved in BayesOpt on
large-scale datasets, we propose a training framework that integrates maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) and negative training method (NEG). The training
method updates parameters of a trained NCMs on two small sets with newly
maintained and removed samples, respectively. Specifically, MLE is applied to
maximize the log-likelihood of newly maintained samples, while NEG is used to
minimize the log-likelihood of newly removed ones. Experimental results on two
datasets show that our method can effectively identify untrustworthy samples,
and NCMs trained on the filtered datasets achieve better performance.

Firstly, we present a conceptual approach to integrate privacy into recommender
system simulations, whose key elements are privacy agents. These agents can
enhance users' profiles with different privacy preferences, e.g., their
inclination to disclose data to the recommender system. Plus, they can protect
users' privacy by guarding all actions that could be a threat to privacy. For
example, agents can prohibit a user's privacy-threatening actions or apply
privacy-enhancing techniques, e.g., Differential Privacy, to make actions less
threatening. Secondly, we identify three critical topics for future research in
privacy-aware recommender system simulations: (i) How could we model users'
privacy preferences and protect users from performing any privacy-threatening
actions? (ii) To what extent do privacy agents modify the users' document
preferences? (iii) How do privacy preferences and privacy protections impact
recommendations and privacy of others? Our conceptual privacy-aware simulation
approach makes it possible to investigate the impact of privacy preferences and
privacy protection on the micro-level, i.e., a single user, but also on the
macro-level, i.e., all recommender system users. With this work, we hope to
present perspectives on how privacy-aware simulations could be realized, such
that they enable researchers to study the dynamics of privacy within a
recommender system.

signatures through multiple transitions of HCO$^+$ and its metastable isomer
HOC$^+$ in the center of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 using data from the ALMA
large program ALCHEMI. The distribution of the HOC$^+$(1-0) integrated
intensity shows its association with ""superbubbles"", cavities created either by
supernovae or expanding HII regions. The observed HCO$^+$/HOC$^+$ abundance
ratios are $\sim 10-150$, and the fractional abundance of HOC$^+$ relative to
H$_2$ is $\sim 1.5\times 10^{-11} - 6\times 10^{-10}$, which implies that the
HOC$^+$ abundance in the center of NGC 253 is significantly higher than in
quiescent spiral-arm dark clouds in the Galaxy and the Galactic center clouds.
Comparison with chemical models implies either an interstellar radiation field
of $G_0\gtrsim 10^3$ if the maximum visual extinction is $\gtrsim 5$, or a
cosmic-ray ionization rate of $\zeta \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ (3-4 orders of
magnitude higher than that within clouds in the Galactic spiral-arms) to
reproduce the observed results. From the difference in formation routes of
HOC$^+$, we propose that a low-excitation line of HOC$^+$ traces cosmic-ray
dominated regions, while high-excitation lines trace photodissociation regions.
Our results suggest that the interstellar medium in the center of NGC 253 is
significantly affected by energy input from UV-photons and cosmic rays, sources

nodes represent positions and edges represent segments of roads. We study basic
properties of maps including their geometric consistency. Furthermore, we study
position refinement and segment abstraction relations allowing multilevel
representation from purely topological to detailed geometric. We progressively
define first order logics for modeling families of maps and distributions of
vehicles over maps. These are Configuration Logics, which in addition to the
usual logical connectives are equipped with a coalescing operator to build
configurations of models. We study their semantics and basic properties. We
illustrate their use for the specification of traffic rules and scenarios
characterizing sequences of scenes. We study various aspects of the validation
problem including run-time verification and satisfiability of specifications.
Finally, we show links of our framework with practical validation needs for ADS

their seeds in the initial density field. By monitoring the collapse and
virialisation of haloes, we derive from first principles and with no single

of simulations, but for the predicted fraction of accreted dDM, which is larger
than reported in previous works as they only count the dDM accreted onto the
final halo, not onto its progenitors. The derivation pursued here clarifies the
origin of some key features of substructure. Overall, our results demonstrate
that CUSP is a powerful tool for understanding halo substructure and extending
the results of simulations to haloes with arbitrary masses, redshifts and

control algorithms are used to eliminate some or all data anomalies at
different isolation levels to ensure data consistency. Isolation levels in the
current ANSI standard are defined by disallowing certain kinds of data
anomalies. Yet, the definitions of data anomalies in the ANSI standard are
controversial. On one hand, the definitions lack a mathematical formalization
and cause ambiguous interpretations. On the other hand, the definitions are
made in a case-by-case manner and lead to a situation that even a senior DBA
could not have infallible knowledge of data anomalies, due to a lack of a full
understanding of its nature. While revised definitions in existing literature
propose various mathematical formalizations to correct the former argument, how
to address the latter argument still remains an open problem. In this paper, we
present a general framework called Coo with the capability to systematically
define data anomalies. Under this framework, we show that existing reported
data anomalies are only a small portion. While we theoretically prove that Coo
is complete to mathematically formalize data anomalies, we employ a novel
method to classify infinite data anomalies. In addition, we use this framework
to define new isolation levels and quantitatively describe the concurrency and
rollback rate of mainstream concurrency control algorithms. These works show
that the C and I of ACID can be quantitatively analyzed based on all data

classification framework that takes both cognition and affect-based features
into consideration. A pre-features fusion-based framework that takes into
account: situation-based features from a regular snapshot of a trailer that
includes nouns and verbs providing the useful affect-based mapping with the
corresponding genres, dialogue (speech) based feature from audio, metadata
which together provides the relevant information for cognitive and affect based
video analysis. We also develop the English movie trailer dataset (EMTD), which
contains 2000 Hollywood movie trailers belonging to five popular genres:
Action, Romance, Comedy, Horror, and Science Fiction, and perform
cross-validation on the standard LMTD-9 dataset for validating the proposed

investigated how the formation of the Solar System may have affected the
composition and structure of the Sun, and whether it plays any role in solving
the solar abundance problem. We simulated the evolution of the Sun from the
protostellar phase to the present age and attempted to reproduce spectroscopic
and helioseismic constraints. We performed chi-squared tests to optimize our
input parameters. We confirmed that, for realistic models, planet formation
occurs when the solar convective zone is still massive; thus, the overall
changes due to planet formation are too small to significantly improve the
chi-square fits. We found that solar models with up-to-date abundances require
an opacity increase of 12% to 18% centered at $T=10^{6.4}$ K to reproduce the
available observational constraints. This is slightly higher than, but is
qualitatively in good agreement with, recent measurements of higher iron
opacities. These models result in better fits to the observations than those
using old abundances; therefore, they are a promising solution to the solar
abundance problem. Using these improved models, we found that planet formation
processes leave a small imprint in the solar core, whose metallicity is
enhanced by up to 5%. This result can be tested by accurately measuring the
solar neutrino flux. In the improved models, the protosolar molecular cloud
core is characterized by a primordial metallicity in the range 0.0127-0.0157

a series of radiative transfer calculations and synthetic observations of

kinematics within the disk may play a more significant role in heating the disk

simulation of disk formation, including heating sources associated with
gravitational instabilities, is able to generate the temperatures necessary to
explain the high fluxes observed in IRAS 16293B. Besides, the low spectral
index values are naturally reproduced by the high optical depth and high inner

borosilicate glass of photomultipliers, produce fast neutrons and prompt gamma
rays. If the shielding from the material to the detector target were not thick
enough, neutrons and gammas could enter the target volume and mimic
antineutrino signals. This paper revisits the yields and energy spectra of
neutrons produced in B$(\alpha,n)$N and F$(\alpha,n)$Na reactions. A Geant4
based simulation has been carried out using a simplified detector geometry for
the present generation reactor neutrino experiments. The background rates in
these experiments are estimated. If this background was not taken into account,
the value of the neutrino mixing angle $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ would be
underestimated. We recommend that Daya Bay, RENO, Double Chooz, and JUNO,
carefully examine the masses and radiopurity levels of detector materials that
are close to the target and rich in boron and fluorine.

paradigm in Natural Language Processing. Previous investigations prove that
introducing a further pre-training phase between pre-training and fine-tuning
phases to adapt the model on the domain-specific unlabeled data can bring
positive effects. However, most of these further pre-training works just keep
running the conventional pre-training task, e.g., masked language model, which
can be regarded as the domain adaptation to bridge the data distribution gap.
After observing diverse downstream tasks, we suggest that different tasks may
also need a further pre-training phase with appropriate training tasks to
bridge the task formulation gap. To investigate this, we carry out a study for
improving multiple task-oriented dialogue downstream tasks through designing
various tasks at the further pre-training phase. The experiment shows that
different downstream tasks prefer different further pre-training tasks, which
have intrinsic correlation and most further pre-training tasks significantly
improve certain target tasks rather than all. Our investigation indicates that
it is of great importance and effectiveness to design appropriate further
pre-training tasks modeling specific information that benefit downstream tasks.
Besides, we present multiple constructive empirical conclusions for enhancing

However, it
is often overlooked that most legislative bills are derived, or even directly
copied, from other bills. Despite the significance of bill-to-bill linkages for
understanding the legislative process, existing approaches fail to address
semantic similarities across bills, let alone reordering or paraphrasing which
are prevalent in legal document writing. In this paper, we overcome these
limitations by proposing a 5-class classification task that closely reflects
the nature of the bill generation process. In doing so, we construct a
human-labeled dataset of 4,721 bill-to-bill relationships at the
subsection-level and release this annotated dataset to the research community.
To augment the dataset, we generate synthetic data with varying degrees of
similarity, mimicking the complex bill writing process. We use BERT variants
and apply multi-stage training, sequentially fine-tuning our models with
synthetic and human-labeled datasets. We find that the predictive performance
significantly improves when training with both human-labeled and synthetic

similarities. Our analysis shows that the proposed methodology successfully
captures the similarities across legal documents at various levels of

scattering properties of the potential and enjoys an analog of the composition
property of its one-dimensional ancestor. Our results improve an earlier

of this approach requires the introduction of a pair of intertwined transfer
matrices each related to the time-evolution operator for an effective
non-unitary quantum system. We study the application of our findings in the
treatment of the scattering problem for delta-function potentials in two and

circumvents the singular terms appearing in the standard treatments of these

renewable and flexibility technologies in power sectors. In a model comparison,
we examine the optimal expansion of such technologies with six capacity
expansion power system models. The technologies under investigation include
base- and peak-load power plants, electricity storage, and transmission. We
define four highly simplified and harmonized use cases that focus on the
expansion of only one or two specific technologies to isolate their effects on
model results. We find that deviating assumptions on limited availability
factors of technologies cause technology-specific deviations between optimal
capacity expansion in models in almost all use cases. Fixed
energy-to-power-ratios of storage can entirely change model optimal expansion
outcomes, especially shifting the ratio between short- and long-duration
storage. Fixed initial and end storage levels can impact the seasonal use of
long-duration storage. Models with a pre-ordered dispatch structure
significantly deviate from linear optimization models, as limited foresight and
flexibility can lead to higher capacity investments. A simplified net transfer
capacity approach underestimates the need for grid infrastructure compared to a
more detailed direct current load flow approach. We further find deviations in
model results of optimal storage and transmission capacity expansion between
regions and link them to variable renewable energy generation and demand
characteristics. We expect that the general effects identified in our stylized

A response selection module is generally a scoring model to evaluate candidates

negative instances, especially that from random sampling methods, are mostly
irrelevant to the dialogue context and too easy to be fitted at the training

this way, our negative instances are fluent, context-related, and more
challenging for the model to learn, while can not be positive. Extensive

diagnosis of neurological diseases. Recently, deep learning methods for
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) have been proposed for the analysis of
brain MRI. These methods rely on healthy brain MRIs and eliminate the
requirement of pixel-wise annotated data compared to supervised deep learning.
While a wide range of methods for UAD have been proposed, these methods are
mostly 2D and only learn from MRI slices, disregarding that brain lesions are
inherently 3D and the spatial context of MRI volumes remains unexploited.
  Methods. We investigate whether using increased spatial context by using MRI
volumes combined with spatial erasing leads to improved unsupervised anomaly
segmentation performance compared to learning from slices. We evaluate and
compare 2D variational autoencoder (VAE) to their 3D counterpart, propose 3D
input erasing, and systemically study the impact of the data set size on the
performance.
  Results. Using two publicly available segmentation data sets for evaluation,
3D VAE outperform their 2D counterpart, highlighting the advantage of
volumetric context. Also, our 3D erasing methods allow for further performance
improvements. Our best performing 3D VAE with input erasing leads to an average
DICE score of 31.40% compared to 25.76% for the 2D VAE.
  Conclusions. We propose 3D deep learning methods for UAD in brain MRI
combined with 3D erasing and demonstrate that 3D methods clearly outperform
their 2D counterpart for anomaly segmentation. Also, our spatial erasing method
allows for further performance improvements and reduces the requirement for
large data sets.

labeled source domain for the unlabeled target domain. Since the data
distributions of the two domains are different, the model often performs poorly
on the target domain. Existing methods align the feature distributions of the
source and target domains and learn domain-invariant features to improve the
performance of the model. However, the features are usually aligned as a whole,
and the domain adaptation task fails to serve the classification, which will
ignore the class information and lead to misalignment.In this paper, we
investigate those features that should be used for domain alignment, introduce
prior knowledge to extract foreground features to guide the domain adaptation
task for classification tasks, and perform alignment in the local structure of
objects. We propose a method called Foreground Object Structure Transfer(FOST).
The key to FOST is the new clustering based condition, which combines the
relative position relationship of foreground objects. Based on this conditions,
FOST makes the data distribution of the same class more compact in geometry. In
practice, since the label of the target domain is not available, we use the
clustering information of the source domain to assign pseudo labels to the
target domain samples, and then according to the source domain data prior
knowledge guides those positive features to maximum the inter-class distance
between different classes and mimimum the intra-class distance. Extensive
experimental results on various benchmarks ($i.e.$ ImageCLEF-DA, Office-31,
Office-Home, Visda-2017) under different domain adaptation settings prove that
our FOST compares favorably against the existing state-of-the-art domain
adaptation methods.

searched for differences between individuals but also tried to identify
possible temporal changes among the drawings of one individual, Molly, who drew
almost 1,300 drawings from 2006 to 2016. A classical analysis of the drawings
was carried out after collecting quantitative and qualitative variables. Our
findings reveal evidence of differences in the drawing style of the five
individuals as well as creative changes in Molly's drawing style throughout her
lifetime. Individuals differed in terms of the colours used, the space they
filled but also the shapes (fan patterns, circles or loops) they drew. Molly
drew less and less as she grew older, and we found a significant difference
between drawings produced in winter, when orang-utans were kept inside and had
less activity, and those produced during other seasons. Our results suggest
that the drawing behaviour of these five orangutans is not random and that
differences among individuals might reflect differences of styles, states of
mind but also motivation to draw. These novel results are a significant
contribution to our understanding of how drawing behaviour evolved in hominids.

massive-massless shift, we study tree-level scattering amplitudes involving a
pair of massive vector bosons and an arbitrary number of gluons in the massive
spinor-helicity formalism. In particular, we derive compact expressions for
cases in which i) all gluons are of the same helicity and ii) one gluon has
flipped helicity and is colour adjacent to one of the massive particles. We
provide numerous consistency checks of our results including the exact match of
high energy limits with well-known MHV and NMHV amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills
theory. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative novel representation of the
NMHV amplitude.

  using Deep Transfer Learning","Accepted at CURAC 2021",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medulloblastoma (MB) is a primary central nervous system tumor and the most
common malignant brain cancer among children. Neuropathologists perform
microscopic inspection of histopathological tissue slides under a microscope to
assess the severity of the tumor. This is a time-consuming task and often
infused with observer variability. Recently, pre-trained convolutional neural
networks (CNN) have shown promising results for MB subtype classification.
Typically, high-resolution images are divided into smaller tiles for
classification, while the size of the tiles has not been systematically
evaluated. We study the impact of tile size and input strategy and classify the
two major histopathological subtypes-Classic and Demoplastic/Nodular. To this
end, we use recently proposed EfficientNets and evaluate tiles with increasing
size combined with various downsampling scales. Our results demonstrate using
large input tiles pixels followed by intermediate downsampling and patch
cropping significantly improves MB classification performance. Our
top-performing method achieves the AUC-ROC value of 90.90\% compared to 84.53\%
using the previous approach with smaller input tiles.

almost upper triangular if $U_{i,j}\geq 0\Rightarrow j\geq i-1$, so that the
increments of the corresponding Markov chains are at least $-1$; a transition

$L_{i,j}\geq 0\Rightarrow j\leq i+1$, and then, the increments of the
corresponding Markov chains are at most $+1$. In the present paper, we
characterize the recurrence, positive recurrence and invariant distribution for
the class of almost triangular transition matrices. The upper case appears to
be the simplest in many ways, with existence and uniqueness of invariant
measures, when in the lower case, existence as well as uniqueness are not
guaranteed. We present the time-reversal connection between upper and lower
almost triangular transition matrices, which provides classes of integrable
lower triangular transition matrices. These results encompass the case of birth
and death processes (BDP) that are famous Markov chains (or processes) taking
their values in $\mathbb{N}$, which are simultaneously almost upper and almost
lower triangular, and whose study has been initiated by Karlin & McGregor in
the 1950's. They found invariant measures, criteria for recurrence, null
recurrence, among others; their approach relies on some profound connections
they discovered between the theory of BDP, the spectral properties of their
transition matrices, the moment problem, and the theory of orthogonal
polynomials. Our approach is mainly combinatorial and uses elementary algebraic
methods; it is somehow more direct and does not use the same tools.

essential for autonomous robots, especially for solid-state LiDARs, where each
LiDAR unit has a very small Field-of-View (FoV), and multiple units are often
used collectively. The majority of extrinsic calibration methods are proposed
for 360$^\circ$ mechanical spinning LiDARs where the FoV overlap with other
LiDAR or camera sensors is assumed. Few research works have been focused on the
calibration of small FoV LiDARs and cameras nor on the improvement of the
calibration speed. In this work, we consider the problem of extrinsic
calibration among small FoV LiDARs and cameras, with the aim to shorten the
total calibration time and further improve the calibration precision. We first
implement an adaptive voxelization technique in the extraction and matching of
LiDAR feature points. Such a process could avoid the redundant creation of
$k$-d trees in LiDAR extrinsic calibration and extract LiDAR feature points in
a more reliable and fast manner than existing methods. We then formulate the
multiple LiDAR extrinsic calibration into a LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (BA)
problem. By deriving the cost function up to second-order, the solving time and
precision of the non-linear least square problem are further boosted. Our
proposed method has been verified on data collected in four targetless scenes
and under two types of solid-state LiDARs with a completely different scanning
pattern, density, and FoV. The robustness of our work has also been validated
under eight initial setups, with each setup containing 100 independent trials.
Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our work has increased the
calibration speed 15 times for LiDAR-LiDAR extrinsic calibration and 1.5 times
for LiDAR-Camera extrinsic calibration (averaged result from 50 independent
trials) while remaining accurate.

transition points in the bosonic system. In many previous jobs, the excitation
energy vanished at the critical point. It can be stated equivalently that
quantum critical point is obtained when the determinant of Hopfield-Bogoliubov

corresponding to the general quadratic Hamiltonian. For single-mode system the
appearance of the exceptional point in Hopfield-Bogoliubov matrix is equivalent
to the disappearance of the determinant of Hopfield-Bogoliubov matrix. However,
in multi-mode bosonic system, they are not equivalent except in some special
cases. For example, in the case of perfect symmetry, that is, swapping any two
subsystems and keeping the total Hamiltonian invariable, the exceptional point
and the degenerate point coincide all the time when the phase transition
occurs. When the exceptional point and the degenerate point do not coincide, we
find a significant result. With the increase of two-photon driving intensity,
the normal phase changes to the superradiant phase, then the superradiant phase
changes to the normal phase, and finally the normal phase changes to the

space around us in which we live, that we observe and/or imagine things within.
Many important features of language have spatial connotations, for example,
many prepositions (like in, next to, after, on, etc.) are fundamentally
spatial. Space is also a key factor of the meanings of many
words/phrases/sentences/text, and space is a, if not the key, context for
referencing (e.g. pointing) and embodiment.
  We propose a mechanism for how space and linguistic structure can be made to
interact in a matching compositional fashion. Examples include Cartesian space,
subway stations, chesspieces on a chess-board, and Penrose's staircase. The
starting point for our construction is the DisCoCat model of compositional
natural language meaning, which we relax to accommodate physical space. We
address the issue of having multiple agents/objects in a space, including the
case that each agent has different capabilities with respect to that space,
e.g., the specific moves each chesspiece can make, or the different velocities
one may be able to reach.
  Once our model is in place, we show how inferences drawing from the structure
of physical space can be made. We also how how linguistic model of space can
interact with other such models related to our senses and/or embodiment, such
as the conceptual spaces of colour, taste and smell, resulting in a rich
compositional model of meaning that is close to human experience and embodiment

  The discussion starts with a simplified model of computation and an

In particular, the sudden increase in X-ray flux during a flare penetrates down
to the lowest-lying D-region and dominates ionization at these altitudes
(60-100 km). Measurements of very low frequency (VLF: 3-30kHz) radio waves that
reflect at D-region altitudes provide a unique remote-sensing probe to
investigate the D-region response to solar flare emissions. Here, using a
combination of VLF amplitude measurements at 24kHz together with X-ray
observations from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES)
X-ray sensor, we present a large-scale statistical study of 334 solar flare
events and their impacts on the D-region over the past solar cycle. Focusing on
both GOES broadband X-ray channels, we investigate how the flare peak fluxes
and position on the solar disk dictate an ionospheric response and extend this
to investigate the characteristic time delay between incident X-ray flux and
the D-region response. We show that the VLF amplitude linearly correlates with
both the 1-8 A and 0.5-4 A channels, with correlation coefficients of 0.80 and
0.79, respectively. Unlike higher altitude ionospheric regions for which the
location of the flare on the solar disk affects the ionospheric response, we
find that the D-region response to solar flares does not depend on the flare
location. By comparing the time delays between the peak X-ray fluxes in both
GOES channels and VLF amplitudes, we find that there is an important difference
between the D-region response and the X-ray spectral band. We also demonstrate
for several flare events that show a negative time delay, the peak VLF
amplitude matches with the impulsive 25-50 keV hard X-ray fluxes measured by
the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI).

inappropriate to synthesize those studies without further investigation. In
this paper, we propose two Bayesian methods to detect outliers in a network

method uses Bayes factors to formally test each study against outliers while
the latter provides a score of outlyingness for each study in the network,

adapting reductions from centralized parameterized complexity, we prove lower

detecting cycles and patterns of treewidth 2 is hard.

detection is easy in CONGEST for any pattern graph. More specifically, we adapt
a centralized parameterized algorithm for a more general maximum common induced

specific for fermionic systems, namely the spin mapping (SM) with and without
including a Jordan-Wigner transformation, and the Li-Miller mapping (LMM). For
non-interacting systems, the inclusion of fermionic anti-symmetry through the
Jordan-Wigner transform does not lead to any improvement in the performance of
the mappings and instead it worsens the classical description. For an
interacting impurity model and for models of excitonic energy transfer, the MM
and LMM mappings perform similarly, and in some cases the former outperforms
the latter when compared to a full quantum description. The classical mappings
are able to capture interference effects, both constructive and destructive,
that originate from equivalent energy transfer pathways in the models.

gradient descent (GD) iterative algorithm to find the related stationary
points. We then propose a deep-unfolding neural network (NN), in which the
iterative GD algorithm is unfolded into a multi-layer structure wherein a set
of trainable parameters are introduced for accelerating the convergence and
enhancing the overall system performance. To implement the training stage, the
relationship between the gradients of adjacent layers is derived based on the
generalized chain rule (GCR). The deep-unfolding NN is developed for both

Furthermore, we analyze the transfer capability, computational complexity, and

challenges, such as being perceived as boring, repetitive, or irrelevant,

attempt to address these challenges, Agile practitioners have adopted teamwork,
innovation, and design techniques geared towards improving collaboration.
Additionally, they have developed their own activities to be used in Scrum
meetings, most notably for conducting retrospective and planning events. Design
thinking incorporates non-designers and designers in design and
conceptualization activities, including user research, ideation, or testing.
Accordingly, the design thinking approach provides a process with different

techniques can support shared understanding in teams and can improve
collaboration, creativity, and product understanding. For these reasons, design
thinking techniques represent a worthwhile addition to the Scrum meeting

classical theory for such regulation is drive reduction, where a function of
the difference between the current and the optimal internal state. The recently
introduced homeostatic regulated reinforcement learning theory (HRRL), by
defining within the framework of reinforcement learning a reward function based
on the internal state of the agent, makes the link between the theories of
drive reduction and reinforcement learning. The HRRL makes it possible to
explain multiple eating disorders. However, the lack of continuous change in
the internal state of the agent with the discrete-time modeling has been so far
a key shortcoming of the HRRL theory. Here, we propose an extension of the
homeostatic reinforcement learning theory to a continuous environment in space
and time, while maintaining the validity of the theoretical results and the
behaviors explained by the model in discrete time. Inspired by the
self-regulating mechanisms abundantly present in biology, we also introduce a
model for the dynamics of the agent internal state, requiring the agent to
continuously take actions to maintain homeostasis. Based on the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and function approximation with neural
networks, we derive a numerical scheme allowing the agent to learn directly how
its internal mechanism works, and to choose appropriate action policies via
reinforcement learning and an appropriate exploration of the environment. Our
numerical experiments show that the agent does indeed learn to behave in a way
that is beneficial to its survival in the environment, making our framework

benchmark, for which the only known results are $O(n^3)$ runtimes for several
classic evolutionary algorithms and an $O(n^2 \log n)$ runtime for an
estimation-of-distribution algorithm. Our finding that the unary unbiased
black-box complexity is only $O(n^2)$ suggests the Metropolis algorithm as an
interesting candidate and we prove that it solves the DLB problem in quadratic
time. Since we also prove that better runtimes cannot be obtained in the class
of unary unbiased algorithms, we shift our attention to algorithms that use the
information of more parents to generate new solutions. An artificial algorithm
of this type having an $O(n \log n)$ runtime leads to the result that the

regulates the inner-disk properties, such as the temperature and mass
distribution, and in turn, the physical conditions associated with planet
formation. The driving mechanism behind accretion remains uncertain; however,
one promising mechanism is the removal of a fraction of angular momentum via a
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind launched from the inner tens of
astronomical units of the disk. This paper utilizes CO isotopologue emission to
study the unique molecular outflow originating from the HD 163296
protoplanetary disk obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array. HD~163296 is one of the most well-studied Class II disks and is proposed
to host multiple gas-giant planets. We robustly detect the large-scale rotating
outflow in the 12CO J=2-1 and the 13CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 transitions. We
constrain the kinematics, the excitation temperature of the molecular gas, and
the mass-loss rate. The high ratio of the rates of ejection to accretion (5 -
50), together with the rotation signatures of the flow, provides solid evidence
for an MHD disk wind. We find that the angular momentum removal by the wind is
sufficient to drive accretion through the inner region of the disk; therefore,
accretion driven by turbulent viscosity is not required to explain HD~163296's
accretion. The low temperature of the molecular wind and its overall kinematics
suggest that the MHD disk wind could be perturbed and shocked by the previously
observed high-velocity atomic jet. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue

without compromising editability, we propose a distortion consultation approach

In the distortion consultation inversion (DCI), the distortion map is first
projected to a high-rate latent map, which then complements the basic low-rate
latent code with more details via consultation fusion. To achieve high-fidelity
editing, we propose an adaptive distortion alignment (ADA) module with a
self-supervised training scheme, which bridges the gap between the edited and

distributed algorithms, sequential greedy algorithms, dynamic algorithms, and
online algorithms. We introduce a new model of computing, called the
online-LOCAL model: the adversary reveals the nodes of the input graph one by
one, in the same way as in classical online algorithms, but for each new node
we get to see its radius-T neighborhood before choosing the output. We compare
the online-LOCAL model with three other models: the LOCAL model of distributed
computing, where each node produces its output based on its radius-T
neighborhood, its sequential counterpart SLOCAL, and the dynamic-LOCAL model,
where changes in the dynamic input graph only influence the radius-T
neighborhood of the point of change. The SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL models are
sandwiched between the LOCAL and online-LOCAL models, with LOCAL being the
weakest and online-LOCAL the strongest model. In general, all models are
distinct, but we study in particular locally checkable labeling problems
(LCLs), which is a family of graph problems studied in the context of
distributed graph algorithms. We prove that for LCL problems in paths, cycles,
and rooted trees, all models are roughly equivalent: the locality of any LCL
problem falls in the same broad class - $O(\log^* n)$, $\Theta(\log n)$, or
$n^{\Theta(1)}$ - in all four models. In particular, this result enables one to
generalize prior lower-bound results from the LOCAL model to all four models,
and it also allows one to simulate e.g. dynamic-LOCAL algorithms efficiently in
the LOCAL model. We also show that this equivalence does not hold in general
bipartite graphs. We provide an online-LOCAL algorithm with locality $O(\log
n)$ for the $3$-coloring problem in bipartite graphs - this is a problem with
locality $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ in the LOCAL model and $\Omega(n^{1/10})$ in the

critical approaching the magnetic phase transition. The presence of the

ordinary quantum mechanics) are considered. The focus is on a pedagogical
presentation of quantum field theory methods in a simpler context where many
exact results are available, but certain subtleties are discussed which may be
of interest to active researchers in higher dimensional field theories as well.
  Large $N$ methods are introduced in the context of the zero-dimensional path
integral and the connection to Stirling's series is shown. The entire spectrum
of the $O(N)$ model, which includes the familiar $l(l+1)$ eigenvalues of the
quantum rotor as a special case, is found both diagrammatically through large
$N$ methods and by using Ward identities. The large $N$ methods are already
exact at subleading order and the $\mathcal{O}\!\left(N^{-2}\right)$
corrections are explicitly shown to vanish. Peculiarities of gauge theories in
$d=1$ are discussed in the context of the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma model, and the
spectrum of a more general squashed sphere sigma model is found. The precise
connection between the $O(N)$ model and the linear sigma model with a $\phi^4$
interaction is discussed. A valid form of the self-consistent screening
approximation (SCSA) applicable to $O(N)$ models with a hard constraint is
presented. The point is made that at least in $d=1$ the SCSA may do worse than
simply truncating the large $N$ expansion to subleading order even for small
$N$. In both the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric versions of the $O(N)$
model, naive equations of motion relating vacuum expectation values are shown
to be corrected by regularization-dependent finite corrections arising from
contact terms associated to the equation of constraint.

solution of a problem to another while always maintaining feasibility, have
been extensively studied. Most research has dealt with the decision problem of
whether a reconfiguration schedule exists, and the complexity of finding one. A
prime example is the reconfiguration of vertex covers. We initiate the study of
batched vertex cover reconfiguration, which allows to reconfigure multiple
vertices concurrently while requiring that any adversarial reconfiguration
order within a batch maintains feasibility. The latter provides robustness,
e.g., if the simultaneous reconfiguration of a batch cannot be guaranteed. The
quality of a schedule is measured by the number of batches until all nodes are
reconfigured, and its cost, i.e., the maximum size of an intermediate vertex
cover.
  To set a baseline for batch reconfiguration, we show that for graphs
belonging to one of the classes $\{\mathsf{cycles, trees, forests, chordal,
cactus, even\text{-}hole\text{-}free, claw\text{-}free}\}$, there are schedules
that use $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$ batches and incur only a $1+\varepsilon$
multiplicative increase in cost over the best sequential schedules. Our main
contribution is to compute such batch schedules in $O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^*
n)$ distributed time, which we also show to be tight. Further, we show that
once we step out of these graph classes we face a very different situation.
There are graph classes on which no efficient distributed algorithm can obtain
the best (or almost best) existing schedule. Moreover, there are classes of
bounded degree graphs which do not admit any reconfiguration schedules without
incurring a large multiplicative increase in the cost at all.

on domain-specific text, e.g. working with financial or biomedical documents,

large-scale domain-specific multilingual pretraining data for such scenarios

pretraining with a focus on adapting to multiple languages within a specific

enable a language model to both become domain-specific and multilingual.
Evaluation on nine domain-specific datasets-for biomedical named entity

the general multilingual model, and performs close to its monolingual

Schuldenzucker et al. (2016) have shown that finding a weakly (or ""almost"")

study the complexity of finding a strongly (or ""near"") approximate solution,

over-smooth and over-sharp artifacts through the number of its connected
neighbors, and the patch-wise non-local correlations can enhance the message

situations can change the result of the match. Therefore players, coaches, and

or scoring a goal. This work proposes a new state representation for the soccer

network gets the contextual information of the situation and proposes the
optimal action to maximize the expected goal for the team. We performed
extensive numerical experiments on the soccer logs made by InStat for 104
European soccer matches. The results show that in all 104 games, the optimized
policy obtains higher rewards than its counterpart in the behavior policy.
Besides, our framework learns policies that are close to the expected behavior

actions such as foul, or ball out can be sometimes more rewarding than a shot
in specific situations.

algorithm, the identified elements are grouped to form regions; finally, every
file layout is represented as a graph and compared with others to find layout

of data becomes available and, it supports the phenomenal growth of artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques especially, deep learning (DL), in various
application domains. While the data sources become valuable assets for enabling
the success of autonomous decision-making, they also lead to critical
vulnerabilities in privacy and security. For example, data leakage can be
exploited via querying and eavesdropping in the exploratory phase for black-box
attacks against DL-based autonomous decision-making systems. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a novel data encryption method, called
AdvEncryption, by exploiting the principle of adversarial attacks. Different
from existing encryption technologies, the AdvEncryption method is not
developed to prevent attackers from exploiting the dataset. Instead, our
proposed method aims to trap the attackers in a misleading feature distillation
of the data. To achieve this goal, our AdvEncryption method consists of two
essential components: 1) an adversarial attack-inspired encryption mechanism to
encrypt the data with stealthy adversarial perturbation, and 2) a decryption
mechanism that minimizes the impact of the perturbations on the effectiveness
of autonomous decision making. In the performance evaluation section, we
evaluate the performance of our proposed AdvEncryption method through case
studies considering different scenarios.

$k$-MPMD problem. This problem considers a metric space with $n$ nodes.
Requests arrive at these nodes in an online fashion. The task is to match these
requests into sets of exactly $k$, such that the space and time cost of all
matched requests are minimized. The notion of the space cost requires a
definition of an underlying metric space that gives distances of subsets of $k$
elements. For $k>2$, the task of finding a suitable metric space is at the core
of our problem: We show that for some known generalizations to $k=3$ points,
such as the $2$-metric and the $D$-metric, there exists no competitive
randomized algorithm for the $3$-MPMD problem. The $G$-metrics are defined for
3 points and allows for a competitive algorithm for the $3$-MPMD problem. For
$k>3$ points, there exist two generalizations of the $G$-metrics known as $n$-
and $K$-metrics. We show that neither the $n$-metrics nor the $K$-metrics can
be used for the $k$-MPMD problem. On the positive side, we introduce the
$H$-metrics, the first metrics to allow for a solution of the $k$-MPMD problem
for all $k$. In order to devise an online algorithm for the $k$-MPMD problem on
the $H$-metrics, we embed the $H$-metric into trees with an $O(\log n)$
distortion. Based on this embedding result, we extend the algorithm proposed by

account) versus certainty-equivalence. Here we show how to bridge these
different formulations and propose a novel, direct, and regularized

least-square identification of state-space matrices followed by a nominal
model-based design, formalized as a bi-level program. We show how to transform
this problem into a single-level, regularized, and direct data-driven control
formulation, where the regularizer accounts for the least-square data fitting
criterion. For this novel formulation we carry out a robustness and performance
analysis in presence of noisy data. Our proposed direct and regularized
formulation is also amenable to be further blended with a
robust-stability-promoting regularizer. In a numerical case study we compare
regularizers promoting either robustness or certainty-equivalence, and we
demonstrate the remarkable performance when blending both of them.

filtering uses a Cholesky decomposition of the fluxes that ensures the entropy
stability of the scheme, which also includes a stable approximation of boundary
conditions for adiabatic walls. For turbulent flows, we test the method with
the three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex and show that energy is correctly
dissipated, and the scheme is stable when a kinetic energy preserving
split-form is used in combination with a low dissipation Riemann solver.
Finally, we test the shock capturing capabilities of our method with the
Shu-Osher and the supersonic forward facing step cases, obtaining good results
without spurious oscillations even with coarse meshes.

becoming more important to test the system as a whole. In the last decade,
tools and approaches have been proposed to automate the creation of
system-level test cases for these APIs using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). One
of the limiting factors of EAs is that the genetic operators (crossover and
mutation) are fully randomized, potentially breaking promising patterns in the
sequences of API requests discovered during the search. Breaking these patterns
has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the test case generation process.
To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new approach that uses
agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) to infer a linkage tree model,
which captures, replicates, and preserves these patterns in new test cases. We
evaluate our approach, called LT-MOSA, by performing an empirical study on 7
real-world benchmark applications w.r.t. branch coverage and real-fault
detection capability. We also compare LT-MOSA with the two existing
state-of-the-art white-box techniques (MIO, MOSA) for REST API testing. Our
results show that LT-MOSA achieves a statistically significant increase in test
target coverage (i.e., lines and branches) compared to MIO and MOSA in 4 and 5
out of 7 applications, respectively. Furthermore, LT-MOSA discovers 27 and 18
unique real-faults that are left undetected by MIO and MOSA, respectively.

  Lyapunov functions","Accepted for 60th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-triggered control (STC) is a well-established technique to reduce the
amount of samples for sampled-data systems, and is hence particularly useful
for Networked Control Systems. At each sampling instant, an STC mechanism
determines not only an updated control input but also when the next sample
should be taken. In this paper, a dynamic STC mechanism for nonlinear systems
is proposed. The mechanism incorporates a dynamic variable for determining the
next sampling instant. Such a dynamic variable for the trigger decision has
been proven to be a powerful tool for increasing sampling intervals in the
closely related concept of event-triggered control, but was so far not
exploited for STC. This gap is closed in this paper. For the proposed
mechanism, the dynamic variable is chosen to be the filtered values of the
Lyapunov function at past sampling instants. The next sampling instant is,
based on the dynamic variable and on hybrid Lyapunov function techniques,
chosen such that an average decrease of the Lyapunov function is ensured. The
proposed mechanism is illustrated with a numerical example from the literature.
For this example, the obtained sampling intervals are significantly larger than
for existing static STC mechanisms. This paper is the accepted version of [1],
containing also proofs of the main results.

free-streaming dynamics. To support practical simulations of hydrodynamics in
high-energy heavy-ion collisions, early-time attractor can be restored in a
mixture of the shear and the bulk viscous corrections, in which early-time

sub-foliation \Sigma^{ADM}_{d-1}=\Sigma_{d-3}\times\Sigma_2 of the
Arnowit--Deser--Misner leaves of d-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds {\cal M}_d.
\Sigma_2 stands for the sub-foliating randomly varying Riemann surfaces in
{\cal M}_d. The ""Beltrami d -bein"" associated to any given generic vielbein of
{\cal M}_d is systematically determined by a covariant gauge fixing of the
Lorentz~symmetry of the latter. It is parametrized by \frac{d(d+1)}2
independent fields belonging to different categories. Each one has a specific
interpretation. The Weyl invariant field sector of the Beltrami d-bein selects
the \frac{d(d-3)}{2} physical local degrees of freedom of d>2 dimensional
gravity. The components of the Beltrami d-bein are in a one to one
correspondence with those of the associated Beltrami d-dimensional metric. The
Beltrami parametrization of the Spin connection and of the Einstein action
delivers interesting expressions. Its use might easier the search of new Ricci
flat solutions classified by the genus of the sub-manifold \Sigma_2. A
gravitational ""physical gauge"" choice is introduced that takes advantage of the
geometrical specificities of the Beltrami parametrization. Further restrictions
simplify the expression of the Beltrami vielbein when {\cal M}_d has a given
spatial holonomy. This point is exemplified in the case of d=8 Lorentzian
spaces with G_2\subset SO(1,7) holonomy. The Lorentzian results presented in

automatic speech recognition (ASR), and a substantial part of NAR transformer
models is to use the casual mask to limit token dependencies. However, the
casual mask is designed for the left-to-right decoding process of the
non-parallel autoregressive (AR) transformer, which is inappropriate for the
parallel NAR transformer since it ignores the right-to-left contexts. Some
models are proposed to utilize right-to-left contexts with an extra decoder,
but these methods increase the model complexity. To tackle the above problems,
we propose a new non-autoregressive transformer with a unified bidirectional
decoder (NAT-UBD), which can simultaneously utilize left-to-right and
right-to-left contexts. However, direct use of bidirectional contexts will
cause information leakage, which means the decoder output can be affected by
the character information from the input of the same position. To avoid
information leakage, we propose a novel attention mask and modify vanilla
queries, keys, and values matrices for NAT-UBD. Experimental results verify
that NAT-UBD can achieve character error rates (CERs) of 5.0%/5.5% on the
Aishell1 dev/test sets, outperforming all previous NAR transformer models.
Moreover, NAT-UBD can run 49.8x faster than the AR transformer baseline when
decoding in a single step.

deformation is large, many variational models cannot ensure diffeomorphism. In
this paper, we propose a new registration model based on an optimal control
relaxation constraint for large deformation images, which can theoretically
guarantee that the registration mapping is diffeomorphic. We present an
analysis of optimal control relaxation for indirectly seeking the diffeomorphic
transformation of Jacobian determinant equation and its registration
applications, including the construction of diffeomorphic transformation as a
special space. We also provide an existence result for the control increment
optimization problem in the proposed diffeomorphic image registration model
with an optimal control relaxation. Furthermore, a fast iterative scheme based
on the augmented Lagrangian multipliers method (ALMM) is analyzed to solve the
control increment optimization problem, and a convergence analysis is followed.
Finally, a grid unfolding indicator is given, and a robust solving algorithm
for using the deformation correction and backtrack strategy is proposed to
guarantee that the solution is diffeomorphic. Numerical experiments show that
the registration model we proposed can not only get a diffeomorphic mapping

dynamic range (LDR) image as an ill-posed problem. This paper proposes a
luminance attentive network named LANet for HDR reconstruction from a single
LDR image. Our method is based on two fundamental observations: (1) HDR images
stored in relative luminance are scale-invariant, which means the HDR images
will hold the same information when multiplied by any positive real number.
Based on this observation, we propose a novel normalization method called "" HDR
calibration "" for HDR images stored in relative luminance, calibrating HDR
images into a similar luminance scale according to the LDR images. (2) The main
difference between HDR images and LDR images is in under-/over-exposed areas,
especially those highlighted. Following this observation, we propose a
luminance attention module with a two-stream structure for LANet to pay more
attention to the under-/over-exposed areas. In addition, we propose an extended
network called panoLANet for HDR panorama reconstruction from an LDR panorama
and build a dualnet structure for panoLANet to solve the distortion problem
caused by the equirectangular panorama. Extensive experiments show that our
proposed approach LANet can reconstruct visually convincing HDR images and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of all
metrics in inverse tone mapping. The image-based lighting application with our
proposed panoLANet also demonstrates that our method can simulate natural scene
lighting using only LDR panorama. Our source code is available at

alters their composition relative to previous stages of star formation. The
abundance ratio CN/HCN has long been proposed to trace the UV field in various
astrophysical objects, however to date the relationship between CN, HCN, and
the UV field in disks remains ambiguous. As part of the ALMA Large Program MAPS
(Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales), we present observations of CN
N=1-0 transitions at 0.3'' resolution towards five disk systems. All disks show
bright CN emission within $\sim$50-150 au, along with a diffuse emission shelf
extending up to 600 au. In all sources we find that the CN/HCN column density
ratio increases with disk radius from about unity to 100, likely tracing
increased UV penetration that enhances selective HCN photodissociation in the
outer disk. Additionally, multiple millimeter dust gaps and rings coincide with
peaks and troughs, respectively, in the CN/HCN ratio, implying that some
millimeter substructures are accompanied by changes to the UV penetration in
more elevated disk layers. That the CN/HCN ratio is generally high (>1) points
to a robust photochemistry shaping disk chemical compositions, and also means
that CN is the dominant carrier of the prebiotically interesting nitrile group
at most disk radii. We also find that the local column densities of CN and HCN
are positively correlated despite emitting from vertically stratified disk
regions, indicating that different disk layers are chemically linked. This

The three continuum nuclei have major-axis FWHM of $\sim$0.1$''$-0.3$''$
(20-140 pc) aligned to their rotating nuclear disks of molecular gas. However,
each nucleus is described better with two or three concentric components than
with a single Gaussian. The innermost cores have sizes of 0.05$''$-0.10$''$
(8-40 pc), peak brightness temperatures of ~100-500 K at 350 GHz, and more
fractional flux at lower frequencies. The intermediate components correspond to
the nuclear disks. They have axial ratios of $\approx$0.5 and hence
inclinations $\stackrel{>}{\sim} 60$ deg. The outermost elements include the
bipolar outflow from Arp 220W. We estimate 1 mm dust opacity of $\tau_{\rm
d,1mm} \approx 2.2$, $1.2$, and $\stackrel{<}{\sim} 0.4$ respectively for NGC

highly Compton thick.

ferroelectric polarization or not, is also investigated as a relevant

aspects, such as inducing build-in field (independent of ferroelectric
polarization) and exacerbating depolarization (intertwined with ferroelectric

annealing (extrinsic) and polarity-induced defect formation (intrinsic). This

Independent control over both inspiratory and expiratory resistances allows for
the simulation of obstructive breathing disorders through the whole spectrum of
FEV1/FVC spirometry ratios (used to classify COPD), ranging from healthy values
to values seen in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover,
waveform characteristics of breathing disorders, such as a change in
inspiratory duty cycle or peak flow are also observed in the waveforms
resulting from use of the artificial breathing disorder simulation apparatus.
Overall, the proposed apparatus provides us with a simple, effective and

growing research interests due to their promising performance and their
abilities on extracting triples from complex sentences. However, this kind of
methods are far from their full potential because most of them only focus on
using local features but ignore the global associations of relations and of
token pairs, which increases the possibility of overlooking some important
information during triple extraction. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a
global feature-oriented triple extraction model that makes full use of the
mentioned two kinds of global associations. Specifically, we first generate a
table feature for each relation. Then two kinds of global associations are
mined from the generated table features. Next, the mined global associations
are integrated into the table feature of each relation. This
""generate-mine-integrate"" process is performed multiple times so that the table
feature of each relation is refined step by step. Finally, each relation's
table is filled based on its refined table feature, and all triples linked to
this relation are extracted based on its filled table. We evaluate the proposed
model on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show our model is
effective and it achieves state-of-the-art results on all of these datasets.

eigenvalues of both the graph and its complement and take their product. Doing
so, we obtain a quantity that satisfies two basic properties that are the
expected for a measure of complexity. First,complexity of fully connected and
fully disconnected graphs vanish. Second, complexity of complementary graphs
coincide. This notion of complexity allows us to distinguish different kinds of
graphs by placing them in a ""croissant-shaped"" region of the plane link density
- complexity, highlighting some features like connectivity,concentration,
uniformity or regularity and existence of clique-like clusters. Indeed,
considering graphs with a fixed number of nodes, by plotting the link density
versus the complexity we find that graphs generated by different methods take
place at different regions of the plane. We consider some generated graphs, in
particular the Erd\""os-R\'enyi, the Watts-Strogatz and the Barab\'asi-Albert
models. Also, we place some particular, let us say deterministic, to wit,
lattices, stars, hyper-concentrated and cliques-containing graphs. It is worthy
noticing that these deterministic classical models of graphs depict the
boundary of the croissant-shaped region. Finally, as an application to graphs
generated by real measurements, we consider the brain connectivity graphs from
two epileptic patients obtained from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording,
both in a baseline period and in ictal periods .In this case, our definition of

corresponding Lorentz-invariant theory written in Hamiltonian form through the
same ""contraction"" procedure of taking the ultrarelativistic limit $c
\rightarrow 0$ where $c$ is the speed of light, but with two different
consistent rescalings of the canonical variables. This procedure can be applied
to general Lorentz-invariant theories ($p$-form gauge fields, higher spin free
theories etc) and has the advantage of providing explicitly an action principle
from which the electrically-contracted or magnetically-contracted dynamics
follow (and not just the equations of motion). Even though not manifestly so,
this Hamiltonian action principle is shown to be Carroll invariant. In the case
of $p$-forms, we construct explicitly an equivalent manifestly
Carroll-invariant action principle for each Carroll contraction. While the
manifestly covariant variational description of the electric contraction is
rather direct, the one for the magnetic contraction is more subtle and involves
an additional pure gauge field, whose elimination modifies the Carroll
transformations of the fields. We also treat gravity, which constitutes one of
the main motivations of our study, and for which we provide the two different

propose a dynamic client scheduling policy, called MRTP, for uploading local

client with the minimum remaining upload time. However, MRTP can lead to biased
participation of clients in the update process, resulting in performance
degradation in non-iid data scenarios. To overcome this, we propose two
alternative schemes with fairness considerations, termed as age-aware MRTP

clients are scheduled according to the ratio between their remaining
transmission time and the update age, while in OF-MRTP, the selection mechanism
utilizes the long term average channel rate of the clients to further reduce
the latency while ensuring fair participation of the clients. It is shown
through numerical simulations that OF-MRTP provides significant reduction in

many fields where data is structured as graphs (e.g., chemistry, recommender

networking, as graphs are intrinsically present at many levels (e.g., topology,
routing). The main novelty of GNNs is their ability to generalize to other
networks unseen during training, which is an essential feature for developing
practical Machine Learning (ML) solutions for networking. However, implementing
a functional GNN prototype is currently a cumbersome task that requires strong
skills in neural network programming. This poses an important barrier to
network engineers that often do not have the necessary ML expertise. In this
article, we present IGNNITION, a novel open-source framework that enables fast
prototyping of GNNs for networking systems. IGNNITION is based on an intuitive
high-level abstraction that hides the complexity behind GNNs, while still
offering great flexibility to build custom GNN architectures. To showcase the
versatility and performance of this framework, we implement two
state-of-the-art GNN models applied to different networking use cases. Our
results show that the GNN models produced by IGNNITION are equivalent in terms
of accuracy and performance to their native implementations in TensorFlow.

based on the fully inhomogeneous six vertex (ice type) model satisfying the
free fermion condition. Two families of symmetric rational functions
$F_\lambda,G_\lambda$ are defined as certain partition functions of the six
vertex model, with variables corresponding to row rapidities, and the labeling
signatures $\lambda=(\lambda_1\ge \ldots\ge \lambda_N)\in \mathbb{Z}^N$
encoding boundary conditions. These symmetric functions generalize Schur
symmetric polynomials, as well as some of their variations, such as factorial
and supersymmetric Schur polynomials. Cauchy type summation identities for
$F_\lambda,G_\lambda$ and their skew counterparts follow from the Yang-Baxter
equation. Using algebraic Bethe Ansatz, we obtain a double alternant type
formula for $F_\lambda$ and a Sergeev-Pragacz type formula for $G_\lambda$.
  In the spirit of the theory of Schur processes, we define probability
measures on sequences of signatures with probability weights proportional to
products of our symmetric functions. We show that these measures can be viewed
as determinantal point processes, and we express their correlation kernels in a
double contour integral form. We present two proofs: The first is a direct
computation of Eynard-Mehta type, and the second uses non-standard,
inhomogeneous versions of fermionic operators in a Fock space coming from the
algebraic Bethe Ansatz for the six vertex model.
  We also interpret our determinantal processes as random domino tilings of a
half-strip with inhomogeneous domino weights. In the bulk, we show that the
lattice asymptotic behavior of such domino tilings is described by a new
determinantal point process on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, which can be viewed as an
doubly-inhomogeneous generalization of the extended discrete sine process.

It is a challenging control problem due to the presence of significant sideslip

of drift maneuvers following circular paths with either fixed or moving
centers, subject to change in the tire-ground interaction, which are common
training tasks for drift enthusiasts and can therefore be used as benchmarks of
the performance of drift control. In order to achieve the above tasks, we
propose a novel hierarchical control architecture which decouples the curvature
and center control of the trajectory. In particular, an outer loop stabilizes
the center by tuning the target curvature, and an inner loop tracks the
curvature using a feedforward/feedback controller enhanced by an
$\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive component. The hierarchical architecture is flexible
because the inner loop is task-agnostic and adaptive to changes in tire-road
interaction, which allows the outer loop to be designed independent of
low-level dynamics, opening up the possibility of incorporating sophisticated
planning algorithms. We implement our control strategy on a simulation platform
as well as on a 1/10 scale Radio-Control~(RC) car, and both the simulation and

  synthesis",,,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The cross-speaker emotion transfer task in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis
particularly aims to synthesize speech for a target speaker with the emotion
transferred from reference speech recorded by another (source) speaker. During
the emotion transfer process, the identity information of the source speaker
could also affect the synthesized results, resulting in the issue of speaker
leakage. This paper proposes a new method with the aim to synthesize
controllable emotional expressive speech and meanwhile maintain the target
speaker's identity in the cross-speaker emotion TTS task. The proposed method
is a Tacotron2-based framework with emotion embedding as the conditioning
variable to provide emotion information. Two emotion disentangling modules are
contained in our method to 1) get speaker-irrelevant and emotion-discriminative
embedding, and 2) explicitly constrain the emotion and speaker identity of
synthetic speech to be that as expected. Moreover, we present an intuitive
method to control the emotion strength in the synthetic speech for the target
speaker. Specifically, the learned emotion embedding is adjusted with a
flexible scalar value, which allows controlling the emotion strength conveyed
by the embedding. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a Mandarin
disjoint corpus, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is able
to synthesize reasonable emotional speech for the target speaker. Compared to
the state-of-the-art reference embedding learned methods, our method gets the
best performance on the cross-speaker emotion transfer task, indicating that
our method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on learning the
speaker-irrelevant emotion embedding. Furthermore, the strength ranking test
and pitch trajectories plots demonstrate that the proposed method can
effectively control the emotion strength, leading to prosody-diverse synthetic
speech.

higher-derivative operators and (B) deviates from the $N$-body results from the
Fourier wavenumber smaller than real space $k_{\rm max}$. Finally, we have

SFRs and stellar masses are consensus estimates based on a combination of four
different SED fitting methods. We note a flattening of radio spectra of a
substantial minority of sources below $\sim 1.4 $ GHz. Such sources have thus a
lower ""radio-loudness"" level at 150 MHz than expected from extrapolations from
1.4 GHz using the average spectral index. We found a weak trend towards a lower
$\hbox{SFR}/L_{150 \rm MHz}$ ratio for higher stellar mass, $M_\star$. We argue
that such a trend may account for most of the apparent redshift evolution of
the $L_{150 \rm MHz}/\hbox{SFR}$ ratio, in line with previous work. Our data
indicate a weaker evolution than found by some previous analyses. We also find
a weaker evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate than found
by several (but not all) previous studies. Our radio selection provides a view
of the distribution of galaxies in the $\hbox{SFR}$-$M_\star$ plane
complementary to that of optical/near-IR selection. It suggests a higher
uniformity of the star formation history of galaxies than implied by some
analyses of optical/near-IR data. We have derived luminosity functions at 150
MHz of both SFGs and radio-quiet (RQ) AGN at various redshifts. Our results are
in very good agreement with the T-RECS simulations and with literature

where the future return is correlated with the historical stock prices in
pre-designed modes, namely the curve-shape-feature (CSF) and the
non-curve-shape-feature (NCSF) modes. In the CSF mode, the future return can be
extracted from the curve shapes of the historical stock prices. By applying
various kinds of existing algorithms on those pre-designed time series and real

That is, the future return is not mainly correlated with the historical stock
prices in the CSF mode. (2) Various kinds of existing machine learning
algorithms are good at extracting the curveshape features in the historical

In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive information-seeking strategy for

where three types of retrieval operations (e.g., BM25, DPR, and hyperlink) and
one answer operation are defined as actions. According to the learned policy,
AISO could adaptively select a proper retrieval action to seek the missing
evidence at each step, based on the collected evidence and the reformulated
query, or directly output the answer when the evidence set is sufficient for
the question. Experiments on SQuAD Open and HotpotQA fullwiki, which serve as
single-hop and multi-hop open-domain QA benchmarks, show that AISO outperforms
all baseline methods with predefined strategies in terms of both retrieval and

Study, in this paper we study the effect of a comprehensive set of covariates
on children's emotional and behavioural trajectories in England. To this end,
we develop a Quantile Mixed Hidden Markov Model for joint estimation of
multiple quantiles in a linear regression setting for multivariate longitudinal
data. The novelty of the proposed approach is based on the Multivariate
Asymmetric Laplace distribution which allows to jointly estimate the quantiles
of the univariate conditional distributions of a multivariate response,
accounting for possible correlation between the outcomes. Sources of unobserved
heterogeneity and serial dependency due to repeated measures are modeled
through the introduction of individual-specific, time-constant random
coefficients and time-varying parameters evolving over time with a Markovian
structure, respectively. The inferential approach is carried out through the
construction of a suitable Expectation-Maximization algorithm without
parametric assumptions on the random effects distribution.

this fairly, that is, your friend and you should each get exactly half of each

  It was recently shown using topological methods that $n$ cuts always suffice.
In this work, we study the computational complexity of finding such $n$ cuts.
Our main result is that this problem is PPA-complete when the ingredients are
represented as point sets. For this, we give a new proof that for point sets
$n$ cuts suffice, which does not use any topological methods.
  We further prove several hardness results as well as a higher-dimensional
variant for the case where the ingredients are well-separated.

an eclipsing black widow (BW) pulsar, J1853$-$0842A, found by high-sensitivity
searches using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. This
2.15 ms pulsar is in a 3.56 hr compact circular orbit with a very low mass
companion likely of mass 0.018 to 0.036 $M_{\rm \odot}$ and exhibits eclipsing
of the pulsar signal. Though the distance to PSR J1853$-$0842A predicted from
its dispersion measure ($155.125 \pm 0.004$ cm$^{-3}$ pc) and Galactic free
electron density models are about 30\% smaller than that of NGC 6712 obtained
from interstellar reddening measurements, this is likely due to limited
knowledge about the spiral arms and Scutum stellar cloud in this direction.
Follow-up timing observations spanning 445 days allow us to localize the
pulsar's position to be 0.14 core radii from the center of NGC 6712 and measure
a negative spin-down rate for this pulsar of $-2.39(2)\times10^{-21}\rm s
s^{-1}$. The latter cannot be explained without the acceleration of the GC and
decisively supports the association between PSR J1853--0842A and NGC 6712.
Considering the maximum GC acceleration, Galactic acceleration, and Shklovskii
effect, we place an upper limit on the intrinsic spin-down rate to be
$1.11\times10^{-20}\rm~s~s^{-1}$. From an analysis of the eclipsing
observations, we estimate the electron density of the eclipse region to be
about $1.88\times10^6\rm cm^{-3}$. We also place an upper limit of the
accretion rate from the companion is about $3.05\times10^{-13}~M_{\rm
\odot}\rm~yr^{-1}$ which is comparable with some other BWs.

  products",,,,,"math.CO cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A $k$-matching $M$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $M\subseteq E$ such that
each connected component in the subgraph $F = (V,M)$ of $G$ is either a
single-vertex graph or $k$-regular, i.e., each vertex has degree $k$. In this
contribution, we are interested in $k$-matchings within the four standard graph
products: the Cartesian, strong, direct and lexicographic product.
  As we shall see, the problem of finding non-empty $k$-matchings ($k\geq 3$)
in graph products is NP-complete. Due to the general intractability of this
problem, we focus on distinct polynomial-time constructions of $k$-matchings in
a graph product $G\star H$ that are based on $k_G$-matchings $M_G$ and
$k_H$-matchings $M_H$ of its factors $G$ and $H$, respectively. In particular,
we are interested in properties of the factors that have to be satisfied such
that these constructions yield a maximum $k$-matching in the respective
products. Such constructions are also called ""well-behaved"" and we provide
several characterizations for this type of $k$-matchings.
  Our specific constructions of $k$-matchings in graph products satisfy the
property of being weak-homomorphism preserving, i.e., constructed matched edges
in the product are never ""projected"" to unmatched edges in the factors. This
leads to the concept of weak-homomorphism preserving $k$-matchings. Although
the specific $k$-matchings constructed here are not always maximum
$k$-matchings of the products, they have always maximum size among all
weak-homomorphism preserving $k$-matchings. Not all weak-homomorphism
preserving $k$-matchings, however, can be constructed in our manner. We will,
therefore, determine the size of maximum-sized elements among all
weak-homomorphims preserving $k$-matching within the respective graph products,
provided that the matchings in the factors satisfy some general assumptions.

developed neural mass model that takes short-term synaptic plasticity into
account. The one being used here is particularly important, as it represents an
exact meanfield limit of synaptically coupled quadratic integrate & fire
neurons, a canonical model for type I excitability. In absence of synaptic
dynamics, a periodic external current with a slow frequency {\epsilon} can lead
to burst-like dynamics. The firing patterns can be understood using techniques
of singular perturbation theory, specifically slow-fast dissection. In the
model with synaptic dynamics the separation of timescales leads to a variety of
slow-fast phenomena and their role for bursting is rendered inordinately more
intricate. Canards are one of the main slow-fast elements on the route to
bursting. They describe trajectories evolving nearby otherwise repelling
locally invariant sets of the system and are found in the transition region
from subthreshold dynamics to bursting. For values of the timescale separation
nearby the singular limit {\epsilon} = 0, we report peculiar jump-on canards,
which block a continuous transition to bursting. In the biologically more
plausible regime of {\epsilon} this transition becomes continuous and bursts
emerge via consecutive spike-adding transitions. The onset of bursting is of
complex nature and involves mixed-type like torus canards, which form the very
first spikes of the burst and revolve nearby fast-subsystem repelling limit
cycles. We provide numerical evidence for the same mechanisms to be responsible
for the emergence of bursting in the quadratic integrate & fire network with
plastic synapses. The main conclusions apply for the network, owing to the
exactness of the meanfield limit.

prospective use of experts beliefs in choosing between survival models in

beliefs is discussed. A process for prospectively quantifying prior beliefs
about model parameters in five standard models is described. Statistical
criterion for comparing models, and the interpretation and computation of model
probabilities is discussed. A case study is provided. Results: Experts have
little difficulty in expressing their posterior beliefs. Information criterion
is an approximation to Bayesian model evidence and is based on data alone. In
contrast, Bayes factors measure evidence in the data and makes use of prior
information. When model averaging is of interest, there is no unique way to
specify prior ignorance about model probabilities. Formulating and interpreting
weights of similar models should acknowledge the dilution phenomenon such that
highly correlated models are given smaller weights than those with low
correlation. Conclusion: The retrospective use of experts beliefs to validate a
model is potentially misleading, may not achieve its intended objective and is
an inefficient use of information. Experts beliefs should be elicited
prospectively as probability distributions to strengthen inferences, facilitate
the choice of model, and mitigate the impact of dilution on model probabilities
in situations when model averaging is of interest.

given black-box Boolean function has a particular given property or is
$\varepsilon$-far from having that property. We investigate here several types
of properties testing for Boolean functions (identity, correlations and
balancedness) using the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (for the Deutsch-Jozsa (D-J)
problem) and also the amplitude amplification technique.
  At first, we study here a particular testing problem: namely whether a given
Boolean function $f$, of $n$ variables, is identical with a given function $g$
or is $\varepsilon$-far from $g$, where $\varepsilon$ is the parameter. We
present a one-sided error quantum algorithm to deal with this problem that has
the query complexity $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$. Moreover, we show that
our quantum algorithm is optimal. Afterwards we show that the classical
randomized query complexity of this problem is $\Theta(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$.
Secondly, we consider the D-J problem from the perspective of functional
correlations and let $C(f,g)$ denote the correlation of $f$ and $g$. We propose
an exact quantum algorithm for making distinction between
$|C(f,g)|=\varepsilon$ and $|C(f,g)|=1$ using six queries, while the classical
deterministic query complexity for this problem is $\Theta(2^{n})$ queries.
Finally, we propose a one-sided error quantum query algorithm for testing
whether one Boolean function is balanced versus $\varepsilon$-far balanced
using $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ queries. We also prove here that our quantum
algorithm for balancedness testing is optimal. At the same time, for this
balancedness testing problem we present a classical randomized algorithm with
query complexity of $O(1/\varepsilon^{2})$. Also this randomized algorithm is
optimal. Besides, we link the problems considered here together and generalize
them to the general case.

such as parametric amplifiers, soliton frequency combs, supercontinua, and
non-reciprocal devices. Ultralow optical loss and the capability for dispersion
engineering are essential, which necessitate the use of multi-mode waveguides.
Despite that rich interaction among different spatial waveguide eigenmodes can
give rise to novel nonlinear phenomena, spatial mode interaction is typically
undesired as it increases optical loss, perturbs local dispersion profile, and
impedes soliton formation. Adiabatic bends, such as Euler bends whose curvature
varies linearly with their path length, have been favoured to suppress spatial
mode interaction. Adiabatic bends can essentially connect any two waveguide
segments with adiabatic mode conversion, thus efficiently avoid mode mixing due
to mode mismatch. However, previous works lack quantitative measurement data
and analysis to fairly evaluate the adiabaticity, and are not based on photonic
integrated circuits with tight optical confinement and optical losses of few
dB/m. Here, we adapt, optimize, and implement Euler bends to build compact
racetrack microresonators based on ultralow-loss, multi-mode, silicon nitride
photonic integrated circuits. The racetrack microresonators feature a small
footprint of only 0.21 mm^2 for 19.8 GHz FSR. We quantitatively investigate the
suppression of spatial mode interaction in the racetrack microresonators with
Euler bends. We show that the optical loss rate (15.5 MHz) is preserved, on par
with the mode interaction strength (25 MHz). This results in an unperturbed
microresonator dispersion profile. We further demonstrate single soliton of
19.8 GHz repetition rate. The optimized Euler bends and racetrack
microresonators can be key building blocks for integrated nonlinear photonic
systems, programmable processors and photonic quantum computing.

influence of the base elements on the deformation behavior, high-temperature
compressive creep experiments were performed on a single crystal alloy series
that was designed to exhibit a varying Co/Ni ratio and a constant Al, W and Cr
content. Creep tests were performed at 900 {\deg}C and 250 MPa and the
resulting microstructures and defect configurations were characterized via
electron microscopy. The minimum creep rates differ by more than one order of
magnitude with changing Co/Ni ratio. An intermediate CoNi-base alloy exhibits
the overall highest creep strength. Several strengthening contributions like
solid solution strengthening of the $\gamma$ phase, effective diffusion
coefficients or stacking fault energies were quantified. Precipitate shearing
mechanisms differ significantly when the base element content is varied. While
the Ni-rich superalloys exhibit SISF and SESF shearing, the Co-rich alloys
develop extended APBs when the $\gamma^\prime$ phase is cut. This is mainly
attributed to a difference in planar fault energies, caused by a changing
segregation behavior. As result, it is assumed that the shearing resistivity

crucial for the creep properties of the investigated alloy series.

vulnerability of such deep detection models against adversarial attacks is

the adversary generates a new post to fool the classifier. We propose a novel

simultaneously reduces the efficacy of the detection model and generates posts
that have several key desirable properties. Specifically, PETGEN generates
posts that are personalized to the user's writing style, have knowledge about a

context, and encapsulate the user's recent topical interests. We conduct
extensive experiments on two real-world datasets (Yelp and Wikipedia, both with

performance of popular deep user sequence embedding-based classification

controllable Hilbert space with a long coherence time, which we predict
translates into a high number of entangled photons and states with a high bond

generalization of this platform, in which several cavity-qubit pairs are
coupled to form a chain. The photonic states thus produced feature a
two-dimensional entanglement structure and can be interpreted as

$SU(N)$-transversally elliptic operators, we derive an explicit cohomological
index formula in de Rham cohomology. Once this is done, we define and compute
the index of families of projective Dirac operators. As a second application of
our computation of the index of families of $\tilde{G}$-transversally elliptic

challenges of both theoretical and numerical analysis lie in the limited
smoothing properties due to the fractional differential operator and high
degree of nonlinearity of the forward map from the unknown diffusion
coefficient to the distributed observation. We establish two conditional
stability results using a novel test function, which leads to a stability bound
in $L^2(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ under a suitable positivity condition. The positivity
condition is verified for a large class of problem data. Numerically, we
develop a rigorous procedure for recovering the diffusion coefficient based on
a regularized least-squares formulation, which is then discretized by the
standard Galerkin method with continuous piecewise linear elements in space and
backward Euler convolution quadrature in time. We provide a complete error
analysis of the fully discrete formulation, by combining several new error
estimates for the direct problem (optimal in terms of data regularity), a
discrete version of fractional maximal $L^p$ regularity, and a nonstandard

The destruction of Anderson localization by nonlinearity and the recovery of
ergodicity after long enough computational times lead to more questions. This
thesis is devoted to contributing to the insight of the nonlinear system
dynamics in and out of equilibrium. Focusing mainly on the GP lattice, we
investigated elementary fluctuations close to zero temperature, localization
properties, the chaotic subdiffusive regimes, and the non-equipartition of
energy in non-Gibbs regime.
  Initially, we probe equilibrium dynamics in the ordered GP lattice and report
a weakly non-ergodic dynamics, and an ergodic part in the non-Gibbs phase that
implies the Gibbs distribution should be modified. Next, we include disorder in
GP lattice, and build analytical expressions for the thermodynamic properties
of the ground state, and identify a Lifshits glass regime where disorder
dominates over the interactions. In the opposite strong interaction regime, we
investigate the elementary excitations above the ground state and found a
dramatic increase of the localization length of Bogoliubov modes (BM) with
increasing particle density. Finally, we study non-equilibrium dynamics with
disordered GP lattice by performing novel energy and norm density resolved wave

$0.25\text{deg}^2$. For the simulated astrophysical distribution, this upper
limit is $91.79\text{deg}^2$. If the Einstein Telescope-like detector in
Australia is replaced with a Cosmic Explorer-like detector(1ET2CE), for
$200\text{Mpc}$ case, the upper limit is $0.18\text{deg}^2$, while for
astrophysical distribution, it is $56.77\text{deg}^2$. We note that the 1ET2CE
network can detect 7.2% more of the simulated astrophysical population than the
2ET1CE network. In terms of early warning performance, we find that a network
of 2ET1CE and 1ET2CE networks can both provide early warnings of the order of 1
hour prior to merger with sky localization uncertainties of 30 square degrees
or less. Our study concludes that the 1ET2CE network is a good compromise
between binary neutron stars detection rate, sky localization and early warning
capabilities.

part of urban transportation. After a passenger is matched up with a driver by
the platform, both the passenger and the driver have the freedom to simply
accept or cancel a ride with one click. Hence, accurately predicting whether a
passenger-driver pair is a good match turns out to be crucial for ride-hailing
platforms to devise instant order assignments. However, since the users of
ride-hailing platforms consist of two parties, decision-making needs to
simultaneously account for the dynamics from both the driver and the passenger
sides. This makes it more challenging than traditional online advertising
tasks. Moreover, the amount of available data is severely imbalanced across
different cities, creating difficulties for training an accurate model for
smaller cities with scarce data. Though a sophisticated neural network
architecture can help improve the prediction accuracy under data scarcity, the
overly complex design will impede the model's capacity of delivering timely
predictions in a production environment. In the paper, to accurately predict
the MSR of passenger-driver, we propose the Multi-View model (MV) which
comprehensively learns the interactions among the dynamic features of the
passenger, driver, trip order, as well as context. Regarding the data imbalance
problem, we further design the Knowledge Distillation framework (KD) to
supplement the model's predictive power for smaller cities using the knowledge
from cities with denser data and also generate a simple model to support
efficient deployment. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world

In contrast, we aim to learn an efficient Pareto classifier to simplify the

state-of-the-art approaches on widely-used benchmark datasets, and experimental
results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other approaches and

generalizations of the category of quasi-Borel spaces, where we now allow for
general sample spaces and less restrictive random variables, spaces and maps.
We show that each category of quasi-measurable spaces is bi-complete and
cartesian closed. We also introduce several different strong probability
monads. Together these constructions provide convenient categories for higher
probability theory that also support semantics of higher-order probabilistic
programming languages in the same way as the category of quasi-Borel spaces
does.
  An important special case is the category of quasi-universal spaces, where
the sample space is the set of the real numbers together with the sigma-algebra
of all universally measurable subsets. The induced sigma-algebras on those
quasi-universal spaces then have explicit descriptions in terms of
intersections of Lebesgue-complete sigma-algebras. A central role is then
played by countably separated and universal quasi-universal spaces, which
replace the role of standard Borel spaces. We prove in this setting a Fubini
theorem, a disintegration theorem for Markov kernels, a Kolmogorov extension
theorem and a conditional de Finetti theorem. We also translate our findings
into properties of the corresponding Markov category of Markov kernels between
universal quasi-universal spaces.
  Furthermore, we formalize causal Bayesian networks in terms of
quasi-universal spaces and prove a global Markov property. For this we
translate the notion of transitional conditional independence into this setting

about conditional independence relations between variables and causal
mechanisms on equal footing. Finally, we also highlight how one can use
exponential objects and random functions for counterfactual reasoning.

optimized (amplitude and phase) RIS design in a point-to-point multipath MIMO
link and study the impact on link capacity under the assumption of perfect
channel state information at the transmitter (TX), receiver (RX) and RIS.
Specifically, we propose RIS design based on the maximization of the trace of
the composite TX-RIS-RX link matrix which is a measure of the average power at
the RX. We propose two RIS designs: a diagonal RIS matrix, and a general RIS
matrix representing a more advanced architecture. The optimum design, in both
cases, corresponds to calculating the dominant eigenvector of certain Hermitian
matrices induced by the component channel matrices. We illustrate the capacity
performance of the optimized RIS designs and compare them to a baseline design
(random amplitudes and phases) and a recently proposed low-complexity
phase-only design. We present results for sparse and rich multipath, and also

network recorded in DLTs. We show that studying the network characteristics and
peculiarities is of paramount importance, in order to understand how users
interact in the DLT. For instance, our analyses reveal that all transaction
graphs exhibit small world properties.

  Translation: A Case Study on Scientific Text","12 pages, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent research suggests that neural machine translation (MT) in the news
domain has reached human-level performance, but for other professional domains,
it is far below the level. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained systematic
human evaluation for four widely used Chinese-English NMT systems on scientific
abstracts which are collected from published journals and books. Our human
evaluation results show that all the systems return with more than 10\% error
rates on average, which requires much post editing effort for real academic
use. Furthermore, we categorize six main error types and and provide some real
examples. Our findings emphasise the needs that research attention in the MT
community should be shifted from short text generic translation to professional
machine translation and build large scale bilingual corpus for these specific
domains.

cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the weighted sum of central
independent chi-squared random variables with non-zero weighs based on a method
using moment generating functions. To obtain the p.d.f. and c.d.f. of such a
function, we first derive the moment generating function of this weighted sum
using the partial fractions decomposition or the residue method. The results
cover the sum of two and three weighted chi-squared random variables, which can
easily be adapted to more general cases.
