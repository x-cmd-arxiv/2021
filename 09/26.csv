  in pre-trained language models","Accepted at EMNLP 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pre-trained LMs have shown impressive performance on downstream NLP tasks,
but we have yet to establish a clear understanding of their sophistication when
it comes to processing, retaining, and applying information presented in their
input. In this paper we tackle a component of this question by examining
robustness of models' ability to deploy relevant context information in the
face of distracting content. We present models with cloze tasks requiring use
of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how
robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We
also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light
on dynamics of models' use of contextual cues. We find that although models
appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and
applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but
irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In
particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic
similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion
that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues,
rather than by robust representations of context meaning.

robotics and wireless communications. For instance, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) require the information of the position precisely for an adequate
control strategy. This problem is handled very efficiently with integrated GPS
units for outdoor applications. However, indoor applications require special
treatment due to the unavailability of GPS signals. Another aspect of mobile
robots such as UAVs is that there is constant wireless communication between
the mobile robot and a computational unit. This communication is mainly done
for obtaining telemetry information or computation of control actions directly.
The responsible integrated units for this transmission are commercial wireless
communication chipsets. These units on the receiver side are responsible for
getting rid of the diverse effects of the communication channel with various
mathematical techniques. These techniques mainly require the Channel State
Information (CSI) of the current channel to compensate the channel itself.
After the compensation, the chipset has nothing to do with CSI. However, the
locations of both the transmitter and receiver have a direct impact on CSI.
Even though CSI contains such rich information about the environment, the
accessibility of these data is blocked by the commercial wireless chipsets
since they are manufactured to provide only the processed information data bits
to the user. However, with the IEEE 802.11n standardization, certain chipsets
provide access to CSI. Therefore, CSI data became processible and integrable to
localization schemes. In this project, a test environment was constructed for
the localization task. Two routers with proper chipsets were assigned as
transmitter and receiver. They were operationalized for the CSI data
collection. Lastly, these data were processed with various deep learning
models.

seek low-dimensional common representations of data entities from multiple
``views'' (e.g., audio and image) using linear transformations and neural
networks, respectively. When the views are acquired and stored at different
computing agents (e.g., organizations and edge devices) and data sharing is
undesired due to privacy or communication cost considerations, federated
learning-based GCCA is well-motivated. In federated learning, the views are
kept locally at the agents and only derived, limited information exchange with
a central server is allowed. However, applying existing GCCA algorithms onto
such federated learning settings may incur prohibitively high communication
overhead. This work puts forth a communication-efficient federated learning
framework for both linear and deep GCCA under the maximum variance (MAX-VAR)
formulation. The overhead issue is addressed by aggressively compressing (via
quantization) the exchanging information between the computing agents and a
central controller. Compared to the unquantized version, our empirical study
shows that the proposed algorithm enjoys a substantial reduction of
communication overheads with virtually no loss in accuracy and convergence
speed. Rigorous convergence analyses are also presented, which is a nontrivial
effort. Generic federated optimization results do not cover the special problem
structure of GCCA. Our result shows that the proposed algorithms for both
linear and deep GCCA converge to critical points at a sublinear rate, even
under heavy quantization and stochastic approximations. In addition, in the
linear MAX-VAR case, the quantized algorithm approaches a global optimum in a
geometric rate under reasonable conditions. Synthetic and real-data experiments

networks to operating systems -- performs resource allocation across system
users. The defacto allocation policies are max-min fairness (MMF) for single
resources and dominant resource fairness (DRF) for multiple resources which
guarantee properties like incentive compatibility, envy-freeness, and Pareto
efficiency, assuming user demands are static (time-independent). However, in
real-world systems, user demands are dynamic, i.e. time-dependant. As a result,
there is now a fundamental mismatch between the goals of computer systems and
the properties enabled by classic resource allocation policies. We aim to
bridge this mismatch. When demands are dynamic, instant-by-instant MMF can be
extremely unfair over longer periods of time, i.e. lead to unbalanced user
allocations as previous allocations have no effect in the present. We consider
a natural generalization of MMF and DRF for multiple resources and users with
dynamic demands: this algorithm ensures that user allocations are as max-min
fair as possible up to any time instant, given past allocations. This dynamic
mechanism remains Pareto optimal and envy-free, but not incentive compatible.
However, our results show that the possible increase in utility by misreporting
is bounded and, since this can lead to significant decrease in overall useful
allocation, this suggests that it is not a useful strategy. Our main result is
to show that our dynamic DRF algorithm is $(1+\rho)$-incentive compatible,
where $\rho$ quantifies the relative importance of a resource for different
users; we show that this factor is tight even with only two resources. We also
present a $3/2$ upper bound and a $\sqrt 2$ lower bound for incentive
compatibility when there is only one resource. We also offer extensions for the
case when users are weighted to prioritize them differently.

the modern processors. Dissipating heat produced from computation, memory
access remains a significant problem for processors. Therefore, processor
thermal management continues to be an active research topic. Most thermal
management research takes place using simulations, given the challenges of
measuring temperature in real processors. Since core and memory are fabricated
on separate packages in most existing processors, with the memory having lower
power densities, thermal management research in processors has primarily
focused on the cores.
  Memory bandwidth limitations associated with 2D processors lead to
high-density 2.5D and 3D packaging technology. 2.5D packaging places cores and
memory on the same package. 3D packaging technology takes it further by
stacking layers of memory on the top of cores themselves. Such packagings
significantly increase the power density, making processors prone to heating.
Therefore, mitigating thermal issues in high-density processors (packaged with
stacked memory) becomes an even more pressing problem. However, given the lack
of thermal modeling for memories in existing interval thermal simulation
toolchains, they are unsuitable for studying thermal management for
high-density processors.
  To address this issue, we present CoMeT, the first integrated Core and Memory
interval Thermal simulation toolchain. CoMeT comprehensively supports thermal
simulation of high- and low-density processors corresponding to four different
core-memory configurations - off-chip DDR memory, off-chip 3D memory, 2.5D, and
3D. CoMeT supports several novel features that facilitate overlying system
research. Compared to an equivalent state-of-the-art core-only toolchain, CoMeT
adds only a ~5% simulation-time overhead. The source code of CoMeT has been

evolutionary dynamics with genotype networks. We show that the genotype
networks of influenza A (H3N2) hemagglutinin are characterized by heavy-tailed

behavior. We argue that: (i) genotype networks are driven by mutation and host
immunity to explore a subspace of networks predictable in structure, and (ii)
genotype networks provide an underlying structure necessary to capture the rich
dynamics of multistrain epidemic models. In particular, inclusion of
strain-transcending immunity in epidemic models is dependent upon the structure
of an underlying genotype network. This interplay suggests a self-organized
criticality where the epidemic dynamics of influenza locates critical-like
regions of its genotype network. We conclude that this interplay between

response to lockdown measures. To account for confinement, we distinguish two
susceptible populations at different risk: confined and unconfined. We show
that transmission and recovery rates within them vary in response to facts. A
key unknown to predict the evolution of the epidemic is the fraction of the
population affected by the virus, including asymptomatic subjects. Our study
tracks its time evolution with quantified uncertainty from available official
data from the onset of the epidemic, limited, however, by the data quality. We
exemplify the technique with data from Spain, country in which late drastic
lockdowns were enforced for months. In late actions and in the absence of other
measures, spread is delayed but not stopped unless a large enough fraction of
the population is confined until the asymptomatic population is depleted. To
some extent, confinement could be replaced by strong distancing through masks
in adequate circumstances.

CCF has been measured between a foreground spectroscopic sample of GAMA

behavior, they predominantly focus on prediction accuracy, ignoring the ethical
challenges embedded in machine learning algorithms. This study introduces an
important missing dimension - computational fairness - to travel behavior
analysis. We first operationalize computational fairness by equality of
opportunity, then differentiate between the bias inherent in data and the bias
introduced by modeling. We then demonstrate the prediction disparities in
travel behavior modeling using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)
and the 2018-2019 My Daily Travel Survey in Chicago. Empirically, deep neural
network (DNN) and discrete choice models (DCM) reveal consistent prediction
disparities across multiple social groups: both over-predict the false negative
rate of frequent driving for the ethnic minorities, the low-income and the
disabled populations, and falsely predict a higher travel burden of the
socially disadvantaged groups and the rural populations than reality. Comparing
DNN with DCM, we find that DNN can outperform DCM in prediction disparities
because of DNN's smaller misspecification error. To mitigate prediction
disparities, this study introduces an absolute correlation regularization
method, which is evaluated with synthetic and real-world data. The results
demonstrate the prevalence of prediction disparities in travel behavior
modeling, and the disparities still persist regarding a variety of model
specifics such as the number of DNN layers, batch size and weight
initialization. Since these prediction disparities can exacerbate social
inequity if prediction results without fairness adjustment are used for
transportation policy making, we advocate for careful consideration of the
fairness problem in travel behavior modeling, and the use of bias mitigation
algorithms for fair transport decisions.

such as robotic navigation by discretizing the state space and precomputing
motion primitives. However in domains with complex dynamic constraints,
constructing motion primitives in a discretized state space is non-trivial.
This requires operating in continuous space which can be challenging for
search-based planners as they can get stuck in local minima regions. Previous
work on planning in continuous spaces introduced soft duplicate detection which
requires search to compute the duplicity of a state with respect to previously
seen states to avoid exploring states that are likely to be duplicates,
especially in local minima regions. They propose a simple metric utilizing the
euclidean distance between states, and proximity to obstacles to compute the
duplicity. In this paper, we improve upon this metric by introducing a
kinodynamically informed metric, subtree overlap, between two states as the
similarity between their successors that can be reached within a fixed time
horizon using kinodynamic motion primitives. This captures the intuition that,
due to robot dynamics, duplicate states can be far in euclidean distance and
result in very similar successor states, while non-duplicate states can be
close and result in widely different successors.

the recently developed staggered mesh method for periodic second order
M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) calculations [Xing, Li, Lin, JCTC
2021]. Compared to standard RPA calculations, the staggered mesh method
introduces negligible additional computational cost. It avoids a significant
portion of the finite-size error, and can be asymptotically advantageous for
quasi-1D systems and certain quasi-2D and 3D systems with high symmetries. We
demonstrate the applicability of the method using two different formalisms: the
direct ring coupled cluster doubles (drCCD) theory, and the
adiabatic-connection (AC) fluctuation-dissipation theory. In the drCCD
formalism, the second order screened exchange (SOSEX) correction can also be
readily obtained using the staggered mesh method. In the AC formalism, the
staggered mesh method naturally avoids the need of performing ""head/wing""
corrections to the dielectric operator. The effectiveness of the staggered mesh
method for insulating systems is theoretically justified by investigating the
finite-size error of each individual perturbative term in the RPA correlation
energy, expanded as an infinite series of terms associated with ring diagrams.
As a side contribution, our analysis provides a proof that the finite-size
error of each perturbative term of standard RPA and SOSEX calculations scales
as $\mathcal{O}(N_{\mathbf{k}}^{-1})$, where $N_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the number of
grid points in a Monkhorst-Pack mesh.

Unpaired Translation is one of the existing methods for solving such problems.
Significant advantage of this method, compared to competitors, is the ability
to train and perform well in cases where both input and output domains are only
a single image. Another key thing that differentiates this method from its
predecessors is the usage of image patches rather than the whole images. It
also turns out that sampling negatives (patches required to calculate the loss)
from the same image achieves better results than a scenario where the negatives
are sampled from other images in the dataset. This type of approach encourages
mapping of corresponding patches to the same location in relation to other
patches (negatives) while at the same time improves the output image quality
and significantly decreases memory usage as well as the time required to train
the model compared to CycleGAN method used as a baseline. Through a series of
experiments we show that using focal loss in place of cross-entropy loss within

considerably due to the enormous number of devices connected to the Internet.
In this context, optical wireless communication (OWC) has received tremendous
interest in the context of next generation wireless networks where OWC offers a
huge unlicensed bandwidth using optical bands. OWC systems are directional and
can naturally provide multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) configurations
serving multiple users using a high number of transmitters in the indoor
environment to ensure coverage. Therefore, multiuser interference must be
managed efficiently to enhance the performance of OWC networks considering
different metrics. A transmission scheme referred to as blind interference
alignment (BIA) is proposed for OWC systems to maximize the multiplexing gain
without the need for channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, which
is difficult to achieve in MIMO scenarios. However, standard BIA avoids the
need for CSI at the cost of requiring channel coherence time large enough for
transmitting the whole transmission block. Moreover, the methodology of BIA
results in increased noise with increase in the number of transmitters and
users. Therefore, various network topologies such as network centric (NC) and
user centric (UC) designs are proposed to relax the limitations of BIA where
these topologies divide the receiving area into multiple clusters. The results
show a significant enhancement in the performance of topological BIA compared
with standard BIA.

  turbulent plumes",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Tracking a turbulent plume to locate its source is a complex control problem
because it requires multi-sensory integration and must be robust to
intermittent odors, changing wind direction, and variable plume statistics.
This task is routinely performed by flying insects, often over long distances,
in pursuit of food or mates. Several aspects of this remarkable behavior have
been studied in detail in many experimental studies. Here, we take a
complementary in silico approach, using artificial agents trained with
reinforcement learning to develop an integrated understanding of the behaviors
and neural computations that support plume tracking. Specifically, we use deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to train recurrent neural network (RNN) agents to
locate the source of simulated turbulent plumes. Interestingly, the agents'
emergent behaviors resemble those of flying insects, and the RNNs learn to
represent task-relevant variables, such as head direction and time since last
odor encounter. Our analyses suggest an intriguing experimentally testable
hypothesis for tracking plumes in changing wind direction -- that agents follow
local plume shape rather than the current wind direction. While reflexive
short-memory behaviors are sufficient for tracking plumes in constant wind,
longer timescales of memory are essential for tracking plumes that switch
direction. At the level of neural dynamics, the RNNs' population activity is
low-dimensional and organized into distinct dynamical structures, with some
correspondence to behavioral modules. Our in silico approach provides key
intuitions for turbulent plume tracking strategies and motivates future
targeted experimental and theoretical developments.

preinstalled with Google Talkback as a default screen-reader, which attempts to
cater for the visually impaired by providing supplementary auditory information
when interfacing with supported applications. Still, the crux of this situation
is that screen-readers rely on developers correctly implementing the required
accessibility guidelines for UI elements, such as charts. Unfortunately,
according to the empirical study, more than 88% of the charts found in
real-world Android applications are inaccessible to a vision-impaired user,
contributing to the wider accessibility issues faced by vision impaired users

in considering possible disabilities for users, and time costs for developers.
To overcome these challenges, this study proposes CAM (Chart Accessibility

it can be achieved by studying the effect of a controlled non-magnetic disorder
on the superconducting transition temperature, $T_{c}$. For this purpose, the

electrons three times, repeating the measurement between the irradiation runs.
A total dose of 10 C/cm$^{2}$ ($6.24\times10^{19}$ electrons/$\textrm{cm}^{2}$)

crossing the Fermi energy can be naturally grouped to support two effective
gaps, not dissimilar from the iron pnictides physics. We analyze the results
using two-gap models for both, $\lambda(T)$ and $T_{c}$, which describe the

based on sampling the parameter space and designing a state observer for each
sample. A supervisor selects one of these observers at each time instant to
produce the parameter and state estimates. In the first scheme, the parameter
and state estimates are guaranteed to converge within a certain margin of their
true values in finite time, assuming that a sufficiently large number of
observers is used and a persistence of excitation condition is satisfied in
addition to other observer design conditions. This convergence margin is
constituted by a part that can be chosen arbitrarily small by the user and a
part determined by the noise levels. The second scheme exploits the convergence
properties of the parameter estimate to perform subsequent zoom-ins on the
parameter subspace to achieve stricter margins for a given number of observers.
The strengths of both schemes are demonstrated using a numerical example.

needed by broadband applications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar
spectrum at 76-81 GHz can be utilized. For this purpose, joint
radar-communication systems have been proposed in the literature to perform
both functions using the same waveform and hardware. While multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) communication with multiple users enables independent
data streaming for high throughput, MIMO radar processing provides
high-resolution imaging that is crucial for safety-critical systems. However,
employing conventional precoding methods designed for communication generates
directional beams that impair MIMO radar imaging and target tracking
capabilities during data streaming. In this paper, we propose a MIMO joint
automotive radar-communication (JARC) framework based on orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. First, we show that the MIMO-OFDM
preamble can be exploited for both MIMO radar processing and estimation of the
communication channel. Then, we propose an optimal precoder design method that
enables high accuracy target tracking while transmitting independent data
streams to multiple receivers. The proposed methods provide high-resolution
radar imaging and high throughput capabilities for MIMO JARC networks. Finally,
we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methods through numerical simulations.

million confirmed cases including 3,698,621 deaths from COVID-19. Detecting
COVID-19 and other lung diseases from Chest X-Ray (CXR) images can be very
effective for emergency diagnosis and treatment as CXR is fast and cheap. The
objective of this study is to develop a system capable of detecting COVID-19
along with 14 other lung diseases from CXRs in a fair and unbiased manner. The
proposed system consists of a CXR image selection technique and a deep learning
based model to classify 15 diseases including COVID-19. The proposed CXR
selection technique aims to retain the maximum variation uniformly and
eliminate poor quality CXRs with the goal of reducing the training dataset size
without compromising classifier accuracy. More importantly, it reduces the
often hidden bias and unfairness in decision making. The proposed solution
exhibits a promising COVID-19 detection scheme in a more realistic situation
than most existing studies as it deals with 15 lung diseases together. We hope
the proposed method will have wider adoption in medical image classification

realised as macroscopically-distinct coherent states $|\alpha\rangle$ and
$|-\alpha\rangle$. Quantum superpositions of $|\alpha\rangle$ and
$|-\alpha\rangle$ are created via a unitary interaction $U(\theta)$ based on a
nonlinear Hamiltonian. Macroscopic delayed-choice experiments give a compelling
reason to develop interpretations not allowing macroscopic retrocausality
(MrC). We therefore consider weak macroscopic realism (wMR), which specifies a
hidden variable $\lambda_{\theta}$ to determine the macroscopic qubit value
(analogous to 'which-way' information), independent of any future measurement
setting $\phi$. Using entangled states, we demonstrate a quantum eraser where
the choice to measure a which-way or wave-type property is delayed. Consistency
with wMR is possible, if we interpret the macroscopic qubit value to be
determined by $\lambda_{\theta}$ without specification of the state at the
level of $\hbar$, where fringes manifest. We then demonstrate violations of a
delayed-choice Leggett-Garg inequality, and of the dimension witness inequality
applied to the Wheeler-Chaves-Lemos-Pienaar experiment, where measurements need
only distinguish the macroscopic qubit states. This negates all two-dimensional
non-retrocausal models, thereby suggesting MrC. However, one can interpret
consistently with wMR, thus avoiding MrC, by noting extra dimensions, and by
noting that the violations require further unitary dynamics $U$ for each
system. The violations are then explained as failure of deterministic
macroscopic realism (dMR), which specifies validity of $\lambda_{\theta}$ prior
to the dynamics $U(\theta)$ determining the measurement setting $\theta$.
Finally, although there is consistency with wMR for macroscopic observations,
we demonstrate EPR paradoxes at a microscopic level.

glide plane operation, which guarantees that the energy bands must stick
together pairwise at a boundary of the Brillouin zone. Moving away from the
Brillouin zone boundary causes the symmetry-enforced nodal lines to split,

networked participants or their avatars through a juxtaposition of
environments, real and virtual, often referred to as the Metaverse. These
applications require a parametric audio scene programming interface to
facilitate the creation and deployment of shared, dynamic and realistic virtual
3D worlds on mobile computing platforms and remote servers.
  We propose a practical approach for designing parametric 6-degree-of-freedom
object-based interactive audio engines to deliver the perceptually relevant
binaural cues necessary for audio/visual and virtual/real congruence in
Metaverse experiences. We address the effects of room reverberation, acoustic
reflectors, and obstacles in both the virtual and real environments, and
discuss how such effects may be driven by combinations of pre-computed and
real-time acoustic propagation solvers. We envision an open scene description
model distilled to facilitate the development of interoperable applications
distributed across multiple platforms, where each audio object represents, to
the user, a natural sound source having controllable distance, size,
orientation, and acoustic radiation properties.

  In this paper, we present conditions on a probabilistic program's execution
under which delayed sampling will execute in bounded memory. The two conditions
are dataflow properties of the core operations of delayed sampling: the
$m$-consumed property and the unseparated paths property. A program executes in
bounded memory under delayed sampling if, and only if, it satisfies the
$m$-consumed and unseparated paths properties. We propose a static analysis
that abstracts over these properties to soundly ensure that any program that
passes the analysis satisfies these properties, and thus executes in bounded

contributes to the phase measured at each voxel. Therefore, estimating velocity
from potentially wrapped phase measurements is the task of solving a system of
noisy congruence equations. We propose Phase Recovery from Multiple Wrapped
Measurements (PRoM) as a fast, approximate maximum likelihood estimator of
velocity from multi-coil data with possible amplitude attenuation due to
dephasing. The estimator can recover the fullest possible extent of unambiguous
velocities, which can greatly exceed twice the highest venc. The estimator uses
all pairwise phase differences and the inherent correlations among them to
minimize the estimation error. Correlations are directly estimated from
multi-coil data without requiring knowledge of coil sensitivity maps, dephasing
factors, or the actual per-voxel signal-to-noise ratio. Derivation of the
estimator yields explicit probabilities of unwrapping errors and the
probability distribution for the velocity estimate; this, in turn, allows for
optimized design of the phase-encoded acquisition. These probabilities are also
incorporated into spatial post-processing to further mitigate wrapping errors.
Simulation, phantom, and in vivo results for three-point PC-MRI acquisitions
validate the benefits of reduced estimation error, increased recovered velocity
range, optimized acquisition, and fast computation. A phantom study at 1.5T
demonstrates 48.5% decrease in root mean squared error using PRoM with
post-processing versus a conventional ""dual-venc"" technique. Simulation and 3T

(CNN) for the thermal simulation surrogate. The network can learn a mapping
from heat source layout to the steady-state temperature field without labeled

(PDEs). To realize the physics-guided training without labeled data, we employ
the heat conduction equation and finite difference method to construct the loss

impose hard constraints by padding in the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions. In addition, the neural network architecture is well-designed to
improve the prediction precision of the problem at hand, and pixel-level online
hard example mining is introduced to overcome the imbalance of optimization
difficulty in the computation domain. The experiments demonstrate that the

text generation. CBART leverages the pre-trained model BART and transfers part
of the generation burden from the decoder to the encoder by decomposing this
task into two sub-tasks, thereby improving the sentence quality. Concretely, we
extend BART by adding a token-level classifier over the encoder, aiming at
instructing the decoder where to replace and insert. Guided by the encoder, the
decoder refines multiple tokens of the input in one step by inserting tokens
before specific positions and re-predicting tokens with low confidence. To
further reduce the inference latency, the decoder predicts all tokens in
parallel. Experiment results on One-Billion-Word and Yelp show that CBART can
generate plausible text with high quality and diversity while significantly

biaxial tension experiments and finite element modeling. A three-stage
deformation process, including tightening, unlocking, and flattening, of the
structure was unveiled through a detailed analysis of facet distortion and
crease rotation, and the relationship between structure deformation and several
key features in the energy, force, and stiffness curve was obtained. Based on
the analysis, an empirical model was built to correlate the geometric and

Using the model, the mechanical properties of the structure can be accurately

chance-constrained Monte-Carlo belief tree search for robot behavioral
planning. Our planner enables a robot to safely and actively reason about its
human partner's latent cognitive states (bounded intelligence and
irrationality) in real-time to maximize its utility better. We validate our

negotiate traffic merges. Simulations and user studies are conducted to show
our planner's effectiveness.

applying these methods to translate images to multiple visual domains remains

the training sample, denoted as the incoherent clip, is constructed by multiple
sub-clips hierarchically sampled from the same raw video with various lengths
of incoherence between each other. The network is trained to learn high-level
representation by predicting the location and length of incoherence given the
incoherent clip as input. Additionally, intra-video contrastive learning is
introduced to maximize the mutual information between incoherent clips from the

in accelerating the acquisition of MR data, and a lot of deep learning-based
methods have been exploited recently. Despite the achieved inspiring results,
the optimization of these methods commonly relies on the fully-sampled
reference data, which are time-consuming and difficult to collect. To address
this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method. Specifically,
during model optimization, two subsets are constructed by randomly selecting
part of k-space data from the undersampled data and then fed into two parallel
reconstruction networks to perform information recovery. Two reconstruction
losses are defined on all the scanned data points to enhance the network's
capability of recovering the frequency information. Meanwhile, to constrain the
learned unscanned data points of the network, a difference loss is designed to
enforce consistency between the two parallel networks. In this way, the
reconstruction model can be properly trained with only the undersampled data.
During the model evaluation, the undersampled data are treated as the inputs
and either of the two trained networks is expected to reconstruct the
high-quality results. The proposed method is flexible and can be employed in
any existing deep learning-based method. The effectiveness of the method is
evaluated on an open brain MRI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed self-supervised method can achieve competitive reconstruction
performance compared to the corresponding supervised learning method at high
acceleration rates (4 and 8). The code is publicly available at

entail adaptation of cancer cells to stress, whether a drug or a lethal new

contingent on pre-existing pathways but on a random search for a state that
diminishes the stress. We review underlying mechanisms that may support this
search, and show by using a learning model that such exploratory adaptation is
feasible in a high dimensional system as the cell. At the population level, we
view the tissue as a network of exploring agents that communicate and restrain
cancer formation in health. In this view, disease results from the breakdown of

RUL prediction require expert domain knowledge for manual feature extraction

extraction method with generative adversarial networks. The adversarial
training learns the distribution of training data from different bearings and
is introduced for health stage division and RUL prediction. To capture the
sequence feature from a one-dimensional vibration signal, we adapt a U-Net
architecture that reconstructs features to process them with multiscale layers
in the generator of the adversarial network. To validate the proposed method,
comprehensive experiments on two rotating machinery datasets have been
conducted to predict the RUL. The experimental results show that the proposed
feature extraction method can effectively predict the RUL and outperforms the
conventional RUL prediction approaches based on deep neural networks. The

decoder by employing the resource theory of asymmetry framework. In this task,
the sender Alice and the receiver Bob share an entangled state. She encodes the
classical information into it using a symmetric preserving encoder and sends
the encoded state to Bob through a noiseless quantum channel. The decoder is
limited to a measurement to satisfy a certain locality condition on the
bipartite system composed of the receiving system and the preshared
entanglement half. Our contributions are summarized as follows: First, we
derive an achievable transmission rate for this task dependently of conditions
of encoder and decoder. Surprisingly, we show that the obtained rate cannot be
improved even when the decoder is relaxed to local measurements, two-way LOCCs,
separable measurements, or partial transpose positive (PPT) measurements for
the bipartite system. Moreover, depending on the class of allowed measurements
with a locality condition, we relax the class of encoding operations to
super-quantum encoders in the framework of general probability theory (GPT).
That is, when our decoder is restricted to a separable measurement,
theoretically, a positive operation is allowed as an encoding operation.
Surprisingly, even under this type of super-quantum relaxation, the
transmission rate cannot be improved. This fact highlights the universal

Benefiting from
generative adversarial networks (GANs), recent studies have promoted the
development of SISR by recovering photo-realistic images. However, there are
still undesired structural distortions in the recovered images. In this paper,
we propose a structure-preserving super-resolution (SPSR) method to alleviate
the above issue while maintaining the merits of GAN-based methods to generate
perceptual-pleasant details. Firstly, we propose SPSR with gradient guidance
(SPSR-G) by exploiting gradient maps of images to guide the recovery in two
aspects. On the one hand, we restore high-resolution gradient maps by a
gradient branch to provide additional structure priors for the SR process. On
the other hand, we propose a gradient loss to impose a second-order restriction
on the super-resolved images, which helps generative networks concentrate more
on geometric structures. Secondly, since the gradient maps are handcrafted and
may only be able to capture limited aspects of structural information, we
further extend SPSR-G by introducing a learnable neural structure extractor
(NSE) to unearth richer local structures and provide stronger supervision for
SR. We propose two self-supervised structure learning methods, contrastive

control system (WNCS). There are $N$ independent linear time-invariant

edge server and cloud server. Each process is measured by a sensor, and the
status updates is sent to controller to generate the control command. The link
delay of cloud server is longer than that of edge server. The processing time
of status update depends on the characteristic of servers and processes. By
taking into account such conditions, we mainly investigate how to choose the
destination of status updates to minimize the system's average Mean Square
Error (MSE), edge server or cloud server? To address this issue, we formulate
an infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and
obtain the optimal scheduling policy. The monotonicity of the value function in
MDP is characterized and then used to show the threshold structure properties
of the optimal scheduling policy. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we
propose a low-complexity suboptimal policy by using additive separable
structure of value function. Furthermore, the processing preemption mechanism
is considered to handle the status updates more flexible, and the consistency
property is proved. On this basis, a numerical example is provided. The
simulation results illustrate that the controller selection is related to the
timeliness of process and show the performance of the suboptimal policy. We
also find that the optimal policy will become a static policy in which the

representations of the target user and the candidate item. As for the graph
convolution, we design a Time-aware Sequential Encoding Layer that leverages
the interaction time information as well as temporal dependencies to learn
evolutionary user and item dynamics. Besides, we propose a Target-Preference

target-aware attention module, to automatically search for parts of behaviors
that are relevant to the target and alleviate the noise from unreliable

the resource trading between the cloud computing service provider (CCP) and
different edge computing service providers (ECPs). Then we derive the optimal

replicator dynamics of users' service selection. These strategies can promise
the maximum integral utilities to all computing service providers (CPs),

mixed updates to the aggregation server. This mixing strategy drastically
reduces privacy without any trade-off with utility. Indeed, mixing the updates

reformed, establishing a theoretical contents from micro- to macro-system, and
comprehensively introducing the theory of chemical reaction to undergraduate

physical-chemistry course, we focus on the last-mile problem between the
physics and chemistry courses to train the critical thinking of undergraduate
students in chemistry. To clearly show this, a reduction scheme of polymer
molecular dynamics was discussed as an example, which shows a different
theoretical content in polymer chemistry. Moreover, we propose a series of
experiences and dependent measures that can provide information regarding
students' levels of knowledge and understanding. This assessment quiz was
designed to test students on the fundamental concepts and applications of TC,
such as dynamics, statistical ensemble, kinetics, and so on. From the actual
teaching for 36 students, it was found that these students performed
significantly improvement from the present TC content. Further analysis of each
individual question revealed that approximately two-third of the students learn
new knowledge. Although the present TC course might be considered to be a
certain degree of difficulty for chemists, these analyses show that students
can effectively accept these complicated concepts.

enables the health authority to detect and isolate the infected cases, thereby
limiting the disease transmission to susceptible people, when no effective
treatment or vaccine is available. In this paper, an epidemic model that
incorporates the testing rate as a control input is presented. The proposed
model distinguishes between the undetected infected and the detected infected
cases with the latter assumed to be isolated from the disease spreading process
in the population. Two testing policies, effective during the onset of an
epidemic when no treatment or vaccine is available, are devised: (i)
best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and (ii) constant optimal strategy for
testing (COST). The BEST is a suppression policy that provides a lower bound on
the testing rate to stop the growth of the epidemic. The COST is a mitigation
policy that minimizes the peak of the epidemic by providing a constant, optimal
allocation of tests in a certain time interval when the total stockpile of
tests is limited. Both testing policies are evaluated by their impact on the
number of active intensive care unit (ICU) cases and the cumulative number of
deaths due to COVID-19 in France.

multi-agent networks. Here, positive semidefiniteness is not inherent for
signed Laplacians, which renders the stability and consensus of this category
of networks intricate. First, we examine the stability of signed networks by
introducing a novel graph-theoretic objective negative cut set, which implies
that manipulating negative edge weights cannot change a unstable network into a
stable one. Then, inspired by the diagonal dominance and stability of matrices,
a local state damping mechanism is introduced using self-loop compensation. The
self-loop compensation is only active for those agents who are incident to
negative edges and can stabilize signed networks in a fully distributed manner.
Quantitative connections between self-loop compensation and the stability of
the compensated signed network are established for a tradeoff between
compensation efforts and network stability. Necessary and/or sufficient
conditions for predictable cluster consensus of compensated signed networks are
provided. The optimality of self-loop compensation is discussed. Furthermore,
we extend our results to directed signed networks where the symmetry of signed
Laplacian is not free. The correlation between the stability of the compensated
dynamics obtained by self-loop compensation and eventually positivity is
further discussed. Novel insights into the stability of multi-agent systems on
signed networks in terms of self-loop compensation are offered. Simulation
examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.

training of the network with better gradient flow. A residual block consists of
few convolutional layers having trainable parameters, which leads to
overfitting. Moreover, the present residual networks are not able to utilize
the high and low frequency information suitably, which also challenges the
generalization capability of the network. In this paper, a frequency

Specifically, FDResNet includes separate connections in the residual block for

disentangles the low and high frequency components to increase the
generalization ability. Moreover, the computation of low and high frequency
components using fixed filters further avoids the overfitting. The proposed
model is tested on benchmark CIFAR10/100, Caltech and TinyImageNet datasets for
image classification. The performance of the proposed model is also tested in

low-energy waveform field sampling have recently been demonstrated using direct
time-domain methods that exploit optical-field photoemission from plasmonic

detectors operating at optical frequency that work in ambient conditions and
require minute pulse energies (picojoule-level). Applications include
frequency-comb stabilization, visible to near-infrared time-domain
spectroscopy, compact tools for attosecond science and metrology and, due to
the high electronic switching speeds, petahertz-scale information processing.
However, these devices have been driven by free-space optical waveforms and
their implementation within integrated photonic platforms has yet to be
demonstrated. In this work, we design and simulate fully-integrated plasmonic
bow-tie nanoantennas coupled to a Si$_3$N$_4$-core waveguide for CEP detection.
We find that when coupled to realistic on-chip, few-cycle supercontinuum
sources, these devices are suitable for direct time-domain CEP detection within
integrated photonic platforms. We estimate a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB at
50 kHz resolution bandwidth. We address technical details, such as the tuning
of the nanoantennas plasmonic resonance and the waveform's CEP slippage in the
waveguide. Moreover, we evaluate power losses due to absorption and scattering
and we study the device sensitivity to pulse duration and pulse peak field
intensity. Our results provide the basis for future design and fabrication of
time-domain CEP detectors and allow for the development of fully-integrated
attosecond science applications, frequency-comb stabilization and

functions with compact support -- to construct each inhomogeneity correction
factor (ICF). This choice offers several distinct advantages over a polynomial
basis by enabling explicit enforcement of linear and non-linear constraints as
well as ICF smoothness using Tikhonov regularization and penalized B-splines
(P-splines). As proof of concept, we use this approach to construct CASE21 -- a
Constrained And Smoothed semi-Empirical hybrid generalized gradient
approximation that completely satisfies all but one constraint (and partially
satisfies the remaining one) met by the PBE0 NE-DFA and exhibits enhanced
performance across a diverse set of chemical properties. As such, we argue that

estimate causal treatment effects from the software changes, even with limited

scenario that shipping of a new software to all users is restricted, as a
result, a fully randomised experiment could not be conducted. Therefore, we
utilised the Bayesian propensity score matching method with 14 observed

anomalous quartic gauge couplings in understanding the details of electroweak
symmetry breaking at future hadron-hadron collider facilities with increasing
center of mass energy and luminosity. In this paper, we investigate the
sensitivities of dimension-8 anomalous couplings related to the
$ZZ\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$ quartic vertices, defined in the
effective field theory framework, via $pp\to Z\gamma\gamma$ signal process with
Z-boson decaying to charged leptons at the high luminosity phase of LHC
(HL-LHC) and future facilities, namely the High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) and Future
Circular hadron-hadron collider (FCC-hh). We analyzed the signal and relevant
backgrounds via a cut based method with Monte Carlo event sampling where the
detector responses of three hadron collider facilities, the center-of-mass
energies of 14, 27 and 100 TeV with an integrated luminosities of 3, 15 and 30
ab$^{-1}$ are considered for the HL-LHC, HE-LHC and FCC-hh, respectively. The
reconstructed 4-body invariant mass of $l^+l^-\gamma\gamma$ system is used to
constrain the anomalous quartic gauge coupling parameters under the hypothesis
of absence of anomalies in triple gauge couplings. Our results indicate that
the sensitivity on anomalous quartic couplings $f_{T8}/\Lambda^{4}$ and
$f_{T9}/\Lambda^{4}$ ($f_{T0}/\Lambda^{4}$, $f_{T1}/\Lambda^{4}$ and
$f_{T2}/\Lambda^{4}$) at 95$\%$ C.L. for FCC-hh with $L_{int}$ = 30 ab$^{-1}$
without systematic errors are two (one) order better than the current
experimental limits. Considering a realistic systematic uncertainty such as
10$\%$ from possible experimental sources, the sensitivity of all anomalous
quartic couplings gets worsen by about 1.2$\%$, 1.7$\%$ and 1.5$\%$ compared to
those without systematic uncertainty for HL-LHC, HE-LHC and FCC-hh,

which can be used to compare two frequency spectra. When applied to

model, a mechanical system with 3 degrees of freedom describing screw-type
nonlinear wave solutions of a scalar field theory dual to the 1+1D SU(2)
Principal Chiral Model. This field theory is strongly coupled in the UV and
could serve as a toy model to study nonperturbative features of theories with a
perturbative Landau pole.
  We begin with a Lagrangian and a pair of Hamiltonian formulations based on
compatible degenerate nilpotent and Euclidean Poisson brackets. Darboux
coordinates, Lax pairs and classical r-matrices are found. Casimirs are used to
identify the symplectic leaves on which a complete set of independent conserved
quantities in involution are found, establishing Liouville integrability.
Solutions are expressible in terms of elliptic functions and their stability is
analyzed. The model is compared and contrasted with those of Neumann and
Kirchhoff.
  Common level sets of conserved quantities are generically 2-tori, though horn
tori, circles and points also arise. On the latter, conserved quantities
develop relations and solutions degenerate from elliptic to hyperbolic,
circular and constant functions. The common level sets are classified using the
nature of roots of a cubic polynomial. We also discover a family of
action-angle variables that are valid away from horn tori. On the latter, the
dynamics is expressed as a gradient flow.
  In Darboux coordinates, the model is reinterpreted as an axisymmetric quartic
oscillator. It is quantized and variables are separated in the Hamilton-Jacobi
and Schrodinger equations. Analytic properties and weak and strong coupling
limits of the radial equation are studied. It is shown to reduce to a
generalization of the Lame equation. Finally, we use this quantization to find
an infinite-dimensional unitary representation of the above nilpotent Lie
algebra.

density modulation shifts the Fermi level across the CDW gap and gives rise to
a nontrivial evolution of AHE, in line with the asymmetric density of states of

galaxies. The size of a galaxy, $D_{\rm r,~25}$, is characterized by the
diameter at which the $r-$band surface brightness reaches $\mu_{\rm r}=25.0~\rm
mag~arcsec^{-2}$. We find that the positions of galaxies in the size ($D_{\rm
r,~25}$)$-$stellar mass ($M_{\ast}$) plane strongly depend on their
HI-to-stellar mass ratio ($M_{\rm HI}/M_{\ast}$). In the HI-rich regime,
galaxies that are more rich in HI tend to have larger sizes. Such a trend is
not seen in the HI-poor regime, suggesting that size growth is barely affected
by the HI content when it has declined to a sufficiently low level. An
investigation of the relations between size, $M_{\rm HI}/M_{\ast}$ and star
formation rate (SFR) suggests that size is more intrinsically linked with
$M_{\rm HI}/M_{\ast}$, rather than SFR. We further examine the HI-to-stellar
disk size ratio ($D_{\rm HI}/D_{\rm r,~25}$) of galaxies and find that at
log($M_{\rm HI}/M_{\ast})>-0.7$, $D_{\rm HI}/D_{\rm r,~25}$ is weakly
correlated with $M_{\ast}$. These findings support a picture in which the
HI-rich galaxies live in an inside-out disk growing phase regulated by gas
accretion and star formation. The angular momentum of the accreted materials is
probably the key parameter in shaping the size of an HI-rich galaxy.

estimation and remain the phase unaltered, resulting in the degraded speech

we pretrain a magnitude CycleGAN to coarsely estimate the spectral magnitude of
clean speech. In the second stage, we incorporate the pretrained CycleGAN with

a rank-1 saddle and the associated transition state separating reactants and

enhanced by external driving in at least one such system. Specifically, we
analyze a reactive model in two degrees of freedom that has been used earlier
to describe driven chemical reactions. Therein, changes in the external driving
can lead to a local maximum of the decay rate constant or even to bifurcations
of periodic trajectories on the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM)
corresponding to the transition state. Inspired by these bifurcations, we show
that in this case, the dynamics on the NHIM can be connected to the geometry of
reactive trajectories and to reaction probabilities of Maxwell-Boltzmann

ubiquitous quasiparticles in semiconductors, and play an important role in

polarons, in which the lattice can be considered as a continuum, have focused
on the original Fr\""ohlich model: a simple (non-degenerate) parabolic isotropic
electronic band coupled to one dispersionless longitudinal optical phonon
branch. The Fr\""ohlich model allows one to understand characteristics such as
polaron formation energy, radius, effective mass and mobility. Real cubic
materials, instead, have electronic band extrema that are often degenerate or
anisotropic and present several phonon modes. In the present work, we address
such issues. We keep the continuum hypothesis inherent to the large polaron
Fr\""ohlich model, but waive the isotropic and non-degeneracy hypotheses, and
also include multiple phonon branches. For polaron effective masses, working at
the lowest order of perturbation theory, we provide analytical results for the
case of anisotropic electronic energy dispersion, with two distinct effective
masses (uniaxial) and numerical simulations for the degenerate 3-band case,
typical of III-V and II-VI semiconductor valence bands. We also deal with the
strong-coupling limit, using a variational treatment: we propose trial
wavefunctions for the above-mentioned cases, providing polaron radii and
energies. Then, we evaluate the polaron formation energies, effective masses
and localisation lengths using parameters representative of a dozen II-VI,
III-V and oxide semiconductors, for both electron and hole polarons...In the
non-degenerate case, we compare the perturbative approach with the Feynman path

two-dimensional ($l^{}_x\times l^{}_y$) assembly of nanoparticles as a function
of out-of-plane positional disorder strength $\Delta(\%)$ using numerical
simulations. Such defects are redundantly observed in experimentally fabricated
nanostructures, resulting in unusual magnetization dynamics. The magnetization
decays exponentially for small and negligible dipolar interaction strength
$h^{}_d\leq0.2$. In such a case, the magnetization relaxation does not depend
on $\Delta$ and aspect ratio $A^{}_r=l^{}_y/l^{}_x$, as expected. In
square-like MNPs ensembles and perfectly ordered system ($\Delta(\%)=0$), the
magnetization relaxes rapidly with an increase in $h^{}_d$. Consequently, the
effective N\'eel relaxation time $\tau^{}_N$ decreases with $h^{}_d$. The
dipolar interaction of sufficient strength promotes antiferromagnetic coupling
in such a system, resulting in rapid magnetization decay. Remarkably, the
out-of-plane disorder instigates the magnetic moment to interact
ferromagnetically in the presence of large $h^{}_d$, even in the square-like
assembly of MNPs. As a result, magnetization relaxation slows down, resulting
in a monotonous increase of $\tau^{}_N$ with an increase in $\Delta$ and
$h^{}_d$ in such cases. Notably, there is a prolonged magnetization decay in
the highly anisotropic system with large $h^{}_d$. The dipolar interaction
induces ferromagnetic coupling along the long axis of the system in such cases.
Therefore, the magnetization ceases to relax as a function of time for large
$h^{}_d$, irrespective of disorder strength $\Delta(\%)$. The present work
could provide a concrete theoretical basis to explain the unexpected relaxation
behaviour observed in experiments. These results are also beneficial in digital

whole model is exactly within the Newton Laws to characterize pedestrian

desired velocity and desired interpersonal distance) rather than physics entity
(i.e., actual velocity and actual distance), and such oscillation is mitigated
by treating non-physics entity as variable rather than constant. Very
interestingly, the desired velocity represents the motivation level of
pedestrian motion, and the faster-is-slower effect is thus explained by
Yerkes-Dodson law, explaining how motivation level could improve or impair
human performances in a collective sense. This inverted-U effect is further
studied with a falling-down model and the numerical testing is exhibited by

due to its low annotation cost and high domain adaptability. Conventional
approaches employ the siamese-network for this task, which obtains the sentence
embeddings through modeling the context-response semantic relevance by applying
a feed-forward network on top of the sentence encoders. However, as the
semantic textual similarity is commonly measured through the element-wise
distance metrics (e.g. cosine and L2 distance), such architecture yields a
large gap between training and evaluating. In this paper, we propose
DialogueCSE, a dialogue-based contrastive learning approach to tackle this
issue. DialogueCSE first introduces a novel matching-guided embedding (MGE)
mechanism, which generates a context-aware embedding for each candidate
response embedding (i.e. the context-free embedding) according to the guidance
of the multi-turn context-response matching matrices. Then it pairs each
context-aware embedding with its corresponding context-free embedding and
finally minimizes the contrastive loss across all pairs. We evaluate our model
on three multi-turn dialogue datasets: the Microsoft Dialogue Corpus, the Jing
Dong Dialogue Corpus, and the E-commerce Dialogue Corpus. Evaluation results
show that our approach significantly outperforms the baselines across all three
datasets in terms of MAP and Spearman's correlation measures, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Further quantitative experiments show that our approach achieves
better performance when leveraging more dialogue context and remains robust
when less training data is provided.

diffusive time-of-flight (DTOF) is solved by FMM and then the governing
equations are computed on the 1D DTOF coordinate. Standard FMM solves the
Eikonal equation using a 4-stencil algorithm on 2D Cartesian grids, ignoring
the diagonal neighbouring cells. In the current study, we build a 8-stencil
algorithm considering all neighbouring cells, and use local analytical
propagation speeds. In addition, a local path-correction coefficient is
introduced to further increase the accuracy of DTOF solution. Next, a
discretisation scheme is built on the 1D DTOF coordinate for efficient
reservoir simulation. The algorithm is validated on homogeneous and
heterogeneous test cases, and its potential for efficient forward simulation in
AHM is demonstrated by two examples of dimensions 2 and 6.

These games arise in the study of the long-time behavior of finite-horizon

Aubry-Mather's theory, we introduce a discrete approximation to stationary
MFGs. Relying on Kakutani's fixed-point theorem, we prove the existence and

Moreover, we show that the solutions to the discrete problem converge,

recommender systems. The learning of a CF model generally depends on three
major components, namely interaction encoder, loss function, and negative
sampling. While many existing studies focus on the design of more powerful
interaction encoders, the impacts of loss functions and negative sampling
ratios have not yet been well explored. In this work, we show that the choice
of loss function as well as negative sampling ratio is equivalently important.
More specifically, we propose the cosine contrastive loss (CCL) and further
incorporate it to a simple unified CF model, dubbed SimpleX. Extensive
experiments have been conducted on 11 benchmark datasets and compared with 29
existing CF models in total. Surprisingly, the results show that, under our CCL
loss and a large negative sampling ratio, SimpleX can surpass most
sophisticated state-of-the-art models by a large margin (e.g., max 48.5%
improvement in NDCG@20 over LightGCN). We believe that SimpleX could not only
serve as a simple strong baseline to foster future research on CF, but also
shed light on the potential research direction towards improving loss function
and negative sampling.

We find that the gravitational-mode ($g$-mode) eigenfrequencies of newly born

Meanwhile, the eigenfrequencies of the other modes of non-radial oscillations,
e.g., fundamental ($f$)- and pressure ($p$)-modes, are much larger than those

inspired the study of Boolean lifting properties in the context of other

$BL$-algebras, bounded distributive lattices, residuated lattices,etc.), as
well as for some types of universal algebras (C. Muresan and the author defined
and studied the Congruence Boolean Lifting Property ($CBLP$) for congruence
modular algebras).
  A lifting ideal of a ring $R$ is an ideal of $R$ fulfilling $LIP$. In a
recent paper, Tarizadeh and Sharma obtained new results on lifting ideals in
commutative rings. The aim of this paper is to extend an important part of
their results to congruences with $CBLP$ in semidegenerate congruence modular
algebras. The reticulation of such algebra will play an important role in our
investigations (recall that the reticulation of a congruence modular algebra
$A$ is a bounded distributive lattice $L(A)$ whose prime spectrum is
homeomorphic with Agliano's prime spectrum of $A$).
  Almost all results regarding $CBLP$ are obtained in the setting of
semidegenerate congruence modular algebras having the property that the
reticulations preserve the Boolean center.
  The paper contains several properties of congruences with $CBLP$. Among the
results we mention a characterization theorem of congruences with $CBLP$. We
achieve various conditions that ensure $CBLP$. Our results can be applied to a
lot of types of concrete structures: commutative rings, $l$-groups,

However, factors like vague boundaries or small regions dissociated from viable
tumour areas make it a challenging task. Considering the usefulness of
multi-scale features in various vision-related tasks, we present a
structure-aware scale-adaptive feature selection method for efficient and
accurate cancer segmentation. Based on a segmentation network with a popular
encoder-decoder architecture, a scale-adaptive module is proposed for selecting
more robust features to represent the vague, non-rigid boundaries. Furthermore,
a structural similarity metric is proposed for better tissue structure
awareness to deal with small region segmentation. In addition, advanced designs
including several attention mechanisms and the selective-kernel convolutions
are applied to the baseline network for comparative study purposes. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed structure-aware scale-adaptive
networks achieve outstanding performance on liver cancer segmentation when
compared to top ten submitted results in the challenge of PAIP 2019. Further
evaluation on colorectal cancer segmentation shows that the scale-adaptive
module improves the baseline network or outperforms the other excellent designs
of attention mechanisms when considering the tradeoff between efficiency and
accuracy.

  Gr\""{o}tzsch's theorem",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of the circular coloring of signed graphs is a recent one that
simultaneously extends both notions of the circular coloring of graphs and
$0$-free coloring of signed graphs. A circular $r$-coloring of a signed graph
$(G, \sigma)$ is to assign points of a circle of circumference $r$, $r\geq 2$,
to the vertices of $G$ such that vertices connected by a positive edge are at
circular distance at least $1$ and vertices connected by a negative edge are at
circular distance at most $\frac{r}{2}-1$. The infimum of all $r$ for which
$(G, \sigma)$ admits a circular $r$-coloring is said to be the circular
chromatic number of $(G, \sigma)$ and is denoted by $\chi_c(G, \sigma)$. For
any rational number $r=\frac{p}{q}$, two notions of circular cliques are
presented corresponding to the edge-sign preserving homomorphism and the
switching homomorphism.
  It is also shown that the restriction of the study of circular chromatic
numbers to the class of signed bipartite simple graphs already captures the
study of circular chromatic numbers of graphs via basic graph operations, even
though the circular chromatic number of every signed bipartite graph is bounded
above by $4$.
  In this work, we consider the restriction of the circular chromatic number to
this class of signed graphs and construct signed bipartite circular cliques
with respect to both notions of homomorphisms. We then present reformulations
of the $4$-Color Theorem and the Gr\""otzsch theorem. As a bipartite analogue of
Gr\""otzsch's theorem, we prove that every signed bipartite planar graph of
negative girth at least $6$ has circular chromatic number at most $3$.

Multi-Transformer is a variant of Transformer models, which have already been
successfully applied in the field of natural language processing. Indeed, this

volatility forecasting models. The empirical results obtained in this paper
suggest that the hybrid models based on Multi-Transformer and Transformer

For a given image, there
may be multiple plausible segmentation hypotheses, and physicians will often
disagree on lesion and organ boundaries. To be suited to real-world
application, automatic segmentation systems must be able to capture this
uncertainty and variability. Thus far, this has been addressed by building deep
learning models that, through dropout, multiple heads, or variational
inference, can produce a set - infinite, in some cases - of plausible
segmentation hypotheses for any given image. However, in clinical practice, it
may not be practical to browse all hypotheses. Furthermore, recent work shows
that segmentation variability plateaus after a certain number of independent
annotations, suggesting that a large enough group of physicians may be able to
represent the whole space of possible segmentations. Inspired by this, we
propose a simple method to obtain soft labels from the annotations of multiple
physicians and train models that, for each image, produce a single
well-calibrated output that can be thresholded at multiple confidence levels,
according to each application's precision-recall requirements. We evaluated our
method on the MICCAI 2021 QUBIQ challenge, showing that it performs well across
multiple medical image segmentation tasks, produces well-calibrated
predictions, and, on average, performs better at matching physicians'
predictions than other physicians.

function of temperature, from room temperature to 200 K above their melting
point. The predictive capability of the proposed framework is discussed based
on a comparison with available experimental data. The effect of equilibrium and
non-equilibrium microstructural parameters (i.e. phase fraction, phase

segmenting volumetric medical images. Compared with the 2D counterparts, 3D
convolutions can capture the spatial context in three dimensions. Nevertheless,
models employing 3D convolutions introduce more trainable parameters and are
more computationally complex, which may lead easily to model overfitting
especially for medical applications with limited available training data. This
paper aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 3D convolutions by
introducing a novel Group Shift Pointwise Convolution (GSP-Conv). GSP-Conv
simplifies 3D convolutions into pointwise ones with 1x1x1 kernels, which
dramatically reduces the number of model parameters and FLOPs (e.g. 27x fewer
than 3D convolutions with 3x3x3 kernels). Na\""ive pointwise convolutions with
limited receptive fields cannot make full use of the spatial image context. To
address this problem, we propose a parameter-free operation, Group Shift (GS),
which shifts the feature maps along with different spatial directions in an
elegant way. With GS, pointwise convolutions can access features from different
spatial locations, and the limited receptive fields of pointwise convolutions
can be compensated. We evaluate the proposed methods on two datasets, PROMISE12
and BraTS18. Results show that our method, with substantially decreased model
complexity, achieves comparable or even better performance than models
employing 3D convolutions.

head and neck (HaN) cancers. An essential step of RT planning is the accurate
segmentation of various organs-at-risks (OARs) in HaN CT images. Nevertheless,
segmenting OARs manually is time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone
considering that typical HaN CT images contain tens to hundreds of slices.
Automated segmentation algorithms are urgently required. Recently,
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively investigated on this
task. Particularly, 3D CNNs are frequently adopted to process 3D HaN CT images.
There are two issues with na\""ive 3D CNNs. First, the depth resolution of 3D CT
images is usually several times lower than the in-plane resolution. Direct
employment of 3D CNNs without distinguishing this difference can lead to the
extraction of distorted image features and influence the final segmentation
performance. Second, a severe class imbalance problem exists, and large organs
can be orders of times larger than small organs. It is difficult to
simultaneously achieve accurate segmentation for all the organs. To address
these issues, we propose a novel hybrid CNN that fuses 2D and 3D convolutions
to combat the different spatial resolutions and extract effective edge and
semantic features from 3D HaN CT images. To accommodate large and small organs,
our final model, named OrganNet2.5D, consists of only two instead of the
classic four downsampling operations, and hybrid dilated convolutions are
introduced to maintain the respective field. Experiments on the MICCAI 2015
challenge dataset demonstrate that OrganNet2.5D achieves promising performance

adopted to make decisions without taking into account the uncertainties in
their predictions. More critically, they can be vulnerable to adversarial
examples. Thus, we believe that developing ML systems that take into account
predictive uncertainties and are robust against adversarial examples is a must
for critical, real-world tasks. We start with a case study in retailing. We
propose a robust implementation of the Nerlove-Arrow model using a Bayesian
structural time series model. Its Bayesian nature facilitates incorporating
prior information reflecting the manager's views, which can be updated with
relevant data. However, this case adopted classical Bayesian techniques, such
as the Gibbs sampler. Nowadays, the ML landscape is pervaded with neural
networks and this chapter also surveys current developments in this sub-field.
Then, we tackle the problem of scaling Bayesian inference to complex models and
large data regimes. In the first part, we propose a unifying view of two
different Bayesian inference algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (SG-MCMC) and Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), leading to
improved and efficient novel sampling schemes. In the second part, we develop a
framework to boost the efficiency of Bayesian inference in probabilistic models
by embedding a Markov chain sampler within a variational posterior
approximation. After that, we present an alternative perspective on adversarial
classification based on adversarial risk analysis, and leveraging the scalable
Bayesian approaches from chapter 2. In chapter 4 we turn to reinforcement
learning, introducing Threatened Markov Decision Processes, showing the
benefits of accounting for adversaries in RL while the agent learns.

rapid indexing and archiving. Many existing supervised learning methods for the
KIE task need to feed a large number of labeled samples and learn separate
models for different types of documents. However, collecting and labeling a
large dataset is time-consuming and is not a user-friendly requirement for many
cloud platforms. To overcome these challenges, we propose a deep end-to-end
trainable network for one-shot KIE using partial graph matching. Contrary to
previous methods that the learning of similarity and solving are optimized
separately, our method enables the learning of the two processes in an
end-to-end framework. Existing one-shot KIE methods are either template or
simple attention-based learning approach that struggle to handle texts that are
shifted beyond their desired positions caused by printers, as illustrated in
Fig.1. To solve this problem, we add one-to-(at most)-one constraint such that
we will find the globally optimized solution even if some texts are drifted.
Further, we design a multimodal context ensemble block to boost the performance
through fusing features of spatial, textual, and aspect representations. To
promote research of KIE, we collected and annotated a one-shot document KIE
dataset named DKIE with diverse types of images. The DKIE dataset consists of
2.5K document images captured by mobile phones in natural scenes, and it is the
largest available one-shot KIE dataset up to now. The results of experiments on
DKIE show that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with
recent one-shot and supervised learning approaches. The dataset and proposed
one-shot KIE model will be released soo

protocols use a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish a
session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using
a symmetric cipher. The commonly used asymmetric algorithms include public key
encryption, key exchange and identity-based encryption(IBE). However, the
network security protocols based on classic identity-based encryption do not
have perfect forward security. To solve the problem, we construct the first
quantum IBE (QIBE) scheme based on the learning with errors problem, and prove
that our scheme is fully secure under the random oracle. Moreover, we construct
the quantum circuit of our QIBE scheme and give an estimate of the quantum
resource of our circuit including the numbers of Hadamard gate, phase gate, T
gate, CNOT gate and the total qubits used in the circuit, and conclude that the
quantum resources required by our scheme increase linearly with the number of
bits of the encrypted quantum plaintext. Our scheme exhibits the following
advantages: (i) The classic key generation center (KGC) system still can be
used for our QIBE scheme to generate and distribute the secret identity keys so
that the cost can be reduced when the scheme is implemented. The reason why the
classic KGC can be used is that the public and private keys are in the form of
classic bits. (ii) The network security protocols using a handshake with our
QIBE scheme can provide perfect forward security. In our scheme, the ciphertext
is transmitted in the form of a quantum state that is unknown to the adversary
and therefore cannot be copied and stored. Thus, in the network security
protocols based on our QIBE construction, the adversary cannot decrypt the
previous quantum ciphertext to threat the previous session keys even if the
identity secret key is threatened.

Task 2 (Arabic) asked to (A) rank a given set of Web pages with respect to a
check-worthy claim based on their usefulness for fact-checking that claim, (B)
classify these same Web pages according to their degree of usefulness for
fact-checking the target claim, (C) identify useful passages from these pages,
and (D) use the useful pages to predict the claim's factuality. CheckThat!
provided a full evaluation framework, consisting of data in English (derived
from fact-checking sources) and Arabic (gathered and annotated from scratch)
and evaluation based on mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted
cumulative gain (nDCG) for ranking, and F1 for classification. A total of 47
teams registered to participate in this lab, and fourteen of them actually
submitted runs (compared to nine last year). The evaluation results show that
the most successful approaches to Task 1 used various neural networks and
logistic regression. As for Task 2, learning-to-rank was used by the highest
scoring runs for subtask A, while different classifiers were used in the other
subtasks. We release to the research community all datasets from the lab as
well as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research in the
important tasks of check-worthiness estimation and automatic claim
verification.

ultra-high speed and ultra-low energy consumption because of their binary and
event-driven nature. Therefore, SNNs are expected to have various applications,
including as generative models being running on edge devices to create
high-quality images. In this study, we build a variational autoencoder (VAE)
with SNN to enable image generation. VAE is known for its stability among
generative models; recently, its quality advanced. In vanilla VAE, the latent
space is represented as a normal distribution, and floating-point calculations
are required in sampling. However, this is not possible in SNNs because all
features must be binary time series data. Therefore, we constructed the latent
space with an autoregressive SNN model, and randomly selected samples from its
output to sample the latent variables. This allows the latent variables to
follow the Bernoulli process and allows variational learning. Thus, we build
the Fully Spiking Variational Autoencoder where all modules are constructed
with SNN. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a VAE only
with SNN layers. We experimented with several datasets, and confirmed that it
can generate images with the same or better quality compared to conventional
ANNs. The code is available at https://github.com/kamata1729/FullySpikingVAE

scheme is proposed. The unknown microwave pulse is converted to the optical
domain and then injected into a fiber loop for pulse replication, which makes
it easier to identify the microwave pulse with large pulse repetition interval
(PRI), whereas stimulated Brillouin scattering-based frequency-to-time mapping
(FTTM) is utilized to measure the carrier frequency of the microwave pulse. A
sweep optical carrier is generated and modulated by the unknown microwave pulse
and a continuous-wave single-frequency reference, generating two different
frequency sweep optical signals, which are combined and used as the probe wave
to detect a fixed Brillouin gain spectrum. When the optical signal is detected
in a photodetector, FTTM is realized and the frequency of the microwave pulse
can be determined. An experiment is performed. For a fiber loop containing a
210-m fiber, pulse replication and FTTM of the pulses with a PRI of 20 {\mu}s
and pulse width of 1.20, 1.00, 0.85, and 0.65 {\mu}s are realized. Under a
certain sweep frequency chirp rate of 0.978 THz/s, the measurement errors are
below {\pm}12 and {\pm}5 MHz by using one pair of pulses and multiple pairs of
pulses, respectively. The influence of the sweep frequency chirp rate and pulse
width on the measurement error has also been studied. To a certain extent, the
faster the frequency sweep, the greater the frequency measurement error. For a
specific sweep frequency chirp rate, the measurement error is almost unaffected
by the pulse width to be measured.
