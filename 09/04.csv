calculations of Green's functions in interacting electron systems. Our method
removes noncausality of numerical data by finding causal functions closest to
the data. By testing our method with an exactly calculable model and applying
it to practical dynamical mean-field calculations, we find that
intermediate-frequency behaviors of Green's functions are determined solely by
causality, and noncausal statistical errors are removed very efficiently.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that numerical calculations of the physical branch
of the Luttinger-Ward functional can be stabilized by ensuring causality of the
noninteracting Green's function. Our method and findings provide a basis for
improving stability and efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum
many-body systems.

  method",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose the rhoLENT method, an extension of the unstructured Level Set /
Front Tracking (LENT) method, based on the collocated Finite Volume equation
discretization, that recovers exact numerical stability for the two-phase
momentum convection with a range of density ratios, namely $\rho^-/\rho^+\in
[1, 10000]$. We provide the theoretical basis for the numerical inconsistency
in the collocated finite volume equation discretization of the single-field
two-phase momentum convection. The cause of the numerical inconsistency lies in
the way the cell-centered density is computed in the new time step
($\rho_c^{n+1}$). Specifically, if $\rho_c^{n+1}$ is computed from the
approximation of the fluid interface at $t^{n+1}$, and it is not computed by
solving a mass conservation equation (or its equivalent), the two-phase
momentum convection term will automatically be inconsistently discretized. We
provide the theoretical justification behind using the auxiliary mass
conservation equation to stabilize flows with strong density ratios. The
evaluation of the face-centered (mass flux) density we base on the fundamental
principle of mass conservation, used to model the single-field density,
contrary to the use of different weighted averages of cell-centered
single-field densities and alternative reconstructions of the mass flux density
by other contemporary methods. Implicit discretization of the two-phase
momentum convection term is achieved, removing the CFL stability criterion.
Numerical stability is demonstrated in terms of the relative $L_\infty$
velocity error norm with realistic viscosity and strong surface tension forces.
The stabilization technique in the rhoLENT method is also applicable to other
two-phase flow simulation methods that utilize the collocated unstructured
Finite Volume Method to discretize single-field two-phase Navier-Stokes
Equations.

for the upper atmosphere of the Archean Earth to study the effects of different

of the atmosphere to space. We find that unless CO$_2$ was a major constituent

counteract the faint young Sun and keep the Earth from being completely frozen.
Furthermore, our results indicate that the Sun was most likely born as a slow

constraints on the Sun's activity evolution throughout the solar system's
history. In case that there were yet unknown cooling mechanisms present in the

a point cloud and predict the coordinates of a shape in the linear basis and
the affine transformation which best approximate the input. Both linear models
and neural networks are learned end-to-end using a single reconstruction loss.
The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to many recent deep
approaches which learn feature-based complex shape representations, our model
is explicit and every operation occurs in 3D space. As a result, our linear
shape models can be easily visualized and annotated, and failure cases can be
visually understood. While our main goal is to introduce a compact and

implement individual neuronal activation, in determining the collective

dynamics of two cellular automaton models, commonly used, rather
in-distinctively, as the building blocks of large scale neuronal networks. One
model, due to Greenberg \& Hastings, (GH) can be described by evolution
equations mimicking an integrate-and-fire process, while the other model, due
to Kinouchi \& Copelli, (KC) represents an abstract branching process, where a
single active neuron activates a given number of postsynaptic neurons according
to a prescribed ""activity"" branching ratio. Despite the apparent similarity
between the local neuronal dynamics of the two models, it is shown that they
exhibit very different collective dynamics as a function of the network
topology. The GH model shows qualitatively different dynamical regimes as the
network topology is varied, including transients to a ground (inactive) state,
continuous and discontinuous dynamical phase transitions. In contrast, the KC
model only exhibits a continuous phase transition, independently of the network
topology. These results highlight the importance of paying attention to the
microscopic rules chosen to model the inter-neuronal interactions in large
scale numerical simulations, in particular when the network topology is far
from a mean field description. One such case is the extensive work being done
in the context of the Human Connectome, where a wide variety of types of models

with the aid of STM simulations as Bi$_\text{Te}$ antisites (Bi atoms at the Te
sites) and Mn$_\text{Bi}$ substitutions (Mn atoms at the Bi sites),
respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments further evidence the presence
of cation (Mn-Bi) intermixing. Altogether, this affects the distribution of the
Mn atoms, which, inevitably, leads to a deviation of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
magnetic structure from that predicted for the ideal crystal structure. Our
transport measurements suggest that the degree of this deviation varies from
sample to sample. Consistently, the ARPES/STS experiments reveal that the Dirac
point gap of the topological surface state is different for different
samples/sample cleavages. Our DFT surface electronic structure calculations
show that, due to the predominant localization of the topological surface state
near the Bi layers, Mn$_\text{Bi}$ defects can cause a strong reduction of the
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Dirac point gap, given the recently proved antiparallel
alignment of the Mn$_\text{Bi}$ moments with respect to those of the Mn layer.
Our results provide a key to puzzle out the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Dirac point gap
mystery.

validate three flux-driven 3D fluid-turbulence models: GBS, GRILLIX and

tuning the particle and power source rates to achieve a reasonable match of the
upstream separatrix value of density and electron temperature. We find that the

both in terms of profile shape and absolute magnitude -- while a poorer
agreement is found towards the divertor targets. The match between simulation

discrepancy between simulations and experiment also suggests that the neutral

turbulence models are able to perform simulations of existing devices and
achieve reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. Where disagreement

Canonical thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states provide a promising path to
estimating thermal properties of quantum materials as they neither require
preparation of the full thermal state nor require a growing number of samples

networks (LEARN) for the estimation of quantitative motion- and

  Methods: We train two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to correct motion
artifacts for high-quality estimation of quantitative
$B0$-inhomogeneity-corrected $R_2^\ast$ maps from mGRE sequences. The first
CNN, LEARN-IMG, performs motion correction on complex mGRE images, to enable
the subsequent computation of high-quality motion-free quantitative $R_2^\ast$
(and any other mGRE-enabled) maps using the standard voxel-wise analysis or
machine-learning-based analysis. The second CNN, LEARN-BIO, is trained to
directly generate motion- and $B0$-inhomogeneity-corrected quantitative
$R_2^\ast$ maps from motion-corrupted magnitude-only mGRE images by taking
advantage of the biophysical model describing the mGRE signal decay. We show
that both CNNs trained on synthetic MR images are capable of suppressing motion
artifacts while preserving details in the predicted quantitative $R_2^\ast$
maps. Significant reduction of motion artifacts on experimental in vivo
motion-corrupted data has also been achieved by using our trained models.
  Conclusion: Both LEARN-IMG and LEARN-BIO can enable the computation of
high-quality motion- and $B0$-inhomogeneity-corrected $R_2^\ast$ maps.
LEARN-IMG performs motion correction on mGRE images and relies on the
subsequent analysis for the estimation of $R_2^\ast$ maps, while LEARN-BIO
directly performs motion- and $B0$-inhomogeneity-corrected $R_2^\ast$
estimation. Both LEARN-IMG and LEARN-BIO jointly process all the available
gradient echoes, which enables them to exploit spatial patterns available in
the data. The high computational speed of LEARN-BIO is an advantage that can
lead to a broader clinical application.

along with other youth indicators, their age. Afterwards, we compare the

system alongside its systemic velocity from high resolution spectra.
Additionally, we use TESS photometry to derive the rotational period of the
GJ1284 and its two wide companions. GJ1284 is a binary system located at
approximately 16 pc with an eccentric orbit ($ e = 0.505 $) of 11.83 d period
made up of an M2-M2.5 + M3-M3.5. The revised systemic velocity of $ \gamma =
0.84 \pm 0.14\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1} $ suggests that it is a member of the Local
Association. The kinematics together with other activity and youth indicators
imply an age of 110-800 Myr for this system and its two companions. The
isochronal ages derived from the comparison of the photometry with several
evolutionary models are younger than the age estimated from the activity
indicators for the three co-moving systems. The masses for the components of
GJ1284, derived from their luminosity and age using the different models, are
not consistent with the masses derived from the photometry, except for the
PARSEC models, but are compatible with dynamical masses of double-lined
eclipsing binaries with similar ages and spectral types. The effect of magnetic
activity in the form of spots can reconcile to some extent the photometric and
dynamical masses, but is not considered in most of the evolutionary models.

Yet, the decisions of profit-maximizing operators running large autonomous
fleets could have a negative impact on other stakeholders, e.g., by
disproportionately cannibalizing public transport, and therefore could make the
transportation system even less efficient and sustainable. A careful analysis
of these tradeoffs requires modeling the main modes of transportation,
including public transport, within a unified framework. In this paper, we
propose such a framework, which allows us to study the interplay among mobility
service providers, public transport authorities, and customers. Our framework
combines a graph-theoretic network model for the transportation system with a
game-theoretic market model in which mobility service providers are
profit-maximizers, while customers select individually-optimal transportation
options. We apply our framework to data for the city of Berlin, Germany, and

  In our method, we exploit the second-order information of the cost function
and the constraints to suggest a new Riemannian metric on the Grassmann
manifold.
  We use a Riemmanian coordinate descent method for solving the problem, and
also provide a local convergence analysis matching that of the coordinate
descent method in the Euclidean setting. We also show that each step of our
method with unit step-size is actually a step of the orthogonal iteration
algorithm. Experimental results show the computational advantage of our method

describe experimental data. A common approach is to manually create
mathematical models of natural phenomena using domain knowledge, and then fit
these models to data. In contrast, machine-learning algorithms automate the
construction of accurate data-driven models while consuming large amounts of

on the functional form of a learned model (e.g., nonnegativity) has been
explored in the literature. However, finding models that are consistent with
prior knowledge expressed in the form of general logical axioms (e.g.,
conservation of energy) is an open problem. We develop a method to enable
principled derivations of models of natural phenomena from axiomatic knowledge
and experimental data by combining logical reasoning with symbolic regression.
We demonstrate these concepts for Kepler's third law of planetary motion,
Einstein's relativistic time-dilation law, and Langmuir's theory of adsorption,
automatically connecting experimental data with background theory in each case.
We show that laws can be discovered from few data points when using formal
logical reasoning to distinguish the correct formula from a set of plausible
formulas that have similar error on the data. The combination of reasoning with
machine learning provides generalizeable insights into key aspects of natural

performs better in applications where recent data is more important or more

of approximating symmetric norms (a norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is invariant
under sign-flips and coordinate-wise permutations) in the sliding window model,
where only the $W$ most recent updates define the underlying frequency vector.
Whereas standard norm estimation algorithms for sliding windows rely on the
smooth histogram framework of Braverman and Ostrovsky (FOCS 2007), analyzing
the smoothness of general symmetric norms seems to be a challenging obstacle.
Instead, we observe that the symmetric norm streaming algorithm of Braverman
et. al. (STOC 2017) can be reduced to identifying and approximating the
frequency of heavy-hitters in a number of substreams. We introduce a
heavy-hitter algorithm that gives a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to each of the
reported frequencies in the sliding window model, thus obtaining the first
algorithm for general symmetric norm estimation in the sliding window model.
Our algorithm is a universal sketch that simultaneously approximates all
symmetric norms in a parametrizable class and also improves upon the smooth
histogram framework for estimating $L_p$ norms, for a range of large $p$.
Finally, we consider the problem of overconstrained linear regression problem
in the case that loss function that is an Orlicz norm, a symmetric norm that
can be interpreted as a scale-invariant version of $M$-estimators. We give the
first sublinear space algorithms that produce $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate

measurements of isolated wakes generated by wind turbines installed at an
onshore wind farm are leveraged to characterize the variability of the wake
mean velocity and turbulence intensity during typical operations encompassing a
breadth of atmospheric stability regimes, levels of power capture, and, in
turn, rotor thrust coefficients. For the statistical analysis of the wake
velocity fields, the LiDAR measurements are clustered through a k-means
algorithm, which enables to identify of the most representative realizations of
the wind turbine wakes while avoiding the imposition of thresholds for the
various wind and turbine parameters, which can be biased by preconceived, and
potentially incorrect, notions. Considering the large number of LiDAR samples
collected to probe the wake velocity field over the horizontal plane at hub
height, the dimensionality of the experimental dataset is reduced by projecting
the LiDAR data on an intelligently-truncated basis obtained with the proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD). The coefficients of only five physics-informed
POD modes, which are considered sufficient to reproduce the observed wake
variability, are then injected in the k-means algorithm for clustering the
LiDAR dataset. The analysis of the clustered LiDAR data, and the associated
SCADA and meteorological data, enables the study of the variability of the wake
velocity deficit, wake extent, and wake-added turbulence intensity for

problem for the development of quantum technologies. For time-independent
systems, an (often unique) steady state describes the average physics once all
the transient processes have faded out, but interesting quantum properties can
emerge at intermediate timescales. Given a Lindblad master equation, these
properties are encoded in the spectrum of the Liouvillian whose
diagonalization, however, is a challenge even for small-size quantum systems.
Here, we propose a new method to efficiently provide the Liouvillian spectral
decomposition. We call this method an Arnoldi-Lindblad time evolution, because
it exploits the algebraic properties of the Liouvillian superoperator to
efficiently construct a basis for the Arnoldi iteration problem. The advantage
of our method is double: (i) It provides a faster-than-the-clock method to
efficiently obtain the steady state, meaning that it produces the steady state
through time evolution shorter than needed for the system to reach
stationarity. (ii) It retrieves the low-lying spectral properties of the
Liouvillian with a minimal overhead, allowing to determine both which quantum
properties emerge and for how long they can be observed in a system. This
method is general and model-independent, and lends itself to the study of large
systems where the determination of the Liouvillian spectrum can be numerically
demanding but the time evolution of the density matrix is still doable. Our
results can be extended to time evolution with a time-dependent Liouvillian. In
particular, our method works for Floquet (i.e., periodically driven) systems,
where it allows not only to construct the Floquet map for the slow-decaying
processes, but also to retrieve the stroboscopic steady state and the
eigenspectrum of the Floquet map. We apply our method to several examples.

characteristic Mach number in its velocity fluctuations. Besides the notion
that there are different mechanism driving turbulence and angular momentum
transport in a disk, we also find that within a single instability mechanism,
here the Vertical Shear Instability, stresses do not linearly scale with
thermal pressure. Here we demonstrate in numerical simulations the effect of
the gas temperature gradient and the thermal relaxation time on the average
stresses generated in the non-linear stage of the instability. We find that the
stresses scale with the square of the exponent of the radial temperature
profile at least for a range of $d \log T /d \log R = [-0.5, -1]$, beyond which
the pressure scale height varies too much over the simulation domain, to
provide clear results. Stresses are also dependent on thermal relaxation times,

novel gradient expansion formalism that describes the time evolution of a set
of bilinear electromagnetic functions in position space. Based on this
formalism, we are able to simultaneously account for two important effects that
have thus far been mostly treated in isolation: (i) the backreaction of the
produced gauge fields on the evolution of the inflaton field and (ii) the
Schwinger pair production of charged particles in the strong gauge-field
background. This allows us to show that the suppression of the gauge-field
production due to the Schwinger effect can prevent the backreaction in
scenarios in which it would otherwise be relevant. Moreover, we point out that
the induced current, $\boldsymbol{J} = \sigma \boldsymbol{E}$, also dampens the
Bunch-Davies vacuum fluctuations deep inside the Hubble horizon. We describe
this suppression by a new parameter $\Delta$ that is related to the time
integral over the conductivity $\sigma$ which hence renders the description of
the entire system inherently nonlocal in time. Finally, we demonstrate how our
formalism can be used to construct highly accurate solutions for the mode
functions of the gauge field in Fourier space, which serves as a starting point
for a wealth of further phenomenological applications, including the
phenomenology of primordial perturbations and baryogenesis.

CREAK, a testbed for commonsense reasoning about entity knowledge, bridging
fact-checking about entities (Harry Potter is a wizard and is skilled at riding
a broomstick) with commonsense inferences (if you're good at a skill you can
teach others how to do it). Our dataset consists of 13k human-authored English

our experiments, we focus on the closed-book setting and observe that a

Recently, Dirac
materials with four-fold rotation symmetry have been shown to exhibit a higher
order bulk-hinge correspondence: they display ""higher order Fermi arcs,"" which
are localized on hinges where two surfaces meet and connect the projections of
the bulk Dirac points. In this paper, we classify higher order Fermi arcs for
Dirac semimetals protected by a rotation symmetry and the product of
time-reversal and inversion. Such Dirac points can be either linear in all
directions or linear along the rotation axis and quadratic in other directions.
By computing the filling anomaly for momentum-space planes on either side of
the Dirac point, we find that all linear Dirac points exhibit higher order
Fermi arcs terminating at the projection of the Dirac point, while the Dirac
points that are quadratic in two directions lack such higher order Fermi arcs.
When higher order Fermi arcs do exist, they obey either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
(four-fold rotation axis) or $\mathbb{Z}_3$ (three- or six-fold rotation axis)
group structure. Finally, we build two models with six-fold symmetry to
illustrate the cases with and without higher order Fermi arcs. We predict
higher order Fermi arcs in Na$_3$Bi.

an important part in cosmological studies, measures the projected mass of all
matter along the line-of-sight, and therefore changes with the orientation of
the cluster. Studies suggest that the shape of the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG) in the centre of the cluster traces the underlying halo shape, enabling a
method to account for projection effects. We use 324 simulated clusters at four
redshifts between 0.1 and 0.6 from `The Three Hundred Project' to quantify
correlations between the orientation and shape of the BCG and the halo. We find
that haloes and their embedded BCGs are aligned, with an average $\sim$20
degree angle between their major axes. The bias in weak lensing cluster mass
estimates correlates with the orientation of both the halo and the BCG.
Mimicking observations, we compute the projected shape of the BCG, as a measure
of the BCG orientation, and find that it is most strongly correlated to the
weak-lensing mass for relaxed clusters. We also test a 2-dimensional cluster
relaxation proxy measured from BCG mass isocontours. The concentration of
stellar mass in the projected BCG core compared to the total stellar mass
provides an alternative proxy for the BCG orientation. We find that the
concentration does not correlate to the weak-lensing mass bias, but does
correlate with the true halo mass. These results indicate that the BCG shape
and orientation for large samples of relaxed clusters can provide information
to improve weak-lensing mass estimates.

paper, we explore cooling and heating functions between $5\leq z \leq10$ in

corresponding ones from charged dilepton rare $b$-decay or Drell-Yan data, for
$e \tau$ and $\tau \tau$ final states, as well as for $\mu \tau$ ones in $b \to

four-fermion operators with top quarks. Implications for ditau modes $b \to s

the interplay between dineutrinos and charged dileptons allows for concrete,
novel tests of lepton universality in rare $B$-decays. Performing a global fit
to $b \to s \,\mu^+ \mu^-, \,s \gamma$ transitions we find that lepton
universality predicts the ratio of the $B^0 \to K^{*0} \,\nu \bar \nu$ to $B^0

be within 1.7 to 2.6 (1.6 to 2.4) at $1\,\sigma$, a region that includes the
standard model, and that can be narrowed with improved charged dilepton data.
There is sizable room outside this region where universality is broken and that
can be probed with the Belle II experiment. Using results of a fit to $B^0 \to

we know that UDGs are red and quiescent in groups and clusters while their

environmental effects as main culprit. However, this scenario is challenged by
recent observations of isolated quiescent UDGs in the field. Here we use

These interactions, albeit brief, remove the gas and tidally strip the

UDGs, which are born as star-forming field UDGs occupying dwarf-mass dark
matter haloes. Quiescent UDGs may therefore be found in non-negligible numbers

at larger scales and/or above/below the disc plane. Moreover, our results also
show that molecular outflows, if present, are more likely the result of gas
being lifted near the MBH than production within the wind because of thermal

composites. In phenomenological applications, these can either play the role of
Standard Model particles or lift chiral exotics by partnering with them in mass
terms. As a consequence, the RG flow may change the effective number of chiral
generations, a phenomenon we call generation flow. We provide explicit
constructions of globally consistent string models exhibiting generation flow.
Since such constructions were misclassified in the traditional model searches,
our results imply that more care than usually appreciated has to be taken when

photon, or a pion, reaching the detector provides valuable information. A
similar measurement for a hadronic final state, however, is much more
challenging as one has to extract the relevant information from a collection of
particles. In this paper, we explore various possibilities in defining the time
of a jet through the measurable arrival times of the jet constituents. We find
that a definition of jet time based on a transverse momentum weighted sum of
the times of the constituents has the best performance. For prompt jets, the
performance depends on the jet trajectory. For delayed jets, the performance
depends on the trajectory of the jet, the trajectory of the mother particle,
and the location of the displaced vertex. Compared to the next-best-performing
jet time definition, the transverse momentum weighted sum has roughly a factor
of ten times better jet time resolution. We give a detailed discussion of the
relevant effects and characterize the full geometrical dependence of the
performance. These results highlight the critical importance of using a proper
definition of jet time with its corresponding detector-dependent calibration
and the exciting possibility of deepening our understanding of jets in the time
domain.

The determination of these moments and their systematic uncertainties open new

moments are measured with progressively increasing threshold selections on
$q^2$ starting with a lower value of 3.0 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$ in steps of 0.5
$\mathrm{GeV}^2$ up to a value of 10.0 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The measured moments
are further unfolded, correcting for reconstruction and selection effects as

Lesnick- (or degree-Rips-) complexes to the more general context of
$\vec{v}$-hierarchical clusterings. Layer points provide a compressed
description of a hierarchical clustering by recording only the points where a
cluster changes. For multi-parameter hierarchical clusterings we consider both
a global notion of layer points and layer points in the direction of a single
parameter. An interleaving of hierarchical clusterings of the same set induces
an interleaving of global layer points. In the particular, we consider cases
where a hierarchical clustering of a finite metric space, $Y$, is interleaved
with a hierarchical clustering of some sample $X \subseteq Y$.
  In the second half, we focus on the hierarchical clustering $\pi_0
L_{-,k}(Y)$ for some finite metric space $Y$. When $X \subseteq Y$ satisfies
certain conditions guaranteeing $X$ is well dispersed in $Y$ and the points of
$Y$ are dense around $X$, there is an interleaving of layer points for $\pi_0
L_{-,k}(Y)$ and a truncated version of $L_{-,0}(X) = V_{-}(X)$. Under stronger
conditions, this interleaving defines a retract from the layer points for
$\pi_0 L_{-,k}(Y)$ to the layer points for $\pi_0 L_{-,0}(X)$.

distributed sources and create better plans faster. This feature makes
agent-based systems naturally suitable to address the challenges in Supply
Chain Management (SCM). Although agent-based supply chains systems have been
proposed since early 2000; industrial uptake of them has been lagging. The
reasons quoted include the immaturity of the technology, a lack of
interoperability with supply chain information systems, and a lack of trust in
Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we revisit the agent-based supply
chain and review the state of the art. We find that agent-based technology has
matured, and other supporting technologies that are penetrating supply chains;
are filling in gaps, leaving the concept applicable to a wider range of
functions. For example, the ubiquity of IoT technology helps agents ""sense"" the
state of affairs in a supply chain and opens up new possibilities for
automation. Digital ledgers help securely transfer data between third parties,
making agent-based information sharing possible, without the need to integrate
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Learning functionality in agents
enables agents to move beyond automation and towards autonomy. We note this
convergence effect through conceptualising an agent-based supply chain
framework, reviewing its components, and highlighting research challenges that
need to be addressed in moving forward.

infrastructures - robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions that
generate, share, and maintain specific knowledge about the human and natural
worlds. Drawing upon a decade of interviews and ethnography, this article
compares how three astronomy groups capture, process, and archive data, and for
whom. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a mission with a dedicated telescope and
instruments, while the Black Hole Group and Integrative Astronomy Group (both
pseudonyms) are university-based, investigator-led collaborations. Findings are
organized into four themes: how these projects develop and maintain their
workflows; how they capture and archive their data; how they maintain and
repair knowledge infrastructures; and how they use and reuse data products over
time. We found that astronomers encode their research methods in software known
as pipelines. Algorithms help to point telescopes at targets, remove artifacts,
calibrate instruments, and accomplish myriad validation tasks. Observations may
be reprocessed many times to become new data products that serve new scientific
purposes. Knowledge production in the form of scientific publications is the
primary goal of these projects. They vary in incentives and resources to
sustain access to their data products. We conclude that software pipelines are
essential components of astronomical knowledge infrastructures, but are
fragile, difficult to maintain and repair, and often invisible. Reusing data
products is fundamental to the science of astronomy, whether or not those
resources are made publicly available. We make recommendations for sustaining
access to data products in scientific fields such as astronomy.

equivalent to the boundedness of the associated Petri net evolution or,
equivalently, to the finiteness of the number of states reachable from each
initial condition. For networks that do not admit a polyhedral Lyapunov
function, we investigate whether it is possible to enforce polyhedral
structural stability by applying a strong negative feedback on some pinned
nodes: in terms of the Petri net, this is equivalent to turning pinned nodes
into black holes that clear any positive or negative incoming token. If such
nodes are chosen so that the transformed Petri net has bounded discrete
trajectories, then there exists a stabilising pinning control: the biochemical
network becomes Lyapunov stable if a sufficiently strong local negative
feedback is applied to the pinned nodes. These results allow us to structurally
identify the critical nodes to be locally controlled so as to ensure the
stability of the whole network.

successfully in a wide range of fields, including fluid mechanics, robotics,

noise sensitivity and issues related to Krylov space closure when modeling
nonlinear systems. Here, we investigate the combination of noise and
nonlinearity in a controlled setting, by studying a class of systems with
linear latent dynamics which are observed via multinomial observables. Our
numerical models include system and measurement noise. We explore the
influences of dataset metrics, the spectrum of the latent dynamics, the
normality of the system matrix, and the geometry of the dynamics. Our results
show that even for these very mildly nonlinear conditions, DMD methods often
fail to recover the spectrum and can have poor predictive ability. Our work is
motivated by our experience modeling multilegged robot data, where we have
encountered great difficulty in reconstructing time series for oscillatory
systems with slow transients, which decay only slightly faster than a period.

classical optimization algorithms to solve hard problems. However, VQAs are
still slow relative to their classical counterparts. Hence, improving the

expected perform better as the problem sizes increase, increasing their

circuit-level concurrency provides a means to increase the performance of
variational quantum algorithms on noisy quantum computers. This involves
mapping multiple instances of the same circuit (program) onto the quantum
computer at the same time, which allows multiple samples in a variational
quantum algorithm to be gathered in parallel for each training iteration. We
demonstrate that this technique provides a linear increase in training speed
when increasing the number of concurrently running quantum circuits.
Furthermore, even with pessimistic error rates concurrent quantum circuit
sampling can speed up the quantum approximate optimization algorithm by up to

the process-induced residual stresses that are formed from resin chemical
shrinkage during the curing process. These residual stresses within the
composite material ultimately result in reduced durability and residual
deformations of the final product. Polybenzoxazine (PBZ) polymer resins have
demonstrated near-zero volumetric shrinkage during the curing process. Although
the low shrinkage of PBZ is promising in terms of reduced process-induced
residual stresses, little is known about the physical causes. In this work,
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed with a reactive force field
to predict physical properties (gelation point, evolution of network, mass
density, volumetric shrinkage) and mechanical properties (Bulk modulus, Shear
modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, Yield strength) as a function of
crosslinking density. The MD modeling procedure is validated herein using
experimental measurements of the modeled PBZ resin. The results of this study
are used to provide a physical understanding of the zero-shrinkage phenomenon
of PBZ. This information is also a critical input to future process modeling

factorization distributes the tensor computation to multiple workers under the

decoupling the hand-mesh reconstruction task into three stages: a joint stage
to predict hand joints and segmentation; a mesh stage to predict a rough hand
mesh; and a refine stage to fine-tune it with an offset mesh for mesh-image
alignment. With careful design in the network structure and in the loss

diboride superconductor, MgB2 structure alpha-MoB2 under pressure with Tc up to

electron-phonon coupling in intermetallic compounds. We establish that MoB2 is
a phonon-mediated superconductor but has little in common with MgB2 (Tc=40 K at
zero pressure). MoB2 is a strongly metallic, three dimensional, multi-Fermi
surface material, becoming of additional interest because it displays a
frequency separation of Mo and B vibrations that mirrors that of metal
superhydrides with Tc approaching room temperature. This separation, which is
unusual in intermetallic compounds, allows an analysis separately for Mo and B
providing, amongst the other parameters essential for understanding phonon
coupling, the matrix elements for scattering by the individual atoms. Strong
coupling (lambda(Mo)=1.48) is provided by Mo (total lambda=1.67). A factor of
15 weaker coupling to each B atom is compensated by that coupling being to mean
high frequency modes around 85-90 meV (maximum of 140 meV), versus 18-20 meV
for Mo. As a result, B enhances Tc by 43% over the Mo-only value, to 33 K,
corresponding to the experimental value. These results provide a guideline for
designing higher Tc materials from a cooperation of strong coupling from heavy
atoms with weakly coupled light atoms. The new high Tc paradigm discovered here

content to help combat disinformation, harassment, and abuse. One common
approach is to check user content for similarity against a server-side database
of problematic items. However, this method fundamentally endangers user
privacy. Instead, we target client-side detection, notifying only the users
when such matches occur to warn them against abusive content. Our solution is
based on privacy-preserving similarity testing. Existing approaches rely on
expensive cryptographic protocols that do not scale well to large databases and
may sacrifice the correctness of the matching. To contend with this challenge,
we propose and formalize the concept of similarity-based bucketization~(SBB).
With SBB, a client reveals a small amount of information to a database-holding
server so that it can generate a bucket of potentially similar items. The
bucket is small enough for efficient application of privacy-preserving
protocols for similarity. To analyze the privacy risk of the revealed
information, we introduce a framework for measuring an adversary's confidence
in inferring a predicate about the client input correctly. We develop a
practical SBB protocol for image content, and evaluate its client privacy
guarantee with real-world social media data. We then combine SBB with various
similarity protocols, showing that the combination with SBB provides a speedup
of at least 29x on large-scale databases compared to that without, while
retaining correctness of over 95%.

the bone is x-ray scanned with the static load present, with and without the
iodine. The resulting distribution in a selected 2D plane is numerically
evaluated using a discrete Radon's inverse transform. The result suggests that
iodine is a useful constituent with a good attenuation effect on the x-ray beam
and clearly reveals the temporal distribution of its transport through the
bone. It further result shows some indication that stress does affect the
iodine distribution.

to the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses
and mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for
training these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem
unsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a
method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating
synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method
relies on SparkAR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to
create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different
colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of
445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254
(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at
https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces
significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by
asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets
designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,
ArcFace) trained on our enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform
equivalent systems trained on original data sets (containing faces without
masks) or competing data sets (containing masks generated by related methods),
when the test benchmarks contain masked faces.

assistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the
robot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the
human know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on
conveying intent: for instance, upon legible motions or gestures to indicate
what the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference
requires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should
also display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human
teacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this paper we propose a
multimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both
passive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich
augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and
attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's
teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must
infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive
and active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when
and which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active
feedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an
in-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how
efficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount
of time humans spend interacting with the robot. Videos here:

$<5\sigma$) sources in 101 lensing cluster fields. Across a CANDELS/Wide-like
survey area of $\sim$648 arcmin$^2$ (effectively $\sim$221 arcmin$^2$ in the
source plane), we have securely discovered 53 sources in the IRAC Channel-2
band (CH2, 4.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$; median CH2$=22.46\pm0.11$ AB mag) that lack
robust HST/WFC3-IR F160W counterparts. The most remarkable source in our
sample, namely ES-009 in the field of Abell 2813, is the brightest H-faint
galaxy at 4.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ known so far ($\mathrm{CH2}=20.48\pm0.03$ AB

$M_\mathrm{star} = 10^{10.3\pm 0.3}$ $M_\odot$), star-forming (median star
formation rate $=100_{-40}^{+60}$ $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$) and dust-obscured
($A_V=2.6\pm0.3$) galaxies around a median photometric redshift of
$z=3.9\pm0.4$. The stellar continua of 14 H-faint galaxies can be resolved in
the CH2 band, suggesting a median circularized effective radius
($R_\mathrm{e,circ}$; lensing corrected) of $1.9\pm0.2$ kpc and $<1.5$ kpc for
the resolved and whole samples, respectively. This is consistent with the sizes
of massive unobscured galaxies at $z\sim4$, indicating that H-faint galaxies
represent the dusty tail of the distribution of a wider galaxy population.
Comparing with the ALMA dust continuum sizes of similar galaxies reported
previously, we conclude that the heavy dust obscuration in H-faint galaxies is
related to the compactness of both stellar and dust continua
($R_\mathrm{e,circ}\sim 1$ kpc). These H-faint galaxies make up
$16_{-7}^{+13}$% of the galaxies in the stellar mass range of
$10^{10}-10^{11.2}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=3\sim5$, contributing to $8_{-4}^{+8}$% of

to use four very large sets of student data made available recently from four
distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results include a new ML approach

improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve improved
accuracy by introducing new features that can be easily computed from
conventional question-response logs (e.g., the pattern in the student 's most
recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history
that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., features such as which video
segments the student watched, or skipped) as well as information about
prerequisite structure in the curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized
SP models for different aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early
versus later segments of the student history), then combine these specialized
models to create a group prediction of the SP. Taken together, these
innovations yield an average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.808
compared to the previous best logistic regression approach score of 0.767, and
also outperforming state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we
observe consistent improvements from each of our three methodological

utility and likely to produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as

loading directions; for triangle and square with symmetrical tips, the maximum
thermoelectric and stress concentration reach the maximum or minimum when the
loading direction is parallel to or perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the

sequence that is indicative of probable Seyfert galaxies - BL Lacs - FSRQs
unification. We discovered that Seyfert galaxies, BL Lacs and FSRQs share
similar emission characteristics in X-ray luminosity (LX-ray), suggestive of
the fundamental connection while the {\gamma}-ray and radio luminosities
(L{\gamma}-ray and Lradio) of Seyfert galaxies are the least powerful,
signifying an evolving structure. From the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test (K-S test), we found that Seyfert galaxies differ from the blazar
subclasses in Lradio while there is no significant difference between them in
LX-ray and L{\gamma}-ray which implies that high energy emissions in Seyfert
galaxies and blazar subclasses may come from the same emission mechanism.
Significant positive correlations exist between the high energy luminosities
(X-ray and {\gamma}-ray bands) and the low energy component (radio) within the

against a target concept, promises to uncover public opinion from large streams
of social media data. Yet even human annotation of social media content does
not always capture ""stance"" as measured by public opinion polls. We demonstrate
this by directly comparing an individual's self-reported stance to the stance
inferred from their social media data. Leveraging a longitudinal public opinion
survey with respondent Twitter handles, we conducted this comparison for 1,129
individuals across four salient targets. We find that recall is high for both
""Pro"" and ""Anti"" stance classifications but precision is variable in a number
of cases. We identify three factors leading to the disconnect between text and
author stance: temporal inconsistencies, differences in constructs, and
measurement errors from both survey respondents and annotators. By presenting a
framework for assessing the limitations of stance detection models, this work
provides important insight into what stance detection truly measures.

largest-scale empirical study on adversarial attacks and defenses in SR,
involving 23 defenses, 15 attacks and 4 attack settings. Our study provides
lots of useful findings that may advance future research: such as (1) all the
transformations slightly degrade accuracy on benign examples and their
effectiveness vary with attacks; (2) most transformations become less effective
under adaptive attacks, but some transformations become more effective; (3) few
transformations combined with adversarial training yield stronger defenses over
some but not all attacks, while our feature-level transformation combined with
adversarial training yields the strongest defense over all the attacks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate capabilities and advantages of SEC4SR which

explorations on an effective training strategy for the saliency network and
accurate matches between image-level annotations and salient objects are still
inadequate. In this work, 1) we propose a self-calibrated training strategy by
explicitly establishing a mutual calibration loop between pseudo labels and
network predictions, liberating the saliency network from error-prone
propagation caused by pseudo labels. 2) we prove that even a much smaller
dataset (merely 1.8% of ImageNet) with well-matched annotations can facilitate
models to achieve better performance as well as generalizability. This sheds
new light on the development of WSOD and encourages more contributions to the
community. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
all the existing WSOD methods by adopting the self-calibrated strategy only.
Steady improvements are further achieved by training on the proposed dataset.
Additionally, our method achieves 94.7% of the performance of fully-supervised
methods on average. And what is more, the fully supervised models adopting our
predicted results as ""ground truths"" achieve successful results (95.6% for

completion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture
for tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture
entails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF)
building blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each
layer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient
diminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks. Furthermore,
the model employs Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based optimization for fast
convergence in training. Our algorithm is highly efficient for imputing missing

embedding learning and end-to-end tensor models, and outperforms approaches

pulling-pushing flipped forces in the broken symmetry phase, with BNF found at

  Films Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Palladium diselenide (PdSe$_2$), a new type of two-dimensional noble metal
dihalides (NMDCs), has received widespread attention for its excellent
electrical and optoelectronic properties. Herein, high-quality continuous
centimeter-scale PdSe$_2$ films with layers in the range of 3L-15L were grown
using Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method. The absorption spectra and DFT
calculations revealed that the bandgap of the PdSe$_2$ films decreased with
increasing number of layers, which is due to PdSe$_2$ enhancement of orbital
hybridization. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis shows that PdSe2 has
significant layer-dependent optical and dielectric properties. This is mainly
due to the unique strong exciton effect of the thin PdSe$_2$ film in the UV
band. In particular, the effect of temperature on the optical properties of
PdSe$_2$ films was also observed, and the thermo-optical coefficients of
PdSe$_2$ films with different number of layers were calculated. This study
provides fundamental guidance for the fabrication and optimization of
PdSe$_2$-based optoelectronic devices.

optimizing a supply chain. However, in this approach, a model constructed from

the latest data. In this study, we examine the effects of updating models in a
supply chain using a minimal setting. We demonstrate that when each party in

perturbations of their input is becoming a topic of increasing importance. In
this paper, the random GCN is introduced for which a random matrix theory
analysis is possible. This analysis suggests that if the graph is sufficiently
perturbed, or in the extreme case random, then the GCN fails to benefit from
the node features. It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message
passing step in GCNs by adding the node feature kernel to the adjacency matrix
of the graph structure solves this problem. An empirical study of a GCN
utilised for node classification on six real datasets further confirms the
theoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations of the graph structure
can result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer Perceptrons
run on the node features alone. In practice, adding a node feature kernel to
the message passing of perturbed graphs results in a significant improvement of
the GCN's performance, thereby rendering it more robust to graph perturbations.

star-shaped domains with smooth boundary. We also establish two independence
properties. We prove that, even for star-shaped domains with smooth boundaries,
these capacities are independent from the volume. We also prove that the
capacities are mutually independent by constructing, for any $j \in

volume, whose capacities are all equal but the $j^{th}$. The constructions
underlying these results are not exotic. They are convex and concave toric
domains. A key to the progress made here is a significant simplification of the
formulae of Gutt and Hutchings for the capacities of such domains which holds
under an additional symmetry assumption. This simplification allows us to
identify new blind spots of the capacities which are used to construct the
desired examples.

Deep HST and CFHT observations of this nebula reveal three pairs of bipolar
structures and an arc-shaped filament near the western waist of Hb 12. The
existence of nested bipolar lobes together with the presence of H2 knots
suggests that these structures originated from several mass-ejection events

three-dimensional model enabling the visualisation of this PN at various
orientations was constructed. The modelling results show that Hb 12 may
resemble other nested hourglass nebulae, such as Hen 2-320 and M 2-9,
suggesting that this type of PN may be common and the morphologies of PNs are
not so diverse as is shown by their visual appearances. The infrared spectra
show that this PN has a mixed chemistry. We discuss the possible material that

existing methods still cannot ensure to sufficiently learn intra-/inter-modal

attention, the learning of inter-class relationships is neglected. Moreover,
the size of datasets limits the generalization ability of existing methods. To
address the afore-mentioned issues, we propose a novel framework HyCon for

simultaneously perform intra-/inter-modal contrastive learning and
semi-contrastive learning (that is why we call it hybrid contrastive learning),
with which the model can fully explore cross-modal interactions, preserve
inter-class relationships and reduce the modality gap. Besides, a refinement
term is devised to prevent the model falling into a sub-optimal solution.
Moreover, HyCon can naturally generate a large amount of training pairs for
better generalization and reduce the negative effect of limited datasets.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method

resort to pixel-wise loss alone for supervision, which might be insufficient to
fully exploit the visual details from sparse events, thus leading to less

software development methodologies: business-driven development, model-driven

used in a general software development context, but software architects can
also apply them in an SOA-based system. Each XDM typically focus on a specific
aspect that drives its processes and steps. This aspect is indicated by its
label. An evaluation method called qualitative screening mode is used in this
study. XDMs are analysed based on their features to determine the suitability
or support for service-oriented solutions. Criteria used to appraise each
method are taken from SOA characteristics and SOA manifesto points. Of the four
discussed XDMs, business-driven development is the best-suited approach to
implement a service-oriented system shown by its conformity with the selected
assessment criteria. Nevertheless, the other three XDMs have also their own
strengths. Model-driven development is excellent for productivity, event-driven
development is preferential for a quick response and asynchronous work, while
domain-driven development is distinctive to describe problems precisely. The
originality of this research is in the assessment general software development
approaches of XDMs to be applied to SOA approach. The results can help
developers in considering suitable methods to construct a prospective software
system. Previous studies only investigate on methodologies designed

applications over large-scale networks. To alleviate the communication burden,
sign-based optimization algorithms have gained popularity recently in both
industrial and academic communities, which is shown to be closely related to
adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam. Along this line, this paper
investigates faster convergence for a variant of sign-based gradient descent,
called scaled signGD, in three cases: 1) the objective function is strongly
convex; 2) the objective function is nonconvex but satisfies the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality; 3) the gradient is stochastic, called
scaled signGD in this case. For the first two cases, it can be shown that the
scaled signGD converges at a linear rate. For case 3), the algorithm is shown
to converge linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal value when a constant
learning rate is employed, and the algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/k)$
when using a diminishing learning rate, where $k$ is the iteration number. The
results are also extended to the distributed setting by majority vote in a
parameter-server framework. Finally, numerical experiments on logistic
regression are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings.

the increasing tendency of expressing and understanding emotions through images

more challenging since it involves a much higher level of complexity and
ambiguity in human cognitive process. Most of the existing methods adopt deep
learning techniques to extract general features from the whole image,
disregarding the specific features evoked by various emotional stimuli.
Inspired by the \textit{Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R)} emotion model in
psychological theory, we proposed a stimuli-aware VEA method consisting of
three stages, namely stimuli selection (S), feature extraction (O) and emotion
prediction (R). First, specific emotional stimuli (i.e., color, object, face)
are selected from images by employing the off-the-shelf tools. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first time to introduce stimuli selection process into
VEA in an end-to-end network. Then, we design three specific networks, i.e.,
Global-Net, Semantic-Net and Expression-Net, to extract distinct emotional
features from different stimuli simultaneously. Finally, benefiting from the
inherent structure of Mikel's wheel, we design a novel hierarchical
cross-entropy loss to distinguish hard false examples from easy ones in an
emotion-specific manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four public visual
emotion datasets. Ablation study and visualizations further prove the validity
and interpretability of our method.

clockwise (CW) rotational directions. The most important measurable
characteristic of the flagellar motor is its torque versus angular speed
relationship in CCW or CW modes, which is found to be non-symmetrical with each
other, and still, such a phenomenon is not clearly understood.Here, we explain
this asymmetry through a mechanistic model based on the detailed torque
analysis for the rotation of the motor and the revolutionary as well as
spinning motion of the filament and bead. We find out that the asymmetry
results from the conformational changing of the hook due to rotational
switching, rather than any non-symmetric changes in the potential of mean force
generated by the stator-rotor interactions. In CCW mode, when the hook remains
bend and flexible, the revolution motion predominates and the restoring torque
in this motion, originated due to drag, governs the shape of the torque-speed
curve. However, in CW mode, spinning motion dominates as the hook becomes
straight and rigid, and the linear torque-speed relation arises due to the
restoring torque for the drag corresponding to this motion. Our study indicates
the significant role of the hook's conformational change upon the biological
functions of the motor and paves the way for further experimental exploration
on the structural origin of such asymmetry.

computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.

MIMO channel scales proportionally as $\frac{\textrm{SNR}}{4} \log^2

surprising result that the low-SNR capacity of the MIMO fading channel
increases in the presence of keyhole degenerate condition, which is in direct
contrast to the well-known MIMO capacity degradation at high SNR under keyhole
conditions. To explain why rank-deficient keyhole fading channel outperforms
the full-rank MIMO fading channel at sufficiently low-SNR, we remark that the
rank of the MIMO channel matrix has no impact in the low-SNR regime and that
the double-faded (or double-scattering) nature of the keyhole MIMO channel
creates more opportunistic communications at low-SNR when compared with pure
MIMO fading channel which leads to increased capacity. Finally, we also show
that a simple one-bit channel information based on-off power control achieves
this low-SNR capacity; surprisingly, this power adaptation is robust against
both moderate and severe fading for a wide range of low SNR values. These
results also hold for the keyhole MIMO Rayleigh channel as a special case.

network's structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called
RiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module.
RiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of
the network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture
temporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving
object instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in
order to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather

segmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different
weather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The

weather effects compared to other FPN structures. We compare RiWNet to several
other state-of-the-art methods in some challenging datasets, and RiWNet shows
better performance especially under adverse weather conditions.

  Multi-Sensor System","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important preliminary procedure in multi-sensor data fusion is sensor
registration, and the key step in this procedure is to estimate sensor biases
from their noisy measurements. There are generally two difficulties in this
bias estimation problem: one is the unknown target states which serve as the
nuisance variables in the estimation problem, and the other is the highly
nonlinear coordinate transformation between the local and global coordinate
systems of the sensors. In this paper, we focus on the 3-dimensional
asynchronous multi-sensor scenario and propose a weighted nonlinear least
squares (NLS) formulation by assuming that there is a target moving with a
nearly constant velocity. We propose two possible choices of the weighting
matrix in the NLS formulation, which correspond to classical NLS estimation and
maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, respectively. To address the intrinsic
nonlinearity, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for solving
the formulated problem, which alternately updates different kinds of bias
estimates. Specifically, the proposed BCD algorithm involves solving linear LS
problems and nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP)
problems with special structures. Instead of adopting the semidefinite
relaxation technique, we develop a much more computationally efficient
algorithm (with global performance guarantee under certain conditions) to solve
the nonconvex QCQP subproblems. The effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed BCD algorithm are demonstrated via numerical simulations.

high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to
effectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from
multi-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able
to fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)
Due to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to
overcome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep
neural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the
interpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we
propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)
with domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we
construct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity
and physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of
graph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions
for capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention
mechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal
information for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and
MSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant
sleep features. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

truth value of the following proposition: Through evolution, there exists at
least one species that can adapt to any one given environment. To address this
issue, this study attempted to define natural selection from the perspective of
mathematical and physical laws. This study roughly classified biological
activities into molecular, cellular, individual, ecological, and biogeochemical
(atomic) levels according to scale and complexity, and selected typical
phenomena from each level to analyze the relationship between adaptive
evolution and several laws of mathematics and physics. Then, we proposed that
natural selection favors heritable variations that allows organisms to better
use and/or hide the laws in a certain environment. Reproductive advantage is by
far the most obvious consequence of natural selection. Moreover, adaptive
evolution can lead to the emergence of laws that ensures that each law only
controls some properties of organisms. This study found that organisms
significantly influence themselves in all five levels of biological activities,
and the whole biosphere can be considered as a huge and evolution-driven
feedback loop. Organisms can carry more laws than non-living matter, but the
carrying capacity is limited. Therefore, this study's findings suggest that
adaptive evolution makes organisms subject to more laws of mathematics and
physics until the highest carrying capacity is reached.

magnetic flux tubes (MFT) with B~10^7G, starting from tachocline to the surface

and the magnetic O-loop inside the MFT near the tachocline. In this magnetic
O-loop (based on the Kolmogorov turbulent cascade) the axions are converted to
photons, producing the axion origin photons near the tachocline. On the other
hand, high-energy photons from the radiation zone through the axion-photon
oscillations in the O-loop produce the axions of photon origin under the
sunspot. This means that at such strong magnetic fields the Parker-Biermann
cooling effect of MFT develops due to the ""disappearance"" of the Parker's
convective heat transport, and consequently, the temperature in the lower part
of the magnetic tube with the help of the axions of photonic origin near the
tachocline. As a result, a free path for photons of axion origin opens from the
tachocline to the photosphere!
  We show that the high-energy photons passing from the radiation zone turn
into axions, which almost completely eliminates the radiation heating of the
almost empty MFT. A certain flux of photons coming from the radiation zone
through the tachocline, passes through the ""ring"" of a strong magnetic tube by
virtue of convective heating. It allows to determine the velocity and the
lifetime of the MFT before the reconnection, from tachocline to the surface of
the Sun, as well as the rate of the MFT reconnection near the tachocline.
  Finally, we show that the formation of sunspot cycles is is the manifestation
of dark matter -- solar axions in the core of the Sun, whose modulations are
controlled by the 11-year modulation of asymmetric dark matter density in the
solar interior.

tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although
many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the
main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic
forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and
validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of
representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design
a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations
in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We
observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to
catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new
light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning.
Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt
generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.

patients. The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation provides critical
diagnostic and prognostic value for glioma. It is of crucial significance to
non-invasively predict IDH mutation based on pre-treatment MRI. Machine
learning/deep learning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH
mutation using MRI. However, most models neglect the systematic brain
alterations caused by tumor invasion, where widespread infiltration along white
matter tracts is a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an
effective tool to characterize brain organisation, which could be captured by
the graph neural networks (GNN) to more accurately predict IDH mutation.
  Here we propose a method to predict IDH mutation using GNN, based on the
structural brain network of patients. Specifically, we firstly construct a
network template of healthy subjects, consisting of atlases of edges (white
matter tracts) and nodes (cortical/subcortical brain regions) to provide
regions of interest (ROIs). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent
multi-modal MRI features from the ROIs of edges and nodes in patients, to train
a GNN architecture for predicting IDH mutation. The results show that the
proposed method outperforms the baseline models using the 3D-CNN and
3D-DenseNet. In addition, model interpretation suggests its ability to identify
the tracts infiltrated by tumor, corresponding to clinical prior knowledge. In
conclusion, integrating brain networks with GNN offers a new avenue to study
brain lesions using computational neuroscience and computer vision approaches.

squeezed vacuum states on unitary linear interferometers. It is found that the
entanglement of photon pairs over the Schmidt modes is one of the sources of
distinguishability. The distinguishability is quantified by the symmetric part
of the internal state of $n$ pairs of photons, whose normalization $q_{2n}$ is
the probability that $2n$ photons interfere as indistinguishable. For two pairs
of photons $q_{4}=(1+ 2\mathbb{P} )/3$, where $\mathbb{P} $ is the purity of
the squeezed states ($K=1/\mathbb{P} $ is the Schmidt number). For a fixed
purity $\mathbb{P}$, the probability $q_{2n}$ decreases exponentially fast in
$n$. For example, in the experimental Gaussian boson sampling of H.-S.~Zhong
\textit{et al} [Science \textbf{370}, 1460 (2020)], the achieved purity
$\mathbb{P}\approx 0.938$ for the average number of photons $2n\ge 43$ gives
$q_{2n}\lesssim 0.5$, i.e., close to the middle line between $n$
indistinguishable and $n$ distinguishable pairs of photons. In derivation of
all the results the first-order quantization representation based on the
particle decomposition of the Hilbert space of identical bosons serves as an
indispensable tool. The approach can be applied also to the generalized

also galaxies, entail an,enhancement of densities by many orders of magnitude
which occurs through gravitational collapse. The role played by turbulence
during this process is important. Turbulence generates density fluctuations,
exerts a support against gravity and possibly delivers angular momentum. How
turbulence exactly behave during the collapse and get amplified remains a
matter of investigation. Spherical averaging of the fluid equations is carried
out, leading to 1D fluid equations that describe the evolution of mean
quantities in particular the mean radial velocity as well as the mean radial
and transverse turbulent velocities. These equations differ from the ones
usually employed in the literature. We then perform a series of 3D numerical
simulations of collapsing clouds for a wide range of thermal and turbulent
supports with two polytropic equation of state, $P \propto \rho^\Gamma$, with
$\Gamma=1$ and 1.25. For each 3D simulations we perform a series of 1D
simulations using the spherically averaged equations and with the same initial
conditions. By performing a detailed comparison between 3D and 1D simulations,
we can analyse in great details the observed behaviours. Altogether we find
that the two approaches agree remarkably well demonstrating the validity of the
inferred equations although when turbulence is initially strong, major
deviations from spherical geometry certainly preclude quantitative comparisons.
The detailed comparisons lead us to an estimate of the turbulent dissipation
parameter that when the turbulence is initially low, is found to be in good
agreement with previous estimate of non self-gravitating supersonic turbulence.

not has a diverse range of applications, and is consequently of substantial
importance. There are several techniques that address this problem, chiefly by
constructing a product program that makes it easier to derive useful
invariants. A novel addition to these is a technique that uses alignment
predicates to align traces of the two programs, in order to construct a program
alignment automaton. Being guided by predicates is not just beneficial in
dealing with syntactic dissimilarities, but also in staying relevant to the
property. However, there are also drawbacks of a trace-based technique.
Obtaining traces that cover all program behaviors is difficult, and any
under-approximation may lead to an incomplete product program. Moreover, an
indirect construction of this kind is unaware of the missing behaviors, and has
no control over the aforesaid incompleteness. This paper, addressing these
concerns, presents an algorithm to construct the program alignment automaton
directly instead of relying on traces.

  on January 3, 2023",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, by designing a normalized nonmonotone search strategy with the
Barzilai--Borwein-type step-size, a novel local minimax method (LMM), which is
a globally convergent iterative method, is proposed and analyzed to find
multiple (unstable) saddle points of nonconvex functionals in Hilbert spaces.
Compared to traditional LMMs with monotone search strategies, this approach,
which does not require strict decrease of the objective functional value at
each iterative step, is observed to converge faster with less computations.
Firstly, based on a normalized iterative scheme coupled with a local peak
selection that pulls the iterative point back onto the solution submanifold, by
generalizing the Zhang--Hager (ZH) search strategy in the optimization theory
to the LMM framework, a kind of normalized ZH-type nonmonotone step-size search
strategy is introduced, and then a novel nonmonotone LMM is constructed. Its
feasibility and global convergence results are rigorously carried out under the
relaxation of the monotonicity for the functional at the iterative sequences.
Secondly, in order to speed up the convergence of the nonmonotone LMM, a
globally convergent Barzilai--Borwein-type LMM (GBBLMM) is presented by
explicitly constructing the Barzilai--Borwein-type step-size as a trial
step-size of the normalized ZH-type nonmonotone step-size search strategy in
each iteration. Finally, the GBBLMM algorithm is implemented to find multiple
unstable solutions of two classes of semilinear elliptic boundary value
problems with variational structures: one is the semilinear elliptic equations
with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and another is the linear
elliptic equations with semilinear Neumann boundary conditions. Extensive
numerical results indicate that our approach is very effective and speeds up
the LMMs significantly.

describing gravity without self-interaction, based on the Komar density

pedestrians in advance, namely socially aware. While the formation control and
goal assignment for each robot is obtained from a target-centered potential
field constructed using aggregated state information from all the following

problems that have been of particular interest in dynamic complexity theory in
recent years [DKMSZ18, DMVZ18, DKMTVZ20]. Reachability can be maintained with
first-order update formulas, or equivalently in DynFO in general graphs with n
nodes [DKMSZ18], even under O(log n/loglog n) changes per step [DMVZ18]. In the
context of how large the number of changes can be handled, it has recently been
shown [DKMTVZ20] that under a polylogarithmic number of changes, reachability
is in DynFOpar in planar, bounded treewidth, and related graph classes -- in
fact in any graph where small non-zero circulation weights can be computed in
NC.
  We continue this line of investigation and extend the meta-theorem for
reachability to distance and bipartite maximum matching with the same bounds.
These are amongst the most general classes of graphs known where we can
maintain these problems deterministically without using a majority quantifier
and even maintain witnesses. For the bipartite matching result, modifying the
approach from [FGT], we convert the static non-zero circulation weights to
dynamic matching-isolating weights.
  While reachability is in DynFOar under O(log n/loglog n) changes, no such
bound is known for either distance or matching in any non-trivial class of
graphs under non-constant changes. We show that, in the same classes of graphs
as before, bipartite maximum matching is in DynFOar under O(log n/loglog n)
changes per step. En route to showing this we prove that the rank of a matrix
can be maintained in DynFOar, also under O(log n/loglog n) entry changes,
improving upon the previous O(1) bound [DKMSZ18]. This implies similar
extension for the non-uniform DynFO bound for maximum matching in general
graphs and an alternate algorithm for maintaining reachability under O(log
n/loglog n) changes [DMVZ18].

stronger influence on current interaction behavior than past events that
occurred a long time ago--a phenomenon known as ""memory decay"". Previous
studies either predefined a short-run and long-run memory or fixed a parametric
exponential memory using a predefined half-life period. In real-life relational

the past events fades as time goes by. For this reason it is not recommendable
to fix this in an ad hoc manner, but instead we should learn the shape of
memory decay from the observed data. In this paper, a novel semi-parametric

FNO-based architecture to a highly complex CO2-water multiphase problem with
wide ranges of permeability and porosity heterogeneity, anisotropy, reservoir
conditions, injection configurations, flow rates, and multiphase flow
properties. The U-FNO architecture is more accurate in gas saturation and
pressure buildup predictions than the original FNO and a state-of-the-art
convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark. Meanwhile, it has superior data
utilization efficiency, requiring only a third of the training data to achieve
the equivalent accuracy as CNN. U-FNO provides superior performance in highly
heterogeneous geological formations and critically important applications such
as gas saturation and pressure buildup ""fronts"" determination. The trained
model can serve as a general-purpose alternative to routine numerical
simulations of 2D-radial CO2 injection problems with significant speed-ups than
traditional simulators.

staggering pace, with thousands of papers released every month. A large portion
of chemistry literature focuses on new molecules and reactions between
molecules. Most vital information is conveyed through 2-D images of molecules,
representing the underlying molecules or reactions described. In order to
ensure reproducible and machine-readable molecule representations, text-based
molecule descriptors like SMILES and SELFIES were created. These text-based
molecule representations provide molecule generation but are unfortunately
rarely present in published literature. In the absence of molecule descriptors,
the generation of molecule descriptors from the 2-D images present in the
literature is necessary to understand chemistry literature at scale. Successful
methods such as Optical Structure Recognition Application (OSRA), and
ChemSchematicResolver are able to extract the locations of molecules structures
in chemistry papers and infer molecular descriptions and reactions. While
effective, existing systems expect chemists to correct outputs, making them
unsuitable for unsupervised large-scale data mining. Leveraging the task
formulation of image captioning introduced by DECIMER, we introduce IMG2SMI, a
model which leverages Deep Residual Networks for image feature extraction and
an encoder-decoder Transformer layers for molecule description generation.
Unlike previous Neural Network-based systems, IMG2SMI builds around the task of
molecule description generation, which enables IMG2SMI to outperform OSRA-based
systems by 163% in molecule similarity prediction as measured by the molecular
MACCS Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity. Additionally, to facilitate further
research on this task, we release a new molecule prediction dataset. including

in which a number of epigenetic and genetic alterations have accumulated thus
transforming it into a tumor cell. The progeny of such a single benign tumor
cell expands in the tissue and can at some point progress to malignant tumor
cells until a detectable tumor is formed. The dynamics from the early phase of
a single cell to a detectable tumor with billions of tumor cells are complex
and still not fully resolved, not even for the well-known prototype of
multistage carcinogenesis, the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence of colorectal
cancer. Mathematical models of such carcinogenesis are frequently tested and
calibrated based on reported age-specific incidence rates of cancer, but they
usually require calibration of four or more parameters due to the wide range of
processes these models aim to reflect. We present a cell-based model, which
focuses on the competition between wild-type and tumor cells in colonic crypts,
with which we are able reproduce epidemiological incidence rates of colon
cancer. Additionally, the fraction of cancerous tumors with precancerous
lesions predicted by the model agree with clinical estimates. The
correspondence between model and reported data suggests that the fate of tumor
development is majorly determined by the early phase of tumor growth and
progression long before a tumor becomes detectable. Due to the focus on the
early phase of tumor development, the model has only a single fit parameter,
the time scale set by an effective replacement rate of stem cells in the crypt.
We find this effective rate to be considerable smaller than the actual
replacement rate, which implies that the time scale is limited by the processes
succeeding clonal conversion of crypts.

detection models to detecting objects from unseen categories, has emerged as a
new challenge in computer vision. Most existing approaches tackle the ZSD task
with a strict mapping-transfer strategy, which may lead to suboptimal ZSD
results: 1) the learning process of those models ignores the available unseen
class information, and thus can be easily biased towards the seen categories;
2) the original visual feature space is not well-structured and lack of
discriminative information. To address these issues, we develop a novel
Semantics-Guided Contrastive Network for ZSD, named ContrastZSD, a detection
framework that first brings contrastive learning mechanism into the realm of
zero-shot detection. Particularly, ContrastZSD incorporates two
semantics-guided contrastive learning subnets that contrast between
region-category and region-region pairs respectively. The pairwise contrastive
tasks take advantage of additional supervision signals derived from both ground
truth label and pre-defined class similarity distribution. Under the guidance
of those explicit semantic supervision, the model can learn more knowledge
about unseen categories to avoid the bias problem to seen concepts, while
optimizing the data structure of visual features to be more discriminative for
better visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments are conducted on two
popular benchmarks for ZSD, i.e., PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Results show that our
method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on both ZSD and generalized
ZSD tasks.

advertisement and label each segment on various dimensions, such as
presentation form, scene, and style. Different from real-life videos, video
advertisements contain sufficient and useful multi-modal content like caption
and speech, which provides crucial video semantics and would enhance the
structuring process. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal encoder to learn
multi-modal representation from video advertisements by interacting between
video-audio and text. Based on multi-modal representation, we then apply
Boundary-Matching Network to generate temporal proposals. To make the proposals
more accurate, we refine generated proposals by scene-guided alignment and
re-ranking. Finally, we incorporate proposal located embeddings into the
introduced multi-modal encoder to capture temporal relationships between local
features of each proposal and global features of the whole video for
classification. Experimental results show that our method achieves
significantly improvement compared with several baselines and Rank 1 on the

assimilation system: first because model field are in better agreement with
high resolution observations, then the corrections are better sustained and,
with ensemble data assimilation, the forecast error covariances are improved.
However, resolution increase is associated with a cubical increase of the
computational costs. Here we are testing an approach inspired from images
super-resolution techniques and called ""Super-resolution data assimilation""
(SRDA). Starting from a low-resolution forecast, a neural network (NN) emulates
a high-resolution field that is then used to assimilate high-resolution
observations. We apply the SRDA to a quasi-geostrophic model representing
simplified surface ocean dynamics, with a model resolution up to four times
lower than the reference high-resolution and we use the Ensemble Kalman Filter
data assimilation method. We show that SRDA outperforms the low-resolution data
assimilation approach and a SRDA version with cubic spline interpolation
instead of NN. The NN's ability to anticipate the systematic differences
between low and high resolution model dynamics explains the enhanced
performance, for example by correcting the difference of propagation speed of
eddies. Increasing the computational cost by 55\% above the LR data
assimilation system (using a 25-members ensemble), the SRDA reduces the errors
by 40\% making the performance very close to the HR system (16\% larger,
compared to 92\% larger for the LR EnKF). The reliability of the ensemble
system is not degraded by SRDA.

deformations with high fidelity. As piezoresistive strain gauges are
aggressively being scaled down for applications in nanotechnology, it has
become critical to investigate their physical attributes at different limits.
Here, we describe an experimental approach for studying the piezoresistive
gauge factor of a gold thin-film nanoresistor as a function of frequency. The
nanoresistor is fabricated lithographically near the anchor of a nanomechanical
doubly-clamped beam resonator. As the resonator is driven to resonance in one
of its normal modes, the nanoresistor is exposed to frequency-dependent strains
of {$\varepsilon \lesssim 10^{-5}$} in the $4-36~\rm MHz$ range. We calibrate
the strain using optical interferometry and measure the resistance changes
using a radio-frequency mix-down technique. The piezoresistive gauge factor
$\gamma$ of our lithographic gold nanoresistors is $\gamma \approx 3.6$ at 4
MHz, in agreement with comparable macroscopic thin metal film resistors in
previous works. However, our $\gamma$ values increase monotonically with
frequency and reach $\gamma \approx 15$ at 36 MHz. We discuss possible physics
that may give rise to this unexpected frequency dependence.

existing works manage to jointly solve them in a unified framework. To tackle
this challenge, we develop a multi-relational graph based MTL model called
Heterogeneous Multi-Task Graph Isomorphism Network (HMTGIN) which efficiently
solves heterogeneous CQA tasks. In each training forward pass, HMTGIN embeds
the input CQA forum graph by an extension of Graph Isomorphism Network and skip
connections. The embeddings are then shared across all task-specific output
layers to compute respective losses. Moreover, two cross-task constraints based
on the domain knowledge about tasks' relationships are used to regularize the
joint learning. In the evaluation, the embeddings are shared among different
task-specific output layers to make corresponding predictions. To the best of
our knowledge, HMTGIN is the first MTL model capable of tackling CQA tasks from
the aspect of multi-relational graphs. To evaluate HMTGIN's effectiveness, we
build a novel large-scale multi-relational graph CQA dataset with over two
