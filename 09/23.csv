holidays in Western countries. The shock of decreased mobility manifested as a
drastic increase in interest in consuming food at home and a corresponding
decrease in consuming food outside of home. The largest (up to threefold)
increases occurred for calorie-dense carbohydrate-based foods such as pastries,
bakery products, bread, and pies. The observed shifts in dietary interests have
the potential to globally affect food consumption and health outcomes. These

nonminimally coupled to the Ricci scalar and propagates at subluminal speeds,
then there exists the possibility of scalar $\check{\hbox{C}}$erenkov radiation
from a moving particle. The mere observation of high-energy cosmic rays could
in principle rule out the existence of such scalar fields since any particle
moving faster than scalar perturbations would lose energy in the form of scalar
waves until it moves slower than those. We compute in detail the energy loss to
scalar waves and find that it scales with the square of the ultra-violet (UV)
cutoff frequency of the effective field theory (EFT) of gravity. For
dark-energy-motivated EFTs, the UV cutoff can be low, in which case that energy
loss could always be negligible. In contrast, if viewed as a covariant theory
valid at all scales or as an EFT valid at higher energies, perhaps even all the
way up to the Planck scale, as may be the case if motivated by quantum-gravity
perspectives, then the energy loss to scalar waves may diverge or become
dramatically large. In this case, high-energy cosmic rays of extragalactic
origin stringently constrain any conformally coupled scalar fields with
non-canonical kinetic terms, although a minimum scalar phase velocity is
required to trust the EFT.

utilizing only prior experience, without any online interaction. This can allow
robots to acquire generalizable skills from large and diverse datasets, without
any costly or unsafe online data collection. Despite recent algorithmic
advances in offline RL, applying these methods to real-world problems has
proven challenging. Although offline RL methods can learn from prior data,
there is no clear and well-understood process for making various design
choices, from model architecture to algorithm hyperparameters, without actually
evaluating the learned policies online. In this paper, our aim is to develop a
practical workflow for using offline RL analogous to the relatively
well-understood workflows for supervised learning problems. To this end, we
devise a set of metrics and conditions that can be tracked over the course of
offline training, and can inform the practitioner about how the algorithm and
model architecture should be adjusted to improve final performance. Our
workflow is derived from a conceptual understanding of the behavior of
conservative offline RL algorithms and cross-validation in supervised learning.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow in producing effective policies
without any online tuning, both in several simulated robotic learning scenarios
and for three tasks on two distinct real robots, focusing on learning
manipulation skills with raw image observations with sparse binary rewards.

infected individuals during coughing, sneezing, speaking and breathing. The
spread of the infection and hence its menace depend on how the virus-loaded
droplets evolve in space and time with changing environmental conditions. In
view of this, we investigate the evolution of the droplets within the purview
of the Brownian motion of the evaporating droplets in the air with varying
weather conditions under the action of gravity. We track the movement of the
droplets till either they gravitationally settle on the ground or evaporate to
aerosols of size 2$\mu$m or less. Droplets with radii $2 \mu$m or less may
continue to diffuse and remain suspended in the air for long time. The effects
of relative humidity and temperature on the evaporation are found to be
significant. We note that under strong flowing conditions droplets travel large
distances. It is found that the bigger droplets fall on the ground due to the
dominance of gravity over the diffusive force despite the loss of mass due to
evaporation. The smaller evaporating droplets may not settle on the ground but
remain suspended in the air due to the dominance of the diffusive force. The
fate of the intermediate size droplets depends on the weather conditions and
play crucial roles in the spread of the infection. These environment dependent
effects indicate that the maintenance of physical separation to evade the virus
is not corroborated, making the use of face mask indispensable.

probabilistic forecasting with DeepAR. Since deep networks can neither handle
missing input nor out-of-distribution intervention, we propose to use the
Knockoffs framework (Barberand Cand`es, 2015) for generating intervention
variables and consequently counterfactual probabilistic forecasting. Knockoff
samples are independent of their output given the observed variables and
exchangeable with their counterpart variables without changing the underlying
distribution of the data. We test our method on synthetic as well as real-world

autoregressive Granger causality and PCMCI in detecting nonlinear causal

listed. These six formats are mathematically equivalent with each other. Linear
approximation and second-order cone programming (SOCP) are then used to derive
the six formats of the convex Mesh-BranchFlow model. The branch ampacity
constraints considering the shunt conductance and capacitance of the
transmission line $\Pi$-model are derived. The key foundation of deriving the
ampacity constraints is the correct interpretation of the physical meaning of
the transmission line $\Pi$-model. An exact linear expression of the ampacity
constraints of the power loss variable is derived. The applications of the
Mesh-BranchFlow model in deriving twelve formats of the exact optimal power
flow (OPF) model and twelve formats of the approximate OPF model are formulated
and analyzed. Using the Julia programming language, the extensive numerical
investigations of all formats of the OPF models show the accuracy and
computational efficiency of the Mesh-BranchFlow model. A penalty function based
approximation gap reduction method is finally proposed and numerically
validated to improve the AC-feasibility of the approximate Mesh-BranchFlow
model.

friction and upward wave radiation through interaction with the stratosphere
are oft-ignored, as they greatly complicate mathematical analysis. In this
study, we relax the rigid-lid assumption and impose surface drag, which allows
the barotropic mode to be excited in equatorial waves. In particular, a
previously developed set of linear, strict quasi-equilibrium tropospheric
equations is coupled with a dry, passive stratosphere, and surface drag is
added to the troposphere momentum equations. Theoretical and numerical model
analysis is performed on the model in the limits of an inviscid surface coupled
to a stratosphere, as well as a frictional surface under a rigid-lid. This
study confirms previous research that shows the presence of a stratosphere
strongly shifts the growth rates of fast propagating equatorial waves to larger
scales, reddening the equatorial power spectrum. The growth rates of modes that
are slowly propagating and highly interactive with cloud-radiation are shown to
be negligibly affected by the presence of a stratosphere. Surface friction in
this model framework acts as purely a damping mechanism and increases the
poleward extent of the equatorial waves through barotropic vorticity
generation. Numerical solutions of the coupled troposphere-stratosphere model
with surface friction also show that the barotropic mode can be
tropospherically trapped when excited by surface friction but in the presence
of a highly stratified stratosphere. The superposition of phase-shifted
barotropic and first baroclinic modes is also shown to lead to an eastward
vertical tilt in the dynamical fields of Kelvin-wave like modes.

of even ""nice"" topological spaces can have different densities. So, our aim

  We improve a result of Berner and Juhasz by showing that $dd(X)$ is always
$\omega$-closed (i.e. countably closed) if $X$ is Hausdorff.
  We manage to give complete characterizations of the double density spectra of
Hausdorff and of regular spaces as follows.
  Let $S$ be a non-empty set of infinite cardinals. Then
  (1) $S = dd(X)$ holds for a Hausdorff space $X$ iff S is $\omega$-closed and
$sup S \le 2^{2^{\min S}},$
  (2) S = dd(X) holds for a regular space X iff S is $\omega$-closed and $\sup
S \le {2^{\min S}}$.
  We also prove a number of consistency results concerning the double density
spectra of compact spaces. For instance:
  (i) If $\kappa = cf(\kappa)$ embeds in $\mathcal{P}(\omega)/fin$ and $S$ is
any set of uncountable regular cardinals $< \kappa$ with $|S| < \min S$, then
there is a compactum $C$ such that $\{\omega, \kappa\} \cup S \subset dd(C)$,
moreover $\lambda \notin d(C)$ whenever $|S| + \omega < cf(\lambda) < \kappa$
and $cf(\lambda) \notin S$.

radiation dose than is received on Earth. $\epsilon\,$Ind$\,$b, a Jupiter-like
planet orbiting at $\sim$11au, receives higher Galactic cosmic ray fluxes than

diffusion or advection dominates at GeV energies and at distances where the
wind has reached its' terminal velocity. For advectively-dominated winds
($\sim$younger systems), varying the astrospheric size influences the
suppression significantly. For diffusion-dominated systems ($\sim$older
systems) the astrospheric size, and therefore knowledge of the ISM properties,
are not very important. This reduces the Galactic cosmic ray flux uncertainties

measurement protocols is attracting an increasing amount of attention. It has
been recently revealed that measurements may induce an abrupt change in the
scaling-law of the bipartite entanglement entropy, thus suggesting the
existence of different non-equilibrium regimes. However, our understanding of
how these regimes appear and whether they survive in the thermodynamic limit is
much less established. Here we investigate these questions on a one-dimensional
quadratic fermionic model: this allows us to reach system sizes relevant in the
thermodynamic sense. We show that local projective measurements induce a
qualitative modification of the time-growth of the entanglement entropy which
changes from linear to logarithmic. However, in the stationary regime, the
logarithmic behavior of the entanglement entropy do not survive in the
thermodynamic limit and, for any finite value of the measurement rate, we
numerically show the existence of a single area-law phase for the entanglement
entropy. Finally, exploiting the quasi-particle picture, we further support our
results analysing the fluctuations of the stationary entanglement entropy and
its scaling behavior.

an early M dwarf. However, its notional bulk density ($\sim$2.2 g cm$^{-3}$) is
consistent with a large volatile fraction, suggesting that it might have
volatile reservoirs that have survived billions of years at more than twice the
Earth's insolation. On the other hand, the upper mass limit paints a picture of
a cool super Mercury dominated by >50\% iron core ($\sim$9.2 g cm$^{-3}$) that
has tiptoed up to the collisional stripping limit and into the radius gap.
Here, we examine several hypothetical states for TOI-1266c using a combination
of new and updated open-source atmospheric escape, radiative-convective, and
photochemical models. We find that water-rich atmospheres with trace amounts of
H$_{2}$ and CO$_{2}$ are potentially detectable (SNR $>\sim 5$) in less than 20
hours of JWST observing time. We also find that water vapor spectral features
are not substantially impacted by the presence of high-altitude water or ice
clouds due the presence of a significant amount of water above the cloud-deck,
although further work with self-consistent cloud models is needed. Regardless
of its mass, however, TOI-1266c represents a unique proving ground for several
hypotheses related to the evolution of sub-Neptunes and Venus-like worlds,
particularly those near the radius valley.

  GA no. 716980",,,,"cs.CR cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background. In recent years, cyber security user studies have been
scrutinized for their reporting completeness, statistical reporting fidelity,
statistical reliability and biases. It remains an open question what strength
of evidence positive reports of such studies actually yield. We focus on the
extent to which positive reports indicate relation true in reality, that is, a
probabilistic assessment.
  Aim. This study aims at establishing the overall strength of evidence in
cyber security user studies, with the dimensions -- Positive Predictive Value
(PPV) and its complement False Positive Risk (FPR), -- Likelihood Ratio (LR),
and -- Reverse-Bayesian Prior (RBP) for a fixed tolerated False Positive Risk.
  Method. Based on $431$ coded statistical inferences in $146$ cyber security
user studies from a published SLR covering the years 2006-2016, we first
compute a simulation of the a posteriori false positive risk based on assumed
prior and bias thresholds. Second, we establish the observed likelihood ratios
for positive reports. Third, we compute the reverse Bayesian argument on the
observed positive reports by computing the prior required for a fixed a
posteriori false positive rate.
  Results. We obtain a comprehensive analysis of the strength of evidence
including an account of appropriate multiple comparison corrections. The
simulations show that even in face of well-controlled conditions and high prior
likelihoods, only few studies achieve good a posteriori probabilities.
  Conclusions. Our work shows that the strength of evidence of the field is
weak and that most positive reports are likely false. From this, we learn what
to watch out for in studies to advance the knowledge of the field.

black hole illuminated by electromagnetic radiation display a sequence of
photon rings (demagnified and rotated copies of the direct image) which
asymptotically approach a purely theoretical critical curve - the outline of
the black hole photon shell. To a distant observer, these images appear
dominated by the direct emission, which forms a ring whose diameter is
primarily determined by the effective radius of the emitting region. For that
reason, connecting the image diameter seen by a distant observer to the
properties of the underlying spacetime crucially relies on a calibration that
necessarily depends on the assumed astrophysical source model. On the other
hand, the diameter of the photon rings depends more on the detailed geometry of
the spacetime than on the source structure. As such, a photon ring detection
would allow for the spacetime metric to be probed in a less model-dependent
way, enabling more robust tests of General Relativity (GR) and the Kerr
hypothesis. Here we present the photon ring structure of several spherically
symmetric black hole spacetimes and perform comparisons with the
Schwarzschild/Kerr case. We offer our perspective on future tests of the
spacetime metric with photon rings, discussing challenges and opportunities
involved.

Extensive structural and electronic characterizations show that the melting

growing variety of language pairs and datasets. However, they are known to
produce fluent translation outputs that can contain important meaning errors,
thus undermining their reliability in practice. Quality Estimation (QE) is the
task of automatically assessing the performance of MT systems at test time.
Thus, in order to be useful, QE systems should be able to detect such errors.
However, this ability is yet to be tested in the current evaluation practices,
where QE systems are assessed only in terms of their correlation with human
judgements. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a general methodology
for adversarial testing of QE for MT. First, we show that despite a high
correlation with human judgements achieved by the recent SOTA, certain types of
meaning errors are still problematic for QE to detect. Second, we show that on
average, the ability of a given model to discriminate between
meaning-preserving and meaning-altering perturbations is predictive of its
overall performance, thus potentially allowing for comparing QE systems without
relying on manual quality annotation.

fundamental component of such networks, and a pivotal factor to the fulfillment

high flexibility on the control of the radio link. However, to fully exploit
the potentiality of vRANs, an efficient mapping of the rapidly varying context

the interdependence of user traffic demand, channel conditions, and resource

dynamic radio resource allocation in heterogeneous vRANs, which selects the
best available link and transmission parameters for packet transfer, so as to
meet the KPI requirements. To show its effectiveness, we develop a testbed for
proof-of-concept. Experimental results demonstrate that CAREM enables an
efficient radio resource allocation under different settings and traffic

approach to approximate inference for posterior distributions expressed over
factor-graphs. Performing such inference is a key step in simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Although the Gaussian approximation often
works well, in other more challenging SLAM situations, the posterior
distribution is non-Gaussian and cannot be explicitly represented with standard
distributions. Our technique applies to settings where the posterior
distribution is substantially non-Gaussian (e.g., multi-modal) and thus needs a
more expressive representation. NSFG exploits nested sampling methods to
directly sample the posterior to represent the distribution without parametric
density models. While nested sampling methods are known for their powerful
capability in sampling multi-modal distributions, the application of the
methods to SLAM factor graphs is not straightforward. NSFG leverages the
structure of factor graphs to construct informative prior distributions which
are efficiently sampled and provide notable computational benefits for nested
sampling methods. We present simulated experiments which demonstrate that NSFG
is more robust and computes solutions over an order of magnitude faster than
state-of-the-art sampling techniques. Similarly, we compare NSFG to
state-of-the-art Gaussian and non-Gaussian SLAM approaches and demonstrate that
NSFG is notably more robust in describing non-Gaussian posteriors.

I absorption is seen in the MUSE spectrum of the background QSO, with
velocities coinciding with the initial HI 21-cm detection, but tracing less

However, WAN's traffic can drastically change during time and the connectivity

solutions must be able to adapt to dynamic scenarios in real-time. In this
paper we propose Enero, an efficient real-time TE solution based on a two-stage

(e.g., when link failures occur), we integrated a Graph Neural Network into the
DRL agent. In the second stage, Enero uses a Local Search algorithm to improve
DRL's solution without adding computational overhead to the optimization

effort by reducing the content of a text document without compromising on its
essence. Ergo, informativeness is the prime attribute of document summary
generated by an algorithm, and selecting sentences that capture the essence of
a document is the primary goal of extractive document summarization. In this
paper, we employ Shannon entropy to capture informativeness of sentences. We
employ Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to reveal probability
distributions for computing entropy of terms, topics, and sentences in latent
space. We present an information theoretic interpretation of the computed
entropy, which is the bedrock of the proposed E-Summ algorithm, an unsupervised
method for extractive document summarization. The algorithm systematically
applies information theoretic principle for selecting informative sentences
from important topics in the document. The proposed algorithm is generic and
fast, and hence amenable to use for summarization of documents in real time.
Furthermore, it is domain-, collection-independent and agnostic to the language
of the document. Benefiting from strictly positive NMF factor matrices, E-Summ
algorithm is transparent and explainable too. We use standard ROUGE toolkit for
performance evaluation of the proposed method on four well known public
data-sets. We also perform quantitative assessment of E-Summ summary quality by
computing its semantic similarity w.r.t the original document. Our
investigation reveals that though using NMF and information theoretic approach

independent text summarization, it needs to be bolstered to match the
performance of deep neural methods.

prove that the asymptotic error obtained on the diagonal can be expressed in

non-degenerate limit on the diagonal depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the
corresponding eigenvalues. We further consider the asymptotic error away from
the diagonal and analyse which scaling exponents ensure that it remains at
zero. For the Hermite polynomials, the associated Laguerre polynomials, and the
Jacobi polynomials, a Christoffel-Darboux type formula, which we establish for
all classical orthogonal polynomial systems, allows us to obtain a better

  arXiv:2103.01374",,,,"cs.LG cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate uncertainty quantification of model predictions is a crucial problem
in machine learning. Existing Bayesian methods, being highly iterative, are
expensive to implement and often fail to accurately capture a model's true
posterior because of their tendency to select only central moments. We propose
a fast single-shot uncertainty quantification framework where, instead of
working with the conventional Bayesian definition of model weight probability
density function (PDF), we utilize physics inspired functional operators over
the projection of model weights in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to
quantify their uncertainty at each model output. The RKHS projection of model
weights yields a potential field based interpretation of model weight PDF which
consequently allows the definition of a functional operator, inspired by
perturbation theory in physics, that performs a moment decomposition of the
model weight PDF (the potential field) at a specific model output to quantify
its uncertainty. We call this representation of the model weight PDF as the
quantum information potential field (QIPF) of the weights. The extracted
moments from this approach automatically decompose the weight PDF in the local
neighborhood of the specified model output and determine, with great
sensitivity, the local heterogeneity of the weight PDF around a given
prediction. These moments therefore provide sharper estimates of predictive
uncertainty than central stochastic moments of Bayesian methods. Experiments
evaluating the error detection capability of different uncertainty
quantification methods on covariate shifted test data show our approach to be
more precise and better calibrated than baseline methods, while being faster to
compute.

conjunctive queries. The goal is to create a data structure in an initial
preprocessing phase and use it for answering (multiple) queries. Previous work
has developed data structures that trade off space usage for answering time and
has proved conditional space lower bounds for queries of practical interest
such as the path and triangle query. However, most of these results cater to
only those queries, lack a comprehensive framework, and are not generalizable.
The isolated treatment of these queries also fails to utilize the connections
with extensive research on related problems within the database community. The
key insight in this work is to exploit the formalism of relational algebra by
casting the problems as answering join queries over a relational database.
Using the notion of boolean {\em adorned queries} and {\em access patterns}, we
propose a unified framework that captures several widely studied algorithmic
problems. Our main contribution is three-fold. First, we present an algorithm
that recovers existing space-time tradeoffs for several problems. The algorithm
is based on an application of the {\em join size bound} to capture the space
usage of our data structure. We combine our data structure with {\em query
decomposition} techniques to further improve the tradeoffs and show that it is
readily extensible to queries with negation. Second, we falsify two conjectures
proposed in the existing literature that relates to the space-time lower bound
for path queries and triangle detection by proposing an unexpectedly better
algorithm. This result opens a new avenue for improving several algorithmic
results that have so far been assumed to be (conditionally) optimal. Finally,
we prove new conditional space-time lower bounds for star and path queries.

Data regime and have opened avenues for solving outstanding questions in
Galactic archaeology. However, exploiting their full potential is limited by
complex systematics, whose characterization has not received much attention in
modern spectroscopic analyses. In this work, we present a novel method to
disentangle the component of spectral data space intrinsic to the stars from
that due to systematics. Using functional principal component analysis on a
sample of $18,933$ giant spectra from APOGEE, we find that the intrinsic
structure above the level of observational uncertainties requires ${\approx}$10
functional principal components (FPCs). Our FPCs can reduce the dimensionality
of spectra, remove systematics, and impute masked wavelengths, thereby enabling
accurate studies of stellar populations. To demonstrate the applicability of
our FPCs, we use them to infer stellar parameters and abundances of 28 giants
in the open cluster M67. We employ Sequential Neural Likelihood, a
simulation-based Bayesian inference method that learns likelihood functions
using neural density estimators, to incorporate non-Gaussian effects in
spectral likelihoods. By hierarchically combining the inferred abundances, we
limit the spread of the following elements in M67: $\mathrm{Fe} \lesssim 0.02$

real world. Thus, to stay up-to-date the graph data needs to be updated
frequently. To utilize information from Knowledge Graphs, many state-of-the-art
machine learning approaches use embedding techniques. These techniques
typically compute an embedding, i.e., vector representations of the nodes as
input for the main machine learning algorithm. If a graph update occurs later
on -- specifically when nodes are added or removed -- the training has to be
done all over again. This is undesirable, because of the time it takes and also
because downstream models which were trained with these embeddings have to be
retrained if they change significantly. In this paper, we investigate embedding
updates that do not require full retraining and evaluate them in combination
with various embedding models on real dynamic Knowledge Graphs covering
multiple use cases. We study approaches that place newly appearing nodes
optimally according to local information, but notice that this does not work
well. However, we find that if we continue the training of the old embedding,
interleaved with epochs during which we only optimize for the added and removed
parts, we obtain good results in terms of typical metrics used in link
prediction. This performance is obtained much faster than with a complete
retraining and hence makes it possible to maintain embeddings for dynamic
Knowledge Graphs.

terms of computation and storage) and results in scalability issues. Moreover,
in most scientific application domains a provenance solution must consider
network-related events as well. Therefore, provenance data in LTM data
management systems are highly diverse and must be organized and processed
carefully. In this paper, we introduce a novel provenance service, called
ProvLet, to collect, distribute, analyze, and visualize provenance data in LTM
data management systems. This means (1) we address how to filter and store the
desired transactions on disk; (2) we consider a data organization model at

algorithms over these data abstractions, rather than solutions considering

highly nonlinear, unformed, and expensive-to-evaluate. To tackle this
challenge, Bayesian optimization, which conducts sequential design via a
posterior distribution over the objective function, is a critical method used
to find the global optimum of black-box functions. Kernel functions play an
important role in shaping the posterior distribution of the estimated function.
The widely used kernel function, e.g., radial basis function (RBF), is very
vulnerable and susceptible to outliers; the existence of outliers is causing
its Gaussian process surrogate model to be sporadic. In this paper, we propose
a robust kernel function, Asymmetric Elastic Net Radial Basis Function
(AEN-RBF). Its validity as a kernel function and computational complexity are
evaluated. When compared to the baseline RBF kernel, we prove theoretically
that AEN-RBF can realize smaller mean squared prediction error under mild
conditions. The proposed AEN-RBF kernel function can also realize faster
convergence to the global optimum. We also show that the AEN-RBF kernel
function is less sensitive to outliers, and hence improves the robustness of
the corresponding Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes. Through
extensive evaluations carried out on synthetic and real-world optimization
problems, we show that AEN-RBF outperforms existing benchmark kernel functions.

different networks for approximating the target and policy values. The
experimental results show that learning becomes more stable and enables agents
to find optimal policies in grid-domains with higher complexity. Additionally,
we assess how parameter sharing influences the agents behavior in multi-agent

N\'eel phase in the model, and the energy gap becomes closed at the
corresponding momentum point. In comparison with linear spin-wave theory, the
differences show that there are strong interactions among magnons at high
energies. With open boundary condition, the gap of edge spins in the AKLT phase
closes at both the $\Gamma$ point and the $\pi$ point interestingly to emerge

elliptic curve, with the aim to provide a physical realisation of recent
constructions in equivariant elliptic cohomology of symplectic resolutions. We
first study the Berry connection for supersymmetric ground states in the
presence of mass parameters and flat connections for flavour symmetries, which
results in a natural construction of the equivariant elliptic cohomology
variety of the Higgs branch. We then investigate supersymmetric boundary
conditions and show from an analysis of boundary 't Hooft anomalies that their
boundary amplitudes represent equivariant elliptic cohomology classes. We
analyse two distinguished classes of boundary conditions known as exceptional
Dirichlet and enriched Neumann, which are exchanged under mirror symmetry. We
show that the boundary amplitudes of the latter reproduce elliptic stable
envelopes introduced by Aganagic-Okounkov, and relate boundary amplitudes of
the mirror symmetry interface to the mother function in equivariant elliptic
cohomology. Finally, we consider correlation functions of Janus interfaces for
varying mass parameters, recovering the chamber R-matrices of elliptic
integrable systems.

challenging to detect experimentally due to their small couplings to SM
particles. In extensions of the SM with new interactions of the sterile
neutrinos, they can be produced copiously at accelerators and colliders. We
systematically investigate the impact of such novel interactions on the

bring the sterile neutrinos into equilibrium at early times, leading to a
significant reduction in the generated asymmetry. We also show that observable
rates of several hidden-sector neutrino signatures, such as SM Higgs decays to
pairs of sterile neutrinos, can be inconsistent with the observed baryon

It is one of the cornerstones of condensed matter physics, which we access on
noisy intermediate-scale (NISQ) quantum devices by leveraging a dynamically
driven phenomenon. We probe the critical properties of the one-dimensional
quantum Ising model on a programmable superconducting quantum chip via a
Kibble-Zurek process, obtain scaling laws, and estimate critical exponents
despite inherent sources of errors on the hardware. In addition, we investigate
how the improvement of NISQ computers (more qubits, less noise) will
consolidate the computation of those universal physical properties. A
one-parameter noise model captures the effect of imperfections and reproduces
the experimental data. Its systematic study reveals that the noise, analogously
to temperature, induces a new length scale in the system. We introduce and
successfully verify modified scaling laws, directly accounting for the noise
without any prior knowledge. It makes data analyses for extracting physical
properties transparent to noise. By understanding how imperfect quantum
hardware modifies the genuine properties of quantum states of matter, we
enhance the power of NISQ processors considerably for addressing quantum
criticality and potentially other phenomena and algorithms.

dominated by angular momentum loss to the dark matter haloes via dynamical
friction. Traditional approximations to dynamical friction are formulated using
the linearized collisionless Boltzmann equation and have been shown to be valid
in the fast limit, i.e. for rapidly slowing bars. However, the linear
assumption breaks down within a few dynamical periods for typical slowly
evolving bars, which trap a significant amount of disc stars and dark matter in
resonances. Recent observations of the Galactic bar imply this slow regime at
the main bar resonances. We formulate the time-dependent dynamical friction in
the slow limit and explore its mechanism in the general slow regime with
test-particle simulations. Here, angular momentum exchange is dominated by
resonantly trapped orbits which slowly librate around the resonances. In
typical equilibrium haloes, the initial phase-space density within the trapped
zone is higher at lower angular momentum. Since the libration frequency falls
towards the separatrix, this density contrast winds up into a phase-space
spiral, resulting in a dynamical friction that oscillates with $\sim$Gyr
periods and damps over secular timescales. We quantify the long-term behaviour
of this torque with secular perturbation theory, and predict two observable
consequences: i) The phase-space spirals may be detectable in the stellar disc
where the number of windings encodes the age of the bar. ii) The torque causes
weak oscillations in the bar's pattern speed, overlaying the overall slowdown
-- while not discussed, this feature is visible in previous simulations.

proper-motion (CPM) candidates. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies
with a median accuracy of 26 cm/s per parsec of distance is demonstrated. This
improvement by a factor 2.5 in accuracy, as compared to DR2, results in PMa
detection limits on companions that are well into the planetary mass regime for
many targets. We identify 37,515 Hipparcos stars with a significant PMa

correlate with external tracers from the same redshift. Here, we forecast the

redshift by cross-correlating the upcoming near-infrared spectro-imaging

clouds simulated within the SILCC-Zoom project. We produce synthetic
observations of HI at 21 cm including HI self-absorption (HISA) and
observational effects. We find that HI column densities, $N_\textrm{HI}$, of
$\gtrsim$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ are frequently reached in molecular clouds with HI
temperatures as low as $\sim$10 K. Hence, HISA observations assuming a fixed HI
temperature tend to underestimate the amount of cold HI in molecular clouds by
a factor of 3 - 10 and produce an artificial upper limit of $N_\textrm{HI}$
around 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. We thus argue that the cold HI mass in clouds could
be a factor of a few higher than previously estimated. Also
$N_\textrm{HI}$-PDFs obtained from HISA observations might be subject to
observational biases and should be considered with caution. The underestimation
of cold HI in HISA observations is due to both the large HI temperature
variations and the effect of noise in regions of high optical depth. We find
optical depths of cold HI around 1 - 10 making optical depth corrections
essential. We show that the high HI column densities ($\gtrsim$10$^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$) can in parts be attributed to the occurrence of up to 10 individual
HI-H$_2$ transitions along the line of sight. This is also reflected in the
spectra, necessitating Gaussian decomposition algorithms for their analysis.
However, also for a single HI-H$_2$ transition, $N_\textrm{HI}$ frequently
exceeds 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, challenging 1D, semi-analytical models. This is
due to non-equilibrium chemistry effects and the fact that HI-H$_2$ transition
regions usually do not possess a 1-dimensional geometry. Finally, we show that
the HI gas is moderately supersonic with Mach numbers of a few. The
corresponding non-thermal velocity dispersion can be determined via HISA
observations within a factor of $\sim$2.

insights into SMBH accretion physics. Here, we present a new radio dataset of
another TDE, iPTF16fnl, and discuss the possibility that a delayed radio flare
has been observed also in this case, ~ 5 months after optical discovery,
suggesting that this phenomenon may be common in TDEs. Unlike ASASSN-15oi, the
data for iPTF16fnl is sparse and the delayed radio flare can be explained by
several alternative models: among them are a complex varying CNM density
structure and a delayed outflow ejection.

study randomly driven $(1+1)$ dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), a
family of quantum many-body systems with soluble non-equilibrium quantum
dynamics. The sequence of driving Hamiltonians is drawn from an independent and
identically distributed random ensemble. At each driving step, the deformed
Hamiltonian only involves the energy-momentum density spatially modulated at a
single wavelength and therefore induces a M\""obius transformation on the
complex coordinates. The non-equilibrium dynamics is then determined by the
corresponding sequence of M\""obius transformations, from which the Lyapunov
exponent $\lambda_L$ is defined. We use Furstenberg's theorem to classify the
dynamical phases and show that except for a few \emph{exceptional points} that
do not satisfy Furstenberg's criteria, the random drivings always lead to a
heating phase with the total energy growing exponentially in the number of
driving steps $n$ and the subsystem entanglement entropy growing linearly in
$n$ with a slope proportional to central charge $c$ and the Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_L$. On the contrary, the subsystem entanglement entropy at an
exceptional point could grow as $\sqrt{n}$ while the total energy remains to
grow exponentially. In addition, we show that the distributions of the operator
evolution and the energy density peaks are also useful characterizations to
distinguish the heating phase from the exceptional points: the heating phase
has both distributions to be continuous, while the exceptional points could
support finite convex combinations of Dirac measures depending on their
specific type. In the end, we compare the field theory results with the lattice
model calculations for both the entanglement and energy evolution and find
remarkably good agreement.

the typical size of cross-sections and their uncertainties and discuss the
preferred choices for the factorization scale. These processes can also be
computed starting directly from the lepto-production hadronic tensor, leading
to a result where some collinear-enhanced QED corrections are missing, but all
strong corrections are included. Thus, we are in the unique position to perform
a comparison of results obtained via the factorization approach to a
calculation that does not have strong corrections. This is particularly
relevant in the case of lepton-scattering, that is more abundant at lower

this process also with the hadronic-tensor method, and compare the results with

indirectly by using the spread of dust polarization angles ($\delta \theta$).
The method developed by Davis 1951 and by Chandrasekhar and Fermi 1953 (DCF)
assumes that incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluctuations induce the
observed dispersion of polarization angles, deriving $B\propto 1/\delta \theta$
(or, $\delta \theta \propto M_{A}$, in terms of the Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number).
However, observations show that the interstellar medium (ISM) is highly
compressible. Recently, Skalidis & Tassis 2021 (ST) relaxed the
incompressibility assumption and derived instead $B\propto 1/\sqrt{\delta
\theta}$ ($\delta \theta \propto M_{A}^2$). We explored what the correct
scaling is in compressible and magnetized turbulence with numerical
simulations. We used 26 magnetized, ideal-MHD numerical simulations with
different types of forcing. The range of $M_{A}$ and sonic Mach numbers $M_{s}$
explored are $0.1 \leq M_{A} \leq 2.0$ and $0.5 \leq M_{s} \leq 20$. We created
synthetic polarization maps and tested the assumptions and accuracy of the two
methods. The synthetic data have a remarkable consistency with the $\delta
\theta \propto M_{A}^{2}$ scaling, which is inferred by ST, while the DCF
scaling fails to follow the data. The ST method shows an accuracy better than
$50\%$ over the entire range of $M_{A}$ explored; DCF performs adequately only
in the range of $M_{A}$ for which it has been optimized through the use of a
""fudge factor"". For low $M_{A}$, DCF is inaccurate by factors of tens. The
assumptions of the ST method reflect better the physical reality in clouds with
compressible and magnetized turbulence, and for this reason the method provides
a much better estimate of the magnetic field strength over the DCF method.

significantly affected by the environment across the full redshift range

overdensity group environments and in regions with greater overall stellar mass
and star formation rates. Complementary to these results, we have further
investigated the more highly ionized gas as traced by CIV absorption, and found
that it is likely to be more extended than the MgII gas, with ~2 times higher
covering fraction at a given distance. We find that the strength and covering
fraction of CIV absorption show less significant dependence on galaxy
properties and environment than the MgII absorption, but more massive and
star-forming galaxies nevertheless also show ~2 times higher incidence of CIV
absorption. The incidence of MgII and CIV absorption within the virial radius
shows a tentative increase with redshift, being higher by a factor of ~1.5 and
~4, respectively, at z>1. It is clear from our results that environmental

singular power-law models with a logarithmic slope close to isothermal
($\zeta=2$). This is sufficient to fit the lensed emission near the Einstein
radius but may not be sufficient when extrapolated to smaller or larger radii
if the large-scale density profile is more complex. Here, we consider a broken
power-law model for the density profile of an elliptical galaxy at $z=1.15$
using observations with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array of the strong
gravitational lens system SPT0532$-$50. This is the first application of such a

profile that is sub-isothermal ($\zeta = 1.87^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$) near the
Einstein radius and steepens to super-isothermal ($\zeta =
2.14^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$) at around half the Einstein radius, demonstrating that
the lensing data probes the mass distribution inside the region probed by the
lensed images. Assuming that a broken power-law is the underlying truth, we
find that a single power-law would result in a $10\pm1$ percent underestimate

Generalization bounds from learning theory often assume that the test
distribution is close to the training distribution. In contrast, if we can
identify the ""true"" parameters, then the model generalizes to arbitrary
distribution shifts. However, neural networks typically have internal
symmetries that make parameter identification impossible. We show that we can

These are used for downstream statistical estimation and prediction problems,
often involving messages or other information that is transmitted along with

cascade observation that take into account phenomena that lead to uncertainty
about the process state at any given time. We highlight one such phenomenon --
temporal distortion -- caused by a misalignment between the rate at which

itself operates, and argue that failure to correct for it results in
degradation of performance on downstream statistical tasks. To address these
issues, we formulate the clock estimation problem in terms of a natural
distortion measure. We give a clock estimation algorithm, which we call
FastClock, that runs in linear time in the size of its input and is provably
statistically accurate for a broad range of model parameters when cascades are
generated from the independent cascade process with known parameters and when
the underlying graph is Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi. We further give empirical results on
the performance of our algorithm in comparison to the state of the art
estimator, a likelihood proxy maximization-based estimator implemented via
dynamic programming. We find that, in a broad parameter regime, our algorithm
substantially outperforms the dynamic programming algorithm in terms of both
running time and accuracy.

different from the electroweak scale and the Planck scale. It has been shown
that such hierarchical mass scales can be realized as typical energy scales of
multiple 3-branes in a 5D warped spacetime. We present a mechanism for
stabilizing the intervals between the multiple 3-branes in the warped extra
dimension, by introducing a single 5D scalar field with brane-localized
potentials. We discuss the radion stabilization by solving the Einstein
equation and the scalar field equation of motion so that a backreaction effect
on the geometry due to the presence of the scalar field is taken into account.
Perturbations from the background configuration are then considered with proper
identification of multiple radion degrees of freedom. By solving their
equations of motion, we compute the mass spectrum of the radion-scalar field
system and the radion couplings to brane-localized matter fields, which are
found to be suppressed by typical energy scales and radion profiles at the
branes. We also compute the mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein gravitons and their
profiles in the extra dimension. Some applications of the setup are briefly
described. Our analysis provides a solid ground to build 5D warped extra

Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes, which enormously reduced the computation time
needed to calculate a single spectrum, while preserving accuracy of the
computation. However, the available fast codes are limited in that they could
only be used for a factorized distribution over the energy and pitch-angle,
while the distributions of electrons over energy or pitch-angle are limited to
a number of predefined analytical functions. In realistic simulations, these
assumptions do not hold; thus, the codes free from the mentioned limitations
are called for. To remedy this situation, we extended our fast codes to work
with an arbitrary input distribution function of radiating electrons. We
accomplished this by implementing fast codes for a distribution function
described by an arbitrary numerically-defined array. In addition, we removed
several other limitations of the available fast codes and improved treatment of
the free-free component. The Ultimate Fast Codes presented here allow for an
arbitrary combination of the analytically and numerically defined
distributions, which offers the most flexible use of the fast codes. We
illustrate the code with a few simple examples.

inverter output current and angle to provide an angle droop-like policy which
improves its stability properties. This also allows to incorporate a secondary
control policy for which we provide an analytical stability result which takes
line conductances into account (in contrast to the lossless line assumptions in
literature). The distinctive feature of the voltage control scheme is that it
has a double loop structure that uses the DC voltage in the feedback control
policy to implement a power balancing strategy to improve performance. The
performance of the control policy is illustrated via simulations with detailed

conducted within the platform. The availability of user identifiers per trade
allows us to focus on the historical record of 440 investors, detected as
arbitrageurs, and consequently to describe their trading behavior. We begin by
showing that a considerable difference appears between arbitrageurs when
indicators of their expertise are taken into account. In particular, we
distinguish between those who conducted arbitrage in a single or in multiple
markets: using this element as a proxy for trade ability, we find that
arbitrage actions performed by expert users are on average non-profitable when
transaction costs are accounted for, while skilled investors conduct arbitrage
at a positive and statistically significant premium. Next, we show that
specific trading strategies, such as splitting orders or conducting arbitrage
non aggressively, are further indicators of expertise that increase the
profitability of arbitrage. Most importantly, we exploit within-user (across
hours and markets) variation and document that expert users make profits on
arbitrage by reacting quickly to plausible exogenous variations on the official
exchange rates. We present further evidence that such differences are chiefly
due to a better ability of the latter in incorporating information, both on the
transactions costs and on the exchange rates volatility, eventually resulting
in a better timing choice at small time scale intervals. Our results support
the hypothesis that arbitrageurs are few and sophisticated users.

from the AdS swampland distance conjecture and the dS conjecture as applied to
AdS vacua by Lust, Palti and Vafa. Unlike the non-SUSY AdS constraints, for

Disease (CAD) with machine learning methods to reduce the cost and health
implications of conventional diagnosis. This paper introduces a CAD diagnosis
method with a novel feature extraction technique called the Profile-Based
Binary Feature Extraction (PBBFE). In this method, after partitioning numerical
features, frequent itemsets are extracted by the Apriori algorithm and then
used as features to increase the CAD diagnosis accuracy. The proposed method
consists of two main phases. In the first phase, each patient is assigned a
profile based on age, gender, and medical condition, and then all numerical
features are discretized based on assigned profiles. All features then undergo
a binarization process to become ready for feature extraction by Apriori. In
the last step of this phase, frequent itemsets are extracted from the dataset
by Apriori and used to build a new dataset. In the second phase, the Genetic
Algorithm and the Support Vector Machine are used to identify the best subset
of extracted features for classification. The proposed method was tested on the
Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset, which is one the richest databases in the field of
CAD. Performance comparisons conducted on this dataset showed that the proposed
method outperforms all major alternative methods with 98.35% accuracy, 100%
sensitivity, and 94.25% specificity. The proposed method also achieved the
highest accuracy on several other datasets.

Most existing approaches focus on designing various matching approaches with

encourage the convolutional features to find correspondence between similar

multivariate copulas using vines allows us to easily account for covariate

precisely, we specify the vine copula density as an infinite mixture of
Gaussian copulas, defining a Dirichlet process (DP) prior on the mixing
measure, and we perform posterior inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

Here we demonstrate a scalable improvement to TTI and exposure notification
apps that uses data assimilation (DA) on a contact network. Network DA exploits
diverse sources of health data together with the proximity data from mobile
devices that exposure notification apps rely upon. It provides users with
continuously assessed individual risks of exposure and infection, which can
form the basis for targeting individual contact interventions. Simulations of
the early COVID-19 epidemic in New York City prove the concepts. In the
simulations, network DA identifies up to a factor 2 more infections than
contact tracing when both harness the same contact data and diagnostic test
data. This remains true even when only a relatively small fraction of the
population uses network DA. When a sufficiently large fraction of the
population ($\gtrsim 75\%$) uses network DA and complies with individual
contact interventions, targeting contact interventions with network DA reduces
deaths by up to a factor 4 relative to TTI. Network DA can be implemented by
expanding the computational backend of existing exposure notification apps,
thus greatly enhancing their capabilities. Implemented at scale, it has the
potential to precisely and effectively control future epidemics while

researchers, across a wide variety of domains, to perform their research.
Because of the complexity of research software, developers cannot conduct
exhaustive testing. As a result, researchers have lower confidence in the
correctness of the output of the software. Peer code review, a standard
software engineering practice, has helped address this problem in other types
of software. Aims: Peer code review is less prevalent in research software than
it is in other types of software. In addition, the literature does not contain
any studies about the use of peer code review in research software. Therefore,
through analyzing developers perceptions, the goal of this work is to
understand the current practice of peer code review in the development of
research software, identify challenges and barriers associated with peer code
review in research software, and present approaches to improve the peer code
review in research software. Method: We conducted interviews and a community
survey of research software developers to collect information about their
current peer code review practices, difficulties they face, and how they
address those difficulties. Results: We received 84 unique responses from the
interviews and surveys. The results show that while research software teams
review a large amount of their code, they lack formal process, proper
organization, and adequate people to perform the reviews. Conclusions: Use of
peer code review is promising for improving the quality of research software
and thereby improving the trustworthiness of the underlying research results.
In addition, by using peer code review, research software developers produce
more readable and understandable code, which will be easier to maintain.

DWDs, LISA will also detect an unresolved confusion foreground produced by the
underlying Galactic population, which will affect the detectability of all LISA
sources at frequencies below a few mHz. So far, the modelling of the DWD
population for LISA has been based on binary population synthesis (BPS)
techniques. The aim of this study is to construct an observationally driven
population. To achieve this, we employ a model developed by Maoz, Hallakoun and
Badenes (2018) for the statistical analysis of the local DWD population using
two complementary large, multi-epoch, spectroscopic samples: the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Supernova Ia Progenitor surveY (SPY). We calculate
the number of LISA-detectable DWDs and the Galactic confusion foreground, based
on their assumptions and results. We find that the observationally driven
estimates yield 1) 2 - 5 times more individually detectable DWDs than various
BPS forecasts, and 2) a significantly different shape of the DWD confusion
foreground. Both results have important implications for the LISA mission. A
comparison between several variations to our underlying assumptions shows that
our observationally driven model is robust, and that the uncertainty on the
total number of LISA-detectable DWDs is in the order of 20 per cent.

for optimal voltage unbalance attenuation (OVUA). This problem is formulated as
an optimization program under a tailored dq-frame, which minimizes the
negative-sequence voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) subject to the
current, active power, synchronization stability, and feasibility constraints.
The program is inherently nonconvex and intractable. So, to guarantee the
optimality, a rigorous optimality analysis is performed by leveraging
analytical optimization. The analysis is divided into two cases: full
mitigation of VU and partial attenuation of VU. For the former case, we
analytically solve the original program since the resultant VU is immediately
deducible. For the latter one, directly solving the problem becomes very hard.
Thus, we reformulate the program into an equivalent but more tractable form
under certain conditions, by which the analytical optimum can be finally
derived. It is found that the optimum trajectory has three stages (O1-O3),
depending on two critical boundary conditions (C1 and C2). Finally, we

can reproduce a wide range of observations assuming that CRs scatter off of
magnetic-field fluctuations with spectrum $\propto k^{-\delta}$ and $\delta
\sim [1.4,1.67]$. We study the extent to which such models can be reconciled
with current microphysical theories of CR transport, specifically
self-confinement due to the streaming instability and/or extrinsic turbulence
due to a cascade of MHD fast modes. We first review why it is that on their own
neither theory is compatible with observations. We then highlight that CR
transport is a strong function of local plasma conditions in the multi-phase
interstellar medium (ISM), and may be diffusive due to turbulence in some
regions and streaming due to self-confinement in others. A multi-phase
combination of scattering mechanisms can in principle reproduce the main trends
in the proton spectrum and the boron-to-carbon ratio (B/C). However, models
with a combination of scattering by self-excited waves and fast-mode turbulence
require significant fine-tuning due to fast-mode damping, unlike
phenomenological models that assume undamped Kolmogorov turbulence. The
assumption that fast modes follow a weak cascade is also not well justified
theoretically, as the weak cascade is suppressed by wave steepening and
weak-shock dissipation even in subsonic turbulence. These issues suggest that
there may be a significant theoretical gap in our understanding of MHD
turbulence. We discuss a few topics at the frontier of MHD turbulence theory
that bear on this (possible) gap and that may be relevant for CR scattering.

implemented through local interactions obey restrictions on their dimension $k$

long-range interactions are required to implement a quantum LDPC code with
parameters $k$ and $d$. In particular, in 2D we show that a quantum LDPC with
distance $n^{1/2 + \epsilon}$ code requires $\Omega(n^{1/2 + \epsilon})$

satisfying $k \propto n$ with distance $d \propto n^\alpha$ requires
$\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ interactions of length

quantum codes from graph metrics. As an application of these results, we
consider a model called a stacked architecture, which has previously been
considered as a potential way to implement quantum LDPC codes. In this model,
although most interactions are local, a few of them are allowed to be very
long. We prove that limited long-range connectivity implies quantitative bounds

Previous works have outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario where planets
of similar composition form sequentially at the H$_2$O snowline (${\sim}0.1$ au
for this low-mass star). It was hypothesized that the subsequent formation and
migration led to the current resonant configuration. Here, we investigate
whether the sequential planet formation model is indeed capable to produce the
present-day resonant configuration, characterized by its two-body and
three-body mean motion resonances structure. We carry out N-body simulations,
accounting for type-I migration, stellar tidal damping, disc
eccentricity-damping, and featuring a migration barrier located at the disc's
inner edge. Due to the sequential migration, planets naturally form a chain of
first-order resonances. But to explain the period ratios of the b/c/d-system,
which are presently in higher-order resonances, we find that planets b and c
must have marched across the migration barrier, into the gas-free cavity,
before the disc has dispersed. We investigate both an early and late cavity
infall scenario and find that the early infall model best matches the
constraints, as well as being more probable. After the dispersal of the gaseous
disc, stellar tidal torque also contributes towards a modest separation of the
inner system. We outline how the insights obtained in this work can be applied

targeted, three-dimensional shapes, have many potential engineering
applications. Though significant effort in recent years has been devoted to
designing fold patterns that can achieve a variety of target shapes, recent
work has also made clear that many origami structures exhibit multiple folding
pathways, with a proliferation of geometric folding pathways as the origami
structure becomes complex. The competition between these pathways can lead to
structures that are programmed for one shape, yet fold incorrectly. To
disentangle the features that lead to misfolding, we introduce a model of
self-folding origami that accounts for the finite stretching rigidity of the
origami faces and allows the computation of energy landscapes that lead to
misfolding. We find that, in addition to the geometrical features of the
origami, the finite elasticity of the nearly-flat origami configurations
regulates the proliferation of potential misfolded states through a series of
saddle-node bifurcations. We apply our model to one of the most common origami
motifs, the symmetric ""bird's foot,"" a single vertex with four folds. We show
that though even a small error in programmed fold angles induces metastability
in rigid origami, elasticity allows one to tune resilience to misfolding. In a
more complex design, the ""Randlett flapping bird,"" which has thousands of
potential competing states, we further show that the number of actual observed

the electroweak model. The consequence of this approach is the emergence of
anomalous couplings in the neutral sector of the $Z$-gauge boson and photon.
These new couplings consist of quartic interactions of the photon with the
$Z$-particle, as for example, three-photon-and-one-$Z$ vertex. With that, we
obtain the decay width of $Z \to 3\,\gamma$ from which we impose a bound on the
Born-Infeld parameter. Other bounds are also obtained from the photon quartic
couplings. Subsequently, we consider the presence of an external uniform
magnetic field in connection with this Born-Infeld weak hypercharge model. The
magnetic background field yields new kinematic effects, like the kinetic mixing
between the photon and the $Z$-boson, and we obtain thereby the corresponding
dispersion relations for the mixed photon-$Z$-particle system. Finally, we
calculate the lowest-order modifications to the interaction energy for the
anomalous coupling $3\gamma-Z$, within the framework of the gauge-invariant but
path-dependent variables formalism. Our results show that the interaction
energy contains a linear term leading to the confinement of static probe
charges. With the help of the potential that comes out, interparticle forces
are estimated.

safety guarantees during training. Therefore, simulation-based benchmarks that
provide abstractions for social navigation are required. A framework for these
benchmarks would need to support a wide variety of learning approaches, be
extensible to the broad range of social navigation scenarios, and abstract away
the perception problem to focus on social navigation explicitly. While there
have been many proposed solutions, including high fidelity 3D simulators and
grid world approximations, no existing solution satisfies all of the
aforementioned properties for learning and evaluating social navigation
behaviors. In this work, we propose SOCIALGYM, a lightweight 2D simulation

Newton's gravity, we confirm earlier results that for relatively homogeneous
systems, this rate of growth per crossing time increases with $N$ up to $N \sim
30$, but that for larger systems, the growth rate has a weaker scaling with
$N$. For concentrated systems, however, the rate of exponential growth
continues to scale with $N$. In relativistic self-gravitating systems, the rate
of growth is almost independent of $N$. This effect, however, is only
noticeable when the system's mean velocity approaches the speed of light to
within three orders of magnitude. The chaotic behavior of systems with more

pairwise interactions in the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equation of motion is
qualitatively different than when the interaction terms (or cross terms) are

traversing the solar system, understanding the dynamics of interstellar objects
is more pressing than ever. These detections have highlighted the possibility
that captured interstellar material could be trapped in our solar system. The
first step in rigorously investigating this question is to calculate a capture
cross section for interstellar objects as a function of hyperbolic excess
velocity, which can be convolved with any velocity dispersion to compute a
capture rate (Napier et. al. 2021). Although the cross section provides the
first step toward calculating the mass of alien rocks residing in our solar
system, we also need to know the lifetime of captured objects. We use an
ensemble of N-body simulations to characterize a dynamical lifetime for
captured interstellar objects and determines the fraction of surviving objects
as a function of time (since capture). We also illuminate the primary effects
driving their secular evolution. Finally, we use the resulting dynamical
lifetime function to estimate the current inventory of captured interstellar
material in the solar system. We find that capture from the field yields a
steady state mass of only $\sim 10^{-13} M_{\oplus}$, whereas the mass
remaining from capture events in the birth cluster is roughly $10^{-9}

teams, we must equip AI agents with a model of how humans make trade-offs in
complex, constrained environments. These agents will be able to mirror human
behavior or to draw human attention to situations where decision making could
be improved. To this end, we propose a novel inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) method for learning implicit hard and soft constraints from
demonstrations, enabling agents to quickly adapt to new settings. In addition,
learning soft constraints over states, actions, and state features allows
agents to transfer this knowledge to new domains that share similar aspects. We
then use the constraint learning method to implement a novel system
architecture that leverages a cognitive model of human decision making,
multi-alternative decision field theory (MDFT), to orchestrate competing
objectives. We evaluate the resulting agent on trajectory length, number of
violated constraints, and total reward, demonstrating that our agent
architecture is both general and achieves strong performance. Thus we are able
to capture and replicate human-like trade-offs from demonstrations in

supernova remnants (SNRs), via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), an efficient
mechanism that predicts power-law energy distributions of CRs. However,
observations of both nonthermal SNR emission and Galactic CRs imply CR spectra
that are steeper than the standard DSA prediction, $\propto E^{-2}$. Recent
kinetic hybrid simulations suggest that such steep spectra may be the result of
a ""postcursor"", or drift of CRs and magnetic structures with respect to the
thermal plasma behind the shock. Using a semi-analytic model of non-linear DSA,
we generalize this result to a wide range of astrophysical shocks. By
accounting for the presence of a postcursor, we produce CR energy distributions

star is nearly pole-on with an inclination of $13.4$ degree. We confirm the
spectroscopic pulsational properties previously reported, and report on three
photometric oscillations from KELT photometry. The outbursting behavior is
studied with equivalent width measurements of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, and the
variations in both of these can be quantitatively explained with two
frequencies through a Fourier analysis. One of the frequencies for the emission
outbursts is equal to the difference between two photometric oscillations,
linking these pulsation modes to the mass ejection mechanism for some
outbursts. During the TESS observation time period of 2019 October 7 to 2019

Robustness to the presence of outliers is achieved by using the so-called

objective function a distance measure aimed at neutralizing the effect of the
outliers, the noise approach builds an artificial cluster expected to contain
the outlying series and the trimmed approach eliminates the most atypical
series in the dataset. All the proposed techniques inherit the nice properties
of the quantile cross-spectral density, as being able to uncover general types

linear, nonlinear and GARCH processes indicate that the algorithms are
substantially effective in coping with the presence of outlying series (i.e.,

clearly poutperforming alternative procedures. The usefulness of the suggested

Thereby the persistent tension between inclusive and exclusive determinations
of $|V_{cb}|$ weakens the power of these theoretically clean decays in the
search for new physics (NP). We demonstrate how this uncertainty can be
practically removed by considering within the SM suitable ratios of the two
branching ratios between each other and with other observables like the
branching ratios for $K_S\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B\to

angles $\beta$ and $\gamma$ in the unitarity triangle (UT). This avoids the use
of the problematic $|V_{ub}|$. A ratio involving $B(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$ and
$B(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ while being $|V_{cb}|$-independent exhibits sizable
dependence on the angle $\gamma$. It should be of interest for several

$|V_{cb}|$-independent ratio of $B(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu)$ and
$B(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ from Belle II and LHCb signals a $1.8\sigma$ tension with
its SM value. As a complementary test of the Standard Model, we propose to
extract $|V_{cb}|$ from different observables as a function of $\beta$ and
$\gamma$. We illustrate this with $\epsilon_K$, $\Delta M_d$ and $\Delta M_s$
finding tensions between these three determinations of $|V_{cb}|$ within the
SM. From $\Delta M_s$ and $S_{\psi K_S}$ alone we find $|V_{cb}|=41.8(6)\times
10^{-3}$ and $|V_{ub}|=3.65(12)\times 10^{-3}$. We stress the importance of a
precise measurement of $\gamma$. We obtain most precise SM predictions for

microscopy, they strongly perturb the electromagnetic fields under study. Here,
through experiment and simulation, we detail light collection by uncoated fiber
probes, which minimize such perturbation. Second-harmonic light from
intensely-irradiated sub-wavelength sub-surface features was imaged to avoid
otherwise dominating fundamental light background, yielding clear nearfield
details through a 50 nm aperture uncoated probe with ~23 nm optical resolution.
Simulations shows how a metallic coating distorts optical nearfields and limits
optical coupling into the probe in comparison to an uncoated probe.

the Picasso effect and the loss of information by the pooling layer. The
Capsule network (CapsNet) was proposed to address these challenges because its
architecture can encode and preserve the spatial orientation of input images.
Similar to traditional CNNs, CapsNet is also vulnerable to several malicious
attacks, as studied by several researchers in the literature. However, most of
these studies focus on single-device-based inference, but horizontally
collaborative inference in state-of-the-art systems, like intelligent edge
services in self-driving cars, voice controllable systems, and drones, nullify
most of these analyses. Horizontal collaboration implies partitioning the
trained CNN models or CNN tasks to multiple end devices or edge nodes.
Therefore, it is imperative to examine the robustness of the CapsNet against
malicious attacks when deployed in horizontally collaborative environments.
Towards this, we examine the robustness of the CapsNet when subjected to
noise-based inference attacks in a horizontal collaborative environment. In
this analysis, we perturbed the feature maps of the different layers of four
DNN models, i.e., CapsNet, Mini-VGG, LeNet, and an in-house designed CNN
(ConvNet) with the same number of parameters as CapsNet, using two types of
noised-based attacks, i.e., Gaussian Noise Attack and FGSM noise attack. The
experimental results show that similar to the traditional CNNs, depending upon
the access of the attacker to the DNN layer, the classification accuracy of the
CapsNet drops significantly. For example, when Gaussian Noise Attack
classification is performed at the DigitCap layer of the CapsNet, the maximum
classification accuracy drop is approximately 97%.

control the spike density in latent representations. In the experiments, we
show that applying regularization on membrane potential and spiking output
successfully avoids both dead and bursting neurons and significantly decreases
the reconstruction error of the spiking auto-encoder. Training regularized
networks on the MNIST dataset yields image reconstruction quality comparable to
non-spiking baseline models (deterministic and variational auto-encoder) and
indicates improvement upon earlier approaches. Importantly, we show that,
unlike the variational auto-encoder, the spiking latent representations display

game-playing, has emphasized tackling difficult exploration problems such as
Montezuma's Revenge (Bellemare et al., 2016). Recently, bonus-based exploration
methods, which explore by augmenting the environment reward, have reached
above-human average performance on such domains. In this paper we reassess
popular bonus-based exploration methods within a common evaluation framework.
We combine Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) with different exploration bonuses and
evaluate its performance on Montezuma's Revenge, Bellemare et al.'s set of hard
of exploration games with sparse rewards, and the whole Atari 2600 suite. We
find that while exploration bonuses lead to higher score on Montezuma's Revenge
they do not provide meaningful gains over the simpler $\epsilon$-greedy scheme.
In fact, we find that methods that perform best on that game often underperform

intelligence. As an emerging technique for characterization, Spatial
Representation Learning (SRL) uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn
non-linear embedded features of spatial data for characterization. However, SRL
extracts features by internal layers of DNNs, and thus suffers from lacking
semantic labels. Texts of spatial entities, on the other hand, provide semantic
understanding of latent feature labels, but is insensible to deep SRL models.
How can we teach a SRL model to discover appropriate topic labels in texts and
pair learned features with the labels? This paper formulates a new problem:
feature-topic pairing, and proposes a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
based deep learning framework. Specifically, we formulate the feature-topic
pairing problem into an automated alignment task between 1) a latent embedding
feature space and 2) a textual semantic topic space. We decompose the alignment
of the two spaces into: 1) point-wise alignment, denoting the correlation
between a topic distribution and an embedding vector; 2) pair-wise alignment,
denoting the consistency between a feature-feature similarity matrix and a
topic-topic similarity matrix. We design a PSO based solver to simultaneously
select an optimal set of topics and learn corresponding features based on the
selected topics. We develop a closed loop algorithm to iterate between 1)
minimizing losses of representation reconstruction and feature-topic alignment
and 2) searching the best topics. Finally, we present extensive experiments to
demonstrate the enhanced performance of our method.

asymptotic expansion in Rossby number is quasigeostrophy which has purely
horizontal velocities and cyclone-anticylone antisymmetry. Ageostrophic effects
are important components of many geophysical flows and, as such, these
phenomena are not well-modeled by quasigeostrophy. The next order correction in
Rossby number, which includes ageostrohpic affects, is so-called balanced
dynamics. Balanced dynamics includes ageostrophic vertical velocity and breaks
the geostrophic cyclone-anticylone antisymmetry. Point vortex solutions are
well known in 2d and quasigeostrophic dynamics and are useful for studying the
vortex gas regime of geophysical turbulence. Here we find point vortex
solutions in fully three dimensional continuously stratified $QG^{+1}$

$QG^{+1}$ point vortices show several interesting features not captured by
quasigeostrophic point vortices including significant vertical transport on

intrinsic spin of electrons, the lattice vibration is rarely rotational. To
induce angular momentum, one needs to find a material that can accommodate a
twisted normal mode, two orthogonal modes or excitation of magnons. If
excitation is too strong, one may exceed the Lindemann limit, so the material
melts. Therefore these methods are not ideal. Here, we theoretically propose a
new route to phonon angular momentum in a molecular crystal $\rm C_{60}$. We
find that a single laser pulse is able to inject a significant amount of
angular momentum to $\rm C_{60}$, and the momentum transfer is
helicity-dependent. Changing from right-circularly polarized light to
left-circularly polarized light switches the direction of phonon angular
momentum. On the ultrafast time scale, the orbital angular momentum change
closely resembles the displacive excitation of coherent phonons, with a
cosine-function dependence on time, different from the spin counterpart. Atomic
displacements, even under strong laser excitation, remain far below the
Lindemann criterion. Under thermal excitation, spinning $\rm C_{60}$ even at
room temperature generates a huge angular momentum close to several hundred
$\hbar$. Our finding opens the door to a large group of fullerenes, from $\rm
C_{60}$, C$_{70}$ to their endohedral derivatives, where angular momentum can
be generated through light or temperature. This paves the way to the phononic
control electronic spin and harvesting thermal energy through phonon angular
momentum.

this work, we account for baryonic physics via a baryonic correction model that
modifies the matter distribution in dark matter-only $N$-body simulations,
mimicking the effects of galaxy formation and feedback. We implement this model
in a large suite of ray-tracing simulations, spanning a grid of cosmological

However, few approaches exist for directly detecting oceans on potentially
Earth-like exoplanets. In most cases, specular reflection of host starlight
from surface bodies of water -- referred to as ocean glint -- proves to be an
important aspect of liquids that can enable detection of habitable conditions.
Here, we propose that spectral principal component analysis (PCA) applied to
orbital phase-dependent observations of Earth-like exoplanets can provide a
straightforward means of detecting ocean glint and, thus, habitability. Using
high-fidelity, orbit-resolved spectral models of Earth, and for instrument
capabilities applicable to proposed exo-Earth direct imaging concept missions,
the extreme reddening effect of crescent-phase ocean glint is demonstrated as
the primary spectral component that explains phase-dependent variability for
orbital inclinations spanning 60--90 degrees. At smaller orbital inclinations
where more-extreme crescent phases cannot be accessed, glint can still
significantly increase planetary brightness but reddening effects are less
pronounced and, as a result, glint is not plainly indicated by phase-dependent
spectral PCA. Using instrument models for future exoplanet direct imaging
mission concepts, we show that brightness enhancements due to glint could be
detected across a wide range of orbital inclinations with typical exposure
times measured in hours to weeks, depending on system distance and mission
architecture. Thus, brightness increases due to glint are potentially
detectable for Earth-like exoplanets for most system inclinations and
phase-dependent spectral PCA could indicate reddening due to glint for a subset
of these inclinations.

(ii) conflict between the visual servoing objective and action objective due to
the underactuated nature. To deal with the first challenge, we parameterize a
visual feature by a bearing vector and a distance, by which the depth will no

service. Many such systems are built, maintained, and improved by customer
service specialists, rather than dialog systems engineers and computer

it is critical to understand what is working, what is not, and what actions can
be taken to reduce the frequency of inappropriate system responses. These
analyses and recommendations need to be presented in terms that directly
reflect the user experience rather than the internal dialog processing.
  This paper introduces and explains the use of Actionable Conversational
Quality Indicators (ACQIs), which are used both to recognize parts of dialogs
that can be improved, and to recommend how to improve them. This combines
benefits of previous approaches, some of which have focused on producing dialog
quality scoring while others have sought to categorize the types of errors the
dialog system is making.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of using ACQIs on LivePerson internal dialog
systems used in commercial customer service applications, and on the publicly
available CMU LEGOv2 conversational dataset (Raux et al. 2005). We report on
the annotation and analysis of conversational datasets showing which ACQIs are
important to fix in various situations.
  The annotated datasets are then used to build a predictive model which uses a
turn-based vector embedding of the message texts and achieves an 79% weighted
average f1-measure at the task of finding the correct ACQI for a given

potential improvement actions a bot-builder must consider at each turn could be
reduced by an average of 81%.

images to meet memory constraints, assuming all pixels are equally informative.
In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption can harm the segmentation
performance because the segmentation difficulty varies spatially. We combat
this problem by introducing a learnable downsampling module, which can be
optimised together with the given segmentation model in an end-to-end fashion.
We formulate the problem of training such downsampling module as optimisation
of sampling density distributions over the input images given their
low-resolution views. To defend against degenerate solutions (e.g.
over-sampling trivial regions like the backgrounds), we propose a
regularisation term that encourages the sampling locations to concentrate
around the object boundaries. We find the downsampling module learns to sample
more densely at difficult locations, thereby improving the segmentation
performance. Our experiments on benchmarks of high-resolution street view,
aerial and medical images demonstrate substantial improvements in terms of
efficiency-and-accuracy trade-off compared to both uniform downsampling and two

performance demands. This raise in performance needs comes from both control

able to provide high computational power under the constraints of the harsh
space environment. On the non-technical side, for strategic reasons it is
mandatory to get European independence on the used computing technology. In
this project, we study the applicability of embedded GPUs in space, which have
shown a dramatic improvement of their performance per-watt ratio coming from
their proliferation in consumer markets based on competitive European
technology. To that end, we perform an analysis of the existing space
application domains to identify which software domains can benefit from their
use. Moreover, we survey the embedded GPU domain in order to assess whether
embedded GPUs can provide the required computational power and identify the
challenges which need to be addressed for their adoption in space. In this
paper, we describe the steps followed in the project, as well as a summary of
results obtained from our analyses so far in the project.

software such as Zoom and Google Meet. Although this trend helps students
continue learning without in-person classes, it removes a vital tool that
teachers use to teach effectively: visual cues. By not being able to see a
student's face clearly, the teacher may not notice when the student needs
assistance, or when the student is not paying attention. In order to help
remedy the teachers of this challenge, this project proposes a machine learning
based approach that provides real-time student mental state monitoring and
classifications for the teachers to better conduct remote teaching. Using
publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) data collections, this research
explored four different classification techniques: the classic deep neural
network, the traditionally popular support vector machine, the latest
convolutional neural network, and the XGBoost model, which has gained
popularity recently. This study defined three mental classes: an engaged
learning mode, a confused learning mode, and a relaxed mode. The experimental
results from this project showed that these selected classifiers have varying
potentials in classifying EEG signals for mental states. While some of the
selected classifiers only yield around 50% accuracy with some delay, the best
ones can achieve 80% accurate classification in real-time. This could be very
beneficial for teachers in need of help making remote teaching adjustments, and
for many other potential applications where in-person interactions are not
possible.

spatial dependencies among the observations and among the disparity estimates.
These methods, however, are limited by spatially fixed and smaller neighborhood

probabilistic graphical model for disparity estimation that allows a larger and
a spatially variable neighborhood structure determined based on the local scene
characteristics. We evaluated our method using the Middlebury benchmark stereo

performance with recent state-of-the-art disparity estimation algorithms. The
new factor graph-based method provided disparity estimates with higher accuracy

in pairs show similar distributions in their global stellar mass, star
formation rate (SFR), and central [OIII] surface brightness. AGNs in pairs show
radial profiles of increasing specific SFR and declining Dn4000 from center to

clearly different from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in our pair sample, which

order to test various hypotheses related to whether developers with higher
scores tend to 1) perform a higher number of refactoring operations 2) exhibit
different motivations behind their refactoring, and 3) better document their

Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint angle detection are important for a

our results by using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to classify the
ultrasound information into several predefined hand configurations based on
activities of daily living (ADL). Ultrasound data from the forearm was obtained
from 6 subjects who were instructed to move their hands according to predefined
hand configurations relevant to ADLs. Motion capture data was acquired as the
ground truth for hand movements at different speeds (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, & 2 Hz) for
the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers. We were able to get promising SVC
classification results on a subset of our collected data set. We demonstrated a

neural network (DNN) that predicts the motion of all surrounding traffic agents
together with the ego-vehicle's motion. All predictions are probabilistic and
are represented in a simple top-down rasterization that allows an arbitrary
number of agents. Conditioned on a multi-layer map with lane information, the
network outputs future positions, velocities, and backtrace vectors jointly for
all agents including the ego-vehicle in a single pass. Trajectories are then
extracted from the output. The network can be used to simulate realistic
traffic, and it produces competitive results on popular benchmarks. More
importantly, it has been used to successfully control a real-world vehicle for
hundreds of kilometers, by combining it with a motion planning/control
subsystem. The network runs faster than real-time on an embedded GPU, and the
system shows good generalization (across sensory modalities and locations) due
to the choice of input representation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by
extending the DNN with reinforcement learning (RL), it can better handle rare
or unsafe events like aggressive maneuvers and crashes.

by molecular gas remains very rare, limited to just six systems at z > 0.05.
Detection of these transitions can yield precise diagnostics of the conditions
of the star forming gas in the earlier Universe, the hydroxyl (OH) radical
being of particular interest as in the 18-cm ground state there are four
different transitions located close to HI 21-cm and thus detectable with the
Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders. The four transitions of OH have
very different dependences on the fundamental constants, thus having much
potential in testing for any evolution in these over large look-back times. By
collating the photometry in a uniform manner, we confirm our previous
hypothesis that the normalised OH absorption strength is correlated with the
optical--near-infrared red colour of the sight-line. Applying this to the
published searches, we find that all, but one (J0414+054), have simply not been
searched sufficiently deeply. We suggest that this is due to the standard
selection of sources with reliable optical redshifts introducing a bias against
those with enough dust with which to shield the molecular gas. For the single
source searched to sufficient depth, we have reason to suspect that the high
degree of reddening arises from another system along the sight-line, thus not
being inconsistent with our hypothesis. We also show that the same optical
redshift bias can account for the scarcity of millimetre-band absorption.

coupled dual dynamics of macroscopic phase coherence and microscopic electronic
fluids in cuprate superconductors. We prove that the developed dual dynamics
provides an efficient and simplified approach to formulate the dephasing
process of macroscopic superconducting phase coherence, as well as its
influence on microscopic electronic fluids (including gap, densities of
superfluid and normal fluid, and in particular, the transport property to
determine superconducting transition temperature $T_c$). We then present
theoretical description of the preformed Cooper pairs in pseudogap state. The
key origin of pseudogap state comes from the quantum effect of disorder, which
excites the macroscopic inhomogeneous phase fluctuation through Josephson
effect. Influenced by this phase fluctuation, there exist normal fluid and
viscous superfluid below $T_c$ in cuprate superconductors, in addition to
conventional non-viscous superfluid. The normal fluid always emerges around
nodal points even at zero temperature, whereas the viscous superfluid emerges
due to the friction between superfluid and normal fluid. Particularly, the
non-viscous superfluid gets suppressed when the phase fluctuation is enhanced
by increasing temperature, until vanishes at $T_c$. Then, the system enters the
pseudogap state, showing the nonzero resistivity as well as the finite gap from
the viscous superfluid. By further increasing temperature to $T^{\rm os}$, the
viscous superfluid and hence gap vanish. An experimental scheme to distinguish
the densities of normal fluid as well as viscous and non-viscous superfluids is
proposed. Finally, this theory is also applied to low-dimensional disordered
$s$-wave superconductors.

An isomorphism mapping between the dq-axes phase voltages and two auxiliary
control inputs over full ranges of torque and speed is established by the
linearization controller using the notion of orthogonal projection. The
auxiliary control inputs are defined to be exclusively responsible for torque
generation and power consumption. Subsequently, an analytical solution for the

is captured at the transition when grains connect to form a one-component

the contribution of pores of certain chosen areas to $\Phi_p$. Pinhole survival
is evaluated at the transition when film closure occurs using survival function
estimates. The morphology of closed films ($\Phi = 1$) is also characterized

warping used in the prevailing learning based MVS methods is only applicable to
pin-hole cameras. In order to apply the SOTA learning based MVS technology to
the satellite MVS task for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, RPC
warping should be considered. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a
rigorous RPC warping module. The rational polynomial coefficients are recorded
as a tensor, and the RPC warping is formulated as a series of tensor
transformations. Based on the RPC warping, we propose the deep learning based
satellite MVS (SatMVS) framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth
surface reconstruction. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset
consisting of 519 5120${\times}$5120 images, which we call the TLC SatMVS
dataset. The satellite images were acquired from a three-line camera (TLC) that
catches triple-view images simultaneously, forming a valuable supplement to the
existing open-source WorldView-3 datasets with single-scanline images.
Experiments show that the proposed RPC warping module and the SatMVS framework
can achieve a superior reconstruction accuracy compared to the pin-hole fitting

demonstrated experimentally. Atoms were released within a dumbbell-shaped
optical trap, where the channel of variable aspect ratio provided the only path
for particles to travel between source and drain reservoirs. This channel can
be populated with columnar (repulsive) optical potential spikes of square cross
section with arbitrary pattern. These spikes constitute impurities, the
scattering centres for the otherwise free propagation of the particles. This
geometry does not allow for classical potential trapping which can be hard to
exclude in other experimental setups. Here we add further theoretical evidence
for Anderson localization in this system by comparing the transport processes
within a regular and a random pattern of impurities. It is demonstrated that
the transport within randomly distributed impurities is suppressed and the
corresponding localization length becomes shorter than the channel length.
However, if an equal density of impurities are distributed in a regular manner,
the transport is only modestly disturbed. This observation corroborates the
conclusions of the experimental observation: the localization is indeed
attributed to the disorder. Beyond analysing the density distribution and the
localization length, we also calculate a quantum `impedance' exhibiting
qualitatively different behaviour for regular and random impurity patterns.

correct outputs with high probability even when the stream updates are chosen
by an adversary who may observe and react to the past outputs of the algorithm.
We grow the burgeoning body of work on such algorithms in a new direction by
studying robust algorithms for the problem of maintaining a valid vertex
coloring of an $n$-vertex graph given as a stream of edges. Following standard
practice, we focus on graphs with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and aim for
colorings using a small number $f(\Delta)$ of colors.
  A recent breakthrough (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna; SODA~2019) shows that in the
standard, non-robust, streaming setting, $(\Delta+1)$-colorings can be obtained
while using only $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space. Here, we prove that an adversarially
robust algorithm running under a similar space bound must spend almost
$\Omega(\Delta^2)$ colors and that robust $O(\Delta)$-coloring requires a
linear amount of space, namely $\Omega(n\Delta)$. We in fact obtain a more
general lower bound, trading off the space usage against the number of colors
used. From a complexity-theoretic standpoint, these lower bounds provide
(i)~the first significant separation between adversarially robust algorithms
and ordinary randomized algorithms for a natural problem on insertion-only
streams and (ii)~the first significant separation between randomized and
deterministic coloring algorithms for graph streams, since deterministic
streaming algorithms are automatically robust.
  We complement our lower bounds with a suite of positive results, giving
adversarially robust coloring algorithms using sublinear space. In particular,
we can maintain an $O(\Delta^2)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n
\sqrt{\Delta})$ space and an $O(\Delta^3)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n)$
space.

transmissibility emerges, immediate usage of vaccines or medicines is hardly
available. Thus, many health authorities rely on non-pharmaceutical
interventions through traceable fixed contacts. However, in reality, there is
an additional type of transmission routes to the regular and fixed contacts:
the random anonymous infection cases where non-pharmaceutical interventions are
hardly feasible. In our study, such realistic situations are implemented by the
susceptible-infected-recovered model with isolation on multiplex networks. The
multiplex networks are composed of a fixed interaction layer and a layer with
time-varying random interactions to represent the different types of disease
spreading routes. The multiplex networks represent the combinations of the
quenched disorder and annealed disorder. Here, we suggest a preemptive
isolation protocol which isolates the second nearest neighbors of the
hospitalized individuals and compare it with one of the most popular protocol
adopted by many health organizations over the globe. From numerical simulations
we find that our preemptive measure significantly reduces both the final
epidemic size and the number of the isolated per unit time. Our finding
suggests a better non-pharmaceutical intervention which can be adopted to

condition for tractable algorithm design. Separability-based NMF is mainly
handled by two types of approaches, namely, greedy pursuit and convex
programming. A notable convex NMF formulation is the so-called self-dictionary
multiple measurement vectors (SD-MMV), which can work without knowing the
matrix rank a priori, and is arguably more resilient to error propagation
relative to greedy pursuit. However, convex SD-MMV renders a large memory cost
that scales quadratically with the problem size. This memory challenge has been
around for a decade, and a major obstacle for applying convex SD-MMV to big
data analytics. This work proposes a memory-efficient algorithm for convex
SD-MMV. Our algorithm capitalizes on the special update rules of a classic
algorithm from the 1950s, namely, the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. It is shown
that, under reasonable conditions, the FW algorithm solves the noisy SD-MMV
problem with a memory cost that grows linearly with the amount of data. To
handle noisier scenarios, a smoothed group sparsity regularizer is proposed to
improve robustness while maintaining the low memory footprint with guarantees.
The proposed approach presents the first linear memory complexity algorithmic
framework for convex SD-MMV based NMF. The method is tested over a couple of
unsupervised learning tasks, i.e., text mining and community detection, to
showcase its effectiveness and memory efficiency.

energy $t(k)$, the isospin symmetric and asymmetric parts of the single-nucleon
potentials $U_0(\rho,k)$ and $U_{\text{\text{sym,i}}}(\rho,k)$. The six basic
quantities include the quadratic symmetry energy $E_{\text{sym,2}}(\rho)$, the
quartic symmetry energy $E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho)$, their corresponding density
slopes $L_2(\rho)$ and $L_4(\rho)$, and the incompressibility coefficients
$K_2(\rho)$ and $K_4(\rho)$. By using four types of well-known effective
nucleon-nucleon interaction models, namely the BGBD, MDI, Skyrme, and Gogny
forces, the density- and isospin-dependent properties of these basic quantities
are systematically calculated and their values at the saturation density
$\rho_0$ are explicitly given. The contributions to these quantities from
$t(k)$, $U_0(\rho,k)$, and $U_{\text{sym,i}}(\rho,k)$ are also analyzed at the
normal nuclear density $\rho_0$. It is clearly shown that the first-order
asymmetric term $U_{\text{sym,1}}(\rho,k)$ (also known as the symmetry
potential in Lane potential) plays a vital role in determining the density
dependence of the quadratic symmetry energy $E_{\text{sym,2}}(\rho)$. It is
also shown that the contributions from high-order asymmetric parts of the
single-nucleon potentials ($U_{\text{sym,i}}(\rho,k)$ with $i>1$) cannot be
neglected in the calculations of the other five basic quantities. Moreover, by
analyzing the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter at the exact saturation
density $\rho_{\text{sat}}(\delta)$, the corresponding quadratic
incompressibility coefficient is found to have a simple empirical relation
$K_{\text{sat,2}}=K_{2}(\rho_0)-4.14 L_2(\rho_0)$.

which describes the optimal success probability of transmitting a randomly
selected classical message over the channel. The cv also offers a dual
interpretation as the classical communication cost for zero-error channel
simulation using non-signaling resources. We first provide an entropic
characterization of the cv as a generalized conditional min-entropy over the
cone of separable operators. Additionally, the logarithm of a channel's cv is
shown to be equivalent to its max-Holevo information, which can further be
related to channel capacity. We evaluate the cv exactly for all qubit channels
and the Werner-Holevo family of channels. While all classical channels are
multiplicative under tensor product, this is no longer true for quantum
channels in general. We provide a family of qutrit channels for which the cv is
non-multiplicative. On the other hand, we prove that any pair of qubit channels
have multiplicative cv when used in parallel. Even stronger, all
entanglement-breaking channels and the partially depolarizing channel are shown
to have multiplicative cv when used in parallel with any channel. We then turn
to the entanglement-assisted cv and prove that it is equivalent to the
conditional min-entropy of the Choi matrix of the channel. A final component of
this work investigates relaxations of the channel cv to other cones such as the
set of operators having a positive partial transpose (PPT). The PPT cv is
analytically and numerically investigated for well-known channels such as the

for the Ca site. The evaluation of the formation energy of these defects in

Ca/Mg or $G3$ = Sc/Y, and $G3$ = La/Y substitutional doping for the Ca site are
relatively favorable among the possibilities considered. In particular, the
formation energy of the La substitutional doping for the Ca site is the lowest
among the considered cases both for CaZn$_2X_2$ ($X$ = As, P) and is negative,

\ln{\Delta_{\text{AFM}}})^2$ in the square lattice case. A first-order
semi-metal to the underlying paramagnetic (PM) insulator Mott transition is
corroborated at $U_{\text{Mott}}=8.36t$, which is responsible for a broad
crossover around $U_{c} = 5.4t$ between the weak- and strong-coupling regimes
in the AFM state that increases with $\delta$, in contrast to the square
lattice case. In the doped system, the compressibility $\kappa$ near the van
Hove singularity at $\delta=1/4$ is suppressed substantially by the interaction
before the semi-metal to AFM transition occurs, whereas $\kappa$ near the Dirac
points is very close to the noninteracting one, indicating that the Dirac cone
structure of the energy dispersion is rather robust. An overall phase diagram
in the $U$-$\delta$ plane is presented, consisting of four regimes: the AFM
insulator at $\delta=0$ for $U> U_{\text{AFM}}$, the AFM metal with
compressibility $\kappa>0$ or $\kappa<0$, and the PM semi-metal, and the AFM

We consider the robust matrix factorization approach. We employ a robust

an overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable. We then solve
the associated nonconvex nonsmooth problem using a subgradient method with
diminishing stepsizes. We show that under a regularity condition on the sensing

(RDPP), even with rank overspecified, the subgradient method converges to the
exact low-rank solution at a sublinear rate. Moreover, our result is more
general in the sense that it automatically speeds up to a linear rate once the
factor rank matches the unknown rank. On the other hand, we show that the RDPP
condition holds under generic settings, such as Gaussian measurements under
independent or adversarial sparse corruptions, where the result could be of
independent interest. Both the exact recovery and the convergence rate of the
proposed subgradient method are numerically verified in the overspecified

overparameterized models, such as robust matrix sensing and learning robust

composition measurements in and around the footpoints of hot, coronal loops in
the core of the active region were able to explain the values later measured
in-situ by the Wind spacecraft. Due to important differences in elemental
composition between SEPs and the solar wind, the magnitude of the Si/S
elemental abundance ratio emerged as a key diagnostic of SEP seed population
and solar wind source locations. We seek to understand if the results are
typical of other active regions, even if they are not solar wind sources or SEP

together with an evolutionary magnetic field model, in a new approach to
investigate a typical solar active region (AR 11150), and identify the
locations of highly fractionated (high Si/S abundance ratio) plasma. Material

case have expanded to the AR periphery, show the signature, and can be released
from magnetic field opened by reconnection at the AR boundary. Since the
fundamental characteristics of closed field loops being opened at the AR

Conventional nonlinear optical spectroscopy and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, which use classical probes such as electromagnetic waves, can
only access certain types of correlations in a quantum system. The idea of
quantum nonlinear spectroscopy was recently proposed to use quantum probes such
as entangled photons to achieve sensitivities and resolutions beyond the
classical limits. It is shown that quantum sensing can extract arbitrary types
and orders of correlations in a quantum system by first quantum-entangling a
sensor and the object and then measuring the sensor. Quantum sensing has been
applied to achieve nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single atoms and the
second-order correlation spectroscopy has been adopted to enhance the spectral
resolution. However, quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (i.e., the measurement of
higher-order correlations) of single nuclear spins is still elusive. Here we
demonstrate the extraction of fourth-order correlations of single nuclear spins
that cannot be measured in conventional nonlinear spectroscopy, using
sequential weak measurement via an atomic quantum sensor, namely, a
nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We show that the quantum nonlinear
spectroscopy provides fingerprint features to identify different types of
objects, such as Gaussian noises, random-phased AC fields, and quantum spins,
which would be indistinguishable in second-order correlations. The measured
fourth-order correlation unambiguously differentiates a single nuclear spin and
a random-phased AC field. This work constitutes an initial step toward the
application of higher-order correlations to quantum sensing, to examining the
quantum foundation (by, e.g., higher-order Leggett-Garg inequality), and to
studying quantum many-body physics.

advantage of an improved neutron tagging algorithm to lower the energy

molecular frame of reference the effect of temperature on the anisotropy ratios

the sunspots and the energy transport therein. Two subsurface structure models
have been proposed, the monolithic and cluster models, but no clear
observational evidence supporting a particular model has been found so far. To
obtain clues about the subsurface structure of sunspots, we analyzed umbral
flashes in merging sunspots registered by IRIS Mg II 2796 Angstrom slit-jaw
images (SJIs). Umbral flashes are regarded as an observational manifestation of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock waves originating from convection cells below
the photosphere. By tracking the motion of individual umbral flashes, we
determined the position of the convection cells that are the oscillation
centers located below the umbra. We found that the oscillation centers are
preferentially located at dark nuclei in the umbral cores rather than in bright
regions such as light bridges or umbral dots. Moreover, the oscillation centers
tend to deviate from the convergent interface of the merging sunspots where
vigorous convection is expected to occur. We also found that the inferred
depths of the convection cells have no noticeable regional dependence. These
results suggest that the subsurface of the umbra is an environment where
convection can occur more easily than the convergent interface, and hence
support the cluster model. For more concrete results, further studies based on
umbral velocity oscillations in the lower atmosphere are required.

temperature of $\sim$0.4--0.6 MK and a hot component peaking at $\sim$7--8 MK.
The two MFRs exhibit erupting, expanding, and untwisting motions that manifest
distinctive features from two different viewpoints. Their evolution can be
divided into two stages, a fast-eruption stage with speeds of about 105--125 km
s$^{-1}$ for MFR-1 and 50--65 km s$^{-1}$ for MFR-2 and a slow-expansion (or
untwisting) stage with speeds of about 10--35 km s$^{-1}$ for MFR-1 and 10--30
km s$^{-1}$ for MFR-2 in the plane of sky. We also find that during the
two-stage evolution, the high temperature features mainly appear in the
interface region between MFRs and ambient magnetic structures and also in the
center of MFRs, which suggests that some heating processes take place in such
places like magnetic reconnection and plasma compression. These observational

using the discovered centroidal static poses as the initial states, we can
improve data efficiency by reducing redundant explorations, and enhance the
robustness by more effective explorations from the centroids to sampled poses.

surgeons frequently need to adjust the endoscopic camera to achieve good
viewpoints. Simultaneously controlling the camera and the surgical instruments
is impossible, and consequentially, these camera adjustments repeatedly
interrupt the surgery. Autonomous camera control could help overcome this
challenge, but most existing systems are reactive, e.g., by having the camera
follow the surgical instruments. We propose a predictive approach for
anticipating when camera movements will occur using artificial neural networks.
We used the kinematic data of the surgical instruments, which were recorded
during robotic-assisted surgical training on porcine models. We split the data
into segments, and labeled each either as a segment that immediately precedes a
camera movement, or one that does not. Due to the large class imbalance, we
trained an ensemble of networks, each on a balanced sub-set of the training
data. We found that the instruments' kinematic data can be used to predict when
camera movements will occur, and evaluated the performance on different segment
durations and ensemble sizes. We also studied how much in advance an upcoming
camera movement can be predicted, and found that predicting a camera movement
0.25, 0.5, and 1 second before they occurred achieved 98%, 94%, and 84%
accuracy relative to the prediction of an imminent camera movement. This
indicates that camera movement events can be predicted early enough to leave
time for computing and executing an autonomous camera movement and suggests
that an autonomous camera controller for RAMIS may one day be feasible.

generate a model by using training data to predict the test data instances as
accurate as possible. Nonetheless, concerns about data privacy are increasingly
raised, but not always addressed. We present a secure protocol for learning a
linear model relying on recently described technique called real number secret
sharing. We take as our starting point the PAC Bayesian bounds and deduce a
closed form for the model parameters which depends on the data and the prior
from the PAC Bayesian bounds. To obtain the model parameters one needs to solve
a linear system. However, we consider the situation where several parties hold
different data instances and they are not willing to give up the privacy of the
data. Hence, we suggest to use real number secret sharing and multiparty
computation to share the data and solve the linear regression in a secure way
without violating the privacy of data. We suggest two methods; a secure inverse
method and a secure Gaussian elimination method, and compare these methods at
the end. The benefit of using secret sharing directly on real numbers is
reflected in the simplicity of the protocols and the number of rounds needed.
However, this comes with the drawback that a share might leak a small amount of
information, but in our analysis we argue that the leakage is small.

Recently, driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, deep learning
inspired audit techniques have emerged in the field of auditing vast quantities
of journal entry data. Nowadays, the majority of such methods rely on a set of
specialized models, each trained for a particular audit task. At the same time,
when conducting a financial statement audit, audit teams are confronted with

auditors prefer to harness only a single preferably `multi-purpose' model

Garey\&Jonhson's book. We are given a grid with $n$ vertical and horizontal
slots and a dictionary with $m$ words and are asked to place words from the
dictionary in the slots so that shared cells are consistent. We attempt to
pinpoint the source of intractability of this problem by taking into account
the structure of the grid graph, which contains a vertex for each slot and an
edge if two slots intersect. Our main approach is to consider the case where
this graph has a tree-like structure. Unfortunately, if we impose the common
rule that words cannot be reused, we show that the problem remains NP-hard even
under very severe structural restrictions. The problem becomes slightly more
tractable if word reuse is allowed, as we obtain an $m^{tw}$ algorithm in this
case, where $tw$ is the treewidth of the grid graph. However, even in this
case, we show that our algorithm cannot be improved. More strongly, we show
that under the ETH the problem cannot be solved in time $m^{o(k)}$, where $k$
is the number of horizontal slots of the instance.
  Motivated by these mostly negative results, we consider the much more
restricted case where the problem is parameterized by the number of slots $n$.
Here, we show that the problem becomes FPT, but the parameter dependence is
exponential in $n^2$. We show that this dependence is also justified: the
existence of an algorithm with running time $2^{o(n^2)}$ would contradict the
randomized ETH. Finally, we consider an optimization version of the problem,
where we seek to place as many words on the grid as possible. Here it is easy
to obtain a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation, even on weighted instances. We show
that this algorithm is also likely to be optimal, as obtaining a better

  Diffusing Method","None",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dense vertex-to-vertex correspondence between 3D faces is a fundamental and
challenging issue for 3D&2D face analysis. While the sparse landmarks have
anatomically ground-truth correspondence, the dense vertex correspondences on
most facial regions are unknown. In this view, the current literatures commonly
result in reasonable but diverse solutions, which deviate from the optimum to
the 3D face dense registration problem. In this paper, we revisit dense
registration by a dimension-degraded problem, i.e. proportional segmentation of
a line, and employ an iterative dividing and diffusing method to reach the
final solution uniquely. This method is then extended to 3D surface by
formulating a local registration problem for dividing and a linear least-square
problem for diffusing, with constraints on fixed features. On this basis, we
further propose a multi-resolution algorithm to accelerate the computational
process. The proposed method is linked to a novel local scaling metric, where
we illustrate the physical meaning as smooth rearrangement for local cells of
3D facial shapes. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in various aspects. Generally, the
proposed method leads to coherent local registrations and elegant mesh grid
routines for fine-grained 3D face dense registrations, which benefits many
downstream applications significantly. It can also be applied to dense
correspondence for other format of data which are not limited to face. The core
code will be publicly available at

quantum computation due to their long-range entanglement. Curiously these
quasiparticles are charge-neutral, hence elusive to most conventional
measurement techniques. A proposed host of such quasiparticles is the $\nu$=5/2
quantum Hall state. The gapless edge modes can provide the topological order of
the state, which in turn identifies the chirality of the non-abelian mode.
Since the $\nu$=5/2 state hosts a variety of edge modes (integer, fractional,
neutral), a robust technique is needed to isolate the fractional channel while
retaining its original non-abelian character. Moreover, a single non-abelian
channel can be easily manipulated to interfere, thus revealing the state's
immunity to decoherence. In this work, we exploit a novel approach to gap-out
the integer modes of the $\nu$=5/2 state by interfacing the state with integer
states, $\nu$=2 & $\nu$=3 (1). The electrical conductance of the isolated
interface channel was 0.5e$^2$/h, as expected. More importantly, we find a
thermal conductance of 0.5$\kappa_0$T (with $\kappa_0$=$\pi^2k_B^2$/3h),
confirming unambiguously the non-abelian nature of the $\nu$=1/2 interface
channel and its Particle-Hole Pfaffian topological order. Our result opens new
avenues to manipulate and test other exotic QHE states and braid, via
interference, the isolated fractional channels.

dye-filled microcavities in 2010, many investigations have focused upon the
emerging effective photon-photon interaction. Despite its smallness, it can be
identified to stem from two physically distinct mechanisms. On the one hand, a
Kerr nonlinearity of the dye medium yields a photon-photon contact interaction.
On the other hand, a heating of the dye medium leads to an additional
thermo-optic interaction, which is both delayed and non-local. The latter turns
out to represent the leading contribution to the effective interaction for the
current 2D experiments. Here we analyse theoretically how the effective
photon-photon interaction increases when the system dimension is reduced from
2D to 1D. To this end, we consider an anisotropic harmonic trapping potential
and determine via a variational approach how the properties of the photon
Bose-Einstein condensate in general, and both aforementioned interaction
mechanisms in particular, change with increasing anisotropy. We find that the
thermo-optic interaction strength increases at first linearly with the trap
aspect ratio and lateron saturates at a certain value of the trap aspect ratio.
Furthermore, in the strong 1D limit the roles of both interactions get reversed
as the thermo-optic interaction remains saturated and the contact Kerr
interaction becomes the leading interaction mechanism. Finally, we discuss how
the predicted effects can be measured experimentally.

developed a code to calculate the synchrotron emission from a simplified shell

the effect of a variable source function that describes electrons accelerated

at the same time. The other is that the emitting region is under acceleration
in addition to the cooling process being dominated by SSC cooling. Otherwise,
hard-to-soft patterns of $E_\text{p}$ are normally expected. Moreover, a

H I line asymmetries. Central galaxies with symmetric H I line profiles
typically correspond to rotationally supported H I and stellar disks, but those
with asymmetric line profiles may or may not correspond to dispersion-dominated
systems. Galaxies with symmetric H I emission lines are, on average, more gas
rich than those with asymmetric lines, and also exhibit systematic differences
in their specific star formation rates, suggesting that turbulence generated by
stellar or AGN feedback may be one factor contributing to H I line asymmetry.
The line asymmetry also correlates strongly with the dynamical state of a
galaxy's host dark matter halo: older, more relaxed haloes host more-symmetric
galaxies than those hosted by unrelaxed ones. At fixed halo mass, asymmetric
centrals tend to be surrounded by a larger number of massive subhaloes than
their symmetric counterparts, and also experience higher rates of gas accretion
and outflow. At fixed stellar mass, central galaxies have, on average, more
symmetric H I emission lines than satellites; for the latter, ram pressure and
tidal stripping are significant sources of asymmetry.

Hinode X-ray telescope in high temporal cadence. A brightening loop footpoint
is located within narrow field of views ALMA, IRIS slit-jaw imager, and Hinode

detected in Si IV and ALMA images, while the counterparts were less apparent in

  Review D",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA gr-qc hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a covariant formulation of refracted gravity (RG), a classical
theory of gravity based on the introduction of the gravitational permittivity
-- a monotonic function of the local mass density -- in the standard Poisson
equation. The gravitational permittivity mimics the dark matter phenomenology.
Our covariant formulation of RG (CRG) belongs to the class of scalar-tensor
theories, where the scalar field $\varphi$ has a self-interaction potential
$\mathcal{V}(\varphi)=-\Xi\varphi$, with $\Xi$ a normalization constant. We
show that the scalar field is twice the gravitational permittivity in the
weak-field limit. Far from a spherical source of density $\rho_s(r)$, the
transition between the Newtonian and the RG regime appears below the
acceleration scale $a_\Xi=(2\Xi-8\pi G\rho/\varphi)^{1/2}$, with
$\rho=\rho_s+\rho_\mathrm{bg}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{bg}$ an isotropic and
homogeneous background. In the limit $2\Xi\gg 8\pi G\rho/\varphi$, we obtain
$a_\Xi\sim 10^{-10}$~m~s$^{-2}$. This acceleration is comparable to the
acceleration $a_0$ originally introduced in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).
From CRG, we also derive the modified Friedmann equations for an expanding,
homogeneous, and isotropic universe. We find that the same scalar field that
mimics dark matter also drives the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Since
$\Xi$ plays a role roughly similar to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in
the standard model and has a comparable value, CRG suggests a natural
explanation of the known relation $a_0\sim \Lambda^{1/2}$. CRG thus appears to
describe both the dynamics of cosmic structure and the expanding Universe with
a single scalar field, and falls within the family of models that unify the two
dark sectors, highlighting a possible deep connection between phenomena
currently attributed to dark matter and dark energy separately.

importance in various contexts ranging from finance to climatology. This brings
such recurrent events to the limelight of attention in interdisciplinary
research. A comprehensive review of recent progress is provided to capture
recent improvements in analyzing such very high-amplitude events from the point
of view of dynamical systems and random walkers. We emphasize, in detail, the
mechanisms responsible for the emergence of such events in complex systems.
Several mechanisms that contribute to the occurrence of extreme events have
been elaborated that investigate the sources of instabilities leading to them.
In addition, we discuss the prediction of extreme events from two different
contexts, using dynamical instabilities and data-based machine learning
algorithms. Tracking of instabilities in the phase space is not always feasible
and precise knowledge of the dynamics of extreme events does not necessarily
help in forecasting extreme events. Moreover, in most studies on
high-dimensional systems, only a few degrees of freedom participate in extreme
events' formation. Thus, the notable inclusion of prediction through machine
learning is of enormous significance, particularly for those cases where the
governing equations of the model are explicitly unavailable. Besides, random
walks on complex networks can represent several transport processes, and
exceedances of the flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold may describe
extreme events. We unveil the theoretical studies on random walkers with their
enormous potential for applications in reducing extreme events. We cover the
possible controlling strategies, which may be helpful to mitigate extreme
events in physical situations like traffic jams, heavy load of web requests,
competition for shared resources, floods in the network of rivers, and many
more.

most studied dynamic phenomena in the solar corona. The oscillations are
excited by impulsive energy releases, such as low coronal eruptions. Typical
periods of the oscillations are from a few to several minutes, and are found to
increase linearly with the increase in the major radius of the oscillating
loops. It clearly demonstrates that kink oscillations are natural modes of the
loops, and can be described as standing fast magnetoacoustic waves with the
wavelength determined by the length of the loop. Kink oscillations are observed
in two different regimes. In the rapidly decaying regime, the apparent
displacement amplitude reaches several minor radii of the loop. The damping
time which is about several oscillation periods decreases with the increase in
the oscillation amplitude, suggesting a nonlinear nature of the damping. In the
decayless regime, the amplitudes are smaller than a minor radius, and the
driver is still debated. The review summarises major findings obtained during
the last decade, and covers both observational and theoretical results.
Observational results include creation and analysis of comprehensive catalogues
of the oscillation events, and detection of kink oscillations with imaging and
spectral instruments in the EUV and microwave bands. Theoretical results
include various approaches to modelling in terms of the magnetohydrodynamic
wave theory. Properties of kink oscillations are found to depend on parameters
of the oscillating loop, such as the magnetic twist, stratification, steady
flows, temperature variations and so on, which make kink oscillations a natural
probe of these parameters by the method of magnetohydrodynamic seismology.

make up a computer security system. Several machine learning-based NIDS have
been proposed in recent years, but most of them were developed and evaluated
under the assumption that the training context is similar to the test context.
In real networks, this assumption is false, given the emergence of new attacks
and variants of known attacks. To deal with this reality, the open set
recognition field, which is the most general task of recognizing classes not
seen during training in any domain, began to gain importance in NIDS research.
Yet, existing solutions are often bounded to high temporal complexities and
performance bottlenecks. In this work, we propose an algorithm to be used in
NIDS that performs open set recognition. Our proposal is an adaptation of the
single-class Energy-based Flow Classifier (EFC), which proved to be an
algorithm with strong generalization capability and low computational cost. The
new version of EFC correctly classifies not only known attacks, but also
unknown ones, and differs from other proposals from the literature by
presenting a single layer with low temporal complexity. Our proposal was
evaluated against well-established multi-class algorithms and as an open set
classifier. It proved to be an accurate classifier in both evaluations, similar
to the state of the art. As a conclusion of our work, we consider EFC a
promising algorithm to be used in NIDS for its high performance and
applicability in real networks.

usually trained with data from a fixed array geometry, which can lead to
degradation in accuracy when a different array is used in testing. This makes
it challenging to deploy these systems in practice, as it is costly to retrain
and deploy different models for various array configurations. To address this,
we present a simple and effective data augmentation technique, which is based
on randomly dropping channels in the multi-channel audio input during training,
in order to improve the robustness to various array configurations at test
time. We call this technique ChannelAugment, in contrast to SpecAugment (SA)
which drops time and/or frequency components of a single channel input audio.
We apply ChannelAugment to the Spatial Filtering (SF) and Minimum Variance
Distortionless Response (MVDR) neural beamforming approaches. For SF, we
observe 10.6% WER improvement across various array configurations employing
different numbers of microphones. For MVDR, we achieve a 74% reduction in

texture, and sweetness. They are, however, among the most sensitive fruits when
it comes to the quality of the end product. The recent commercial trends show a
rising number of farmers who directly sell their products and are interested in
using smart solutions for a continuous quality control of the product.
Cloud-based approaches for smart irrigation have been widely used in the recent
years. However, the network traffic, security and regulatory challenges, which
come hand in hand with sharing the crop data with third parties outside the
edge of the network, lead strawberry farmers and data owners to rely on global
clouds and potentially lose control over their data, which are usually
transferred to third party data centers. In this paper, we follow a three-step
methodological approach in order to design, implement and validate a solution
for smart strawberry irrigation in greenhouses, while keeping the corresponding
data at the edge of the network: (i) We develop a small-scale smart irrigation
prototype solution with off-the-shelf hardware and software equipment, which we
test and evaluate on different kinds of plants in order to gain useful insights
for larger scale deployments, (ii) we introduce a reference network
architecture, specifically targeting smart irrigation and edge data
distribution for strawberry greenhouses, and (iii) adopting the proposed
reference architecture, we implement a full-scale system in an actual
strawberry greenhouse environment in Greece, and we compare its performance
against that of conventional strawberries irrigation. We show that our design
significantly outperforms the conventional approach, both in terms of soil
moisture variation and in terms of water consumption, and conclude by
critically appraising the costs and benefits of our approach in the

network upgrades while increasing the proportion of renewable energy generation
in the electrical grid, when properly designed. In contrast, poorly designed
DES can accelerate the degeneration of existing network infrastructure. Most
optimisation models used to design grid-connected DES have oversimplified or
excluded constraints associated with alternating current (AC) power flow, as
the latter has been studied in a standalone class of models known as Optimal
Power Flow (OPF). A small subset of models, labelled DES-OPF models, have
attempted to combine these independent frameworks. However, the impacts of
using a DES-OPF framework on the resulting designs, as opposed to a
conventional DES framework without AC power flow, have not been studied in
previous work. This study aims to shed light on these impacts by proposing a
bi-level method to solve the computationally-expensive DES-OPF framework, and
simultaneously comparing results to a baseline MILP model that utilises direct
current (DC) approximations in place of AC OPF, as found abundantly in
literature. Two test cases of varying scale are employed to test the frameworks
and compare resulting designs. The practical feasibility of the designs is
assessed, based on whether the designs can mitigate network violations and
energy wastage during standard operation. Results demonstrate that the baseline
MILP underestimates total costs due to its inability to detect current and
voltage violations, resulting in a 37% increase for one case study when tested
with the DES-OPF framework. Major implications on battery capacity are also
observed, primarily to manage higher levels of renewable energy curtailment,
which emphasise the need to use DES-OPF frameworks when designing

contextual factors, such as user emotional state, location and activity at

of great importance to take them into account when recommending music. However,
it is very difficult to develop context-aware recommender systems that consider
these factors, both because of the difficulty of detecting some of them, such
as emotional state, and because of the drawbacks derived from the inclusion of
many factors, such as sparsity problems in contextual pre-filtering. This work
involves the proposal of a method for the detection of the user contextual
state when listening to music based on the social tags of music items. The
intrinsic characteristics of social tagging that allow for the description of
items in multiple dimensions can be exploited to capture many contextual
dimensions in the user listening sessions. The embeddings of the tags of the
first items played in each session are used to represent the context of that
session. Recommendations are then generated based on both user preferences and
the similarity of the items computed from tag embeddings. Social tags have been
used extensively in many recommender systems, however, to our knowledge, they
have been hardly used to dynamically infer contextual states.

depend on solar wind type and distance from the Sun. Conclusions. Although
suggesting a likely small contribution, but which remains to be quantitatively

We used Gaussian processes to account for systematic noise in the transit light

survival or extinction of sinking phytoplankton species. However, dealing with
its multiscale nature in models of coupled fluid and biological dynamics is a
formidable challenge. Advection by coherent structures, as those related to
winter convection and Langmuir circulation, is also recognized to play a role
in the survival and localization of phytoplankton. In this work we revisit a
theoretically appealing model for phytoplankton vertical dynamics, and
numerically investigate how large-scale fluid motions affect the survival
conditions and the spatial distribution of the biological population. For this
purpose, and to work with realistic parameter values, we adopt a kinematic flow
field to account for the different spatial and temporal scales of turbulent
motions. The dynamics of the population density are described by an
advection-reaction-diffusion model with a spatially heterogeneous growth term
proportional to sunlight availability. We explore the role of fluid transport
by progressively increasing the complexity of the flow in terms of spatial and
temporal scales. We find that, due to the large-scale circulation,
phytoplankton accumulates in downwelling regions and its growth is reduced,
confirming previous indications in slightly different conditions. We then
explain the observed phenomenology in terms of a plankton filament model.
Moreover, by contrasting the results in our different flow cases, we show that
the large-scale coherent structures have an overwhelming importance. Indeed, we
find that smaller-scale motions only quite weakly affect the dynamics, without
altering the general mechanism identified. Such results are relevant for
parameterizations in numerical models of phytoplankton life cycles in realistic
oceanic flow conditions.

hypergraph allows us to account for its community structure and for more
general interactions between different subsets of nodes.)
  We consider two natural generalizations to hypergraphs of zero forcing on
graphs (one of them already known) and, for each one of these generalizations
we look into two clutters that play a significant role in the forcing process:
the clutter of minimal forcing sets and the one of minimal immune sets. A
formulation of immune sets in terms of neighbourhoods (hence without making
reference to the iterative zero forcing process) is presented, highlighting the
different behaviour of the distinct forcing rules. Moreover, we obtain the
families of minimal forcing and minimal immune sets in the case of complete
hypergraphs and we provide a full characterization of forcing and immune

there is no consensus regarding the mechanism at the origin of these outflows,
nor on the cause of the less-frequently observed monopolar outflows. We aim to
identify the origin of early massive protostellar outflows, focusing on the
combined effects of radiative transfer and magnetic fields in a turbulent
medium. We use four state-of-the-art radiation-magnetohydrodynamical
simulations following the collapse of massive 100 Msun pre-stellar cores with
the Ramses code. Turbulence is taken into account via initial velocity
dispersion. We use a hybrid radiative transfer method and include ambipolar
diffusion. We find that turbulence delays the launching of outflows, which
appear to be mainly driven by magnetohydrodynamical processes. Magnetic tower
flow and the magneto-centrifugal acceleration contribute to the acceleration
and the former operates on larger volumes than the latter. Our finest
resolution, 5 AU, does not allow us to get converged results on
magneto-centrifugally accelerated outflows. Radiative acceleration takes place
as well, dominates in the star vicinity, enlarges the outflow extent, and has
no negative impact on the launching of magnetic outflows (up to M~17 Msun,
L~1e5 Lsun). The associated opening angles (20-30 deg when magnetic fields
dominate) suggest additional (de-)collimating effects to meet observational
constraints. Outflows are launched nearly perpendicular to the disk and are
misaligned with the initial core-scale magnetic fields, in agreement with
several observational studies. In the most turbulent run, the outflow is
monopolar. We conclude that magnetic processes dominate the acceleration of
massive protostellar outflows up to ~17 Msun, against radiative processes.
Turbulence perturbs the outflow launching and is a possible explanation for
monopolar outflows.

present in deep-ocean samples, Antarctic snow, lunar regolith, and cosmic rays.
$^{60}$Fe represents supernova (SN) ejecta deposited in the Solar System around
$3 \, \rm Myr$ ago, and recently an earlier pulse $\approx 7 \ \rm Myr $ ago
has been found. These data point to one or multiple near-Earth SN explosions
that presumably participated in the formation of the Local Bubble. We explore
this theory using 3D high-resolution smooth-particle hydrodynamical simulations
of isolated supernovae with ejecta tracers in a uniform interstellar medium
(ISM). The simulation allows us to trace the supernova ejecta in gas form and
those eject in dust grains that are entrained with the gas. We consider two
cases of diffused ejecta: when the ejecta are well-mixed in the shock and when
they are not. In the latter case, we find that these ejecta remain far behind
the forward shock, limiting the distance to which entrained ejecta can be
delivered to $\approx 100$ pc in an ISM with $n_\mathrm{H}=0.1\; \rm cm^{-3}$
mean hydrogen density. We show that the intensity and the duration of $^{60}$Fe
accretion depend on the ISM density and the trajectory of the Solar System.
Furthermore, we show the possibility of reproducing the two observed peaks in
$^{60}$Fe concentration with this model by assuming two linear trajectories for
the Solar System with $30$-km s$^{-1}$ velocity. The fact that we can reproduce
the two observed peaks further supports the theory that the $^{60}$Fe signal
was originated from near-Earth SNe.

recognition task. Varieties of information, consisting of character appearance,
behaviors, facial emotions, dialogues, background music as well as subtitles
contribute differently to the final results, which makes the task more
challenging but meaningful in developing more advanced multi-modal models. To
facilitate the task, we develop a new dataset called Emotional RelAtionship of
inTeractiOn (ERATO) based on dramas and movies. ERATO is a large-scale
multi-modal dataset for PERR task, which has 31,182 video clips, lasting about
203 video hours. Different from the existing datasets, ERATO contains
interaction-centric videos with multi-shots, varied video length, and multiple

propose a baseline model composed of Synchronous Modal-Temporal Attention

further improve the research of multi-modal fusion methodology.

genetic material can be represented by leaf-labelled, directed graphs called
phylogenetic networks. A major challenge in the burgeoning area of phylogenetic
networks is to develop algorithms for building such networks by amalgamating
small networks into a single large network. The level of a phylogenetic network
is a measure of its deviation from being a tree; the higher the level of
network, the less treelike it becomes. Various algorithms have been developed
for building level-1 networks from small networks. However, level-1 networks
may not be able to capture the complexity of some data sets. In this paper, we
present a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a rooted binary level-2
phylogenetic network from a collection of 3-leaf networks or trinets. Moreover,
we prove that the algorithm will correctly reconstruct such a network if it is
given all of the trinets in the network as input. The algorithm runs in time
$O(t\cdot n+n^4)$ with $t$ the number of input trinets and $n$ the number of

injecting faults during the training phase of a neural network in a way that

solving a system of linear equations that would cause a particular behaviour on
the attacked activation functions, similar to the one induced in training
through faulting. We call such attacks fooling backdoors as the fault attacks
at the training phase inject backdoors into the network that allow an attacker
to produce fooling inputs. We evaluate our approach against multi-layer

high classification confidence when as little as 25 neurons are attacked while

this is because agents, even in cooperative games, could have conflicting
directions of policy updates. As a result, achieving a guaranteed improvement
on the joint policy where each agent acts individually remains an open
challenge. In this paper, we extend the theory of trust region learning to
MARL. Central to our findings are the multi-agent advantage decomposition lemma
and the sequential policy update scheme. Based on these, we develop
Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation (HATPRO) and
Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimisation (HAPPO) algorithms. Unlike
many existing MARL algorithms, HATRPO/HAPPO do not need agents to share

perspective, the solution represents the velocity of a homogeneous
incompressible fluid, flowing in steady parallel streamlines through a hollow
cylindrical pipe and obeying a no-slip condition. In contrast with Serrin's
classical result, we show that the simplest possible set of overdetermining
conditions, namely the prescription of locally constant Neumann boundary data,
is not sufficient to obtain a complete characterisation of the solutions. A
further requirement on the number of maximum points arises in our analysis as a
necessary and sufficient condition for the rotational symmetry. In
fluid-dynamical terms, our results imply that if the wall shear stress is
constant on some connected component of the pipe's wall, then the velocity of
the fluid must attain its maximal value only at finitely many streamlines,
unless the hollow pipe itself consists of a couple of concentric cylindrical
round tubes. A major difficulty in the analysis of this problem comes from the
lack of monotonicity of the model solutions, which makes the moving plane
method ineffective. To remedy this issue, we introduce some new arguments in

$\lambda_G(t, T\setminus \{t\})$ is the size of a smallest cut that separates

which makes it very challenging to keep the overall CPS safe. By sandboxing
these controllers, we are not only able to use them but also to enforce safety
properties over the controlled physical systems at the same time. However,
current available solutions for sandboxing controllers are just applicable to
deterministic (a.k.a. non-stochastic) systems, possibly affected by bounded

sandboxing unverified complex controllers for CPS operating in noisy

guarantees on their safety. Here, the unverified control input is observed at
each time instant and checked whether it violates the maximal tolerable
probability of reaching the unsafe set. If this probability exceeds a given
threshold, the unverified control input will be rejected, and the advisory
input provided by the optimal safety controller will be used to maintain the
probabilistic safety guarantee. The proposed approach is illustrated
empirically and the results indicate that the expected safety probability is

untrimmed video given a language query. Existing methods often address this
task in an indirect way, by casting it as a proposal-and-match or
fusion-and-detection problem. Solving these surrogate problems often requires
sophisticated label assignment during training and hand-crafted removal of
near-duplicate results. Meanwhile, existing works typically focus on sparse
video grounding with a single sentence as input, which could result in
ambiguous localization due to its unclear description. In this paper, we tackle
a new problem of dense video grounding, by simultaneously localizing multiple
moments with a paragraph as input. From a perspective on video grounding as
language conditioned regression, we present an end-to-end parallel decoding
paradigm by re-purposing a Transformer-alike architecture (PRVG). The key
design in our PRVG is to use languages as queries, and directly regress the
moment boundaries based on language-modulated visual representations. Thanks to
its simplicity in design, our PRVG framework can be applied in different
testing schemes (sparse or dense grounding) and allows for efficient inference
without any post-processing technique. In addition, we devise a robust
proposal-level attention loss to guide the training of PRVG, which is invariant
to moment duration and contributes to model convergence. We perform experiments
on two video grounding benchmarks of ActivityNet Captions and TACoS,
demonstrating that our PRVG can significantly outperform previous methods. We
also perform in-depth studies to investigate the effectiveness of parallel
regression paradigm on video grounding.

of decentralized finance (DeFi) may enable attractive online trading automation
options. In this paper we present ChainBot, an approach for creating
algorithmic trading bots with the help of blockchain technology. We show how to
partition the computation into on- and off-chain components in a way that
provides a measure of end-to-end integrity, while preserving the algorithmic
""secret sauce"". Our system is enabled with a careful use of algorithm
partitioning, zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts. We also show that with
layer-2 (L2) technologies, trades can be kept private, which means that
algorithmic parameters are difficult to recover by a chain observer. Our
approach offers more transparent access to liquidity and better
censorship-resistance compared to traditional off-chain trading approaches. We
develop a sample ChainBot and train it on historical data, resulting in returns
that are up to 2.4x the buy-and-hold strategy, which we use as our baseline.
Our measurements show that across 1000 runs, the end-to-end average execution
time for our system is 48.4 seconds. We demonstrate that the frequency of
trading does not significantly affect the rate of return and Sharpe ratio,
which indicates that we do not have to trade at every block, thereby
significantly saving in terms of gas fees. In our implementation, a user who

  The above result is achieved in two steps. We first introduce the singular
Yoneda dg category of $\Lambda$, which is quasi-equivalent to the dg
singularity category of $\Lambda$. The construction of this new dg category
follows from a general operation for dg categories, namely an explicit dg
localization inverting a natural transformation from the identity functor to a

learning in a semi-supervised manner. In particular, both labeled and unlabeled
demonstrations are leveraged during training by estimating the quality of each
unlabeled demonstration. If the provided demonstrations are corrupted and have
a low signal-to-noise ratio, the performance of the imitation learning agent
can be degraded significantly. To mitigate this problem, we propose a method
called semi-supervised imitation learning (SSIL). SSIL first learns how to
discriminate and evaluate each state-action pair's reliability in unlabeled
demonstrations by assigning higher reliability values to demonstrations similar
to labeled expert demonstrations. This reliability value is called leverage.
After this discrimination process, both labeled and unlabeled demonstrations
with estimated leverage values are utilized while training the policy in a
semi-supervised manner. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of
the proposed algorithm using unlabeled trajectories with mixed qualities.
Moreover, the hardware experiments using an RC car are conducted to show that
the proposed method can be applied to real-world applications.

the computational cost for fitting all models when ridge regression is used is
no more than for a single fit of ridge regression, and describe a strategy for

  Labels",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers binary and multilabel classification problems in a
setting where labels are missing independently and with a known rate. Missing
labels are a ubiquitous phenomenon in extreme multi-label classification (XMC)
tasks, such as matching Wikipedia articles to a small subset out of the
hundreds of thousands of possible tags, where no human annotator can possibly
check the validity of all the negative samples. For this reason,
propensity-scored precision -- an unbiased estimate for precision-at-k under a
known noise model -- has become one of the standard metrics in XMC. Few methods
take this problem into account already during the training phase, and all are
limited to loss functions that can be decomposed into a sum of contributions
from each individual label. A typical approach to training is to reduce the
multilabel problem into a series of binary or multiclass problems, and it has
been shown that if the surrogate task should be consistent for optimizing
recall, the resulting loss function is not decomposable over labels. Therefore,
this paper derives the unique unbiased estimators for the different multilabel
reductions, including the non-decomposable ones. These estimators suffer from
increased variance and may lead to ill-posed optimization problems, which we
address by switching to convex upper-bounds. The theoretical considerations are
further supplemented by an experimental study showing that the switch to
unbiased estimators significantly alters the bias-variance trade-off and may
thus require stronger regularization, which in some cases can negate the
benefits of unbiased estimation.

prove functional limit theorems for the triplet of a random walk, coupled with
its positive and negative reinforced versions when $p<1/2$ and when the typical

(i.e., labeling) as the acquisition of annotations is often time-consuming and
therefore expensive. For this purpose, an AL strategy queries annotations
intelligently from annotators to train a high-performance classification model
at a low annotation cost. Traditional AL strategies operate in an idealized
framework. They assume a single, omniscient annotator who never gets tired and
charges uniformly regardless of query difficulty. However, in real-world
applications, we often face human annotators, e.g., crowd or in-house workers,
who make annotation mistakes and can be reluctant to respond if tired or faced
with complex queries. Recently, a wide range of novel AL strategies has been
proposed to address these issues. They differ in at least one of the following
three central aspects from traditional AL: (1) They explicitly consider
(multiple) human annotators whose performances can be affected by various
factors, such as missing expertise. (2) They generalize the interaction with
human annotators by considering different query and annotation types, such as
asking an annotator for feedback on an inferred classification rule. (3) They
take more complex cost schemes regarding annotations and misclassifications
into account. This survey provides an overview of these AL strategies and
refers to them as real-world AL. Therefore, we introduce a general real-world
AL strategy as part of a learning cycle and use its elements, e.g., the query
and annotator selection algorithm, to categorize about 60 real-world AL
strategies. Finally, we outline possible directions for future research in the
field of AL.

overcome these challenges, we introduce a non-equilibrium first-principles
calculation method based on the recently developed multi-space
constrained-search density functional formalism and apply it to
graphene/few-layer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene field-effect
transistors. Our explicit finite-voltage first-principles calculations show
that the previously reported negative differential resistance (NDR)
current-bias voltage characteristics can be produced not only from the
gating-induced mismatch between two graphene Dirac cones but from the
bias-dependent energetic shift of defect levels. Specifically, for a carbon
atom substituted for a nitrogen atom (C$_N$) within inner hBN layers, the
increase of bias voltage is found to induce a self-consistent electron filling
of in-gap C$_N$ states, which leads to changes in voltage drop profiles and
symmetric NDR characteristics. On the other hand, with a C$_N$ placed on outer
interfacial hBN layers, we find that due to the pinning of C$_N$ levels to
nearby graphene states voltage drop profiles become bias-independent and NDR
peaks disappear. Revealing hitherto undiscussed non-equilibrium behaviors of
atomic defect states and their critical impact on device characteristics, our
work points towards future directions for the computational design of 2D vdW

RF bandwidth of <10%) within a Field of View (FoV) of 20 cm in diameter and 4.5

numerical simulations. The encoding capability of the designed PMA was examined

field outperforms a linear pattern for encoding. The PMA is 57.91 cm wide, 38
cm long, has a 5-gauss range of 87x87x104 cm^3, allowing an operation in a
small space. It weights 126.08kg, comprising of a stationary main array that
supplies a strong homogeneous field, and a light rotatable sub-gradient-array

time-asymptotically converge to the nonlinear diffusion wave whose profile is
self-similar solution to the corresponding parabolic equation, which is derived
by Darcy's law, as in [11, 28]. For the initial-boundary value problem, we
consider two cases: Dirichlet boundary condition and null Neumann boundary
condition on (u, \rho). In the case of Dirichlet boundary condition, similar to
the Cauchy problem, the asymptotic profile is still the self-similar solution
of the corresponding parabolic equation, which is derived by Darcy's law, thus
we only need to deal with boundary effect. In the case of null-Neumann boundary
condition, the global existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions near

Moreover, such learning from only few annotated training samples further adds
the flexibility for the object detector, which is highly expected in many

sequential learning scenario with few-shot training samples generally causes
catastrophic forgetting and dramatic overfitting. In this paper, to address the
above incremental few-shot learning issues, a novel Incremental Few-Shot Object
Detection (iFSOD) method is proposed to enable the effective continual learning
from few-shot samples. Specifically, a Double-Branch Framework (DBF) is
proposed to decouple the feature representation of base and novel (few-shot)
class, which facilitates both the old-knowledge retention and new-class
adaption simultaneously. Furthermore, a progressive model updating rule is
carried out to preserve the long-term memory on old classes effectively when
adapt to sequential new classes. Moreover, an inter-task class separation loss
is proposed to extend the decision region of new-coming classes for better
feature discrimination. We conduct experiments on both Pascal VOC and MS-COCO,

superiority in learning node representations. These models rely on message

significantly decreases the performance of GNNs. Most recent studies attribute
this limitation to the over-smoothing issue, where node embeddings converge to
indistinguishable vectors. Through a number of experimental observations, we
argue that the main factor degrading the performance is the unstable forward
normalization and backward gradient resulted from the improper design of the
feature transformation, especially for shallow GNNs where the over-smoothing
has not happened. Therefore, we propose a novel orthogonal feature
transformation, named Ortho-GConv, which could generally augment the existing
GNN backbones to stabilize the model training and improve the model's

feature transformation comprehensively from three perspectives, namely hybrid
weight initialization, orthogonal transformation, and orthogonal
regularization. By equipping the existing GNNs (e.g. GCN, JKNet, GCNII) with
Ortho-GConv, we demonstrate the generality of the orthogonal feature

information about suspicious files. These remote services use their up-to-date
information and global context (view) to help classify the files and instruct
their agents to take a predetermined action (e.g., delete or quarantine). In
this study, we provide a security analysis of a specific form of communication
between anti-malware agents and their services, which takes place entirely over
the insecure DNS protocol. These services, which we denote DNS anti-malware
list (DNSAML) services, affect the classification of files scanned by
anti-malware agents, therefore potentially putting their consumers at risk due
to known integrity and confidentiality flaws of the DNS protocol. By analyzing
a large-scale DNS traffic dataset made available to the authors by a well-known
CDN provider, we identify anti-malware solutions that seem to make use of
DNSAML services. We found that these solutions, deployed on almost three
million machines worldwide, exchange hundreds of millions of DNS requests
daily. These requests are carrying sensitive file scan information, oftentimes
- as we demonstrate - without any additional safeguards to compensate for the
insecurities of the DNS protocol. As a result, these anti-malware solutions
that use DNSAML are made vulnerable to DNS attacks. For instance, an attacker
capable of tampering with DNS queries, gains the ability to alter the
classification of scanned files, without presence on the scanning machine. We
showcase three attacks applicable to at least three anti-malware solutions that
could result in the disclosure of sensitive information and improper behavior
of the anti-malware agent, such as ignoring detected threats. Finally, we
propose and review a set of countermeasures for anti-malware solution providers
to prevent the attacks stemming from the use of DNSAML services.

dynamical simulations. The commensurability ratio, i.e., the ratio of the
number of particles to the number of potential well minima, is set to 1 or 2.
The resulting phonon spectra show that propagation of waves is always
suppressed due to the confinement of particles by the applied 2D periodic
substrates. For a commensurability ratio of 1, the spectra indicate that all
particles mainly oscillate at one specific frequency, corresponding to the
harmonic oscillation frequency of one single particle inside one potential
well. At a commensurability ratio of 2, the substrate allows two particles to
sit inside the bottom of each potential well, and the resulting longitudinal
and transverse spectra exhibit four branches in total. We find that the two
moderate branches come from the harmonic oscillations of one single particle
and two combined particles in the potential well. The other two branches
correspond to the relative motion of the two-body structure in each potential
well in the radial and azimuthal directions. The difference in the spectra
between the square and triangular substrates is attributed to the anisotropy of
the substrates and the resulting alignment directions of the two-body structure
in each potential well.

cascade processes of three modes by particle-turbulence interactions,
regardless of whether the shock wave appears; (2) not only can the power
spectra of maximum acceleration rates reveal the inertial range of compressible

the modes; (3) fast mode dominates the acceleration of particles, especially in
the case of super-Alfv\'enic and supersonic turbulence, slow mode dominates the
acceleration for sub-Alfv\'enic turbulence in the very high energy range, and
the acceleration of Alfv\'en mode is significant at the early stage of the
acceleration; (4) particle acceleration from three modes results in a power-law

of time in the phase where spikes have arrived at a compute node and need to be
delivered to their target neurons. These spikes were emitted over the last
interval between communication steps by source neurons distributed across many
compute nodes and are inherently irregular with respect to their targets. For
finding the targets, the spikes need to be dispatched to a three-dimensional
data structure with decisions on target thread and synapse type to be made on
the way. With growing network size a compute node receives spikes from an
increasing number of different source neurons until in the limit each synapse
on the compute node has a unique source. Here we show analytically how this
sparsity emerges over the practically relevant range of network sizes from a
hundred thousand to a billion neurons. By profiling a production code we
investigate opportunities for algorithmic changes to avoid indirections and
branching. Every thread hosts an equal share of the neurons on a compute node.
In the original algorithm all threads search through all spikes to pick out the
relevant ones. With increasing network size the fraction of hits remains
invariant but the absolute number of rejections grows. An alternative algorithm
equally divides the spikes among the threads and sorts them in parallel
according to target thread and synapse type. After this every thread completes
delivery solely of the section of spikes for its own neurons. The new algorithm
halves the number of instructions in spike delivery which leads to a reduction
of simulation time of up to 40 %. Thus, spike delivery is a fully
parallelizable process with a single synchronization point and thereby well
suited for many-core systems. Our analysis indicates that further progress
requires a reduction of the latency instructions experience in accessing

velocimetry measurements to measure the flow in a column generated by a
homogeneous bubble swarm rising in water, for two different bubble diameters
($2.7$ mm $\&$ $3.9$ mm) and moderate gas volume fractions
($0.26\%\sim1.31\%$). The two velocity components were measured at
high-resolution, and used to construct structure functions up to twelfth order
for separations spanning the small to large scales in the flow. Concerning the
flow anisotropy, the velocity structure functions are found to differ for
separations in the vertical and horizontal directions of the flow, and the
cases with smaller bubbles are the most anisotropic, with a dependence on void
fraction. The degree of anisotropy is shown to increase as the order of the
structure functions is increased, showing that extreme events in the flow are
the most anisotropic. Our results show that the average energy transfer with
the horizontal velocity component is downscale, just as for the
three-dimensional single-phase turbulence. However, the energy transfer
associated with the vertical component of the fluid velocity is upscale. The
probability density functions of the velocity increments reveal that extreme
values become more probable with decreasing Reynolds number, the opposite of
the behaviour in single-phase turbulence. We visualize those extreme events and
find that regions of intense small scale velocity increments occur near the

the transit photometric data obtained by TESS are free from any noise component

emitting periodic gravitational waves (GWs), while the latter with a short

synthesized the magnetic topological insulator (TI)/TI penta-layer
heterostructures with different Cr doping concentrations in the middle magnetic

monotonically decreases from h/e2 to h/2e2, concurrently, the longitudinal
resistance exhibits a maximum at the critical point. Our results show that the

channel from the C = 1 QAH state coexists with the dissipative bulk conduction
channels. Subsequently, these bulk conduction channels appear to self-organize

by accretion of pebble-size particles whose accretional cross-section is
enhanced by aerodynamic gas drag [1][2]. A commonly held view is that the
terrestrial planet system formed later (30-200 Myr after the dispersal of the
gas disk) by giant collisions of tens of roughly Mars-size protoplanets [3].
Here we propose, instead, that the terrestrial planets formed earlier by
gas-driven convergent migration of protoplanets toward $\sim\!1\,{\rm au}$
(related ref. [4] invoked a different process to concentrate planetesimals). To
investigate situations in which convergent migration occurs, we developed a
radiation-hydrodynamic model with realistic opacities [5][6] to determine the
thermal structure of the gas and pebble disks in the terrestrial planet zone.
We find that protoplanets rapidly grow by mutual collisions and pebble
accretion, and gain orbital eccentricities by gravitational scattering and the
hot-trail effect [7][8]. The orbital structure of the terrestrial planet system
is well reproduced in our simulations, including its tight mass concentration
at 0.7-1 au and the small sizes of Mercury and Mars. The early-stage protosolar
disk temperature exceeds 1500 K inside 0.4 au implying that Mercury grew in a
highly reducing environment, next to the evaporation lines of iron and
silicates, influencing Mercury's bulk composition [9]. In a late-stage cold gas

""smart environments"" (e.g., smart cities and smart factories) will be,
generators of huge amounts of data. Currently, analysis of this data is
typically achieved through centralised cloud-based services. However, according
to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from the
standpoint of data ownership, as well as wireless network capacity. In this
paper, we exploit the fog computing paradigm to move computation close to where
data is produced. We exploit a well-known distributed machine learning
framework (Hypothesis Transfer Learning), and perform data analytics on mobile
nodes passing by IoT devices, in addition to fog gateways at the edge of the
network infrastructure. We analyse the performance of different configurations
of the distributed learning framework, in terms of (i) accuracy obtained in the
learning task and (ii) energy spent to send data between the involved nodes.
Specifically, we consider reference wireless technologies for communication
between the different types of nodes we consider, e.g. LTE, Nb-IoT, 802.15.4,
802.11, etc. Our results show that collecting data through the mobile nodes and
executing the distributed analytics using short-range communication
technologies, such as 802.15.4 and 802.11, allows to strongly reduce the energy
consumption of the system up to $94\%$ with a loss in accuracy w.r.t. a
centralised cloud solution up to $2\%$.

exists a surjective radial parts map $\mathrm{rad}$ from $ \mathcal{D}(V)^G$ to
the spherical subalgebra $A_{\kappa}$ of a Cherednik algebra. When $A_{\kappa}$
is simple we show that $\mathcal{G}$ has no $\delta$-torsion submodule nor
factor module and we determine when $\mathcal{G}$ is semisimple, thereby
answering questions of Sekiguchi, respectively Levasseur-Stafford. In the
diagonal case when $V=\mathfrak{g}$, these results reduce to fundamental
theorems of Harish-Chandra and Hotta-Kashiwara.
  We generalise these results to polar representations $V$ satisfying natural
conditions.
  By twisting the radial parts map, we obtain families of invariant holonomic
systems. We introduce shift functors between the different twists. We show that
the image of the simple summands of $\mathcal{G} $ under these functors is
described by Opdam's KZ-twist.

different named entities such as the city ""Washington D.C."" or the newspaper
""Washington Post."" The goal of named entity disambiguation is to identify the
mentioned named entity correctly among all possible candidates. If the type
(e.g. location or person) of a mentioned entity can be correctly predicted from
the context, it may increase the chance of selecting the right candidate by
assigning low probability to the unlikely ones. This paper proposes
cluster-based mention typing for named entity disambiguation. The aim of
mention typing is to predict the type of a given mention based on its context.
Generally, manually curated type taxonomies such as Wikipedia categories are
used. We introduce cluster-based mention typing, where named entities are
clustered based on their contextual similarities and the cluster ids are
assigned as types. The hyperlinked mentions and their context in Wikipedia are
used in order to obtain these cluster-based types. Then, mention typing models
are trained on these mentions, which have been labeled with their cluster-based
types through distant supervision. At the named entity disambiguation phase,
first the cluster-based types of a given mention are predicted and then, these
types are used as features in a ranking model to select the best entity among
the candidates. We represent entities at multiple contextual levels and obtain
different clusterings (and thus typing models) based on each level. As each
clustering breaks the entity space differently, mention typing based on each
clustering discriminates the mention differently. When predictions from all
typing models are used together, our system achieves better or comparable
results based on randomization tests with respect to the state-of-the-art
levels on four defacto test sets.

of efficient calibration techniques remains a major challenge. This paper
considers a class of high-dimensional calibration problems known as

recent metamodel methods that tackle the simulation-based problem by solving a
sequence of approximate analytical optimization problems, which rely on the use
of analytical network models. In this paper, we formulate a network model
defined as a system of linear equations, the dimension of which scales linearly
with the number of roads with field data and independently of the dimension of
the route choice set. This makes the approach suitable for large-scale
metropolitan networks. The approach has enhanced efficiency compared with past
metamodel formulations that are based on systems of nonlinear, rather than
linear, equations. It also has enhanced efficiency compared to traditional
calibration methods that resort to simulation-based estimates of traffic
assignment matrices, while the proposed approach uses analytical approximations
of these matrices. We benchmark the approach considering a peak period Salt

a real number $0<\tau $, as well as $m+1$ fixed real numbers $\delta _0,\ldots

the following quantities:
  $\kappa :=\min _{i\not= j}|\delta _i-\delta _j|$;
  $A(x):=\nabla ^2f(x)+\delta ||\nabla f(x)||^{\tau}Id$, where $\delta$ is the
first element in the sequence $\{\delta _0,\ldots ,\delta _m\}$ for which
$minsp(A(x))\geq \kappa ||\nabla f(x)||^{\tau}$;
  $e_1(x),\ldots ,e_m(x)$ are an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^m$, chosen
appropriately;
  $w(x)=$ the step direction, given by the formula: $$w(x)=\sum
_{i=1}^m\frac{<\nabla f(x),e_i(x)>}{||A(x)e_i(x)||}e_i(x);$$ (we can also

  The update rule for our algorithm is $x\mapsto H(x)=x-\gamma (x)w(x)$.
  In New Q-Newton's method Backtracking, the choices are $\tau =1+\alpha >1$
and $e_1(x),\ldots ,e_m(x)$'s are eigenvectors of $\nabla ^2f(x)$. In this
paper, we allow more flexibility and generality, for example $\tau$ can be
chosen to be $<1$ or $e_1(x),\ldots ,e_m(x)$'s are not necessarily eigenvectors
of $\nabla ^2f(x)$.
  New Q-Newton's method Backtracking (as well as Backtracking gradient descent)
is a special case, and some versions have flavours of quasi-Newton's methods.
Several versions allow good theoretical guarantees. An application to solving
systems of polynomial equations is given.

  Data Programming","Findings of ACL, 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A critical bottleneck in supervised machine learning is the need for large
amounts of labeled data which is expensive and time consuming to obtain.
However, it has been shown that a small amount of labeled data, while
insufficient to re-train a model, can be effectively used to generate
human-interpretable labeling functions (LFs). These LFs, in turn, have been
used to generate a large amount of additional noisy labeled data, in a paradigm
that is now commonly referred to as data programming. However, previous
approaches to automatically generate LFs make no attempt to further use the
given labeled data for model training, thus giving up opportunities for
improved performance. Moreover, since the LFs are generated from a relatively
small labeled dataset, they are prone to being noisy, and naively aggregating
these LFs can lead to very poor performance in practice. In this work, we
propose an LF based reweighting framework \ouralgo{} to solve these two
critical limitations. Our algorithm learns a joint model on the (same) labeled
dataset used for LF induction along with any unlabeled data in a
semi-supervised manner, and more critically, reweighs each LF according to its
goodness, influencing its contribution to the semi-supervised loss using a
robust bi-level optimization algorithm. We show that our algorithm
significantly outperforms prior approaches on several text classification

generated naturally through the analysis of the box diagram. However, this
anomalous model is not a viable extension of QED, and we explicitly show that
the induced CP-violating term in the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian is
obtained only by adding an axial coupling to the ordinary QED Lagrangian. In
order to perform our analysis, we use a parametrization of the vector and axial
coupling constants, $g_{v}$ and $g_{a}$, in terms of a new coupling $\beta$.
Interestingly, this parametrization allows us to explore a hidden symmetry
under the change of $g_{v}\leftrightarrow g_{a}$ in some diagrams. This
symmetry is explicitly observed in the analysis of the box diagram, where we
determine the $\lambda_i$ coefficients of $\cal{L}_{\rm ext.}^{\rm \small

evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability in a fan-spine magnetic field
configuration. This magnetic topology exists near an active region AR12297 and
is rooted in a nearby sunspot. In this magnetic configuration, two layers of
cool plasma flow in parallel and interact with each other inside an elongated
spine. The slower plasma flow (5 $km s^{-1}$) is the reflected stream along the
spine field lines from the top, which interacts with the impulsive plasma
upflows (114-144 km s$^{-1}$) from below. This process generates a shear motion
and subsequent evolution of the K--H instability. The amplitude and
characteristic wavelength of the K-H unstable vortices increase, satisfying the
criterion of the fastest growing mode of this instability. We also describe
that the velocity difference between two layers and velocity of K-H unstable
vortices are greater than the Alfven speed in the second denser layer, which
also satisfies the criterion of the growth of K-H instability. In the presence
of the magnetic field and sheared counter streaming plasma as observed in the
fan-spine topology, we estimate the parametric constant, $\Lambda\ge$1, that
confirms the dominance of velocity shear and the evolution of the linear phase
of the K-H instability. This observation indicates that in the presence of
complex magnetic field structuring and flows, the fan-spine configuration may
evolve into rapid heating, while the connectivity changes due to the
fragmentation via the K-H instability.

cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and
post-processing of model errors, i.e. the scoring functions independently of
each other, through a grid of 10 models and 4 scoring functions, comparing
these variants to state of the art methods. In time-series anomaly detection,
detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual
anomalous time-points. Through experiments, we find that the existing
evaluation metrics either do not take events into account, or cannot
distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or
an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks,
namely, the composite F-score ($Fc_1$), for evaluating time-series anomaly
detection.
  Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than
static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of
scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model.
We also find that a simple, channel-wise model - the Univariate Fully-Connected

difficulties involved in its preparation and preservation, is of considerable
importance for ensuring efficient applications in quantum technology. Here we
demonstrate quantitatively the resource theoretic advantage of reusing a single
copy of a two-qubit entangled state towards information processing. To this
end, we consider a scenario of sequential entanglement detection of a given
two-qubit state by multiple independent observers on each of the two spatially
separated wings. In particular, we consider equal numbers of sequential
observers on the two wings. We first determine the upper bound on the number of
observers who can detect entanglement employing suitable entanglement witness
operators. In terms of the parameters characterizing the entanglement consumed
and the robustness of measurements, we then compare the above scenario with the
corresponding scenario involving multiple pairs of entangled qubits shared
among the two wings. This reveals a clear resource theoretic advantage of
recycling a single copy of a two-qubit entangled state in the sequential
network.

contributed to making agile a transformation in the software industry in which
many companies want to take part. However, driven either by a natural and
expected evolution or by contextual factors that challenge the adoption of
agile methods as prescribed by their creator(s), software processes in practice
mutate into hybrids over time. Are these still agile? In this article, we
investigate the question: what makes a software development method agile? We
present an empirical study grounded in a large-scale international survey that
aims to identify software development methods and practices that improve or
tame agility. Based on 556 data points, we analyze the perceived degree of
agility in the implementation of standard project disciplines and its relation
to used development methods and practices. Our findings suggest that only a
small number of participants operate their projects in a purely traditional or
agile manner (under 15%). That said, most project disciplines and most
practices show a clear trend towards increasing degrees of agility. Compared to
the methods used to develop software, the selection of practices has a stronger
effect on the degree of agility of a given discipline. Finally, there are no
methods or practices that explicitly guarantee or prevent agility. We conclude
that agility cannot be defined solely at the process level. Additional factors
need to be taken into account when trying to implement or improve agility in a
software company. Finally, we discuss the field of software process-related
research in the light of our findings and present a roadmap for future
research.

gravitational waves from the binary neutron star mergers in the current and the
future generation detectors, as it does not depend on either the arm length, or
the injected squeezing level. In this paper, we come up with the sloshing
Sagnac interferometer topology, which can be obtained from the Michelson
interferometer by optically connecting the end mirrors into an additional
optical cavity. This transforms the interferometer into a triply-coupled cavity
system capable of beating the loss-induced high-frequency limit of the
signal-recycled Michelson interferometer. With advanced LIGO+ comparable
parameters, a sloshing-Sagnac scheme can achieve 7 times better sensitivity at
2.5\,kHz or 4 times better signal to noise ratio for a typical waveform of

atomic-scale simulations have triggered efforts to better understand the
mathematical properties of the mapping between the Cartesian coordinates of the
atoms and the variety of representations that can be used to convert them into
a finite set of symmetric descriptors or features. Here, we analyze the
sensitivity of the mapping to atomic displacements, showing that the
combination of symmetry and smoothness leads to mappings that have singular
points at which the Jacobian has one or more null singular values (besides
those corresponding to infinitesimal translations and rotations). This is in
fact desirable, because it enforces physical symmetry constraints on the values
predicted by regression models constructed using such representations. However,
besides these symmetry-induced singularities, there are also spurious singular
points, that we find to be linked to the incompleteness of the mapping, i.e.
the fact that, for certain classes of representations, structurally distinct
configurations are not guaranteed to be mapped onto different feature vectors.
Additional singularities can be introduced by a too aggressive truncation of
the infinite basis set that is used to discretize the representations.

are lack of characteristic experimental signature. Thus, an experimental probe
to identify the characters of these featureless CI and DW states are urgently
needed. In this work, we theoretically study the correlated insulators and
density-wave states at different integer and fractional fillings of the flat

calculations including the Coulomb screening effects from the remote bands. We
further investigate the nonlinear optical response of the various correlated

constraints and semantic priors for completion tasks, the relationship between
them is worth exploring. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end semantic

raw point cloud as input, and merges the features from the segmentation branch
into the completion branch hierarchically to provide semantic information. By
adopting BEV representation and 3D sparse convolution, we can benefit from the
lower operand while maintaining effective expression. Besides, the decoder of

increase in the approximation ratio for an infinite family of MaxCut instances
over QAOA. The optimal performance is lower bounded by the conventional ansatz,
and we present empirical results for graphs on eight vertices that one layer of
the multi-angle anstaz is comparable to three layers of the traditional ansatz
on MaxCut problems. Similarly, multi-angle QAOA yields a higher approximation
ratio than QAOA at the same depth on a collection of MaxCut instances on fifty
and one-hundred vertex graphs. Many of the optimized parameters are found to be
zero, so their associated gates can be removed from the circuit, further
decreasing the circuit depth. These results indicate that multi-angle QAOA
requires shallower circuits to solve problems than QAOA, making it more viable
for near-term intermediate-scale quantum devices.

raise the metamorphic probability of a corpus of malware by >0.45.
Additionally, more than 33% of metamorphic instances generated by

radiation originating from neutron-induced reactions. The study of fast
neutrons is often based on the neutron-proton elastic scattering reaction. In
this case, the ionization induced by the recoil protons in a hydrogenous

possible due to the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the newly gained
knowledge overwrites existing representations. Furthermore, most
state-of-the-art models excel either in recognizing the objects or in grasp
prediction, while both tasks use visual input. The combined architecture to
tackle both tasks is very limited. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model
architecture consists of a dynamically growing dual-memory recurrent neural

GDM part is designed to recognize the object in both instances and categories

past. Prediction performances not only depend on the structure and features of
the model, but also on its parametrization. Official databases are often biased
due to lag in reporting of cases, changing testing policy or incompleteness of
data. Moreover, model parametrization is time-dependent e.g. due to changing
age-structures, new emerging virus variants, non-pharmaceutical interventions
and ongoing vaccination programs. To cover these aspects, we develop a
principled approach to parametrize SIR-type epidemiologic models of different
complexities by embedding the model structure as a hidden layer into a general
Input-Output Non-Linear Dynamical System (IO-NLDS). Non-explicitly modelled
impacts on the system are imposed as inputs of the system. Observable data are
coupled to hidden states of the model by appropriate data models considering
possible biases of the data. We estimate model parameters including their
time-dependence by a Bayesian knowledge synthesis process considering parameter
ranges derived from external studies as prior information. We applied this
approach on a SIR-type model and data of Germany and Saxony demonstrating good
prediction performances. By our approach, we can estimate and compare for
example the relative effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and can
provide scenarios of the future course of the epidemic under specified
conditions. Our method of parameter estimation can be translated to other data
sets, i.e. other countries and other SIR-type models even for other disease
contexts.

divergence--free. It is common belief that the initial condition is compatible
with the boundary condition if the initial condition fulfills the boundary
condition but this is not sufficient. Such a field does not necessarily fulfill
the full compatibility condition of the Navier-Stokes equation. If the

were performed in an analytical framework. The results for a channel

facilitated by the interaction of hidden biochemical processes that govern
synaptic efficacy during varying lifetimes. This arrangement allows idle
memories to be temporarily overwritten without being forgotten, in favour of
new memories utilised in the short-term. While embedded artificial intelligence
can greatly benefit from such functionality, a practical demonstration in
hardware is still missing. Here, we show how the intrinsic properties of
metal-oxide volatile memristors emulate the hidden processes that support
biological palimpsest consolidation. Our memristive synapses exhibit an
expanded doubled capacity which can protect a consolidated long-term memory
while up to hundreds of uncorrelated short-term memories temporarily overwrite
it. The synapses can also implement familiarity detection of previously
forgotten memories. Crucially, palimpsest operation is achieved automatically
and without the need for specialised instructions. We further demonstrate a
practical adaptation of this technology in the context of image vision. This
showcases the use of emerging memory technologies to efficiently expand the
capacity of artificial intelligence hardware towards more generalised learning

datasets, normally between the training set and the test set for machine
learning algorithms. Domain shift is a serious problem for generalization of
machine learning models and it is well-established that a domain shift between
the training and test sets may cause a drastic drop in the model's performance.
In medical imaging, there can be many sources of domain shift such as different
scanners or scan protocols, different pathologies in the patient population,
anatomical differences in the patient population (e.g. men vs women) etc.
Therefore, in order to train models that have good generalization performance,
it is important to be aware of the domain shift problem, its potential causes
and to devise ways to address it. In this paper, we study the effect of domain
shift on left and right ventricle blood pool segmentation in short axis cardiac
MR images. Our dataset contains short axis images from 4 different MR scanners
and 3 different pathology groups. The training is performed with nnUNet. The
results show that scanner differences cause a greater drop in performance
compared to changing the pathology group, and that the impact of domain shift
is greater on right ventricle segmentation compared to left ventricle
segmentation. Increasing the number of training subjects increased
cross-scanner performance more than in-scanner performance at small training
set sizes, but this difference in improvement decreased with larger training
set sizes. Training models using data from multiple scanners improved

7.3--237.9 MeV nuc$^{-1}$ from the ACE spacecraft at 1 au, we compare the
energy spectra and intensities of anomalous and Galactic cosmic rays (ACRs and
GCRs, respectively) during 1997--2020. Our analysis shows that the transition
from ACR-dominated spectrum to GCR-dominated spectrum occurs at energies
$\sim$15 to $\sim$35 MeV nuc$^{-1}$, and the transition energy $E_t$ is found
to be well anticorrelated with varying solar activity. This is the first study
of ACR-GCR transition energy dependence on the solar cycle variation. At
energies below $E_t$, the index of the power-law ACR-dominated spectrum
($\gamma_1$) ranges from -2.0 to -0.5, whereas the GCR-dominated spectrum has a
power-law index ($\gamma_2$) changing from 0.3 to 0.8 at energies ranging from
$E_t$ to 237.9 MeV nuc$^{-1}$. Both $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are positively
correlated with solar activity. In addition, during the solar cycle 24/25
minimum period, the peak GCR intensity observed by ACE spacecraft is about 8\%
above its 2009 value, setting a new record since the space age, while the peak
ACR intensity is almost similar to that of the previous two solar cycles with
the same pattern of solar magnetic polarity, indicating a different modulation
mechanism between ACRs and GCRs.

the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources and the

electricity users' demand is of utmost value to retailers, aggregators, and
policymakers. However, behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment and appliances at the
household level are unknown to the other stakeholders mainly due to privacy
concerns and tight regulations. In this paper, we seek to identify residential
consumers based on their BTM equipment, mainly rooftop photovoltaic (PV)
systems and electric heating, using imported/purchased energy data from utility
meters. To solve this problem with an interpretable, fast, secure, and
maintainable solution, we propose an integrated method called Interpretable
Refined Motifs And binary Classification (IRMAC). The proposed method comprises
a novel shape-based pattern extraction technique, called Refined Motif (RM)
discovery, and a single-neuron classifier. The first part extracts a
sub-pattern from the long time series considering the frequency of occurrences,
average dissimilarity, and time dynamics while emphasising specific times with
annotated distances. The second part identifies users' types with linear
complexity while preserving the transparency of the algorithms. With the real
data from Australia and Denmark, the proposed method is tested and verified in
identifying PV owners and electrical heating system users.

  Adversarial Framework","5 pages, 2 figures; authors contributed equally",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The success of deep learning for medical imaging tasks, such as
classification, is heavily reliant on the availability of large-scale datasets.
However, acquiring datasets with large quantities of labeled data is
challenging, as labeling is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
learning (SSL) is a growing alternative to fully-supervised learning, but
requires unlabeled samples for training. In medical imaging, many datasets lack
unlabeled data entirely, so SSL can't be conventionally utilized. We propose
3N-GAN, or 3 Network Generative Adversarial Networks, to perform
semi-supervised classification of medical images in fully-supervised settings.
We incorporate a classifier into the adversarial relationship such that the
generator trains adversarially against both the classifier and discriminator.
Our preliminary results show improved classification performance and GAN
generations over various algorithms. Our work can seamlessly integrate with
numerous other medical imaging model architectures and SSL methods for greater
performance.

information of urban 3D city objects. There are several ways to generate 3D
models for applications such as gaming, media content for movies and TV, and 3D
printing among others. Since visualization is the primary purpose of these
methods of 3D model generation they lack the semantic information required for
applications such as spatial data-mining, thematic queries, and geospatial
simulation and analysis. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods for
mapping sematic information of new and existing 3D geometric models and their
conversation to CityGML formats so it can be stored for future use. The
conversion of must allows mapping of classes of objects with a higher
Level-Of-Detail (LOD) such as LOD3 and LOD4 which represent an urban city model
in greater detail. A methodology of the conversion is developed and a prototype
is implemented to validate the algorithms and the methods developed for this
project. The methods can be broadly categorized into three parts a) Extraction
of geometric information; b) Segmentation of the model into various groups for
semantic mapping; c) Mapping of semantic information on the model. Topological
aspects are considered for the mesh segmentation to allow users to easily
select and map semantic information to the geometric model. The generated
models can be used in a wide range of applications ranging from disaster
management to urban simulations such as rooftop solar panel installations.

function and the polylogarithm. Starting from that relation and a formula for
the polylogarithm at the negative integers known from the literature, we can
deduce a simple closed formula for the Lerch $\Phi$ function at the negative
integers, where the Stirling numbers of the second kind are not needed.
Leveraging that finding, we also produce alternative formulae for the $k$-th
derivatives of the cotangent and cosecant (ditto, tangent and secant), as
simple functions of the negative polylogarithm and Lerch $\Phi$, respectively,
which is evidence of the importance of these functions (they are less exotic
than they seem). Lastly, we extend formulae for the Hurwitz zeta function only
valid at the positive integers to the complex half-plane using this novelty.

because such a minimal length occurs due to quantum gravitational effects, and
modifies the low energy quantum mechanical systems. In fact, as the mean field

explicitly analyze such corrections to this potential. We will obtain the

(i.e. mixed-criticality real-time systems) represent an emerging research that
faces many issues. This paper describes a new ASIC design of a coprocessor that
realizes process scheduling for mixed-criticality real-time systems. The
solution proposed in this paper uses Robust Earliest Deadline (RED) algorithm.
Due to the on-chip implementation of the scheduler, all scheduler operations
always take two clock cycles to execute. The proposed solution was verified by
simulations that applied millions of random inputs. Chip area costs are
evaluated by synthesis into ASIC using 28 nm TSMC technology. The proposed
RED-based scheduler is compared with an existing EDF-based scheduler that
supports hard real-time processes only. Even though the RED-based scheduler
costs more chip area, it can handle any combinations of process criticalities,
variations of process execution times and deadlines, achieves higher CPU
utilization and can be used for scheduling of non-real-time, soft real-time and
hard real-time processes combined within one system.

case of narrative information models based on ontology was identified. There
are significantly fewer studies that reviewed the ontology-based narrative
models. This work goes a step further by evaluating the ontologies using the
parameters from narrative components. This paper will explore the basic

research, a comprehensive dataset of Kazakh handwritten texts is necessary.
This is particularly true given the lack of a dataset for handwritten Kazakh

researchers in the field of handwriting recognition tasks by using deep and

energy for the supercurrent is converted into the energy of the magnetic field
during the transition of a bulk superconductor into the normal state in the
presence of a magnetic field. The Comment indicates that this opinion cannot be
correct, since the kinetic energy is much less than the energy of the magnetic
field and both of these energies decrease during the transition to the normal

explained how a reversible thermodynamic process differs from an irreversible
