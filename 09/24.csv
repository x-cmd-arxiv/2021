James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the ground-based Extremely Large
Telescopes, the first characterization of a high molecular weight atmosphere
around a temperate rocky exoplanet is imminent. Atmospheric simulations and
synthetic observables of target exoplanets are essential to prepare and
interpret these observations. Here we report the results of the first part of
the TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) project, which
compares 3D numerical simulations performed with four state-of-the-art global
climate models (ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D, Unified Model) for the
potentially habitable target TRAPPIST-1e. In this first part, we present the
results of dry atmospheric simulations. These simulations serve as a benchmark
to test how radiative transfer, subgrid-scale mixing (dry turbulence and
convection), and large-scale dynamics impact the climate of TRAPPIST-1e and
consequently the transit spectroscopy signature as seen by JWST. To first
order, the four models give results in good agreement. The intermodel spread in
the global mean surface temperature amounts to 7K (6K) for the N2-dominated
(CO2-dominated) atmosphere. The radiative fluxes are also remarkably similar
(intermodel variations less than 5%), from the surface (1 bar) up to
atmospheric pressures around 5 mbar. Moderate differences between the models
appear in the atmospheric circulation pattern (winds) and the (stratospheric)
thermal structure. These differences arise between the models from (1)
large-scale dynamics, because TRAPPIST-1e lies at the tipping point between two
different circulation regimes (fast and Rhines rotators) in which the models
can be alternatively trapped, and (2) parameterizations used in the upper
atmosphere such as numerical damping.

the best use of observational data, a thorough understanding of their
atmospheres is needed. 3D general circulation models (GCMs) are one of the most
comprehensive tools available for this task and will be used to interpret
observations of temperate rocky exoplanets. Due to parameterization choices
made in GCMs, they can produce different results, even for the same planet.
Employing four widely-used exoplanetary GCMs -- ExoCAM, LMD-G, ROCKE-3D and the
UM -- we continue the TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison by
modeling aquaplanet climates of TRAPPIST-1e with a moist atmosphere dominated
by either nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Although the GCMs disagree on the details
of the simulated regimes, they all predict a temperate climate with neither of
the two cases pushed out of the habitable state. Nevertheless, the inter-model
spread in the global mean surface temperature is non-negligible: 14 K and 24 K
in the nitrogen and carbon dioxide dominated case, respectively. We find
substantial inter-model differences in moist variables, with the smallest
amount of clouds in LMD-Generic and the largest in ROCKE-3D. ExoCAM predicts
the warmest climate for both cases and thus has the highest water vapor content
and the largest amount and variability of cloud condensate. The UM tends to
produce colder conditions, especially in the nitrogen-dominated case due to a
strong negative cloud radiative effect on the day side of TRAPPIST-1e. Our
study highlights various biases of GCMs and emphasizes the importance of not
relying solely on one model to understand exoplanet climates.

project that aims to quantify how dfferences in general circulation models
(GCMs) could impact the climate prediction for TRAPPIST-1e and, subsequently
its atmospheric characterization in transit. Four GCMs have participated in
THAI so far: ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D and the UM. This paper, focused on
the simulated observations, is the third part of a trilogy, following the
analysis of two land planet scenarios (part I) and two aquaplanet scenarios
(part II). Here, we show a robust agreement between the simulated spectra and
the number of transits estimated to detect the land planet atmospheres. For the
aquaplanet ones, using atmospheric data from any of the four GCMs would require
at least 17 transits. This prediction corresponds to UM simulated data which
produces the lowest and thinnest clouds. Between 35-40% more clouds are
predicted by ExoCAM or LMD-G due to higher thick terminator clouds. For the
first time this work provides ""GCM uncertainty error bars"" of 35-40% that need
to be considered in future analyses of transmission spectra. We also analyzed
the inter-transit variability induced by weather patterns and changes of
terminator cloudiness between transits. Its magnitude differs significantly
between the GCMs but its impact on the transmission spectra is within the
measurement uncertainties. THAI has demonstrated the importance of model
intercomparison for exoplanets and also paved the way for a larger project to
develop an intercomparison meta-framework, namely the Climates Using
Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES).

(UAVs) to search for an unknown source. The proposed method is inspired by the
well-known PSO algorithm and is called acceleration-based particle swarm
optimization (APSO) to address the source-seeking problem with no a priori
information. Unlike the conventional PSO algorithm, where the particle velocity
is updated based on the self-cognition and social-cognition information, here
the update is performed on the particle acceleration. A theoretical analysis is
provided, showing the stability and convergence of the proposed APSO algorithm.
Conditions on the parameters of the resulting third order update equations are
obtained using Jurys stability test. High fidelity simulations performed in
CoppeliaSim, shows the improved performance of the proposed APSO algorithm for
searching an unknown source when compared with the state-of-the-art particle
swarm-based source seeking algorithms. From the obtained results, it is
observed that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods
under scenarios like different inter-UAV communication network topologies,
varying number of UAVs in the swarm, different sizes of search region,
restricted source movement and in the presence of measurements noise.

Johnson and Mawdesley's groups of Fibonacci type, the only ones that can be LOG
groups are Gilbert-Howie groups $H(n,m)$. We conjecture that if a Gilbert-Howie
group is a LOG group, then it is a Sieradski group, and prove this in certain
cases (in particular, for fixed $m$, the conjecture can only be false for
finitely many $n$). We obtain necessary conditions for a cyclically presented

problems. Despite showing good scalability, existing replanners often fail to
solve problems involving a large number of misleading plans, i.e., weak plans
that do not lead to strong solutions, however, due to their minimal lengths,
are likely to be found at every replanning iteration. The poor performance of
replanners in such problems is due to their all-outcome determinization. That
is, when compiling from non-deterministic to classical, they include all
compiled classical operators in a single deterministic domain which leads
replanners to continually generate misleading plans. We introduce an offline
replanner, called Safe-Planner (SP), that relies on a single-outcome
determinization to compile a non-deterministic domain to a set of classical
domains, and ordering heuristics for ranking the obtained classical domains.
The proposed single-outcome determinization and the heuristics allow for
alternating between different classical domains. We show experimentally that
this approach can allow SP to avoid generating misleading plans but to generate
weak plans that directly lead to strong solutions. The experiments show that SP
outperforms state-of-the-art non-deterministic solvers by solving a broader
range of problems. We also validate the practical utility of SP in real-world
non-deterministic robotic tasks.

comprehensive understanding of both sentence semantics and video contents.
Previous works either tackle this task in a fully-supervised setting that
requires a large amount of temporal annotations or in a weakly-supervised
setting that usually cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Since manual
annotations are expensive, to cope with limited annotations, we tackle TLG in a
semi-supervised way by incorporating self-supervised learning, and propose
Self-Supervised Semi-Supervised Temporal Language Grounding (S^4TLG). S^4TLG
consists of two parts: (1) A pseudo label generation module that adaptively
produces instant pseudo labels for unlabeled samples based on predictions from
a teacher model; (2) A self-supervised feature learning module with inter-modal
and intra-modal contrastive losses to learn video feature representations under
the constraints of video content consistency and video-text alignment. We
conduct extensive experiments on the ActivityNet-CD-OOD and Charades-CD-OOD

competitive performance compared to fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods

polar wander (TPW) and atmospheric condensation worked together to create the
Sputnik Planitia (SP) ice sheet and reorient it to its present-day location on
Pluto. SP is located at 18 N, 178 E, very close to the anti-Charon point, and
it has been previously shown that this location can be explained by TPW
reorientation of an impact basin as it fills with N2 ice. We readdress that
hypothesis while including a more accurate treatment of Pluto's climate and
orbital obliquity cycle. Our model again finds that TPW is a viable mechanism
for the formation and present-day location of SP. We find that the initial
impact basin could have been located north of the present-day location, at
latitudes between 35 N and 50 N. The empty basin is constrained to be 2.5 -- 3
km deep, with enough N2 available to form at most a 1 -- 2 km thick ice sheet.
Larger N2 inventories reorient too close to the anti-Charon point. After
reaching the final location, the ice sheet undergoes short periods of
sublimation and re-condensation on the order of ten meters of ice, due Pluto's
variable obliquity cycle, which drives short periods of reorientation of a few
km. The obliquity cycle also has a role in the onset of infilling; some initial
basin locations are only able to begin accumulating N2 ice at certain points
during the obliquity cycle. We also explore the sensitivity of the coupled
model to albedo, initial obliquity, and Pluto's orbit.

gallium-based radiochemical measurements with high-intensity neutrino sources,
commonly referred to as the \textit{gallium anomaly}, which could be
interpreted as evidence for oscillations between $\nu_e$ and sterile neutrino
($\nu_s$) states. A 3.414-MCi \nuc{51}{Cr} $\nu_e$ source was placed at the
center of two nested Ga volumes and measurements were made of the production of
\nuc{71}{Ge} through the charged current reaction,
\nuc{71}{Ga}($\nu_e$,e$^-$)\nuc{71}{Ge}, at two average distances. The measured
production rates for the inner and the outer targets respectively are

($55.6^{+2.7}_{-2.6}(\mbox{stat})\pm1.4 (\mbox{syst})$) atoms of

at each distance to the expected rate from the known cross section and
experimental efficiencies are $R_{in}=0.79\pm0.05$ and $R_{out}= 0.77\pm0.05$.
The ratio of the outer to the inner result is 0.97$\pm$0.07, which is
consistent with unity within uncertainty. The rates at each distance were found
to be similar, but 20-24\% lower than expected, thus reaffirming the anomaly.
These results are consistent with $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_s$ oscillations with a
relatively large $\Delta m^2$ ($>$0.5 eV$^2$) and mixing sin$^2 2\theta$

evolution of this pulsar and show that the pulsar kick can create a highly
relativistic jet at the opposite direction of the kick velocity. The lifetime
and energetics of the jet is estimated. It is argued that the jet can generate
a Gamma-ray Burst (GRB). The long term dynamical evolution of the jet is
calculated. It is found that the shock radius of the jet should expand to about
32 pc at present, which is well consistent with the observed radius of the
supernova remnant S147 ($32.1\pm4.8$ pc). Additionally, our calculations
indicate that the current velocity of the GRB remnant should be about 440 km
s$^{-1}$, which is also consistent with the observed blast wave velocity of the
remnant of S147 (500 km s$^{-1}$).

devices, due to their small size, low insertion losses, and passive operation.
While the MRRs have been established for optical filtering in
wavelength-multiplexed systems, the nonlinear properties that they can exhibit
give rise to new perspectives on their use. For instance, they have been
recently considered for introducing optical nonlinearity in photonic reservoir
computing systems. In this work, we present a detailed numerical investigation
of a silicon MRR operation, in the presence of external optical feedback, in a
time delay reservoir computing scheme. We demonstrate the versatility of this
compact, passive device, by exploiting different operating regimes and solving
computing tasks with diverse memory requirements. We show that when large
memory is required, as it occurs in the Narma 10 task, the MRR nonlinearity
does not play a significant role when the photodetection nonlinearity is
involved, while the contribution of the external feedback is significant. On
the contrary, for computing tasks such as the Mackey-Glass and the Santa Fe
chaotic timeseries prediction, the MRR and the photodetection nonlinearities
contribute both to efficient computation. The presence of optical feedback
improves the prediction of the Mackey-Glass timeseries while it plays a minor
role in the Santa Fe timeseries case.

three types of security-related anomaly detection systems and extensively
evaluate our Interpreter with representative prior works. Experimental results
show that DeepAID can provide high-quality interpretations for unsupervised DL

symmetric pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson Dark Matter (pNGB DM) model. They help
us to have a better understanding of the mechanism from multi-angle, and
inspire us to propose some interesting generalizations. In the first proof, we
revisit the non-linear representation method and rephrase the argument with the
interaction eigenstates. In this picture, the phase mode (DM) can only have a
trilinear interaction with a derivative-squared acting on the radial mode when
the DM is on-shell. Thus, the DM-quark scattering generated by a mass mixing
between the radial mode and the Higgs boson vanishes in the limit of
zero-momentum transfer. Using the same method, we can easily generalize the
model to an SO(N) model with general soft-breaking structures. In particular,
we study the soft-breaking cubic terms and identify those terms which preserve
the cancellation mechanism for the DM candidate. In our discussion of the
second method, we find that the cancellation relies on the special structure of
mass terms and interactions of the mediators. This condition can be
straightforwardly generalized to the vector-portal models. We provide two
examples of the vector-portal case where the first one is an SU(2)_L \times
U(1)_Y \times U(1)_X model and the second one is an SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y
\times U(1)_(B-L) \times U(1)_X model. In the first model, the vector mediators
are the Z_nu boson and a new U(1)_X gauge boson X_nu, while in the second model
the mediators are the U(1)_(B-L) and U(1)_X gauge bosons. The cancellation
mechanism works in both models when there are no generic kinetic mixing terms
for the gauge bosons. Once the generic kinetic mixing terms are included, the
first model requires a fine-tuning of the mixing parameter to avoid the
stringent direct detection bound, while the second model can naturally
circumvent it.

However, its applicability in IDS is studied largely in the default settings as
used in language models. Whereas security applications offer distinct
conditions and hence warrant careful consideration while applying such
recurrent networks. Therefore, we conducted one of the most exhaustive works on
LSTM hyper-parameters for IDS and experimented with approx. 150 LSTM
configurations to determine its hyper-parameters relative importance,
interaction effects, and optimal selection approach for designing an IDS. We
conducted multiple analyses of the results of these experiments and empirically
controlled for the interaction effects of different hyper-parameters covariate
levels. We found that for security applications, especially for designing an
IDS, neither similar relative importance as applicable to language models is
valid, nor is the standard linear method for hyper-parameter selection ideal.
We ascertained that the interaction effect plays a crucial role in determining
the relative importance of hyper-parameters. We also discovered that after
controlling for the interaction effect, the correct relative importance for
LSTMs for an IDS is batch-size, followed by dropout ratio and padding. The
findings are significant because when LSTM was first used for language models,
the focus had mostly been on increasing the number of layers to enhance
performance.

reproducibility and high costs. Automatic metrics are cheap and reproducible
but sometimes poorly correlated with human judgment. In this work, we propose
flexible semiautomatic to automatic summary evaluation metrics, following the
Pyramid human evaluation method. Semi-automatic Lite2Pyramid retains the
reusable human-labeled Summary Content Units (SCUs) for reference(s) but
replaces the manual work of judging SCUs' presence in system summaries with a
natural language inference (NLI) model. Fully automatic Lite3Pyramid further
substitutes SCUs with automatically extracted Semantic Triplet Units (STUs) via
a semantic role labeling (SRL) model. Finally, we propose in-between metrics,
Lite2.xPyramid, where we use a simple regressor to predict how well the STUs
can simulate SCUs and retain SCUs that are more difficult to simulate, which
provides a smooth transition and balance between automation and manual
evaluation. Comparing to 15 existing metrics, we evaluate human-metric
correlations on 3 existing meta-evaluation datasets and our newly-collected
PyrXSum (with 100/10 XSum examples/systems). It shows that Lite2Pyramid
consistently has the best summary-level correlations; Lite3Pyramid works better
than or comparable to other automatic metrics; Lite2.xPyramid trades off small
correlation drops for larger manual effort reduction, which can reduce costs
for future data collection. Our code and data are publicly available at:

challenge in robotics. Most solutions rely entirely on visual data to plan the

reliably pick and hold unknown objects, the integration of an artificial sense
of touch in robotic systems is pivotal. This paper describes a novel
model-based slip detection pipeline that can predict possibly failing grasps in
real-time and signal a necessary increase in grip force. As such, the slip
detector does not rely on manually collected data, but exploits physics to
generalize across different tasks. To evaluate the approach, a state-of-the-art
vision-based tactile sensor that accurately estimates distributed forces was
integrated into a grasping setup composed of a six degrees-of-freedom cobot and
a two-finger gripper. Results show that the system can reliably predict slip
while manipulating objects of different shapes, materials, and weights. The
sensor can detect both translational and rotational slip in various scenarios,
making it suitable to improve the stability of a grasp.

binaries in which proximity effects, tidal distortion due to time-dependent
tidal potential in particular, lead to measurable photometric variability close
to the periastron passage. The varying tidal potential may also give rise to
tidally-excited oscillations (TEOs). TEOs may play an important role in the

detection of TEOs and characterisation of the long-term behaviour of their

We use two seasons of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations
of the target to obtain new 30-min cadence photometry by means of the
difference image analysis of TESS full-frame images. In order to extend the
analysis to longer time scales, we supplement the TESS data with 30-years long
ground-based photometry of the target. We confirm the detection of the known
$n=23$, 25, and 41 TEOs and announce the detection of two new TEOs, with $n=24$

found to vary on a time scale of years or months. For $n=25$ TEO amplitude and
frequency changes are related, which may indicate that the main cause of the
amplitude drop of this TEO in TESS observations is the change of its frequency
and increase of detuning parameter. The light curve of the $n=230$ TEO is
strongly non-sinusoidal. Its high frequency may indicate that the oscillation
is a strange mode. We also find that the orbital period of the system decreases
at the rate of about 11 s(yr)$^{-1}$, which can be explained by a significant
mass loss or mass transfer in the system with a possible contribution from
tidal dissipation.

perform thermodynamic tasks. In particular, asymmetric couplings to two heat

Cooper pairs are the key ingredient to BCS theory as the microscopic
explanation of conventional superconductivity. They form between particles of
opposite spin and momentum at the Fermi surface of the system. Here, we
directly observe Cooper pairs in a mesoscopic two-dimensional Fermi gas. We
apply an imaging scheme that enables us to extract the full in-situ momentum
distribution of a strongly interacting Fermi gas with single particle and spin
resolution. Our ultracold gas allows us to freely tune between a completely
non-interacting, unpaired system and weak attractions, where we find Cooper
pair correlations at the Fermi surface. When increasing the attractive
interactions even further, the pairs gradually turn into deeply bound molecules
breaking up the Fermi surface. Our mesoscopic system is closely related to the
physics of nuclei, superconducting grains or quantum dots. With the precise
control over interactions, particle number and potential landscape in our
experiment, the observables we establish in this work provide a new approach to
longstanding questions concerning not only such mesoscopic systems but also
their connection to the macroscopic world.

of the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene (CTBG). In particular, they
exhibit a set of magic angles which are identical to those of CTBG at which a
pair of bands (i) are perfectly flat, (ii) have Chern numbers in the sublattice

self-supervised visual representation learning algorithms relative to humans?
More concretely, how much ""human-like"" natural visual experience would these
algorithms need in order to reach human-level performance in a complex,
realistic visual object recognition task such as ImageNet? Using a scaling
experiment, here we estimate that the answer is several orders of magnitude
longer than a human lifetime: typically on the order of a million to a billion
years of natural visual experience (depending on the algorithm used). We obtain
even larger estimates for achieving human-level performance in ImageNet-derived
robustness benchmarks. The exact values of these estimates are sensitive to
some underlying assumptions, however even in the most optimistic scenarios they
remain orders of magnitude larger than a human lifetime. We discuss the main
caveats surrounding our estimates and the implications of these surprising
results.

missing image or text, and it replaces the computationally expensive
pretraining with modality translation. MARMOT outperforms an ensemble text-only

investigates a new spin-half Yb$^{3+}$ delafossite material, KYbSe$_2$, whose
inelastic neutron scattering spectra reveal a diffuse continuum with a sharp

multipartite entanglement spread between its neighbors, and analysis of its

at the $K$ point shows a scaling collapse in $\hbar\omega/k_\mathrm{B}T$ down
to 0.3 K, indicating a second-order quantum phase transition. Comparing this to
previous theoretical work suggests that the proximate phase at larger $J_2$ is
a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, resolving a long-debated issue. We thus
show that KYbSe$_2$ is close to a spin liquid phase, which in turn sheds light

(D-CTC) can perfectly distinguish multiple non-orthogonal quantum states. In
this paper, we propose a practical method for discriminating multiple
non-orthogonal states, by using a previously known quantum circuit designed to
simulate D-CTCs. This method relies on multiple copies of an input state,
multiple iterations of the circuit, and a fixed set of unitary operations. We
first characterize the performance of this circuit and study its asymptotic
behavior. We also show how it can be equivalently recast as a local, adaptive
circuit that may be implemented simply in an experiment. Finally, we prove that
our state discrimination strategy achieves the multiple Chernoff bound when
discriminating an arbitrary set of pure qubit states.

to a framework applicable to the national level. First, employing confirmatory
factor analyses on 47 variables, I build 13 composite factors crucial to
measuring six national level capacities: technological capacity, financial
capacity, human capacity, infrastructural capacity, public policy capacity, and
social capacity. My data cover most low- and middle-income- economies (LMICs),
eligible for the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA)
support between 2005 and 2019. Second, I analyze the relationship between the
estimated capacity factors and economic growth while controlling for some of
the incoming flows from abroad and other confounders that might influence the
relationship. Lastly, I conduct K-means cluster analysis and then analyze the
results alongside regression estimates to glean patterns and classifications
within the LMICs. Results indicate that enhancing infrastructure (ICT, energy,
trade, and transport), financial (apparatus and environment), and public policy
capacities is a prerequisite for attaining economic growth. Similarly, I find
improving human capital with specialized skills positively impacts economic
growth. Finally, by providing a ranking of which capacity is empirically more
important for economic growth, I offer suggestions to governments with limited
budgets to make wise investments. Likewise, my findings inform international
policy and monetary bodies on how they could better channel their funding in
LMICs to achieve sustainable development goals and boost shared prosperity.

single cavity with realistic parameters successfully transfers photons every

by local operations and ion readout. For processors composed of Rydberg atoms,
our method fully connects a large array of thousands of neutral atoms. The

stellar populations of all dwarfs, for which we find that a small fraction of
young stars cannot be excluded. We also find that dwarf radial velocities
contribute too little to their kinetic energy when compared to satellite
systems with motions only regulated by gravity, and some other mechanism must
be at work such as ram pressure. The latter may have preferentially reduced
radial velocities when dwarf progenitors entered the halo until they lost their

discover a novel large scale structure perpendicular to the Milky Way disk,
which is made by 20% of dwarfs orbiting or counter orbiting with the

excellent relic of the chemical evolution across cosmic time. We present a
detailed analysis of spatially resolved stellar populations based on $>2.6$
million spatial bins from 7439 nearby galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. To
account for accurate inclination corrections, we derive an equation for
morphology dependent determination of galaxy inclinations. Our study goes
beyond the well-known global mass-metallicity relation and radial metallicity
gradients by providing a statistically sound exploration of local relations
between stellar metallicity $[Z/H]$, stellar surface mass density
$\Sigma_\star$ and galactocentric distance in the global mass-morphology plane.
We find a significant resolved mass density-metallicity relation $\rm
r\Sigma_\star ZR$ for galaxies of all types and masses above
$10^{9.8}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. Different radial distances make an important
contribution to the spread of the relation. Particularly, in low and
intermediate mass galaxies, we find that at fixed $\Sigma_\star$ metallicity
increases with radius independently of morphology. For high masses, this radial
dependence is only observed in high $\Sigma_\star$ regions of spiral galaxies.
This result calls for a driver of metallicity, in addition to $\Sigma_\star$
that promotes chemical enrichment in the outer parts of galaxies more strongly
than in the inner parts. We discuss gas accretion, outflows, recycling and
radial migration as possible scenarios.

gravitational charges in subregions bounded by a timelike hypersurface. We
consider the generalization of this stress tensor to null hypersurfaces. Such a
stress tensor can be derived from the on-shell subregion action of general
relativity associated with a Dirichlet variational principle, which fixes an
induced Carroll structure on the null boundary. The formula for the mixed-index
tensor $T{}^i{}_j$ takes a remarkably simple form that is manifestly
independent of the choice of auxiliary null vector at the null surface, and we
compare this expression to previous proposals for null Brown-York stress
tensors. The stress tensor we obtain satisfies a covariant conservation
equation with respect to any connection induced from a rigging vector at the
hypersurface, as a result of the null constraint equations. For transformations
that act covariantly on the boundary structures, the Brown-York charges
coincide with canonical charges constructed from a version of the Wald-Zoupas
procedure. For anomalous transformations, the charges differ by an intrinsic
functional of the boundary geometry, which we explicity verify for a set of
symmetries associated with finite null hypersurfaces. Applications of the null
Brown-York stress tensor to symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes and
celestial holography are discussed.

a central theme in the study of extrasolar planets. Although the 12C/13C
isotope ratio shows little variation in the solar system, the atmosphere of a
super-Jupiter was recently shown to be rich in 13CO, possibly as a result of
dominant ice accretion beyond the CO snowline during its formation. In this
paper we aim to measure the 12CO/13CO isotopologue ratio of a young, isolated
brown dwarf. While the general atmospheric characteristics of young, low mass
brown dwarfs are expected to be very similar to those of super-Jupiters, their
formation pathways may be different, leading to distinct isotopologue ratios.
We analyse archival K-band spectra of the L dwarf 2MASS J03552337+1133437 taken
with NIRSPEC at the Keck telescope. A free retrieval analysis is applied to the
data to determine the isotopologue ratio 12CO/13CO in its atmosphere. The
isotopologue 13CO, is detected in the atmosphere through the cross-correlation
method at a signal-to-noise of ~8.4. The detection significance is determined
to be ~9.5 sigma using Bayesian model comparison between two retrieval models.
We retrieve an isotopologue ratio 12CO/13CO of 97(+25/-18), marginally higher
than the local interstellar standard. Its C/O ratio of ~0.56 is consistent with
the solar value. Although only one super-Jupiter and one brown dwarf have now a
measured 12CO/13CO ratio, it is intriguing that they are different, possibly
hinting to distinct formation pathways. Albeit spectroscopic similarities,
isolated brown dwarfs may experience a top-down formation via gravitational
collapse, which resembles star formation, while giant exoplanets favorably form
through core accretion, which potentially alters isotopologue ratios in their
atmospheres depending on the material they accrete from protoplanetary disks.

of La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ from 0.12 to 0.26 using time-of-flight
techniques. These measurements allow us to follow the evolution of parallel
spin stripe fluctuations with energies less than 33 meV, from x=0.12 to 0.26.
Samples at these hole-doping levels are known to display static (on the neutron
scattering time scale) parallel spin stripes at low temperature, with onset
temperatures and intensities which decrease rapidly with increasing x.
Nonetheless, we report remarkably similar dynamic spectral weight for the
corresponding dynamic parallel spin stripes, between 5 meV to 33 meV, from the
1/8 anomaly near x=0.12, to optimal doping near x=0.19 to the quantum critical
point for the pseudogap phase near x=0.24, and finally to the approximate end
of superconductivity near x=0.26. This observed dynamic magnetic spectral
weight is structured in energy with a peak near 17 meV at all dopings studied.
Earlier neutron and resonant x-ray scattering measurements on related cuprate
superconductors have reported both a disappearance with increasing doping of
magnetic fluctuations at ($\pi$, $\pi$) wavevectors characterizing parallel
spin stripe structures, and persistant paramagnon scattering away from this
wavevector, respectively. Our new results on
La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ from 0.12 < x <0.26 clearly show persistent
parallel spin stripe fluctuations at and around at ($\pi$, $\pi$), and across
the full range of doping studied. These results are also compared to recent
theory. Together with a rapidly declining x-dependence to the static parallel
spin stripe order, the persistent parallel spin stripe fluctuations show a
remarkable similarity to the expectations of a quantum spin glass, random t-J
model, recently introduced to describe strong local correlations in cuprates.

  Data",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Depth estimation from a single image is an active research topic in computer
vision. The most accurate approaches are based on fully supervised learning
models, which rely on a large amount of dense and high-resolution (HR)
ground-truth depth maps. However, in practice, color images are usually
captured with much higher resolution than depth maps, leading to the
resolution-mismatched effect. In this paper, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised framework to train a monocular depth estimation network to
generate HR depth maps with resolution-mismatched supervision, i.e., the inputs
are HR color images and the ground-truth are low-resolution (LR) depth maps.
The proposed weakly supervised framework is composed of a sharing weight
monocular depth estimation network and a depth reconstruction network for
distillation. Specifically, for the monocular depth estimation network the
input color image is first downsampled to obtain its LR version with the same
resolution as the ground-truth depth. Then, both HR and LR color images are fed
into the proposed monocular depth estimation network to obtain the
corresponding estimated depth maps. We introduce three losses to train the
network: 1) reconstruction loss between the estimated LR depth and the
ground-truth LR depth; 2) reconstruction loss between the downsampled estimated
HR depth and the ground-truth LR depth; 3) consistency loss between the
estimated LR depth and the downsampled estimated HR depth. In addition, we
design a depth reconstruction network from depth to depth. Through distillation
loss, features between two networks maintain the structural consistency in
affinity space, and finally improving the estimation network performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
than unsupervised and semi-supervised learning based schemes, and is
competitive or even better compared to supervised ones.

absorb energy from a time-dependent external magnetic field and transfer it
into their environment. In the so-called superlocalization, the combination of
an applied oscillating and a static magnetic field gradient provides even more
focused heating since for large enough static field the dissipation is
considerably reduced. Similar effect was found in the deterministic study of
the rotating field combined with a static field gradient. Here we study
theoretically the influence of thermal effects on superlocalization and on
heating efficiency. We demonstrate that when time-dependent steady state
motions of the magnetisation vector are present in the zero temperature limit,
then deterministic and stochastic results are very similar to each other. We
also show that when steady state motions are absent, the superlocalization is
severely reduced by thermal effects. Our most important finding is that in the
low frequency range ($\omega \to 0$) suitable for hyperthermia, the oscillating
applied field is shown to result in two times larger intrinsic loss power and
specific absorption rate then the rotating one with identical superlocalization
ability which has importance in technical realisation.

rate surface density and specific star formation rate, and we provide
approximate fits to these relations. The observed ratios can be reasonably
reproduced by models with low temperature, moderate opacity, and moderate
densities, in good agreement with expectations for the cold ISM. Because the
line ratios are expected to anti-correlate with the CO(1-0)-to-H_2 conversion
factor, alphaCO^(1-0), these results have general implications for the
interpretation of CO emission from galaxies.

most current work examines the emergence of small-scale OSS projects, our
approach draws on a large-scale historical dataset of 1.8 million GitHub users
and their repository contributions. OSS collaborations are characterized by
small groups of users that work closely together, leading to the presence of
communities defined by short cycles in the underlying network structure. To
understand the impact of this phenomenon, we apply a pre-processing step that
accounts for the cyclic network structure by using Renewal-Nonbacktracking
Random Walks (RNBRW) and the strength of pairwise collaborations before
implementing the Louvain method to identify communities within the network.
Equipping Louvain with RNBRW and the contribution strength provides a more
assertive approach for detecting small-scale teams and reveals nontrivial
differences in community detection such as users tendencies toward preferential
attachment to more established collaboration communities. Using this method, we
also identify key factors that affect community formation, including the effect
of users location and primary programming language, which was determined using
a comparative method of contribution activities. Overall, this paper offers
several promising methodological insights for both open-source software experts
and network scholars interested in studying team formation.

that is played by a defender against attackers with a suite of malware that is

evaluated under a framework of exponential utility according to their
willingness to accept risk. We find that against a defender who must choose a
single strategy up front, risk-seeking attackers gain more actual utility than
risk-averse attackers, particularly in cases where the defender is better
equipped than the two attackers anticipate. Additionally, we empirically
confirm that high-risk, high-reward scenarios are more beneficial to
risk-seeking attackers like cybercriminals, while low-risk, low-reward

representation of temporal attributes in videos. However, the role of
stationary versus non-stationary attributes is less explored: Stationary
features, which remain similar throughout the video, enable the prediction of
video-level action classes. Non-stationary features, which represent temporally
varying attributes, are more beneficial for downstream tasks involving more
fine-grained temporal understanding, such as action segmentation. We argue that
a single representation to capture both types of features is sub-optimal, and
propose to decompose the representation space into stationary and
non-stationary features via contrastive learning from long and short views,
i.e. long video sequences and their shorter sub-sequences. Stationary features
are shared between the short and long views, while non-stationary features
aggregate the short views to match the corresponding long view. To empirically
verify our approach, we demonstrate that our stationary features work
particularly well on an action recognition downstream task, while our
non-stationary features perform better on action segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyse the learned representations and find that stationary features capture
more temporally stable, static attributes, while non-stationary features
encompass more temporally varying ones.

Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), when applied to adaptive
sampling problems. We propose improvements in rollout allocation, the action
exploration algorithm, and plan commitment. The first allocates a different
number of rollouts depending on how many actions the agent has taken in an
episode. We find that rollouts are more valuable after some initial information
is gained about the environment. Thus, a linear increase in the number of
rollouts, i.e. allocating a fixed number at each step, is not appropriate for
adaptive sampling tasks. The second alters which actions the agent chooses to
explore when building the planning tree. We find that by using knowledge of the
number of rollouts allocated, the agent can more effectively choose actions to
explore. The third improvement is in determining how many actions the agent
should take from one plan. Typically, an agent will plan to take the first
action from the planning tree and then call the planner again from the new
state. Using statistical techniques, we show that it is possible to greatly
reduce the number of rollouts by increasing the number of actions taken from a
single planning tree without affecting the agent's final reward. Finally, we
demonstrate experimentally, on simulated and real aquatic data from an
underwater robot, that these improvements can be combined, leading to better
adaptive sampling. The code for this work is available at

atmospheric parameters for stars and separate stellar sources from quasars,
using the unique J-PLUS photometric system. The adoption of adequate selection
criteria allows the identification of metal-poor star candidates suitable for
spectroscopic follow-up. SPEEM consists of a series of machine learning models
which uses a training sample observed by both J-PLUS and the SEGUE
spectroscopic survey. The training sample has temperatures Teff between 4\,800
K and 9\,000 K; $\log g$ between 1.0 and 4.5, and $-3.1<[Fe/H]<+0.5$. The
performance of the pipeline has been tested with a sample of stars observed by
the LAMOST survey within the same parameter range. The average differences
between the parameters of a sample of stars observed with SEGUE and J-PLUS,
which were obtained with the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline and SPEEM,
respectively, are $\Delta Teff\sim 41$ K, $\Delta \log g\sim 0.11$ dex, and
$\Delta [Fe/H]\sim 0.09$ dex. A sample of 177 stars have been identified as new
candidates with $[Fe/H]<-2.5$ and 11 of them have been observed with the ISIS
spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope. The spectroscopic analysis
confirms that $64\%$ of stars have $[Fe/H]<-2.5$, including one new star with
$[Fe/H]<-3.0$. SPEEM in combination with the J-PLUS filter system has shown the
potential to estimate the stellar atmospheric parameters (Teff, $\log g$, and
[Fe/H]). The spectroscopic validation of the candidates shows that SPEEM yields
a success rate of $64\%$ on the identification of very metal-poor star
candidates with $[Fe/H]<-2.5$.

of active sites and relatively low inherent electrical conductivity. In this
work, we demonstrated a synergistic enhancement of both active site exposure
and electrical conductivity by a one-step solvothermal synthesis technique. The
1T-phase enriched MoS$_2$ was directly formed on the titanium carbide
(Ti$_3$C$_2$Tx, MXene) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) acting as crosslinks. The
existence of edge-enriched metallic phase MoS$_2$, the conductive backbone of
MXene along with the crosslinking function of CNTs clearly improved the overall
electrical conductivity of the catalyst. Moreover, the integration of
two-dimensional (2D) MoS$_2$ with MXene effectively suppressed the MXene
oxidation and 2D layer restacking, leading to good catalytic stability. As a
result, an overpotential of 169 mV and a low Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec was
successfully achieved. This work provides a new route for 2D-based
electrocatalyst engineering and sheds light on the development of the
next-generation PGM-free HER electrocatalysts.

of the formed structures are mainly formed by eight-membered rings, which have
different shapes in each morphology. In one of them, a graphitization process

graphene transitions from an elastic to a brittle regime, while BPN can exhibit
different inelastic stages. These stages are associated with the appearance of
new morphologies. However, BPN shares some of the exceptional graphene

in-vehicle devices renders it increasingly feasible to collect streaming
trajectory data of moving objects. The continuous clustering of such data can
enable a variety of real-time services, such as identifying representative
paths or common moving trends among objects in real-time. However, little
attention has so far been given to the quality of clusters -- for example, it
is beneficial to smooth short-term fluctuations in clusters to achieve

  We propose the notion of evolutionary clustering of streaming trajectories,
abbreviated ECO, that enhances streaming-trajectory clustering quality by means
of temporal smoothing that prevents abrupt changes in clusters across
successive timestamps. Employing the notions of snapshot and historical
trajectory costs, we formalize ECO and then formulate ECO as an optimization
problem and prove that ECO can be performed approximately in linear time, thus
eliminating the iterative processes employed in previous studies. Further, we
propose a minimal-group structure and a seed point shifting strategy to
facilitate temporal smoothing. Finally, we present all algorithms underlying
ECO along with a set of optimization techniques. Extensive experiments with two
real-life datasets offer insight into ECO and show that it outperforms
state-of-the-art solutions in terms of both clustering quality and efficiency.

than $5^\circ$ in opposite directions. Accompanying simulations show that they
result from Faraday rotation within portions of dense bubble side walls that
are pervaded by the azimuthal magnetic field of accelerating electrons during
the probe transit across the bubble. Analysis of the width of the streaks shows
that quasi-monoenergetic high-energy electrons and trailing lower energy

Second, we propose a simple and computationally efficient algorithm inspired by

cumulative accretion of subhaloes and their associated star formation
efficiencies, therefore, the luminosity distribution of satellites provides
valuable information of both dark matter properties and star formation physics.
Recently, the luminosity function of satellites in nearby Milky Way-mass
galaxies has been well measured to satellites as faint as Leo I with $M_{V}
\sim -8$. In addition to the finding of the diversity in the satellite
luminosity functions, it has been noticed that there is a big gap among the
magnitude of satellites in some host galaxies, such as M101, where the gap is
around 5 in magnitude, noticeably larger than the prediction from the halo
abundance matching method. The reason of this gap is still unknown. In this
paper, we use a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with
high-resolution N-body simulation, to investigate the probability and origin of
such big gap in M101-alike galaxies. We found that, although M101 analogues are
very rare with probability of \sim 0.1%-0.2% in the local universe, their
formation is a natural outcome of the CDM model. The gap in magnitude is mainly
due to the mass of the accreted subhaloes, not from the stochastic star
formation in them. We also found that the gap is correlated with the total
satellite mass and host halo mass. By tracing the formation history of M101
type galaxies, we find that they likely formed after $z \sim 1$ due to the
newly accreted bright satellites. The gap is not in a stable state, and it will
disappear in ~7 Gyr due to mergers of bright satellites with the central
galaxy.

this paper, we propose an efficient and effective keypoints-based deep feature
fusion framework built on the 3D object detector PV-RCNN, called Fusion PV-RCNN

high-performance bounding box proposal matching module and a keypoints

feature fusion, FPV-RCNN achieves improved detection accuracy by about 9% at a
high evaluation criterion (IoU 0.7) on the synthetic dataset COMAP dedicated to
collective perception. In addition, its performance is comparable to two raw
data fusion baselines that have no data loss in sharing. Moreover, our method
also significantly decreases the CPM size to less than 0.3 KB, and is thus
about 50 times smaller than the BEV feature map sharing used in previous works.
Even with further decreased CPM feature channels, i.e., from 128 to 32, the

gestational age. Oxygen crosses the placenta by diffusion and placental
permeability to O$_2$ is high. Thus, the fetus receives adequate amounts, but
vascular Po$_2$ is much lower than after birth. Studies of sustained fetal
hypoxemia and acute 40-45% hemorrhage show that hypoxemia is not tolerated
whereas hemorrhage is. This suggests that if fetal Po$_2$ falls markedly, O$_2$
diffusion from blood to tissue is impaired. Uterine blood and umbilical blood
flows/fetal weight fall progressively with advancing gestation. This results in
fetal hypoxemia, an increase in Pco$_2$, and decrease in pH. This decreases
fetal O$_2$ delivery, and in fetal lambs and horses there is a decrease in
fetal O$_2$ consumption. The decrease in O$_2$ demands is linked to a decrease
in fetal breathing and body movements and growth rate. The decrease in fetal
motility is due to an increase in fetal plasma PGE2 concentration, which begins
at ~120 days GA in sheep and is due to the prepartum rise in fetal cortisol.
Also, adenosine administration to fetal lambs decreases fetal breathing and REM
sleep and the plasma adenosine concentration increases in late gestation. The
fetal plasma levels of neurosteroids, which suppress fetal motility, increase
with advancing gestation. The prepartum cortisol rise also inhibits fetal
growth. In normal pregnancies, these mechanisms operate effectively to maintain
an appropriate balance between fetal oxygen consumption and delivery. However,
in pregnancies with either further reduce O$_2$ delivery or increase fetal
O$_2$ demands, the mismatch between O$_2$ delivery and consumption may worsen
leading to IUGR, hypoxic organ damage or stillbirth.

differential equations cast in curvilinear coordinates. Specifically, energy
stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) schemes are considered as they allow for
design flexibility as well as stability proofs for the linear advection problem
on affine elements. Additionally, split forms are examined as they enable the
development of energy stability proofs. The first critical step proves, that in
curvilinear coordinates, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) conservative and
non-conservative forms are inherently different--even under exact integration
and analytically exact metric terms. This analysis demonstrates that the split
form is essential to developing provably stable DG schemes on curvilinear
coordinates and motivates the construction of metric dependent ESFR correction
functions in each element. Furthermore, the provably stable FR schemes differ
from schemes in the literature that only apply the ESFR correction functions to
surface terms or on the conservative form, and instead incorporate the ESFR
correction functions on the full split form of the equations. It is
demonstrated that the scheme is divergent when the correction functions are
only used for surface reconstruction in curvilinear coordinates. We numerically
verify the stability claims for our proposed FR split forms and compare them to
ESFR schemes in the literature. Lastly, the newly proposed provably stable FR
schemes are shown to obtain optimal orders of convergence. The scheme loses the
orders of accuracy at the equivalent correction parameter value c as that of
the one-dimensional ESFR scheme.

protesters to organize and express their agenda in various parts of the world.
Nevertheless, scholars still debate whether online tools induce offline
protests or facilitate them. Unfortunately, studies of protests often lack
panel data and cannot address how particular users change their behaviour over
time in line with the protest agenda. To this end, we analyze a new dataset of
the Facebook page EuroMaydan that was explicitly created to facilitate the
protest in Ukraine from November 2013 to February 2014. Moreover, our analysis
follows this page even after the end of the protest till June 2014. In total,
the dataset includes 26,631 posts and 1,470,593 comments that were generated by
124,790 users during and after the protests. We use this panel data to test how
particular users switch between the two most popular languages of this page:
Ukrainian and Russian. Previous studies have puzzled with language behaviour
during the Ukrainian protest. Although researchers expected to see more
Ukrainian language due to national mobilization, studies discovered that
Ukrainian protesters frequently used Russian, especially after the end of the
protest. A hypothesis was suggested that protesters use language strategically
depending on circumstances (e.g., to maximize outreach). However, previous
studies relied on aggregated data and did not explore the within-subject
variation of language behaviour. Our study adds to this scholarship by adding a
longitudinal analysis of language behaviour. Considering the broader
contribution of this paper, we add to the literature on protests by validating
previous findings derived from surveys that activists change their behaviour to
reflect prior preferences and situational goals rather than modify their
preferences.

a mathematical framework for the static policy, and extend to dynamic policy by
mapping our file transfer problem to the stochastic shortest path problem. We
analyze the performance of our proposed static optimal and dynamic optimal

heuristic policy that takes into account the performance-complexity tradeoff

also present the regret bound for our online algorithm. We also present

language users for utterances structured such that information is distributed
uniformly across a signal. While its implications on language production have

comprehension and linguistic acceptability as well. Further, it is unclear how
uniformity in a linguistic signal -- or lack thereof -- should be measured, and
over which linguistic unit, e.g., the sentence or language level, this
uniformity should hold. Here we investigate these facets of the UID hypothesis
using reading time and acceptability data. While our reading time results are
generally consistent with previous work, they are also consistent with a weakly
super-linear effect of surprisal, which would be compatible with UID's
predictions. For acceptability judgments, we find clearer evidence that
non-uniformity in information density is predictive of lower acceptability. We
then explore multiple operationalizations of UID, motivated by different
interpretations of the original hypothesis, and analyze the scope over which
the pressure towards uniformity is exerted. The explanatory power of a subset
of the proposed operationalizations suggests that the strongest trend may be a
regression towards a mean surprisal across the language, rather than the
phrase, sentence, or document -- a finding that supports a typical
interpretation of UID, namely that it is the byproduct of language users
maximizing the use of a (hypothetical) communication channel.

of computing an equilibrium of the resulting zero-sum defender-attacker game

mixed strategy using a deep neural network generator, and then using

treatment effect (AIE) asymptotically. A standard RCT can consistently estimate
the ADE, but confidence intervals and AIE estimation require price elasticity
estimates, which we provide using a novel experimental design. We define
heterogeneous treatment effects and derive an optimal targeting rule that meets
an equilibrium stability condition. We illustrate our results using a freelance
labor market simulation and data from a cash transfer experiment.

use a Bayesian inference framework, with the Hapke reflectance model, to
reassess Europa's surface composition. Our framework has several quantitative
improvements relative to prior analyses: (1) simultaneous inclusion of
amorphous and crystalline water ice, sulfuric-acid-octahydrate (SAO), CO$_2$,

radiation-induced band-center shift; and (3) tools to quantify confidence in
the presence of each species included in the model, constrain their parameters,
and explore solution degeneracies. We find that SAO strongly dominates the
composition in the spectra considered in this study, while both forms of water
ice are detected at varying confidence levels. We find no evidence of either

degrees to the orbital plane of the binary with an angular momentum vector that
is aligned to the binary eccentricity vector. With n- body simulations we model
polar terrestrial planet formation using hydrodynamic gas disk simulations to
motivate the initial particle distribution. Terrestrial planet formation around
an eccentric binary is more likely in a polar alignment than in a coplanar
alignment. Similar planetary systems form in a polar alignment around an
eccentric binary and a coplanar alignment around a circular binary. The polar
planetary systems are stable even with the effects of general relativity.
Planetary orbits around an eccentric binary exhibit tilt and eccentricity

extract users' interests based on their past interactions and associated static
contextual information (e.g. a user id or item category). However, extracted
interests can be inaccurate and become obsolete. Dynamic attributes, such as
user income changes, item price changes (etc.), change over time. Such dynamics
can intrinsically reflect the evolution of users' interests. We argue that
modeling such dynamic attributes can boost recommendation performance. However,
properly integrating them into user interest models is challenging since
attribute dynamics can be diverse such as time-interval aware, periodic
patterns (etc.), and they represent users' behaviors from different
perspectives, which can happen asynchronously with interactions. Besides
dynamic attributes, items in each basket contain complex interdependencies
which might be beneficial but nontrivial to effectively capture. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Attentive network to model Dynamic
attributes (named AnDa). AnDa separately encodes dynamic attributes and basket
item sequences. We design a periodic aware encoder to allow the model to
capture various temporal patterns from dynamic attributes. To effectively learn
useful item relationships, intra-basket attention module is proposed.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art.

complexity is exponential in the sparsity level. The bispectrum framework
provides a statistical-computational trade-off: it requires more observations

polynomial in the signal's length. The convex relaxation approach provides
polynomial time algorithms (with a large exponent) that recover sufficiently
sparse signals at the optimal estimation rate. We conclude the paper by

When particles are identical their wave function must be either symmetric or

different microstate. This binary and discontinuous classification raises a few

when the property that distinguishes between them is irrelevant to the physical

$\tau_d$, required for a measurement to resolve the differences between them.
Below $\tau_d$, particles seem identical, above it - different, and the
uncertainty principle provides a lower bound for $\tau_d$. Thermal systems
admit a conjugate temperature scale, $T_d$. Above this temperature the system
appears to equilibrate before it resolves the differences between particles,
below this temperature the system identifies these differences before
equilibration. As the physical differences between particles decline towards
zero, $\tau_d \to \infty$ and $T_d \to 0$.

accompanied by a significantly enhanced plasma emission at the second harmonic

  using Subcarrier Index Modulation and Reed Solomon Encoding",,,,,"cs.IT cs.SY eess.SY math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a new subcarrier index modulation scheme for
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which incorporates the
Reed-Solomon (RS) encoding in a visible light communication (VLC) system. In
this scheme, the incoming bits are first encoded using the RS encoder, then a
set of symbols in the resulting RS codeword are punctured, and the remaining
symbols are modulated and mapped onto the OFDM subcarriers. This system is
referred to as RS-OFDM-IM. Unlike the traditional subcarrier index modulation
(SIM) schemes, the proposed scheme operates based on conveying extra
information by inactivating the selected subcarriers, which facilitates
simultaneous clipping noise reduction and spectral efficiency enhancement in
OFDM-VLC. The bit error rate (BER) and throughput of the proposed technique is
theoretically and numerically analyzed. The simulation results show the
superiority of the proposed technique as compared to the coded DCO-OFDM without
SIM and the classical SIM in OFDM-VLC in a system with practical clipping
conditions.

problems under qualitative temporal and spatial relations, among others. More
formally, a QCN includes a set of entities, and a list of qualitative
constraints defining the possible scenarios between these entities. These
latter constraints are expressed as disjunctions of binary relations capturing
the (incomplete) knowledge between the involved entities. QCNs are very
effective in representing a wide variety of real-world applications, including
scheduling and planning, configuration and Geographic Information Systems
(GIS). It is however challenging to elicit, from the user, the QCN representing
a given problem. To overcome this difficulty in practice, we propose a new
algorithm for learning, through membership queries, a QCN from a non expert. In
this paper, membership queries are asked in order to elicit temporal or spatial
relationships between pairs of temporal or spatial entities. In order to
improve the time performance of our learning algorithm in practice, constraint
propagation, through transitive closure, as well as ordering heuristics, are
enforced. The goal here is to reduce the number of membership queries needed to
reach the target QCN. In order to assess the practical effect of constraint
propagation and ordering heuristics, we conducted several experiments on
randomly generated temporal and spatial constraint network instances. The
results of the experiments are very encouraging and promising.

metallic substrates. Pre-prepared ices may be processed in a variety of ways. A
2 MV Tandetron accelerator is capable of delivering a wide variety of
high-energy ions into the ICA, which simulates ice processing by cosmic rays,
the solar wind, or magnetospheric ions. The ICA is also equipped with an

QNN architectures. Here, we rigorously analyze the overparametrization
phenomenon in QNNs with periodic structure. We define overparametrization as
the regime where the QNN has more than a critical number of parameters $M_c$
that allows it to explore all relevant directions in state space. Our main
results show that the dimension of the Lie algebra obtained from the generators
of the QNN is an upper bound for $M_c$, and for the maximal rank that the
quantum Fisher information and Hessian matrices can reach. Underparametrized
QNNs have spurious local minima in the loss landscape that start disappearing
when $M\geq M_c$. Thus, the overparametrization onset corresponds to a
computational phase transition where the QNN trainability is greatly improved
by a more favorable landscape. We then connect the notion of
overparametrization to the QNN capacity, so that when a QNN is
overparametrized, its capacity achieves its maximum possible value. We run
numerical simulations for eigensolver, compilation, and autoencoding
applications to showcase the overparametrization computational phase
transition. We note that our results also apply to variational quantum
algorithms and quantum optimal control.

second-neighbor couplings, taking into account quantum and thermal
fluctuations. We use a path integral formulation in terms of coherent states to
describe the low energy physics of the model. We show that for a particular
point in the parameter space, close to the experimental estimated couplings, a
continuum classical degeneracy is lifted by both quantum and thermal
fluctuations, and a collinear state is then selected by an order by disorder
mechanism. Our results provide a global perspective in the understanding of the
experimental observations.

congestion. It is important to correctly size the buffer: make it too small,
and packets are dropped unnecessarily and the link may be underutilized; make
it too big, and packets may wait for a long time, and the router itself may be
more expensive to build. Despite its importance, there are few guidelines for
picking the buffer size. The two most well-known rules only apply to long-lived
TCP Reno flows; either for a network carrying a single TCP Reno flow (the
buffer size should equal the bandwidth-delay product, or $BDP$) or for a
network carrying $n$ TCP Reno flows (the buffer size should equal
$BDP/\sqrt{n}$). Since these rules were introduced, TCP Reno has been replaced
by newer algorithms as the default congestion control algorithm in all major
operating systems, yet little has been written about how the rules need to
change. This paper revisits both rules. For the single flow case, we generalize
the $BDP$ rule to account for changes to TCP, such as Proportional Rate
Reduction (PRR), and the introduction of new algorithms including Cubic and
BBR. We find that buffers can be made 60-75% smaller for newer algorithms. For
the multiple flow case, we show that the square root of $n$ rule holds under a
broader set of assumptions than previously known, including for these new

root of $n$ rule does not hold, including for unfair flows and certain settings

properties of the fluctuation dynamo in supersonic turbulent plasmas, which is
of relevance to the ISM, structure formation, and lab experiments of

exponentially growing and saturated state of the fluctuation dynamo for
subsonic and supersonic turbulence. We confirm that the fluctuation dynamo
efficiency decreases with compressibility. We show that the fluctuation dynamo
generated magnetic fields are spatially intermittent and the level of
intermittency decreases as the field saturates. We find a stronger back
reaction of the magnetic field on the velocity for the subsonic case as
compared to the supersonic case. Locally, we find that the level of alignment
between vorticity and velocity, velocity and magnetic field, and current
density and magnetic field in the saturated stage is enhanced in comparison to
the exponentially growing phase for the subsonic case, but only the current
density and magnetic field alignment is enhanced for the supersonic case. We
show that both the magnetic field amplification (due to weaker stretching of
field lines) and diffusion decreases when the field saturates, but the
diffusion is enhanced relative to amplification. This occurs throughout the
volume in the subsonic turbulence, but primarily in the strong-field regions
for the supersonic case. This leads to the saturation of the fluctuation
dynamo. Overall, both the amplification and diffusion of magnetic fields are

remains unclear whether isotropisation can really occur in physically motivated
contexts. We present a few examples of microphysical manifestations of
viscosity in fluids that interact either gravitationally or, for a scalar field
for instance, through a self-coupling term in the potential. In each case, we
derive the viscosity coefficient and comment on the applicability of the
approximations involved when dealing with dissipative non-perfect fluids. Upon
embedding the fluids in a cosmological context, we then show the extent to
which these models allow for isotropisation of the universe in the approach to
a singularity. We first do this in the context of expansion anisotropy only,
i.e., in the case of a Bianchi type-I universe. We then include anisotropic
3-curvature modelled by the Bianchi type-IX metric. It is found that a
self-interacting scalar field at finite temperature allows for efficient
isotropisation, whether in a Bianchi type-I or type-IX spacetime, although the
model is not tractable all the way to a singularity. Mixmaster chaotic
behaviour, which is well known to arise in anisotropic models including
anisotropic 3-curvature, is found to be suppressed in the latter case as well.
We find that the only model permitting an isotropic singularity is that of a
dense gas of black holes.

verification activities are executed as the development progresses. Such an
approach appears to give inferior results as the selection of the verification

its application under realistic engineering scenarios remains unproven due to

(Gro-M$^3$s) for multivariate categorical data, which improve parsimony and
interpretability. In Gro-M$^3$s, observed variables are partitioned into groups
such that the latent membership is constant for variables within a group but
can differ across groups. Traditional latent class models are obtained when all
variables are in one group, while traditional MMMs are obtained when each
variable is in its own group. The new model corresponds to a novel
decomposition of probability tensors. Theoretically, we derive transparent
identifiability conditions for both the unknown grouping structure and model
parameters in general settings. Methodologically, we propose a Bayesian
approach for Dirichlet Gro-M$^3$s to inferring the variable grouping structure
and estimating model parameters. Simulation results demonstrate good
computational performance and empirically confirm the identifiability results.
We illustrate the new methodology through applications to a functional
disability survey dataset and a personality test dataset.

the aim of overcoming the limitations of usual transformation-based cloaks in
terms of microstructure complexity and shape arbitrarity of the obstacle. This
is achieved by recasting the acoustic cloaking design as a nonlinear optimal
control problem constrained by a linear elliptic partial differential equation.
In this setting, isotropic material properties' distributions realizing the
cloak take the form of control functions and a system of first-order optimality
conditions is derived accordingly. Such isotropic media can then be obtained in
practice with simple hexagonal lattices of inclusions in water.
  For this reason, the optimization problem is directly formulated to take into
account suitable partitions of the control domain Two types of inclusions are
considered, and long-wavelength homogenization is used to define the feasible
set of material properties that is employed as a constraint in the optimization
problem. In this manner, we link the stage of material properties optimization
with that of microstructure design, aiming at finding the optimal implementable
solution. As a test benchmark, cloaking of the silhouette of a ship is
considered, for various frequencies and directions of incidence. The resulting

requires acquaintance with the cardiac anatomy and remains a challenging task
in clinical practice. Existing approaches to its automation relied either on an
additional volumetric image not typically acquired in clinic routine, or on
laborious manual annotations of cardiac structural landmarks. This work
presents a clinic-compatible and annotation-free system for automatic CMR view
planning. The system mines the spatial relationship -- more specifically,
locates and exploits the intersecting lines -- between the source and target
views, and trains deep networks to regress heatmaps defined by these
intersecting lines. As the spatial relationship is self-contained in properly
stored data, e.g., in the DICOM format, the need for manual annotation is
eliminated. Then, a multi-view planning strategy is proposed to aggregate
information from the predicted heatmaps for all the source views of a target
view, for a globally optimal prescription. The multi-view aggregation mimics
the similar strategy practiced by skilled human prescribers. Experimental
results on 181 clinical CMR exams show that our system achieves superior
accuracy to existing approaches including conventional atlas-based and newer
deep learning based ones, in prescribing four standard CMR views. The mean
angle difference and point-to-plane distance evaluated against the ground truth
planes are 5.98 degrees and 3.48 mm, respectively.

topological information of the body mesh to learn an expressive visual

most methods for measuring human driving styles require thresholds or labels to
classify the driving styles, and some require additional questionnaires for
drivers about their driving attitude. These limitations are not suitable for
creating a large virtual testing environment. Driving models (DMs) simulate
human driving styles. Calibrating a DM makes the simulated driving behavior
closer to human-driving behavior, and enable the simulation of human-driving
cars. Conventional DM-calibrating methods do not take into account that the
parameters in a DM vary while driving. These ""fixed"" calibrating methods cannot
reflect an actual interactive driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a
DM-calibration method for measuring human driving styles to reproduce real

entropy weight method for measuring and clustering human driving styles, and 2)
online adaption of DM parameters based on deep learning by combining Bayesian
optimization (BO) and a gated recurrent unit neural network. We conducted

can be easily used to measure human driver styles. The experiments also showed
that we can calibrate a corresponding DM in a virtual testing environment with

the existence of codes with the best known or even near-optimal trade-offs in
many noise models. However, they have little structure besides linearity, and
are not amenable to tractable error-correction algorithms.
  In this work, we prove a general derandomization result applicable to random
linear codes. Namely, in settings where the coding-theoretic property of
interest is ""local"" (in the sense of forbidding certain bad configurations
involving few vectors -- code distance and list-decodability being notable
examples), one can replace random linear codes (RLCs) with a significantly
derandomized variant with essentially no loss in parameters. Specifically,
instead of randomly sampling coordinates of the (long) Hadamard code (which is
an equivalent way to describe RLCs), one can randomly sample coordinates of any
code with low bias. Over large alphabets, the low bias requirement can be
weakened to just large distance. Furthermore, large distance suffices even with
a small alphabet in order to match the current best known bounds for RLC
list-decodability.
  In particular, by virtue of our result, all current (and future)
achievability bounds for list-decodability of random linear codes extend
automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet)
""mother"" code. We also show that our punctured codes emulate the behavior of
RLCs on stochastic channels, thus giving a derandomization of RLCs in the
context of achieving Shannon capacity as well. Thus, we have a
randomness-efficient way to sample codes achieving capacity in both worst-case
and stochastic settings that can further inherit algebraic or other
algorithmically useful structural properties of the mother code.

However, the computational burden of smoothing splines is significant when the
sample size $n$ is large. When the number of predictors $d\geq2$, the
computational cost for smoothing splines is at the order of $O(n^3)$ using the
standard approach. Many methods have been developed to approximate smoothing
spline estimators by using $q$ basis functions instead of $n$ ones, resulting
in a computational cost of the order $O(nq^2)$. These methods are called the
basis selection methods. Despite algorithmic benefits, most of the basis
selection methods require the assumption that the sample is
uniformly-distributed on a hyper-cube. These methods may have deteriorating
performance when such an assumption is not met. To overcome the obstacle, we
develop an efficient algorithm that is adaptive to the unknown probability
density function of the predictors. Theoretically, we show the proposed

Previous studies indicate that scoring models can be easily fooled. In this
paper, we explore the reason behind their surprising adversarial brittleness.
We utilize recent advances in interpretability to find the extent to which
features such as coherence, content, vocabulary, and relevance are important
for automated scoring mechanisms. We use this to investigate the
oversensitivity i.e., large change in output score with a little change in
input essay content) and overstability i.e., little change in output scores
with large changes in input essay content) of AES. Our results indicate that
autoscoring models, despite getting trained as ""end-to-end"" models with rich
contextual embeddings such as BERT, behave like bag-of-words models. A few
words determine the essay score without the requirement of any context making
the model largely overstable. This is in stark contrast to recent probing
studies on pre-trained representation learning models, which show that rich
linguistic features such as parts-of-speech and morphology are encoded by them.
Further, we also find that the models have learnt dataset biases, making them
oversensitive. To deal with these issues, we propose detection-based protection
models that can detect oversensitivity and overstability causing samples with
high accuracies. We find that our proposed models are able to detect unusual
attribution patterns and flag adversarial samples successfully.

(GNNs) to molecular property prediction which is a fundamental task for
computational drug and material discovery. One of major obstacles to hinder the
successful prediction of molecule property by GNNs is the scarcity of labeled
data. Though graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have achieved
extraordinary performance with insufficient labeled data, most focused on
designing data augmentation schemes for general graphs. However, the
fundamental property of a molecule could be altered with the augmentation
method (like random perturbation) on molecular graphs. Whereas, the critical
geometric information of molecules remains rarely explored under the current
GNN and GCL architectures. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive

which is named GeomGCL. Specifically, we first devise a dual-view geometric
message passing network (GeomMPNN) to adaptively leverage the rich information
of both 2D and 3D graphs of a molecule. The incorporation of geometric
properties at different levels can greatly facilitate the molecular
representation learning. Then a novel geometric graph contrastive scheme is
designed to make both geometric views collaboratively supervise each other to
improve the generalization ability of GeomMPNN. We evaluate GeomGCL on various

an Adversarial Neural Trip Recommendation (ANT) framework to tackle the above

trip generator that can learn the correlations among POIs and generate
well-designed trips under given constraints. Another novelty of ANT relies on
an adversarial learning strategy integrating with reinforcement learning to
guide the trip generator to produce high-quality trips. For this purpose, we
introduce a discriminator, which distinguishes the generated trips from
real-life trips taken by users, to provide reward signals to optimize the

variability of the magnetar radio pulsations during the observing period from

observing frequency goes higher, analogous to the general profile narrowing
behavior of ordinary pulsars. When assuming a simple power law in the range of

average spectral index $ \langle \alpha \rangle \approx -0.85$ for the first

a valley point in 22 - 150 GHz, where the first spectral peak infers a
gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) feature with a peak at a few GHz. The GPS and
the high-frequency peak have been identified in the spectra of other radio-loud

side-channel attacks exist, these often fail in practice due to unintended
interactions between values deep within the CPU. To detect and protect from
side-channel attacks, several automated tools have recently been proposed; one
of their common limitations is that they only support first-order leakage.
  In this work, we present the first automated tool for detecting and
eliminating higher-order leakage from cryptographic implementations. Rosita++
proposes statistical and software-based tools to allow high-performance
higher-order leakage detection. It then uses the code rewrite engine of Rosita
(Shelton et al. NDSS 2021) to eliminate detected leakage. For the sake of
practicality we evaluate Rosita++ against second and third order leakage, but
our framework is not restricted to only these orders.
  We evaluate Rosita++ against second-order leakage with three-share

Boolean-to-arithmetic masking, a core building block of masked implementations
of many cryptographic primitives, including SHA-2, ChaCha and Blake. We show
effective second-order leakage elimination at a performance cost of 36% for
Xoodoo, 189% for PRESENT, and 29% for the Boolean-to-arithmetic masking. For
third-order analysis, we evaluate Rosita++ against the third-order leakage

resonators are susceptible to numerous loss and noise mechanisms under
few-photon microwave excitation, especially the dissipation due to
quasi-particles and two-level systems (TLS), which can result in a decrease of
the superconducting intrinsic quality factor $(Q_i)$ in high quality
superconducting resonators. In particular, TLS losses can become the dominant
loss mechanism in the few-photon and low temperature ($T$) regime. In this
study, capacitively-coupled aluminum half-wavelength coplanar waveguide
resonators are investigated. Surprisingly, the loss of the resonators was
observed to decrease with a lowering temperature at low excitation powers and
temperatures below the TLS saturation. This behavior is attributed to the
reduction of the TLS resonant response bandwidth with decreasing temperature
and power to below the detuning between the TLS and the resonant photon
frequency in a discrete ensemble of TLS. TLS fall out of resonance when their
response bandwidths are smaller than their detunings from the resonance,
reducing the resonant response and thus lowering the loss. At higher excitation
powers, the loss followed a logarithmic power dependence, consistent with
predictions from the generalized tunneling model.

often failing even to stabilize; controllers using both types of sensors
perform extremely well, demonstrating a strong diversity-enabled sweet spot
(DESS). We demonstrate that IFPs are key in enabling this DESS, and
additionally that with IFPs removed, controllers with delayed sensing perform
poorly. The existence of strong DESS and IFP in this simple example suggest
that these are fundamental architectural features in any complex system with

Predictions are often issued on a regular basis, such as every hour, day, or
month, and their quality is monitored continuously. However, the classical
statistical tools for forecast evaluation are static, in the sense that
statistical tests for forecast calibration are only valid if the evaluation
period is fixed in advance. Recently, e-values have been introduced as a new,
dynamic method for assessing statistical significance. An e-value is a
non-negative random variable with expected value at most one under a null
hypothesis. Large e-values give evidence against the null hypothesis, and the
multiplicative inverse of an e-value is a conservative p-value. E-values are
particularly suitable for sequential forecast evaluation, since they naturally
lead to statistical tests which are valid under optional stopping. This article
proposes e-values for testing probabilistic calibration of forecasts, which is
one of the most important notions of calibration. The proposed methods are also
more generally applicable for sequential goodness-of-fit testing. We
demonstrate that the e-values are competitive in terms of power when compared
to extant methods, which do not allow sequential testing. Furthermore, they
provide important and useful insights in the evaluation of probabilistic
weather forecasts.

through different levels of the network, to dramatically reduce expensive NICs
required for the scale-out network. However, it comes at the expense of
communication overhead between distributed accelerators to exchange gradients
or input/output activation. In order to allow for further scaling of the
workloads, communication overhead needs to be minimized. In this paper, we
motivate the fact that in training platforms, adding more intermediate network
dimensions is beneficial for efficiently mitigating the excessive use of
expensive NIC resources. Further, we address different challenges of the DNN
training on hierarchical networks. We discuss when designing the interconnect,
how to distribute network bandwidth resources across different dimensions in
order to (i) maximize BW utilization of all dimensions, and (ii) minimizing the
overall training time for the target workload. We then implement a framework
that, for a given workload, determines the best network configuration that
maximizes performance, or performance-per-cost.

A particularly important class of tensor Ising models are the tensor
Curie-Weiss models, where all tuples of nodes of a particular order interact
with the same intensity. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is not explicit
in this model, due to the presence of an intractable normalizing constant in
the likelihood, and a computationally efficient alternative is to use the
maximum pseudolikelihood estimator (MPLE). In this paper, we show that the MPLE
is in fact as efficient as the MLE (in the Bahadur sense) in the $2$-spin
model, and for all values of the null parameter above $\log 2$ in higher-order
tensor models. Even if the null parameter happens to lie within the very small
window between the threshold and $\log 2$, they are equally efficient unless
the alternative parameter is large. Therefore, not only is the MPLE
computationally preferable to the MLE, but also theoretically as efficient as
the MLE over most of the parameter space. Our results extend to the more
general class of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi hypergraph Ising models, under slight

In particular, the most salient collective phenomena in brain activity are
oscillations, which require the synchronous activation of many neurons. Here,
we analyse parsimonious dynamical models of neural synchronisation running on
top of synthetic networks that capture essential aspects of the actual brain
anatomical connectivity such as a hierarchical-modular and core-periphery
structure. These models reveal the emergence of complex collective states with
intermediate and flexible levels of synchronisation, halfway in the
synchronous-asynchronous spectrum. These states are best described as broad
Griffiths-like phases, i.e. an extension of standard critical points that
emerge in structurally heterogeneous systems. We analyse different routes
(bifurcations) to synchronisation and stress the relevance of 'hybrid-type

illustrate the complex interplay between structure and dynamics, underlining
key aspects leading to rich collective states needed to sustain brain

this compactly supported continuous function is a piecewise polynomial function
involving infinitely many pieces.
  As an application, we give a closed formula for $e_{HK}(R_{p, n+1})$. More
specifically we show that, for given $n\geq 4$, there are explicit polynomials
$p_n(t), q_n(t) \in {\mathbb {Q}}[t]$ such that
  $$e_{HK}(R_{p, n+1}) = (1+m_{n+1})+ \frac{p_n(t)}{q_n(t)}\mid_{t={1/p}}\quad
p > 2^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}(n-2).$$ The same holds if $n=3$ and $p\geq 5$.
  As a result the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity $e_{HK}(R_{p,n+1})$ of a quadric
hypersurface is bounded below by $1+m_{n+1}$, where $m_{n+1}$ is the
$(n+1)^{th}$ coefficient in the expansion of $\mbox{sec}+\mbox{tan}$. This
proves a part of the long standing conjecture of Watanabe-Yoshida. We also give
an upper bound on the HK multiplicity of such a hypersurface.
  We also prove that, for $p \gg 0$, the invariant $e_{HK}(R_{p, n+1})$ is a
decreasing function of $p$, and in fact a strictly decreasing one if $n\geq 3$.
This supports another old conjecture of Yoshida, which states that
$e_{HK}(R_{p, n+1})$ is a decreasing function of $p$, for all $p$.
  One of the main tools in determining the HK density function is the

Although a few studies investigate the dynamics involved in the dual sides, the

over the unknown problem parameters -- the rewards and transitions -- is
assumed, and a policy that optimizes the (posterior) expected return is sought.
A common approximation, which has been recently popularized as meta-RL, is to
train the agent on a sample of $N$ problem instances from the prior, with the
hope that for large enough $N$, good generalization behavior to an unseen test
instance will be obtained. In this work, we study generalization in Bayesian RL
under the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework, using the method of
algorithmic stability. Our main contribution is showing that by adding
regularization, the optimal policy becomes stable in an appropriate sense. Most
stability results in the literature build on strong convexity of the
regularized loss -- an approach that is not suitable for RL as Markov decision
processes (MDPs) are not convex. Instead, building on recent results of fast
convergence rates for mirror descent in regularized MDPs, we show that
regularized MDPs satisfy a certain quadratic growth criterion, which is
sufficient to establish stability. This result, which may be of independent
interest, allows us to study the effect of regularization on generalization in
the Bayesian RL setting.

abound in a variety of fields such as finance, genome associations analysis and

consistent estimate of the varying neighborhood size for each variable. The
existing literature on banded covariance matrix estimation, which assumes a

derived which are nearly or exactly minimax optimal, and our procedure leads to
consistent estimates of the neighborhood size for all the variables. Another

and relations. Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on
extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a
trained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r,
t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works
focus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us
how to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited
explanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the
important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt
to study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to
unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability?
For the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and
from relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic
Evidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important
semantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs
through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods. For the problem
2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based
KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In
SE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor
pattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which
contributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation. Finally,
through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that
SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task

3D simulators for large-scale training of robots on massive amounts of data.
But once robots are deployed in the real world, the simulation gap, as well as
changes in the real world (e.g. lights, objects displacements) lead to errors.
In this paper, we introduce Sim2RealViz, a visual analytics tool to assist
experts in understanding and reducing this gap for robot ego-pose estimation
tasks, i.e. the estimation of a robot's position using trained models.
Sim2RealViz displays details of a given model and the performance of its
instances in both simulation and real-world. Experts can identify environment
differences that impact model predictions at a given location and explore
through direct interactions with the model hypothesis to fix it. We detail the
design of the tool, and case studies related to the exploit of the regression
to the mean bias and how it can be addressed, and how models are perturbed by
the vanish of landmarks such as bikes.

important but challenging. Previous approaches, based on session types, have
been intensively investigated over the past decade. They provide a concise way
to express protocol specifications and a lightweight approach for checking
their implementation. Current solutions are based on only implicit
synchronization, and are based on the less precise types rather than logical
formulae. In this paper, we propose a more expressive session logic to capture
multiparty protocols. By using two kinds of ordering constraints, namely
""happens-before"" <HB and ""communicates-before"" <CB, we show how to ensure from
first principle race-freedom over common channels. Our approach refines each
specification with both assumptions and proof obligations to ensure compliance
to some global protocol. Each specification is then projected for each party
and then each channel, to allow cooperative proving through localized automated
verification. Our primary goal in automated verification is to ensure
race-freedom and communication-safety, but the approach is extensible for
deadlock-freedom as well. We shall also describe how modular protocols can be
captured and handled by our approach.

motivated a significant amount of research under the broad umbrella of
adversarial machine learning. Sophisticated attacks may cause learning
algorithms to learn decision functions or make decisions with poor predictive
performance. In this context, there is a growing body of literature that uses
local intrinsic dimensionality (LID), a local metric that describes the minimum
number of latent variables required to describe each data point, for detecting
adversarial samples and subsequently mitigating their effects. The research to
date has tended to focus on using LID as a practical defence method often
without fully explaining why LID can detect adversarial samples. In this paper,
we derive a lower-bound and an upper-bound for the LID value of a perturbed
data point and demonstrate that the bounds, in particular the lower-bound, has
a positive correlation with the magnitude of the perturbation. Hence, we
demonstrate that data points that are perturbed by a large amount would have
large LID values compared to unperturbed samples, thus justifying its use in
the prior literature. Furthermore, our empirical validation demonstrates the
validity of the bounds on benchmark datasets.

points at a relative distance of 30-35 km along an oil pipeline (100 km length,
16 inch diameter pipes) located in Northern Italy. In order to speed up the
activity and to check the operation logs, a tool has been implemented to
automatically highlight the historical pig operations performed on the line.
Such a tool is capable of detecting, in the observed pressure measurements, the
acoustic noise generated by the travelling pig. All the data sets have been
reanalyzed and exploited by using field data validations to guide a decision
tree regressor (DTR). Several statistical indicators, computed from pressure
head loss between line segments, are fed to the DTR, which automatically
outputs probability values indicating the possible need for pigging the
pipeline. The procedure is applied to the vibroacoustic signals of each pair of
consecutive monitoring stations, such that the proposed predictive maintenance
strategy is capable of tracking the conditions of individual pipeline sections,
thus determining which portion of the conduit is subject to the highest
occlusion levels in order to optimize the clean-up operations. Prediction
accuracy is assessed by evaluating the typical metrics used in statistical
analysis of regression problems, such as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

as their key performance indicators. Current approaches for model-based
engineering do not inherently support these aspects.
  We present a novel model-based approach treating those aspects as first-class

in the transmit and receive paths of multiple sequences for estimating a mean
medium SoS. We use images from diverging waves beamformed with an assumed SoS,
and propose a model fitting method for estimating the SoS offset. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for tomographic SoS
reconstruction. With corrected beamforming SoS, the reconstruction accuracy on
simulated data was improved by 63% and 29%, respectively, for an initial SoS
over- and under-estimation of 1.5%. We further demonstrate our proposed method
on a breast phantom, indicating substantial improvement in contrast-to-noise
ratio for local SoS mapping.

of a sample of T Tauri's disks to better understand their morphology and
composition. We extended our homogeneous data set of 27 Herbig stars and
collected near-IR K-band observations of 17 T Tauri stars, spanning effective
temperatures and luminosities in the ranges of ~4000-6000 K and ~0.4-10 Lsun.
We focus on the continuum emission and develop semi-physical geometrical models
to fit the interferometric data and search for trends between the properties of
the disk and the central star. The best-fit models of the disk's inner rim
correspond to wide rings. We extend the Radius-luminosity relation toward the
smallest luminosities (0.4-10 Lsun) and find the R~L^(1/2) trend is no longer
valid, since the K-band sizes measured with GRAVITY are larger than the
predicted sizes from sublimation radius computation. No clear correlation
between the K-band half-flux radius and the mass accretion rate is seen. Having
magnetic truncation radii in agreement with the K-band GRAVITY sizes would
require magnetic fields as strong as a few kG, which should have been detected,
suggesting that accretion is not the main process governing the location of the
half-flux radius of the inner dusty disk. Our measurements agree with models
that take into account the scattered light. The N-to-K band size ratio may be a
proxy for disentangling disks with silicate features in emission from disks
with weak and/or in absorption silicate features. When comparing inclinations
and PA of the inner disks to those of the outer disks (ALMA) in nine objects of

PDMPs to real world scenarios is currently limited by the fact that these

can be simulated exactly. In order to overcome this problem, we introduce
discretisation schemes for PDMPs which make their approximate simulation
possible. In particular, we design both first order and higher order schemes
that rely on approximations of one or more of the three characteristics. For
the proposed approximation schemes we study both pathwise convergence to the
continuous PDMP as the step size converges to zero and convergence in law to
the invariant measure of the PDMP in the long time limit. Moreover, we apply
our theoretical results to several PDMPs that arise from the computational
statistics and mathematical biology literature.

Portuguese health authorities are currently using some decision analysis-like
techniques to assess the impact of this pandemic and implementing measures for
each county, region, or the whole country. Such decision tools led to some
criticism and many stakeholders asked for novel approaches, in particular those
having in consideration dynamical changes in the pandemic behavior arising,
e.g., from new virus variants or vaccines. A multidisciplinary team formed by
researchers of the Covid-19 Committee of Instituto Superior T\'ecnico at
Universidade de Lisboa (CCIST analysts team) and medical doctors from the
Crisis Office of the Portuguese Medical Association (GCOM experts team)
gathered efforts and worked together in order to propose a new tool to help

presents the main steps and elements, which led to the construction of a
pandemic impact assessment composite indicator, applied to the particular case
of {\sc{Covid-19}} in Portugal. A multiple criteria approach based on an
additive multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) aggregation model was used to
construct the pandemic assessment composite indicator (PACI). The parameters of
the additive model were built through a sociotechnical co-constructive

in the poor generalization ability of classifiers. To address this dilemma, we

backbone model. 1) A k-beta augmentation, an essential component of DECRA, is
proposed to enhance the diversity in generating constrained data. It expands
the changing scope and improves the degree of complexity of the generated data.
2) A masked language model loss, instead of fine-tuning, is used as a
regularization. It relaxes constraints so that the classifier can be trained
with more scattered generated data. The combination of these two components
generates data that can reach or approach category boundaries and hence help
the classifier generalize better. We evaluate our DECRA on three public

practical applications. In this letter, we present the first preparation of
B20-MnSi on Si(100) substrates. It is realized by sub-second solid-state
reaction between Mn and Si via flash-lamp annealing at ambient pressure. The
regrown layer shows an enhanced Curie temperature of 43 K compared with bulk
B20-MnSi. The magnetic skyrmion signature is proved in our films by magnetic
and transport measurements. The millisecond-range flash annealing provides a
promising avenue for the fabrication of Si-based skyrmionic devices.

essential physiological processes, and is observed even in tissues where
specialized pacemaker cells have not been identified. The emergence of periodic
oscillations in diffusively coupled assemblies of excitable and electrically
passive cells (which are individually incapable of sustaining autonomous
activity) has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying such phenomena.
In this paper we investigate the dynamics of such assemblies in more detail by
considering simple motifs of coupled electrically active and passive cells. The
resulting behavior encompasses a wide range of dynamical phenomena, including
chaos. However, embedding such assemblies in a lattice yields spatio-temporal
patterns that either correspond to a quiescent state or partial/globally
synchronized oscillations. The resulting reduction in dynamical complexity
suggests an emergent simplicity in the collective dynamics of such large,
spatially extended systems. Furthermore, we show that such patterns can be
reproduced by a reduced model comprising only excitatory and oscillatory
elements. Our results suggest a generalization of the mechanism by which
periodic activity can emerge in a heterogeneous system comprising
non-oscillatory elements by coupling them diffusively, provided their steady
states in isolation are sufficiently dissimilar.

great success in image processing tasks. However, commonly used poolings in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as max-pooling, average-pooling, and
strided-convolution, are not shift-equivalent. Thus, the shift-equivalence of
CNNs is destroyed when convolutions and poolings are stacked. Moreover,
anti-aliasing is another essential property of poolings from the perspective of
signal processing. However, recent poolings are neither shift-equivalent nor
anti-aliasing. To address this issue, we propose a new pooling method that is
shift-equivalent and anti-aliasing, named frequency pooling. Frequency pooling
first transforms the features into the frequency domain, and then removes the
frequency components beyond the Nyquist frequency. Finally, it transforms the
features back to the spatial domain. We prove that frequency pooling is
shift-equivalent and anti-aliasing based on the property of Fourier transform
and Nyquist frequency. Experiments on image classification show that frequency
pooling improves accuracy and robustness with respect to the shifts of CNNs.

steady-state spherical models does not vary strongly with the anisotropy
profile, and that it is hence mainly determined by the density distribution of
the model. We explore this similarity in more detail. Through a worked example
and a simple proof, we show that the mean binding energy per unit mass
$\langle{\cal{E}}\rangle$, or equivalently the total integrated binding energy
$B_{\text{tot}} = M\langle{\cal{E}}\rangle$, is independent of the orbital
structure, not only for spherical models but for any steady-state dynamical
model. Only the higher-order moments of the differential energy distribution
depend on the details of the orbital structure. We show that the standard
deviation of the differential energy distribution of spherical dynamical models
varies systematically with the anisotropy profile: radially anisotropic models
tend to prefer more average binding energies, whereas models with a more
tangential orbital distribution slightly favour more extreme binding energies.
Finally, we find that the total integrated binding energy supplements the
well-known trio consisting of total kinetic energy, total potential energy, and
total energy on an equal footing. Knowledge of any one out of these four
energies suffices to calculate the other three.

predicting the growth of large-scale structure in the Universe. However, to
date there have been relatively few direct comparisons of the halo model with
more accurate (but much more computationally expensive) cosmological
simulations. We test the accuracy of the halo model in reproducing the
non-linear matter power spectrum, P(k), when the main inputs of the halo model
(specifically the matter density profiles, halo mass function, and linear bias)
are taken directly from the BAHAMAS simulations and we assess how well the halo
model reproduces P(k) from the same simulations. We show that the halo model
generally reproduces P(k) in the deep non-linear regime (1-halo) to typically a
few percent accuracy, but struggles to reproduce (approx. 15% error) P(k) at
intermediate scales of 0.1 < k [h/ Mpc] < 3 at z=0, marking the transition
between the 1-halo and 2-halo terms. We show that the magnitude of this error
is a strong function of the halo mass definition (through its effects on radial
extent of haloes) and of redshift. Furthermore, we test the accuracy of the
halo model in recovering the relative impact of baryons on P(k). We show that
the systematic errors in recovering the absolute P(k) largely cancel when
considering the relative impact of baryons. This suggests that the halo model
can make precise predictions for the baryonic suppression, offering a fast and

robots only up to a constant distance denoted as the viewing range. The robots
operate in discrete rounds that are either fully synchronous (FSync) or
semi-synchronized (SSync). Most previously studied formation problems in this
setting seek to bring the robots closer together (e.g., Gathering or
Chain-Formation). In this work, we introduce the Max-Line-Formation problem,
which has a contrary goal: to arrange the robots on a straight line of maximal
length. First, we prove that the problem is impossible to solve by robots with
a constant sized circular viewing range. The impossibility holds under
comparably strong assumptions: robots that agree on both axes of their local
coordinate systems in FSync. On the positive side, we show that the problem is
solvable by robots with a constant square viewing range, i.e., the robots can
observe other robots that lie within a constant-sized square centered at their
position. In this case, the robots need to agree on only one axis of their
local coordinate systems. We derive two algorithms: the first algorithm
considers oblivious robots and converges to the optimal configuration in time
$\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot \log (n/\varepsilon))$ under the SSync scheduler. The
other algorithm makes use of locally visible lights (LUMI). It is designed for
the FSync scheduler and can solve the problem exactly in optimal time
$\Theta(n)$. Afterward, we show that both the algorithmic and the analysis
techniques can also be applied to the Gathering and Chain-Formation problem: we
introduce an algorithm with a reduced viewing range for Gathering and give new
and improved runtime bounds for the Chain-Formation problem.

improvement phases are simultaneously performed by minimizing the
$f$-divergence between the learning policy and sampling policy, which is
distinct from conventional DRL algorithms that aim to maximize the expected

can make the learning policy converge to the optimal policy. Besides, we
convert the process of training agents in FRL framework to a saddle-point
optimization problem with a specific $f$ function through Fenchel conjugate,
which forms new methods for policy evaluation and policy improvement. Through
mathematical proofs and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the FRL
framework has two advantages: (1) policy evaluation and policy improvement
processes are performed simultaneously and (2) the issues of overestimating
value function are naturally alleviated. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
FRL framework, we conduct experiments on Atari 2600 video games and show that

phase, characterized by arcade-like, post-flare loops (PFLs) visible in many
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands. These coronal loops are filled with hot --
$\sim 30 \,\mathrm{MK}$ -- and dense plasma, evaporated from the chromosphere
during the impulsive phase of the flare, and they very gradually recover to
normal coronal density and temperature conditions. During this gradual cooling
down to $\sim 1 \,\mathrm{MK}$ regimes, much cooler -- $\sim 0.01
\,\mathrm{MK}$ -- and denser coronal rain is frequently observed inside PFLs.
Understanding PFL dynamics in this long-duration, gradual phase is crucial to
the entire corona-chromosphere mass and energy cycle. Here we report a
simulation in which a solar flare evolves from pre-flare, over impulsive phase
all the way into its gradual phase, which successfully reproduces post-flare
coronal rain. This rain results from catastrophic cooling caused by thermal
instability, and we analyse the entire mass and energy budget evolution driving
this sudden condensation phenomenon. We find that the runaway cooling and rain
formation also induces the appearance of dark post-flare loop systems, as
observed in EUV channels. We confirm and augment earlier observational
findings, suggesting that thermal conduction and radiative losses alternately
dominate the cooling of PFLs.

noise is considered in this paper. Since in practice no a priori information on
noise is available, noise statistics should be pre-estimated for image
denoising. In this paper, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based method
for estimation of a map of local, patch-wise, standard deviations of noise
(so-called sigma-map) is proposed. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance
in accuracy of estimation of sigma-map for the case of non-stationary noise, as
well as estimation of noise variance for the case of additive white Gaussian
noise. Extensive experiments on image denoising using estimated sigma-maps
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent CNN-based blind image denoising
methods by up to 6 dB in PSNR, as well as other state-of-the-art methods based
on sigma-map estimation by up to 0.5 dB, providing same time better usage
flexibility. Comparison with the ideal case, when denoising is applied using
ground-truth sigma-map, shows that a difference of corresponding PSNR values
for most of noise levels is within 0.1-0.2 dB and does not exceeds 0.6 dB.

few-layer-thick MoSe2 is measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry. An
increase in the electron concentration with increasing Cl fluence is determined
from the softening and red shift of the Raman-active A_1g phonon mode due to
the Fano effect. The electrical measurements confirm the n-type doping of

is fundamentally different from the dependence for pulsars. A comparative

extragalactic occurrence of fast radio bursts and an almost uniform

whether close binary systems form by the effect of magnetic braking. Using
magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we calculate the cloud evolution with a sink,
for which we do not resolve the binary system or binary orbital motion to
realize long-term time integration. Then, we analytically estimate the binary
separation using the accreted mass and angular momentum obtained from the
simulation. In unmagnetized clouds, wide binary systems with separations of
>100 au form, in which the binary separation continues to increase during the
main accretion phase. In contrast, close binary systems with separations of
<100 au can form in magnetized clouds. Since the efficiency of magnetic braking
strongly depends on both the strength and configuration of the magnetic field,
they also affect the formation conditions of a close binary. In addition, the
protostellar outflow has a negative impact on close binary formation,
especially when the rotation axis of the prestellar cloud is aligned with the
global magnetic field. The outflow interrupts the accretion of gas with small
angular momentum, which is expelled from the cloud, while gas with large
angular momentum preferentially falls from the side of the outflow onto the
binary system and widens the binary separation. This study shows that a cloud
with a magnetic field that is not parallel to the rotation axis is a favorable
environment for the formation of close binary systems.

have been adopted extensively to supply demands when the main utility
experiences blackouts. However, the stochastic nature of renewables and
unpredictable contingencies are difficult to address with the deterministic
energy management framework. The paper proposes a comprehensive
distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DR-JCC) framework that
incorporates microgrid island, power flow, distributed batteries and voltage
control constraints. All chance constraints are solved jointly and each one is
assigned to an optimized violation rate. To highlight, the JCC problem with the
optimized violation rates has been recognized to be NP-hard and challenging to
be solved. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm that successfully
tackles the problem and reduces the solution conservativeness (i.e. operation
cost) by around 50% comparing with the baseline Bonferroni Approximation.
Considering the imperfect solar power forecast, we construct three data-driven
ambiguity sets to model uncertain forecast error distributions. The solution is
thus robust for any distribution in sets with the shared moment and shape
assumptions. The proposed method is validated by robustness tests based on
those sets and firmly secures the solution robustness.

(TURs) we derive novel upper bounds on the nonlinear response of an observable

relaxations of these bounds allow to recover well known bounds such as
(strengthenings of) Cramer-Rao's and Pinsker's inequalities. In particular we
obtain a master inequality, named Symmetric Response Intensity Relation, which
recovers several TURs as particular cases. We employ this set of bounds for
three physical applications. First, we derive a trade-off between thermodynamic
cost (dissipated free energy) and reliability of systems switching instantly
between two states, such as one-bit memories. We derive in particular a lower
bound of $2.8 k_BT$ per Shannon bit to write a bit in such a memory, a bound
distinct from Landauer's one. Second, we obtain a new family of classic speed
limits which provide lower bounds for non-autonomous Markov processes on the
time needed to transition between two probabilistic states in terms of a
thermodynamic quantity (e.g. non-equilibrium free energy) and a kinetic
quantity (e.g. dynamical activity). Third, we provide an upper bound on the
nonlinear response of a system based solely on the `complexity' of the system
(which we relate to a high entropy and non-uniformity of the probabilities). We
find that `complex' models (e.g. with many states) are necessarily fragile to
some perturbations, while simple systems are robust, in that they display a low
response to arbitrary perturbations.

solution. Recent literature results showed that the usage of enstrophy (the
volume integral of the vorticity) instead of the kinetic energy as the norm of
perturbations predicts higher Reynolds numbers in the two-dimensional case. Its
usage in three dimensions is discussed in the paper. In addition, other
research showed an improvement of the original Reynolds-Orr energy equation
using the weighted norm in a tilted coordinate system. Here, these two methods
are combined. The zero enstrophy growth constraint is applied to the classical
Reynolds-Orr equation, and then the solution is further refined in the tilted

Data taken with the atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and
VERITAS at energies above 350 GeV were used together with observations at X-ray
energies obtained with Swift-XRT, Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Suzaku. Some
of these observations were accompanied by measurements of the H{\alpha}
emission line. A significant detection of the modulation of the VHE gamma-ray
fluxes with a period of 316.7+-4.4 days is reported, consistent with the period
of 317.3+-0.7 days obtained with a refined analysis of X-ray data. The analysis
of data of four orbital cycles with dense observational coverage reveals short
timescale variability, with flux-decay timescales of less than 20 days at very
high energies. Flux variations observed over the time scale of several years
indicate orbit-to-orbit variability. The analysis confirms the previously
reported correlation of X-ray and gamma-ray emission from the system at very
high significance, but can not find any correlation of optical H{\alpha}
parameters with X-ray or gamma-ray energy fluxes in simultaneous observations.
The key finding is that the emission of HESS J0632+057 in the X-ray and
gamma-ray energy bands is highly variable on different time scales. The ratio
of gamma-ray to X-ray flux shows the equality or even dominance of the
gamma-ray energy range. This wealth of new data is interpreted taking into
account the insufficient knowledge of the ephemeris of the system, and
discussed in the context of results reported on other gamma-ray binary systems.

the clustering-based domain decomposition to evolve dynamically throughout the
problem solution, ensuring optimum refinement in regions where the relevant
fields present steeper gradients. It offers a new route to fast and accurate
material modeling of history-dependent nonlinear problems involving highly
localized plasticity and damage phenomena. The overall approach is composed of
three main building blocks: target clusters selection criterion, adaptive
cluster analysis, and computation of cluster interaction tensors. In addition,
an adaptive clustering solution rewinding procedure and a dynamic adaptivity
split factor strategy are suggested to further enhance the adaptive process.
The coined Adaptive Self-Consistent Clustering Analysis (ASCA) is shown to
perform better than its static counterpart when capturing the multi-scale
elasto-plastic behavior of a particle-matrix composite and predicting the
associated fracture and toughness. Given the encouraging results shown in this
paper, the ACROM framework sets the stage and opens new avenues to explore
adaptivity in the context of CROMs.

  TR-MRC and Windowing","Accepted by WCNC 2022",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as an
effective waveform to tackle the linear time-varying channels. In OTFS
literature, approximately constant channel gains for every group of samples
within each OTFS block are assumed. This leads to limitations for OTFS on the
maximum Doppler frequency that it can tolerate. Additionally, presence of
cyclic prefix (CP) in OTFS signal limits the flexibility in adjusting its
parameters to improve its robustness against channel time variations.
Therefore, in this paper, we study the possibility of removing the CP overhead
from OTFS and breaking its Doppler limitations through multiple antenna
processing in the large antenna regime. We asymptotically analyze the
performance of time-reversal maximum ratio combining (TR-MRC) for OTFS without
CP. We show that doubly dispersive channel effects average out in the large
antenna regime when the maximum Doppler shift is within OTFS limitations.
However, for considerably large Doppler shifts exceeding OTFS limitations, a
residual Doppler effect remains. Our asymptotic derivations reveal that this
effect converges to scaling of the received symbols in delay dimension with the
samples of a Bessel function that depends on the maximum Doppler shift. Hence,
we propose a novel residual Doppler correction (RDC) windowing technique that
can break the Doppler limitations of OTFS and lead to a performance close to
that of the linear time-invariant channels. Finally, we confirm the validity of
our claims through simulations.

task in session-based recommendation (SBR).Multi-behavior session
recommendation considers session sequence with multiple interaction types, such
as click and purchase, to capture more effective user intention representation
sufficiently.Despite the superior performance of existing multi-behavior based
methods for SBR, there are still several severe limitations:(i) Almost all
existing works concentrate on single target type of next behavior and fail to
model multiplex behavior sessions uniformly.(ii) Previous methods also ignore
the semantic relations between various next behavior and historical behavior
sequence, which are significant signals to obtain current latent intention for
SBR.(iii) The global cross-session item-item graph established by some existing
models may incorporate semantics and context level noise for multi-behavior
session-based recommendation. To overcome the limitations (i) and (ii), we
propose two novel tasks for SBR, which require the incorporation of both
historical behaviors and next behaviors into unified multi-behavior
recommendation modeling. To this end, we design a Multi-behavior Graph
Contextual Aware Network (MGCNet) for multi-behavior session-based
recommendation for the two proposed tasks. Specifically, we build a
multi-behavior global item transition graph based on all sessions involving all
interaction types. Based on the global graph, MGCNet attaches the global
interest representation to final item representation based on local contextual
intention to address the limitation (iii). In the end, we utilize the next
behavior information explicitly to guide the learning of general interest and
current intention for SBR. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show
that MGCNet can outperform state-of-the-art models for multi-behavior

state evolution equations, adaptable to new AMP iterations without reproducing
each time the full argument ? We propose an answer to both questions, showing
that AMP instances can be generically indexed by an oriented graph. This
enables to give a unified interpretation of these iterations, independent from

that all AMP iterations indexed by such a graph admit rigorous SE equations,
extending the reach of previous proofs, and proving a number of recent
heuristic derivations of those equations. Our proof naturally includes
non-separable functions and we show how existing refinements, such as spatial

arouses increasing interest in seismology, acoustics, optics and
electromagnetism. Assuming the equipartition of the noise field, the
cross-correlation function measured with non-invasive receiving probes
converges towards the difference of the causal and anti-causal Green's
functions. Here, we consider the case when the receiving field probes are
antennas which are well coupled to a complex medium -- a scenario of practical
relevance in electromagnetism. We propose a general approach based on the
scattering matrix formalism to explore the convergence of the cross-correlation

confirmed in microwave measurements within a mode-stirred reverberation
chamber. This study provides new fundamental insights into the Green's function

superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is an outstanding puzzle in condensed matter
physics. Despite the tremendous efforts made in the past twenty-seven years,
neither the pairing symmetry nor the underlying pairing mechanism in this
material has been understood with clear consensus. This is largely due to the
lack of a superconducting order that is capable of interpreting in a coherent
manner the numerous essential experimental observations. At this stage, it may
be desirable to reexamine the existing theoretical descriptions of
superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. This review focuses on several recent
developments that may provide some clues for future study. We highlight three
separate aspects: 1) any pairing in the $E_u$ symmetry channel, with which the
widely discussed chiral p-wave is associated, shall acquire a 3D structure due
to spin-orbit entanglement; 2) if the reported Kerr effect is a
superconductivity-induced intrinsic bulk response, the superconductivity must
either exhibit a chiral character, or be complex mixtures of certain set of
helical p-wave pairings; 3) when expressed in a multiorbital basis, the Cooper
pairing could acquire numerous exotic forms that are inaccessible in
single-orbital descriptions. The implications of each of these new perspectives
are briefly discussed in connection with selected experimental phenomena.

to average the observed surface-densities along a section of the filament, or
even along its whole length, before fitting the profile. We show that, if
filaments do indeed have intrinsic Plummer profiles with exponent p_INTRINSIC,

secondarily a range of Sigma_B values), the value of the Plummer exponent,

In this paper, we introduce a purely vision-based navigation scheme that is
able to reliably guide the robot through row-crop fields without manual
intervention. Independent of any global localization or mapping, this approach
is able to accurately follow the crop-rows and switch between the rows, only
using onboard cameras. With the help of a novel crop-row detection and a novel
crop-row switching technique, our navigation scheme can be deployed in a wide
range of fields with different canopy types in various growth stages with
limited parameter tuning, creating a crop agnostic navigation approach. We have
extensively evaluated our approach in three different fields under various
illumination conditions using our agricultural robotic platform (BonnBot-I).
For navigation, our approach is evaluated on five crop types and achieves an
average navigation accuracy of 3.82cm relative to manual teleoperation.

landmarks on dental mesh models are essential in computer-aided orthodontic
treatment. Manually performing these two tasks is time-consuming, tedious, and,
more importantly, highly dependent on orthodontists' experiences due to the
abnormality and large-scale variance of patients' teeth. Some machine
learning-based methods have been designed and applied in the orthodontic field
to automatically segment dental meshes (e.g., intraoral scans). In contrast,
the number of studies on tooth landmark localization is still limited. This
paper proposes a two-stage framework based on mesh deep learning (called
TS-MDL) for joint tooth labeling and landmark identification on raw intraoral
scans. Our TS-MDL first adopts an end-to-end \emph{i}MeshSegNet method (i.e., a
variant of the existing MeshSegNet with both improved accuracy and efficiency)
to label each tooth on the downsampled scan. Guided by the segmentation
outputs, our TS-MDL further selects each tooth's region of interest (ROI) on
the original mesh to construct a light-weight variant of the pioneering
PointNet (i.e., PointNet-Reg) for regressing the corresponding landmark
heatmaps. Our TS-MDL was evaluated on a real-clinical dataset, showing
promising segmentation and localization performance. Specifically,
\emph{i}MeshSegNet in the first stage of TS-MDL reached an averaged Dice
similarity coefficient (DSC) at \textcolor[rgb]{0,0,0}{$0.964\pm0.054$},
significantly outperforming the original MeshSegNet. In the second stage,
PointNet-Reg achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of $0.597\pm0.761 \, mm$ in
distances between the prediction and ground truth for $66$ landmarks, which is
superior compared with other networks for landmark detection. All these results
suggest the potential usage of our TS-MDL in orthodontics.

constrain the mass of exoplanets detected by microlensing, and to precisely
measure the mass of distant isolated objects such as stars, brown dwarfs and
stellar remnants like white dwarfs, neutron stars or stellar black holes.
Having accurate models and reliable numerical methods is of particular

the near future. In this work, we discuss the different approaches to
calculating the fringe complex visibility for the important case of a single

and introduce a novel approximation, that we call `thin-arcs approximation',
which applies over a wide range of lens-source separations. We find that this
approximation runs $\times6$ to $\times10$ times faster than the exact

accuracy. This approximation provides accurate results for microlensing events

low-energy effective description of either superstring theory or M-theory: the
six-dimensional theory of Romans, and the maximal supergravity in seven
dimensions. We compactify on an $S^{1}$ and $T^{2}$, respectively, to obtain 5D
sigma-models coupled to gravity, and spectra of bosonic excitations are
computed numerically by fluctuating fields on backgrounds which holographically
realise confinement. We propose a method to detect mixing effects between
scalar resonances and the pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone boson associated with
spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance: the dilaton. This test consists
of neglecting a key component of the spin-0 fluctuation variables, effectively
disregarding their back-reaction on the underlying geometry; where
discrepancies arise compared to the proper calculation we infer dilaton mixing.
In both cases this analysis evinces a parametrically light dilaton. For each
theory we also uncover a tachyonic instability within their parameter space. We
hence proceed to investigate their respective phase structures, reasoning that
some mechanism must render the instabilities physically inaccessible. We
compile a catalogue of geometrically distinct backgrounds within each theory,
and derive general expressions for their holographically renormalised free
energy $F$. Another numerical routine is used to systematically extract data
for some special deformation parameters, and $F$ is plotted in units of an
appropriate universal scale. Our analysis proves fruitful: each theory shows
evidence of a first-order phase transition which induces the spontaneous
decompactification of the shrinking dimension before the instability manifests,
favouring instead a branch of singular solutions. The light dilaton resonance
appears only along a metastable portion of the branch of confining backgrounds.

Geant4 simulation of the detector which models both the interactions of the

It also facilitated a previously inaccessible understanding of the systematic

The simulation-based method was also compared to well-established numerical
prescriptions for locating the Compton edges. Ultimately, the simulation
predicted as much as 17% lower light-yield calibrations than the prescriptions.
These calibrations indicate that approximately 35% of the scintillation light

decentralisation of services towards the edge, it is likely that a significant
share of data generated by IoT devices will be needed by other (mobile) nodes
nearby, while global Internet access will be limited only to a small fraction
of data. In this context, opportunistic networking schemes can be adopted to
build efficient content-centric protocols, through which data generated by IoT
devices (or by mobile nodes themselves) can be accessed by the other nodes
nearby. In this paper, we propose MobCCN, which is an ICN-compliant protocol
for this heterogeneous environment. MobCCN is designed to implement the routing
and forwarding mechanisms of the main ICN realisations, such as CCN. The
original aspect of MobCCN is to implement an efficient opportunistic networking
routing scheme to populate the Forwarding Interest Base (FIB) tables of the
nodes, in order to guide the propagation of Interest packets towards nodes that
store the required data. Specifically, MobCCN defines the utility of each node
as a forwarder of Interest packets for a certain type of content, such that
Interest packets can be propagated along a positive utility gradient, until
reaching some node storing the data. We evaluate MobCCN against protocols
representing two possible endpoints of the spectrum, respectively in terms of
minimising the data delivery delay and the resource consumption. Performance
results show that MobCCN is very effective and efficient, as it guarantees very
high delivery rates and low delays, while keeping the total generated traffic
at a reasonable level and also saving local resources.

NestedSampler, our general-purpose implementation of the nested sampling
algorithm.
  Nested sampling is a novel way to perform Bayesian calculations. It can be
applied to inference problems, that consist of a parameterized model to fit
measured data to. NestedSampler calculates the Bayesian evidence as the numeric
integral over the posterior probability of (hyper)parameters of the problem.
The solution in terms of the parameters is obtained as a set of weighted
samples drawn from the posterior.
  In this paper, we emphasize nested sampling and all classes that are directly
connected to it. Additionally, we present the fitters, which fit the data by
the least-squares method or the maximum likelihood method. They can also

an aperture phased array located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory
(MRO) site in Western Australia. It will be composed of 512 stations, each of
them consisting of 256 log-periodic dual polarized antennas, and will operate
in the low frequency range (50 MHz - 350 MHz) of the SKA bandwidth. The
Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2), operational since late 2019, is
the last full-size engineering prototype station deployed at the MRO site
before the start of the SKA1-Low construction phase. The aim of this paper is
to characterize the station performance through commissioning observations at
six different frequencies (55, 70, 110, 160, 230 and 320 MHz) collected during
its first year of activities. We describe the calibration procedure, present
the resulting all-sky images and their analysis, and discuss the station
calibratability and system stability. Using the difference imaging method, we
also derive estimates of the SKA1-Low sensitivity for the same frequencies, and
compare them to those obtained through electromagnetic simulations across the
entire telescope bandwidth, finding good agreement (within $\leq 13%$).
Moreover, our estimates exceed the SKA1-Low requirements at all the considered
frequencies, by up to a factor of $\sim$2.3. Our results are very promising and
allow an initial validation of the AAVS2 prototype station performance, which
is an important step towards the upcoming SKA-Low telescope construction and
science.

single-component blackbody model, while the SEDs of OGLE-2012-SN-006 cannot. We
invoke the double-component model assuming that the SEDs were produced by the
SN photosphere and the heated dust to fit the optical$-$NIR SEDs of the four
SNe Ibn, finding that the derived temperatures of the dust associated with
OGLE-2012-SN-006 favor the scenario that the dust consists of the graphite
grains, and the mass and temperature of dust are
$\sim$$0.5-2.0\times10^{-3}~M_\odot$ and $\sim$ $1200-1300$ K, respectively.
Moreover, our fits for SN~2010al, LSQ13ddu, and SN~2015G show that the upper
limits of the masses of the dust associated with the three SNe Ibn are
respectively $1.45\times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$, $5.9\times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$, and
$2.4\times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$. A further analysis demonstrates that the inferred
radius of the dust shell surrounding OGLE-2012-SN-006 is significantly larger
than that of the SN ejecta at early epochs, indicating that the NIR excesses of
the SEDs of OGLE-2012-SN-006 were produced by a preexisting dust shell. Our

observed at their true value, but rather at a value that is known to fall above
or below that truth. While much attention has been given to the analysis of
censored outcomes, contemporary focus has shifted to censored covariates, as
well. Missing data is often overcome using multiple imputation, which leverages
the entire dataset by replacing missing values with informed placeholders, and
this method can be modified for censored data by also incorporating partial
information from censored values. One such modification involves replacing
censored covariates with their conditional means given other fully observed
information, such as the censored value or additional covariates. So-called
conditional mean imputation approaches were proposed for censored covariates in
Atem et al. [2017], Atem et al.[2019a], and Atem et al. [2019b]. These methods
are robust to additional parametric assumptions on the censored covariate and
utilize all available data, which is appealing. As we worked to implement these
methods, however, we discovered that these three manuscripts provide
nonequivalent formulas and, in fact, none is the correct formula for the
conditional mean. Herein, we derive the correct form of the conditional mean
and demonstrate the impact of the incorrect formulas on the imputed values and
statistical inference. Under several settings considered, using an incorrect
formula is seen to seriously bias parameter estimation in simple linear
regression. Lastly, we provide user-friendly R software, the imputeCensoRd

Given
data that contains covariates and an outcome, which covariates are causes of

learning (ML), the goal of optimization is to maximize predictive accuracy.
However, some covariates might exhibit a non-causal association to the outcome.
Such spurious associations provide predictive power for classical ML, but they
prevent us from causally interpreting the result. This paper proposes CoCo, an
optimization algorithm that bridges the gap between pure prediction and causal
inference. CoCo leverages the recently-proposed idea of environments, datasets
of covariates/response where the causal relationships remain invariant but
where the distribution of the covariates changes from environment to
environment. Given datasets from multiple environments -- and ones that exhibit
sufficient heterogeneity -- CoCo maximizes an objective for which the only
solution is the causal solution. We describe the theoretical foundations of
this approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated and real datasets.
Compared to classical ML and existing methods, CoCo provides more accurate

the value function of an infinite-horizon discounted Markov reward process
(MRP). We study a regularized form of the kernel least-squares temporal
difference (LSTD) estimate; in the population limit of infinite data, it
corresponds to the fixed point of a projected Bellman operator defined by the
associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The estimator itself is obtained
by computing the projected fixed point induced by a regularized version of the
empirical operator; due to the underlying kernel structure, this reduces to
solving a linear system involving kernel matrices. We analyze the error of this
estimate in the $L^2(\mu)$-norm, where $\mu$ denotes the stationary
distribution of the underlying Markov chain. Our analysis imposes no
assumptions on the transition operator of the Markov chain, but rather only
conditions on the reward function and population-level kernel LSTD solutions.
We use empirical process theory techniques to derive a non-asymptotic upper
bound on the error with explicit dependence on the eigenvalues of the
associated kernel operator, as well as the instance-dependent variance of the
Bellman residual error. In addition, we prove minimax lower bounds over
sub-classes of MRPs, which shows that our rate is optimal in terms of the
sample size $n$ and the effective horizon $H = (1 - \gamma)^{-1}$. Whereas
existing worst-case theory predicts cubic scaling ($H^3$) in the effective
horizon, our theory reveals that there is in fact a much wider range of
scalings, depending on the kernel, the stationary distribution, and the
variance of the Bellman residual error. Notably, it is only parametric and

biomarkers or to infer gene regulatory networks from transcriptomic data.
Methods are mainly based on the high-dimensional Gaussian linear regression
model and we focus on this framework for this review. We propose a comparison
study of variable selection procedures from regularization paths by considering
three simulation settings. In the first one, the variables are independent
allowing the evaluation of the methods in the theoretical framework used to
develop them. In the second setting, two structures of the correlation between
variables are considered to evaluate how biological dependencies usually
observed affect the estimation. Finally, the third setting mimics the
biological complexity of transcription factor regulations, it is the farthest
setting from the Gaussian framework. In all the settings, the capacity of
prediction and the identification of the explaining variables are evaluated for
each method. Our results show that variable selection procedures rely on
statistical assumptions that should be carefully checked. The Gaussian
assumption and the number of explaining variables are the two key points. As
soon as correlation exists, the regularization function Elastic-net provides
better results than Lasso. LinSelect, a non-asymptotic model selection method,
should be preferred to the eBIC criterion commonly used. Bolasso is a judicious
strategy to limit the selection of non explaining variables.

$W_{10}$ measurements across the total bandwidth of 775 MHz, where $W_{10}$ is
the width at the 10% level of the pulse peak. We also measure about 400
$W_{10}$ values in each of the four or eight frequency sub-bands. Assuming, the
width is a function of the rotation period P, this relationship can be
described with a power law with power law index $\mu=-0.29\pm 0.03$. However,
using orthogonal distance regression, we determine a steeper power law with
$\mu=-0.63\pm 0.06$. A density plot of the period-width data reveals such a fit
to align well with the contours of highest density. Building on a previous
population synthesis model, we obtain population-based estimates of the
obliquity of the magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis for our
pulsars. Investigating the width changes over frequency, we unambiguously
identify a group of pulsars that have width broadening at higher frequencies.
The measured width changes show a monotonic behaviour with frequency for the
whole TPA pulsar population, whether the pulses are becoming narrower or
broader with increasing frequency. We exclude a sensitivity bias, scattering
and noticeable differences in the pulse component numbers as explanations for
these width changes, and attempt an explanation using a qualitative model of
five contributing Gaussian pulse components with flux density spectra that

percent level or lower, it becomes increasingly important to reconsider
estimator assumptions at each step of the process, and their consequences on
the statistical variability of the scientific results.
  We compare $L^1$ regression statistics to the weighted mean, the canonical
$L^2$ method based on Gaussian assumptions, for inference of the weak
gravitational shear signal from a catalog of background ellipticity
measurements around a sample of clusters, in many recent analyses a standard
step in the process.
  We use the shape measurements of background sources around 6925 AMICO
clusters detected in the KiDS 3rd data release. We investigate the robustness
of our results and the dependence of uncertainties on the signal-to-noise
ratios of the background source detections. Using a halo model approach, we
derive lensing masses from the estimated excess surface density profiles.
  The highly significant shear signal allows us to study the scaling relation
between the $r$-band cluster luminosity $L_{200}$, and the derived lensing mass
$M_{200}$. We show the results of the scaling relations derived in 13 bins in
$L_{200}$, with a tightly constrained power law slope of $\sim 1.24\pm 0.08$.
We observe a small, but significant relative bias of a few percent in the
recovered excess surface density profiles between the two regression methods,
which translates to a $1\sigma$ difference in $M_{200}$. The efficiency of
$L^1$ is at least that of the weighted mean, relatively increasing with higher
signal-to-noise shape measurements.
  Our results indicate the relevance of optimizing the estimator for infering
the gravitational shear from a distribution of background ellipticities. The
interpretation of measured relative biases can be gauged by deeper
observations, while increased computation times remain feasible.

the next frontier in the research of topological insulators is to investigate
what happens in fractionally filled topological flat bands. A particularly
pressing question is if there exists the lattice analogue of the Laughlin state
in the 1/3-filled Chern flat band, dubbed as the Chern-Laughlin state. The
answer depends crucially on the form of the electron-electron interaction,
which can generate various competing ground states such as the Laughlin,
stripe/nematic, parafermion, and parton states. Unfortunately, it is difficult
to precisely characterize the exact ground state as any of these candidate
ground states due to the lack of appropriate order parameters. Here, we propose
that the existence of an adiabatic path from fractional Chern insulators to the
Tao-Thouless state, i.e., the root partition state of the Laughlin state in the
thin torus limit, can serve as an effective order parameter for the
Chern-Laughlin state. Specifically, by devising the piecewise hybrid adiabatic
path of first transforming the electron-electron interaction and then taking
the thin torus limit, it is shown that Chern flat bands with the
nearest-neighbor interaction can indeed host the Chern-Laughlin state at 1/3
filling. This method can be extended to possible FCIs at other general fillings
of the Jain sequence.

sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing. We quantify the nonclassicality degree

which rely on exploiting one specific type of program context information

These techniques either completely neglect a prefetcher's undesirable effects
(e.g., memory bandwidth usage) on the overall system, or incorporate
system-level feedback as an afterthought to a system-unaware prefetch
algorithm. We show that prior prefetchers often lose their performance benefit
over a wide range of workloads and system configurations due to their inherent
inability to take multiple different types of program context and system-level
feedback information into account while prefetching. In this paper, we make a
case for designing a holistic prefetch algorithm that learns to prefetch using
multiple different types of program context and system-level feedback
information inherent to its design.
  To this end, we propose Pythia, which formulates the prefetcher as a
reinforcement learning agent. For every demand request, Pythia observes
multiple different types of program context information to make a prefetch
decision. For every prefetch decision, Pythia receives a numerical reward that
evaluates prefetch quality under the current memory bandwidth usage. Pythia
uses this reward to reinforce the correlation between program context
information and prefetch decision to generate highly accurate, timely, and
system-aware prefetch requests in the future. Our extensive evaluations using
simulation and hardware synthesis show that Pythia outperforms multiple
state-of-the-art prefetchers over a wide range of workloads and system

viscous discs the internal torque vector G is uniquely determined by the local
conditions in the disc, and warps tend to damp out rapidly if they are not
continuously driven. For very inviscid discs, on the other hand, G becomes a
dynamic quantity, and a warp will propagate through the disc as a wave. The
equations governing both regimes are usually treated separately. A unified set
of equations was postulated recently by Martin et al. (2019), but not yet
derived from the underlying physics. The standard method for deriving these
equations is based on a perturbation series expansion, which is a powerful, but
somewhat abstract technique. A more straightforward method is to employ the
warped shearing box framework of Ogilvie and Latter (2013), which so far has
not yet been used to derive the equations for the wavelike regime. The goal of
this paper is to analyze the warped disc equations in both regimes using the
warped shearing box framework, to derive a unified set of equations, valid for
small warps, and to discuss how our results can be interpreted in terms of the

choice models using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In particular, we use
continuous vector representations, called embeddings, for encoding categorical
or discrete explanatory variables with a special focus on interpretability and
model transparency. Although embedding representations within the logit
framework have been conceptualized by Pereira (2019), their dimensions do not
have an absolute definitive meaning, hence offering limited behavioral insights
in this earlier work. The novelty of our work lies in enforcing
interpretability to the embedding vectors by formally associating each of their
dimensions to a choice alternative. Thus, our approach brings benefits much
beyond a simple parsimonious representation improvement over dummy encoding, as
it provides behaviorally meaningful outputs that can be used in travel demand
analysis and policy decisions. Additionally, in contrast to previously
suggested ANN-based Discrete Choice Models (DCMs) that either sacrifice
interpretability for performance or are only partially interpretable, our
models preserve interpretability of the utility coefficients for all the input
variables despite being based on ANN principles. The proposed models were
tested on two real world datasets and evaluated against benchmark and baseline
models that use dummy-encoding. The results of the experiments indicate that
our models deliver state-of-the-art predictive performance, outperforming

component or system. Accurate RUL prediction is critical for prognostic and
health management and for maintenance planning. In this work, we address three
prevalent challenges in data-driven RUL prediction, namely the handling of high
dimensional input features, the robustness to noise in sensor data and
prognostic datasets, and the capturing of the time-dependency between system
degradation and RUL prediction. We devise a highly accurate RUL prediction
model with uncertainty quantification, which integrates and leverages the
advantages of deep learning and nonstationary Gaussian process regression
(DL-NSGPR). We examine and benchmark our model against other advanced
data-driven RUL prediction models using the turbofan engine dataset from the
NASA prognostic repository. Our computational experiments show that the
DL-NSGPR predictions are highly accurate with root mean square error 1.7 to 6.2
times smaller than those of competing RUL models. Furthermore, the results
demonstrate that RUL uncertainty bounds with the proposed DL-NSGPR are both
valid and significantly tighter than other stochastic RUL prediction models. We
unpack and discuss the reasons for this excellent performance of the DL-NSGPR.

implement computation of the magnetic field in the pulsar magnetosphere from a

a pulsar and find that the field exhibits a strong gravitational effect. The
effect modifies curvature radiation of a pulsar, which then leads to
modifications of the pulse profiles of radio emission. We take the pulsar PSR

twofold: first, the system can return to previously learned tasks after

for faster learning of a novel task. Previous approaches to CF and
bootstrapping are primarily based on modifying learning in the form of changing
weights to tune the model to the current task, overwriting previously tuned

largely overlooked is the initial network topology, or architecture. Here, we
argue that the topology of biological brains likely evolved certain features

approach, the Schwinger-Feynman variational principle, which is more
appropriate and rigorous that the functional integral method, when we are in
the presence of derivative couplings \nd We base our efforts on works by Suraj
N. Gupta and Richard P. Feynman so as to undertake the construction of a
Quantum Field Theory (QFT) of Einstein Gravity (EG). We explicitly use the
Einstein Lagrangian elaborated by Gupta \cite{g1} but choose a new constraint
for the theory that differs from Gupta's one. In this way, we avoid the problem
of lack of unitarity for the $S$ matrix that afflicts the procedures of Gupta
and Feynman. Simultaneously, we significantly simplify the handling of
constraints. This eliminates the need to appeal to ghosts for guarantying the
unitarity of the theory. Our ensuing approach is obviously non-renormalizable.
However, this inconvenience can be overcome by appealing tho the mathematical
theory developed by Bollini et al. \cite{tp3,tp18,tp19,tp20,pr} Such
developments were founded in the works of Alexander Grothendieck \cite{gro} and
in the theory of Ultradistributions of Jose Sebastiao e Silva \cite{tp6} (also
known as Ultrahyperfunctions). Based on these works, we have constructed a
mathematical edifice, in a lapse of about 25 years, that is able to quantize
non-renormalizable Field Theories (FT). Here we specialize this mathematical
theory to treat the quantum field theory of Einsteins's gravity (EG). Because
we are using a Gupta-Feynman inspired EG Lagrangian, we are able to evade the
intricacies of Yang-Mills theories.

with requirement changes? This paper addresses this challenge for the first
time by proposing a new framework that is capable of dealing with requirement
changes at runtime through a mechanism we term runtime interchange. Our
approach functions via a continual exchange and selection process of multiple
pre-verified controllers. It represents a key step on the way to
component-oriented engineering for intelligent designs, as it preserves the
behaviours of the original controllers while introducing additional
functionality. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach we utilise an
existing autonomous driving case study as well as a set of smaller benchmarks.
These show that introduced overheads are extremely minimal and that the
approach is very scalable.

the scientific study of consciousness when all the details are considered,
especially how measurement results relate to physical events. It turns out that
the closure of the physical has surprising implications that conflict with
scientific practice. These implications point to a fundamental flaw in the
paradigm underlying many experiments conducted to date and pose a challenge to
any research programme that aims to ground a physical functionalist or
identity-based understanding of consciousness on empirical observations.

  fits all","4 figures",,,,"math.ST math.FA stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  For the large family of ARMA models with variable coefficients (TV-ARMA),
either deterministic or stochastic, we provide an explicit and computationally
tractable representation based on the general solution of the associated linear
difference equation. Analogous representations are established for the
fundamental properties of such processes, including the Wold-Cram\'{e}r
decomposition and their covariance structure as well as explicit optimal linear
forecasts based on a finite set of past observations. These results are
grounded on the principal determinant, that is a banded Hessenbergian
representation of a restriction of the Green function involved in the solution
of the linear difference equation associated with TV-ARMA models, built up
solely of the autoregressive coefficients of the model. The $L_2$ convergence
properties of the model are a consequence of the absolute summability of the
aforementioned Hessenbergian representation, which is in line with the
asymptotic stability and efficiency of such processes. The invertibility of the
model is also a consequence of an analogous condition, but now the Green
function is built up of the moving average coefficients. The structural
asymmetry between constant and deterministically time-varying coefficient
models, that is the backward and forward asymptotic efficiency differ in an
essential manner, is formally demonstrated. An alternative approach to the
Hessenbergian solution representation is described by an equivalent procedure
for manipulating time-varying polynomials. The practical significance of the
theoretical results in this work is illustrated with an application to U.S.
inflation data. The main finding is that inflation persistence increased after
1976, whereas from 1986 onwards the persistence declines and stabilizes to even
lower levels than the pre-1976 period.

  Event Prediction","EMNLP 2021 long paper (main conference)",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scripts are structured sequences of events together with the participants,
which are extracted from the texts.Script event prediction aims to predict the
subsequent event given the historical events in the script. Two kinds of
information facilitate this task, namely, the event-level information and the
script-level information. At the event level, existing studies view an event as
a verb with its participants, while neglecting other useful properties, such as
the state of the participants. At the script level, most existing studies only
consider a single event sequence corresponding to one common protagonist. In
this paper, we propose a Transformer-based model, called MCPredictor, which
integrates deep event-level and script-level information for script event
prediction. At the event level, MCPredictor utilizes the rich information in
the text to obtain more comprehensive event semantic representations. At the
script-level, it considers multiple event sequences corresponding to different
participants of the subsequent event. The experimental results on the
widely-used New York Times corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of the proposed model.

  Metal Droplet Machine","26 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Magnetism and magnetic monopole are classical issues in basic physics.
Conventional magnets are generally composed of rigid materials with shapes and
structures unchangeable which may face challenges sometimes to answer the above
questions. Here, from an alternative other than rigid magnet, we disclosed an
unconventional way to generate endogenous magnetism and then construct magnetic
monopole through tuning liquid metal machine. Through theoretical
interpretation and conceptual experiments, we illustrated that when gallium
base liquid metal in solution rotates under actuation of an external electric
field, it forms an endogenous magnetic field inside which well explains the
phenomenon that two such discrete metal droplets could easily fuse together,
indicating their reciprocal attraction via N and S poles. Further, we conceived
that the self-driving liquid metal motor was also an endogenous magnet owning
the electromagnetic homology. When liquid metal in solution swallowed aluminum
inside, it formed a spin motor and dynamically variable charge distribution
which produced an endogenous magnetic field. This finding explains the
phenomena that there often happened reflection collision and attraction fusion
between running liquid metal motors which were just caused by the dynamic
adjustment of their N and S polarities. Finally, we conceived that such
endogenous magnet could lead to magnetic monopole and four technical routes
were suggested as: 1. Matching the interior flow field of liquid metal
machines; 2. Superposition between external electric effect and magnetic field;
3. Composite construction between magnetic particles and liquid metal motor; 4.
Chemical ways such as via galvanic cell reaction. Overall, the fluidic
endogenous magnet and the promising magnetic monopole it enabled may lead to
unconventional magnetoelectric devices and applications in the near future.
