encoders directly adopts, or draws inspiration from, the concepts and images of
ImageNet. While one can hardly overestimate how much this benchmark contributed
to progress in computer vision, it is mostly derived from lexical databases and
image queries in English, resulting in source material with a North American or
Western European bias. Therefore, we devise a new protocol to construct an
ImageNet-style hierarchy representative of more languages and cultures. In
particular, we let the selection of both concepts and images be entirely driven
by native speakers, rather than scraping them automatically. Specifically, we
focus on a typologically diverse set of languages, namely, Indonesian, Mandarin
Chinese, Swahili, Tamil, and Turkish. On top of the concepts and images
obtained through this new protocol, we create a multilingual dataset for
{M}ulticultur{a}l {R}easoning over {V}ision and {L}anguage (MaRVL) by eliciting
statements from native speaker annotators about pairs of images. The task
consists of discriminating whether each grounded statement is true or false. We
establish a series of baselines using state-of-the-art models and find that
their cross-lingual transfer performance lags dramatically behind supervised
performance in English. These results invite us to reassess the robustness and
accuracy of current state-of-the-art models beyond a narrow domain, but also
open up new exciting challenges for the development of truly multilingual and
multicultural systems.

of infinitely many discrete-time switched systems. An approximation (known as
abstraction) is itself a continuous-space system, which can be used as a
replacement of the original (known as concrete) system in a controller design
process. Having synthesized a controller for the abstract system, the
controller is refined to a more detailed controller for the concrete system. To
quantify the mismatch between the output trajectory of the approximation and of
that the original system, we use the notion of so-called simulation functions.
In particular, each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one
in the abstract network is related through a local simulation function. We show
that if the local simulation functions satisfy a certain small-gain type
condition developed for a network of infinitely many subsystems, then the
aggregation of the individual simulation functions provides an overall
simulation function between the overall abstraction and the concrete network.
For a network of linear switched systems, we systematically construct local
abstractions and local simulation functions, where the required conditions are
expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities and can be efficiently
computed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through an
application to frequency control in a power gird with a switched (i.e.
time-varying) topology.

masses well below the Chandrasekhar limit (MCh ~ 1.4 Msun) contribute a
significant fraction of SN Ia progenitors. The relative fraction of stable
iron-group elements synthesized in the explosion has been suggested as a
possible discriminant between MCh and sub-MCh events. In particular, it is
thought that the higher-density ejecta of MCh WDs, which favours the synthesis
of stable isotopes of nickel, results in prominent [Ni II] lines in late-time
spectra. We study the explosive nucleosynthesis of stable nickel in SNe Ia
resulting from MCh and sub-MCh progenitors. We explore the potential for lines
of [Ni II] at 7378 \AA\ and 1.94 microns in late-time spectra to serve as a
diagnostic of the exploding WD mass, using nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium
radiative-transfer simulations with the CMFGEN code. We find that the radiative
proton-capture reaction 57Co(p,gamma)58Ni is the dominant production mode for
58Ni in both MCh and sub-MCh models, while the alpha-capture reaction on 54Fe
has a negligible impact on the final 58Ni yield. More importantly, we
demonstrate that the lack of [Ni II] lines in late-time spectra of sub-MCh
events is not always due to an under-abundance of stable Ni; rather, it results
from the higher ionization of Ni in the inner ejecta. Conversely, the strong
[Ni II] lines predicted in our 1D MCh models are completely suppressed when
56Ni is sufficiently mixed with the innermost layers, which are rich in stable
iron-group elements. [Ni II] lines in late-time SN Ia spectra have a complex
dependency on the abundance of stable Ni, which limits their use in
distinguishing among MCh and sub-MCh progenitors. However, we argue that a
low-luminosity SN Ia displaying strong [Ni II] lines would most likely result
from a Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor. [Abridged]

  Retinal Vessel Segmentations","31 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) may demonstrate racial bias when
skin or choroidal pigmentation is present in medical images. Recent studies
have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can predict race from
images that were not previously thought to contain race-specific features. We
evaluate whether grayscale retinal vessel maps (RVMs) of patients screened for
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) contain race-specific features.
  Methods: 4095 retinal fundus images (RFIs) were collected from 245 Black and
White infants. A U-Net generated RVMs from RFIs, which were subsequently
thresholded, binarized, or skeletonized. To determine whether RVM differences
between Black and White eyes were physiological, CNNs were trained to predict
race from color RFIs, raw RVMs, and thresholded, binarized, or skeletonized
RVMs. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) was evaluated.
  Findings: CNNs predicted race from RFIs near perfectly (image-level AUC-PR:
0.999, subject-level AUC-PR: 1.000). Raw RVMs were almost as informative as
color RFIs (image-level AUC-PR: 0.938, subject-level AUC-PR: 0.995).
Ultimately, CNNs were able to detect whether RFIs or RVMs were from Black or
White babies, regardless of whether images contained color, vessel segmentation
brightness differences were nullified, or vessel segmentation widths were
normalized.
  Interpretation: AI can detect race from grayscale RVMs that were not thought
to contain racial information. Two potential explanations for these findings
are that: retinal vessels physiologically differ between Black and White babies
or the U-Net segments the retinal vasculature differently for various fundus
pigmentations. Either way, the implications remain the same: AI algorithms have
potential to demonstrate racial bias in practice, even when preliminary
attempts to remove such information from the underlying images appear to be
successful.

of the currents in individual legs; we find the regions in the parameter space
where the currents in individual legs alter their direction. In some parameter
regime, the total current exhibits the re-entrance phenomena, in the sense that
the total current flips its direction with increase of certain parameter and
flips it again when the parameter is increased further. It turns out that the
multibalance condition we introduce here is very useful and it can be applied
generically to several other models. We discuss some of these models in short.

this issue, Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies have been adopted to
replace the caregivers and complement patients' lack of intelligence.
Technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
have enabled intelligent ubiquitous learning for smart buildings to monitor the
cognitively declined occupants and provide in-home assistive services and
solutions. This paper aims to summarize and evaluate the intelligence
complements provided by smart buildings that can increase the cognitively
declined occupants' quality of life and autonomy. Through a systematic
literature review, the authors find that most of the existing contributions are
towards identifying the occupants' behavior, and thus, to determine
corresponding assistive services and solutions. Five key research gaps are
identified, including the lack of adequate adoption of technological
interventions to fully support the occupants' autonomy and independence. The

support rapid transfer of learning across tasks and which enable them to
efficiently traverse their environments to reach rewarding states. The
successor representation (SR), which measures the expected cumulative,
discounted state occupancy under a fixed policy, enables efficient transfer to
different reward structures in an otherwise constant Markovian environment and
has been hypothesized to underlie aspects of biological behavior and neural
activity. However, in the real world, rewards may move or only be available for
consumption once, may shift location, or agents may simply aim to reach goal
states as rapidly as possible without the constraint of artificially imposed
task horizons. In such cases, the most behaviorally-relevant representation
would carry information about when the agent was likely to first reach states
of interest, rather than how often it should expect to visit them over a
potentially infinite time span. To reflect such demands, we introduce the
first-occupancy representation (FR), which measures the expected temporal
discount to the first time a state is accessed. We demonstrate that the FR
facilitates exploration, the selection of efficient paths to desired states,
allows the agent, under certain conditions, to plan provably optimal
trajectories defined by a sequence of subgoals, and induces similar behavior to
animals avoiding threatening stimuli.

systems. The proposed scheme encodes the information bits with the CSC indices
and the phase-shift keying (PSK) symbols. It allows the receiver to exploit the
frequency selectivity naturally in fading channels by combining IM and wideband
CSCs. It also leverages the fact that a CSC is a constant-envelope signal to
achieve a controllable peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR). For radar
functionality, CSC-IM maintains the good autocorrelation (AC) properties of a
chirp by ensuring that the transmitted CSCs are separated apart sufficiently in
the time domain through index separation (IS). We investigate the impact of IS
on spectral efficiency (SE) and obtain the corresponding mapping functions. For
theoretical results, we derive the union bound (UB) of the block error rate
(BLER) for arbitrary chirps and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the
range and reflection coefficients for the matched filter (MF)-based estimation.
We also prove that complementary sequences (CSs) can be constructed through
CSCs by linearly combining the Fourier series of CSCs. Finally, through
comprehensive comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme
for DFRC scenarios.

Today, there is the issue of scattered resources in distribution systems, which

animal losses. The most important challenge in this section is the existence of
voltage and frequency fluctuations during the occurrence of possible events
such as severe load changes or errors in distribution networks. Having such a
big problem can call a distribution network into question and destroy it.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide an optimal method that can meet and cover

of establishing and placing a multifunctional phasor measurement unit to
improve the parallel state estimation in distribution networks, which offers a
control approach. This approach determines the time of occurrence of internal

distribution network due to the mentioned challenges, and training in the
system is needed to accurately deploy and place possible errors. Do not occur.
When setting up and placing the phasor measuring unit, the most important issue

Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group), we show that the transverse
momentum map admits a natural constant rank stratification. To this end, we
construct a refinement of the canonical stratification associated to the Lie
groupoid action (the orbit type stratification, in the case of a Hamiltonian
Lie group action) that seems not to have appeared before, even in the
literature on Hamiltonian Lie group actions. This refinement turns out to be
compatible with the Poisson geometry of the Hamiltonian action: it is a Poisson
stratification of the orbit space, each stratum of which is a regular Poisson
manifold that admits a natural proper symplectic groupoid integrating it. The
main tools in our proofs (which we believe could be of independent interest)
are a version of the Marle-Guillemin-Sternberg normal form theorem for
Hamiltonian actions of proper symplectic groupoids and a notion of equivalence
between Hamiltonian actions of symplectic groupoids, closely related to Morita
equivalence between symplectic groupoids.

and a requirement for several real-life applications such as virtual reality,
augmented reality, and hand gesture recognition. Currently, reasonable
estimations can be computed from single RGB images, especially when a
multi-task learning approach is used to force the system to consider the shape
of the hand when its pose is determined. However, depending on the method used
to represent the hand, the performance can drop considerably in real-life
tasks, suggesting that stable descriptions are required to achieve satisfactory
results. In this paper, we present a keypoint-based end-to-end framework for 3D
hand and pose estimation and successfully apply it to the task of hand gesture
recognition as a study case. Specifically, after a pre-processing step in which
the images are normalized, the proposed pipeline uses a multi-task semantic
feature extractor generating 2D heatmaps and hand silhouettes from RGB images,
a viewpoint encoder to predict the hand and camera view parameters, a stable
hand estimator to produce the 3D hand pose and shape, and a loss function to
guide all of the components jointly during the learning phase. Tests were
performed on a 3D pose and shape estimation benchmark dataset to assess the
proposed framework, which obtained state-of-the-art performance. Our system was
also evaluated on two hand-gesture recognition benchmark datasets and
significantly outperformed other keypoint-based approaches, indicating that it
is an effective solution that is able to generate stable 3D estimates for hand
pose and shape.

deriving from the atmospheric propagation (absorption, beam broadening, beam
wandering, scintillation, and wavefront distortions), as well as the effect of
fiber-coupling in the presence of a partial adaptive correction with finite
control bandwidth. We find that the channel fluctuation statistics must be
considered to correctly estimate the effect of the saturation rate of the
single-photon detectors, which may otherwise lead to an overestimation of the
secret key rate. We further present strategies to minimize the impact of

industrial scenarios where no prior knowledge on model structure is available.
Such scenarios often require specific model properties such as
interpretability, robustness, trustworthiness and plausibility, that are not
easily achievable using standard approaches like genetic programming for
symbolic regression. In this chapter we introduce a deterministic symbolic
regression algorithm specifically designed to address these issues. The
algorithm uses a context-free grammar to produce models that are parameterized
by a non-linear least squares local optimization procedure. A finite
enumeration of all possible models is guaranteed by structural restrictions as
well as a caching mechanism for detecting semantically equivalent solutions.
Enumeration order is established via heuristics designed to improve search
efficiency. Empirical tests on a comprehensive benchmark suite show that our
approach is competitive with genetic programming in many noiseless problems
while maintaining desirable properties such as simple, reliable models and
reproducibility.

two arbitrary observers in asymptotically flat spacetimes (possibly containing
black holes) and investigate what is the energy cost for such information
transmission. By means of localized two-level quantum systems, sender and
receiver can use a quantum scalar field as a communication channel. As we have
already shown in a previous paper, such a channel has non-vanishing classical
capacity as well as entanglement-assisted classical and quantum capacities.
Here we will show that the change in the expectation value of the energy of the
system during the communication process can be separated in: (i) a contribution
coming from the particle creation due to the change of the spacetime, (ii) a
contribution associated with the energy needed to switch-on/off each qubit, and
{\bf (iii)} a term which comes from the communication process itself. For the
quantum channel considered here, we show that the extra energy cost needed for
communication vanishes. As a result, if one has already created a system of
qubits for some specific task (e.g., quantum computation) one can also reliably
convey information between its parts with no extra energy cost. We conclude the
paper by illustrating the form of the channel capacities and energy
contributions in two paradigmatic cases in Minkowski spacetime: (1) sender and
receiver in inertial motion and (2) sender in inertial motion while the
receiver is uniformly accelerated.

a restricted grammar for uni-variate symbolic regression models and generate
all possible models up to a fixed length limit. We identify unique models and
cluster them based on phenotypic as well as genotypic similarity. We find that
phenotypic similarity leads to well-defined clusters while genotypic similarity

do so, we use our newly developed Multiphase Micro-Continuum model to perform
first-of-a-kind direct numerical simulations of two-phase flow in porous

previous evidence that the influence of SRP cannot be disregarded without
incurring significant errors in numerical predictions or experimental analyses

keeps learning features of objects it has interacted with and updates their

foregrounds, some of which are usually masked to perform cosmological analyses.
If masks are correlated to the lensing signal, such as those removing
extragalactic emissions located in matter overdensities, measurements over the
unmasked sky may give biased estimates. We quantify the impact of these
mask-induced biases for the reconstructed CMB lensing auto- and
cross-correlation power spectra with external matter tracers. We show that they
arise both from changes in the lensing power, and via modifications to the
reconstruction power spectrum corrections, $N_L^{(0)}$, $N_L^{(1)}$ and
$N_L^{(3/2)}$). For direct masking of the CMB lensing field, we derive simple
analytic models of the masking effect and show that it is potentially large. We
show that mask-induced biases are significantly reduced by optimal filtering of
the CMB maps in the lensing reconstruction. We test the resulting lensing power
spectrum biases on numerical simulations, masking radio sources, and peaks of
thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) emission.
For the lensing auto spectrum, masking biases can only be measured with a
statistical significance $\lesssim 3\sigma$ for future data sets. The same
applies to the cross-correlation power spectra between CMB lensing and tSZ and
CIB even though biases are larger (up to ~30%). We find that masking
tSZ-selected galaxy clusters leads to the largest mask biases, potentially
detectable with high significance. We find that the calibration of cluster
masses using CMB lensing, in particular for objects at $z\lesssim 0.6$, might
be significantly affected by mask biases for near-future observations if the
lensing signal recovered inside the mask holes is used without further
corrections. Conversely, mass calibration of high redshift objects will still
deliver unbiased results.

a long-standing computer vision problem with numerous applications. While

However, dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large
displacements, occlusions, or homogeneous regions. In order to apply dense
methods to real-world applications, such as pose estimation, image
manipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is therefore crucial to estimate the
confidence of the predicted matches.
  We propose the Enhanced Probabilistic Dense Correspondence Network, PDC-Net+,
capable of estimating accurate dense correspondences along with a reliable
confidence map. We develop a flexible probabilistic approach that jointly
learns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we parametrize
the predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better
modelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers. Moreover, we develop
an architecture and an enhanced training strategy tailored for robust and
generalizable uncertainty prediction in the context of self-supervised
training. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging

usefulness of our probabilistic confidence estimation for the tasks of pose

uncertainty from these neural network perception stacks by modifying network

these methods lack calibration, meaning that the predictive uncertainties do
not faithfully represent the true underlying uncertainties (process noise). Our
key insight is that calibration is only achieved by imposing constraints across
multiple examples, such as those in a mini-batch; as opposed to existing
approaches which only impose constraints per-sample, often leading to
overconfident (thus miscalibrated) uncertainty estimates. By enforcing the
distribution of outputs of a neural network to resemble a target distribution

colour-magnitude diagrams of the stars in all these regions show an elongated
red giant clump that reveals a variable amount of extinction across these
fields, ranging from Av~0.2 to Av~1.9, including Galactic foreground
extinction. The extinction properties nonetheless are remarkably uniform. The
slope of the reddening vectors measured in the (V-I,V) and (B-I,B)
colour-magnitude planes is fully in line with the Av/E(B-V)~5.5 value found in
the outskirts of 30 Dor. This indicates the presence of an additional grey
extinction component in the optical requiring big grains to be about twice as
abundant as in the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). Areas of higher
extinction appear to be systematically associated with regions of more intense
star formation, as measured by the larger number of stars more massive than 8
Msun, thus making injection of big grains into the ISM by SNII explosion the
likely mechanism at the origin of the observed grey extinction component.

readers a systematized structure of his attempt to produce a universal
repository of human knowledge. Divided into an interconnected taxonomic tree
and domain vocabulary, this structure forms the basis of one effort from the
Metadata Research Center to study historical ontologies. The knowledge
structure is being encoded into a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)
form as well as a Web Ontology Language (OWL) version. This paper explores the
expressive and functional differences between these SKOS and OWL versions of
Chambers' knowledge structure. As part of this goal, the paper research focused
on the construction and application of rules in each system to produce a more
computationally ready representation of Chambers' structure in SKOS, which is
more thesaurus-like, and OWL, which represents additional ontological nuances.
First, studying the various textual aspects at the semantic, syntactic, and
typographic levels allowed for the relationships between terms to manifest from
which rules governing expression of the connections between elements developed.
Second, because each language, SKOS and OWL, functionally expresses different
logical relationships, their possibilities and limitations offer a ground for
further analyzing the resultant knowledge structures; although, each stemmed
from the same basic source of Chambers' text. Lastly this paper will examine
rule making and expression in light of Paul Grice's theory of conversational
implicature to understand how a naive agent formulates and applies these rules
to a knowledge structure.

the force-free electrodynamics constraints is a proxy for the physical
resistivity, we examine its impact on the overall dynamics of force-free
aligned pulsar magnetospheres endowed with an equatorial current sheet. We
assess the constraint violations as a diffusivity source. The effects of
modifications on electric fields used to restore force-free conditions are not
confined to the equatorial current sheet, but modify the magnetospheric
dynamics on timescales shorter than the pulsar rotational period. These
corrections propagate especially via a channel that was unexplored, namely,
changes induced to the electric charge density, $\rho$. We quantify the global
consequences of diffusivity by comparing different techniques to model $\rho$.
By default, we combine a conservative $\rho$-evolution with
hyperbolic/parabolic cleaning of inaccuracies in the Maxwell equations. As an
alternative, we enforce a constrained evolution where $\rho$ is directly
computed as the electric field divergence. The conservative approach reduces
the Poynting flux dissipated in the equatorial current sheet by an order of
magnitude, along with an increase of the pulsar luminosity driven by a shift of
the Y-point location. The luminosity changes according to $L_{\rm Y}\propto
\alpha^{0.11}$, where $\alpha$ is the ratio of diffusion to advection
timescales, controlling the amount of (numerical) diffusivity. Our models
suggest interpreting the luminosity dependence on the Y-point location as
differences in resistivities encountered at the equatorial current sheet.
Alternatively, they could be interpreted in terms of the pair formation
multiplicity, $\kappa$, smaller diffusion being consistent with $\kappa\gg 1$.

supersymmetric theory in flat space, and for all minimally coupled theories,
logarithmic running at one loop pushes the Wilson coefficient of certain
four-derivative operators to be larger at lower energies, guaranteeing the
existence of sufficiently large black holes with $Q>M$. We identify two
exceptional cases of nonsupersymmetric theories involving large numbers of
light states and Planck-scale nonminimal couplings, in which the sign of the
running is reversed, leading to black holes with negative corrections to $Q/M$
in the deep IR, but argue that these do not rule out extremal black holes as
the requisite charged states for the WGC. We separately show that causality and
unitarity imply that the leading threshold corrections to the effective action
from integrating out massive states, in any weakly coupled theory, can be
written as a sum of squares and is manifestly positive for black hole
backgrounds. Quite beautifully, the shift in the extremal $Q/M$ ratio is
directly proportional to the shift in the on-shell action, guaranteeing that

the objective status of tracing out degrees of freedom inside the black hole.
Second, evaporation must be completed (or nearly completed) in finite time

should also occur in finite time. In spherical symmetry these requirements
constrain the possible metrics strongly enough to obtain a unique black hole
formation scenario and match their parameters with the semiclassical results.

magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has raised the intriguing
possibility that its pairing mechanism is distinct from that of conventional
superconductors, as described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory.
While there is now ample evidence for strong electronic correlations in MATBG,
recent studies have claimed that unlike correlated insulators,
superconductivity persists even when these interactions are partially screened.
This suggests that the pairing in MATBG might be conventional in nature, a
consequence of the large density of states of its nearly flat bands, perhaps
phonon-mediated as in BCS superconductors. Here we combine tunneling and
Andreev reflection spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to
observe several key experimental signatures for unconventional
superconductivity in MATBG. We show that the tunneling spectra below the
transition temperature $T_c$ are inconsistent with that of a conventional
s-wave superconductor, but rather resemble that of a nodal superconductor with
an anisotropic pairing mechanism. We observe a large discrepancy between the
tunneling energy gap $\Delta_T$, which far exceeds the mean-field BCS ratio
(with $2\Delta_T/k_BT_c \sim 25$) and the energy gap $\Delta_{AR}$ extracted
from Andreev reflection spectroscopy ($2\Delta_{AR}/k_BT_c \sim 6$). The
tunneling gap persists even when superconductivity is suppressed, indicating
its emergence from a pseudogap phase, with a suppressed density of states at
the Fermi level. Moreover, the pseudogap state and superconductivity are both
absent when MATBG is aligned with the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) underneath.
These findings and other observations reported here provide a preponderance of
evidence for a non-BCS mechanism for superconductivity in MATBG.

post-starburst (PS) and quiescent Balmer-strong (QBS) galaxies. This preference
can be used to help find TDEs in transient surveys. But what other transients
might ""contaminate"" such a search, and by how much? We examine all reported
transients coincident with the centers of galaxies in the French & Zabludoff
(2018) catalog of spectroscopically confirmed PS and QBS galaxies and
photometrically identified PS and QBS galaxy candidates. We find that TDEs and
Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the only types of transients classified in the
centers of these galaxies (aside from one active galactic nucleus flare), with
Type Ia SNe being 8.3+-0.2 times more prevalent than TDEs (1-sigma confidence
bounds). This factor is ~2.7 times lower than in a control sample of quiescent
galaxies. Narrowing the sample to spectroscopically confirmed QBS galaxies does
not change these statistics much. In spectroscopically confirmed PS galaxies,
however, TDEs are the ones that outnumber Type Ia SNe 2+-0.6 to 1.
Unfortunately, there are few such galaxies in the catalog. By classifying
transients from the entire catalog, three times more TDEs are expected to be
found, but with a ~16-times larger Type Ia SN contamination. We use the public

halo and mass densities at the field level using the mass-weighted halo field
in the AbacusSummit simulations at $z=0.5$. Unlike the perturbative halo bias
model widely used in interpreting the observed large-scale structure traced by
galaxies, we find a non-negative halo-to-mass ratio that increases
monotonically with the linear overdensity $\delta_1$ in the initial Lagrangian
space. The bias expansion, however, does not guarantee non-negativity of the
halo counts, and may give rising halo number counts at negative overdensities.
The shape of the halo-to-mass ratio is unlikely to be described by a polynomial
of $\delta_1$ and other quantities. Especially for massive halos with
$6\times10^{12}\ h^{-1}\ M_\odot$, the halo-to-mass ratio starts soaring up at
$\delta_1>0$, substantially different from the predictions of the bias
expansion. We show that for the halo masses we consider ($M>3\times10^{11}\
h^{-1}\ M_\odot$) a non-parametric halo-to-mass ratio as a function of
$\delta_1$ and its local derivative $\nabla^2\delta_1$ can recover the halo
power spectra to sub-percent level for wavenumbers $k=0.01-0.1\ h\ {\rm
Mpc}^{-1}$ given a proper smoothing scale to filter the initial density field,
even though we do not fit the power spectrum directly. However, there is mild
dependence of the recovery of the halo power spectrum on the smoothing scale
and other input parameters. At $k<0.01\ h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and for massive
halos with $M>6\times10^{12}\ h^{-1}\ M_\odot$, our non-parametric model leads
to a few percent overestimation of the halo power spectrum, indicating the need
for larger or multiple smoothing scales. The halo-to-mass ratios obtained
qualitatively agree with intuitions from extended Press-Schechter theory. We
compare our framework to the bias expansion and discuss possible extensions.

modern hydrodynamics codes adopt a variety of techniques accounting for these

hydrodynamics are often solved using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH),
whereas radiative transfer is typically solved on a grid. Here we present a
radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme combining the SPH code Phantom and the

demonstrate that the scheme successfully reproduces the well-studied problem of
D-type H II region expansion in a uniform density medium. Furthermore, we use
this simulation setup to study the robustness of the RHD code with varying
choice of grid structure, density mapping method, and mass and temporal
resolution. To test the scheme under more realistic conditions, we apply it to
a simulated star-forming cloud reminiscing those in the Central Molecular Zone
of our galaxy, in order to estimate the amount of ionised material that a
single source could create. We find that a stellar population of several

asymptotic giant branch stars, and cosmic ray spallation. During their
longer-lived evolutionary phases, stars are not expected to add to the Li
budget of the Galaxy, but to largely deplete it. In this context, recent
analyses of Li data from GALAH and LAMOST for field red clump (RC) stars have
concluded that there is the need for a new production channel of Li, ubiquitous
among low-mass stars, and that would be triggered on the upper red giant branch
(RGB) or at helium ignition. This is distinct from the ""Li-rich giant"" problem
and reflects bulk RC star properties. We provide an analysis of the GALAH Li
data that accounts for the distribution of progenitor masses of field RC stars
observed today. Such progenitors are different than today's field RGB stars.
Using standard post main-sequence stellar evolution, we show that the
distribution of Li among field RC giants as observed by GALAH is consistent
with standard model predictions, and does not require new Li production
mechanisms. Our model predicts a large fraction of very low Li abundances from
low mass progenitors, with higher abundances from higher mass ones. Moreover,
there should be a large number of upper limits for RC giants, and higher
abundances should correspond to higher masses. The most recent GALAH data
indeed confirm the presence of large numbers of upper limits, and a much lower
mean Li abundance in RC stars, in concordance with our interpretation.

reducing model runtime requirements and supporting deployment on embedded

supported by deeper and wider neural networks, making mobile deployment of
state-of-the-art DNNs a moving target.
  In this paper, we perform the first holistic study of DNN usage in the wild
in an attempt to track deployed models and match how these run on widely
deployed devices. To this end, we analyse over 16k of the most popular apps in
the Google Play Store to characterise their DNN usage and performance across
devices of different capabilities, both across tiers and generations.
Simultaneously, we measure the models' energy footprint, as a core cost
dimension of any mobile deployment. To streamline the process, we have
developed gaugeNN, a tool that automates the deployment, measurement and
analysis of DNNs on devices, with support for different frameworks and
platforms. Results from our experience study paint the landscape of deep

developers. Furthermore, our study shows the gap between bespoke techniques and
real-world deployments and the need for optimised deployment of deep learning

electric dipole (E1) photon strength functions (PSFs) combining the microscopic
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation
(HFB+QRPA) model and the parametrizations constrained by the available
experimental giant dipole resonance (GDR) data. For about 10000 nuclei with
8<Z<124 lying between the proton and the neutron drip-lines on nuclear chart,
the particle-hole strength distributions are computed using the HFB+QRPA model
under the assumption of spherical symmetry and making use of the BSk27 Skyrme
effective interaction derived from the most accurate HFB mass model (HFB-27) so
far achieved. Large-scale calculations of the BSk27+QRPA E1 PSFs are performed
in the framework of a specific folding procedure, in which three
phenomenological improvements are considered. First, two interference factors
are introduced and adjusted to reproduce at best the available experimental GDR
data. Second, an empirical expression accounting for the deformation effect is
applied to describe the peak splitting of the strength function. Third, the
width of the strength function is corrected by a temperature-dependent term,
which effectively increases the de-excitation photon strength function at
low-energy. The E1 PSFs as well as the extracted GDR peaks and widths are
compared with available experimental data. A relatively good agreement with
data indicates the reliability of the calculations. Eventually, the
astrophysical (n,g) rates for all the 10000 nuclei with 8<Z<124 are estimated
using the present E1 PSFs. The resulting reaction rates are compared with
previous BSk7+QRPA results and Gogny-HFB+QRPA predictions based on the D1M
interaction.

perception (CPIP), a Bayesian framework to iteratively learn and exploit
task-level competence in novel deployment environments. CPIP factorizes the
competence-aware planning problem into two components. First, perception errors
are learned in a model-free and location-agnostic setting via introspective
perception prior to deployment in novel environments. Second, during actual
deployments, the prediction of task-level failures is learned in a
context-aware setting. Experiments in a simulation show that the proposed CPIP
approach outperforms the frequentist baseline in multiple mobile robot tasks,

Furthermore, it scales efficiently: the number of possible shower steps
increases exponentially with the number of qubits, and the circuit depth grows

to convex, curved substrates, such as the surfaces of spherical nanoparticles

previously shown that strongly-stretched, curved brushes require a boundary
layer devoid of free chain ends, requiring modifications of the theoretical
analysis. While this ""end exclusion zone"" has been successfully incorporated
into descriptions of brushes grafted onto the outer surfaces of cylinders and
spheres, the behavior of brushes on surfaces of arbitrary curvature has not yet

a sequence of sentences making it easier to read and understand while
preserving the content and approximating the original meaning. Text
simplification has been exploited in NLP applications like machine translation,
summarization, semantic role labeling, and information extraction, opening a
broad avenue for its exploitation in comprehension-based question-answering
downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the effect of text
simplification in the task of question-answering using a comprehension context.
We release Simple-SQuAD, a simplified version of the widely-used SQuAD dataset.
  Firstly, we outline each step in the dataset creation pipeline, including
style transfer, thresholding of sentences showing correct transfer, and offset
finding for each answer. Secondly, we verify the quality of the transferred
sentences through various methodologies involving both automated and human
evaluation. Thirdly, we benchmark the newly created corpus and perform an
ablation study for examining the effect of the simplification process in the
SQuAD-based question answering task. Our experiments show that simplification
leads to up to 2.04% and 1.74% increase in Exact Match and F1, respectively.
Finally, we conclude with an analysis of the transfer process, investigating
the types of edits made by the model, and the effect of sentence length on the
transfer model.

during mass transfer episodes the system is in a synchronised and circularised
state. Remarkably, the redback system PSR J1723-2837 has an orbital period
derivative $\dot{P}_{orb}$ too large to be explained by this model. Motivated
by this fact, we investigate the action of tidal forces in between two
consecutive mass transfer episodes for a system under irradiation feedback,
which is a plausible progenitor for PSR J1723-2837. We base our analysis on
Hut's treatment of equilibrium tidal evolution, generalised by considering the
donor as a two layers object that may not rotate as a rigid body. We also
analyse three different relations for the viscosity with the tidal forcing
frequency. We found that the large value measured for $\dot{P}_{orb}$ can be
reached by systems where the donor star rotates slower (by few percent) than
the orbit just after mass transfer episodes. Van Staden & Antoniadis have
observed this object and reported a lack of synchronism, opposite to that
required by the Hut's theory to account for the observed $\dot{P}_{orb}$.
Motivated by this discrepancy, we analyse photometric data obtained by the
spacecraft Kepler second mission K2, with the purpose of identifying the
periods present in PSR J1723-2837. We notice several periods close to those of
the orbit and the rotation. The obtained periods pattern reveals the presence
of a more complex phenomenology, which would not be well described in the frame
of the weak friction model of equilibrium tides.

optical-field configurations classified according to their three lowest
dispersion orders resulting from AD (the axial phase velocity, group velocity,

fields have eluded optics thus far. This gap is due in part to the limited
technical reach of the standard components that provide AD such as gratings and
prisms, but due in part also to misconceptions regarding the set of physically
admissible field configurations that can be accessed via AD. For example, it
has long been thought that AD cannot yield normal group-velocity dispersion in
free space. To rectify this state of affairs, we introduce a 'universal AD
synthesizer': a pulsed-beam shaper that produces a wavelength-dependent
propagation angle with arbitrary spectral profile, thereby enabling access to
all physically admissible field configurations realizable via AD. This
universal AD synthesizer is a versatile tool for preparing pulsed optical
fields for dispersion compensation, optical signal processing, and nonlinear

codebook is generated with up to $2^{m(m+3)/2}$ codewords of length $2^m$,
where each codeword is a unique RM sequence determined by a matrix-vector pair
with binary entries. This allows every device to send $m(m + 3)/2$ bits of
information where an arbitrary number of these bits can be used to represent
the identity of a node, and the remaining bits represent a message. There can
be up to $2^{m(m+3)/2}$ different identities. Using an iterative algorithm, an
access point can estimate the matrix-vector pairs of each nearby device, as

causal relationships among a set of variables from observational data. In
linear non-Gaussian acyclic models (LiNGAM), it can be shown that the true
underlying causal structure can be identified uniquely from merely
observational data. DirectLiNGAM algorithm is a well-known solution to learn
the true causal structure in high dimensional setting. DirectLiNGAM algorithm
executes in a sequence of iterations and it performs a set of comparisons
between pairs of variables in each iteration. Unfortunately, the runtime of
this algorithm grows significantly as the number of variables increases. In
this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm, called ParaLiNGAM, to learn casual

that can reduce the number of comparisons remarkably compared with the

messaging mechanism between workers and derive some mathematical formulations

ParaLiNGAM on GPU, considering hardware constraints. Experimental results on

  Deep Neural Networks","26 pages, 10 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown their success as high-dimensional
function approximators in many applications; however, training DNNs can be
challenging in general. DNN training is commonly phrased as a stochastic
optimization problem whose challenges include non-convexity, non-smoothness,
insufficient regularization, and complicated data distributions. Hence, the
performance of DNNs on a given task depends crucially on tuning
hyperparameters, especially learning rates and regularization parameters. In
the absence of theoretical guidelines or prior experience on similar tasks,
this requires solving many training problems, which can be time-consuming and
demanding on computational resources. This can limit the applicability of DNNs
to problems with non-standard, complex, and scarce datasets, e.g., those
arising in many scientific applications. To remedy the challenges of DNN
training, we propose slimTrain, a stochastic optimization method for training
DNNs with reduced sensitivity to the choice hyperparameters and fast initial
convergence. The central idea of slimTrain is to exploit the separability
inherent in many DNN architectures; that is, we separate the DNN into a
nonlinear feature extractor followed by a linear model. This separability
allows us to leverage recent advances made for solving large-scale, linear,
ill-posed inverse problems. Crucially, for the linear weights, slimTrain does
not require a learning rate and automatically adapts the regularization
parameter. Since our method operates on mini-batches, its computational
overhead per iteration is modest. In our numerical experiments, slimTrain
outperforms existing DNN training methods with the recommended hyperparameter
settings and reduces the sensitivity of DNN training to the remaining
hyperparameters.

transmission between two individuals is important for infection control.
However, analyzing measures of genetic relatedness is complicated due to
correlation arising from the presence of the same individual across multiple
dyadic outcomes, potential spatial correlation caused by unmeasured
transmission dynamics, and the distinctive distributional characteristics of
some of the outcomes. We develop two novel hierarchical Bayesian spatial
methods for analyzing dyadic genetic relatedness data, in the form of patristic
distances and transmission probabilities, that simultaneously address each of
these complications. Using individual-level spatially correlated random effect
parameters, we account for multiple sources of correlation between the outcomes
as well as other important features of their distribution. Through simulation,
we show the limitations of existing approaches in terms of estimating key
associations of interest, and the ability of the new methodology to correct for
these issues across datasets with different levels of correlation. All methods
are applied to Mycobacterium tuberculosis data from the Republic of Moldova
where we identify previously unknown factors associated with disease
transmission and, through analysis of the random effect parameters, key
individuals and areas with increased transmission activity. Model comparisons
show the importance of the new methodology in this setting. The methods are
implemented in the R package GenePair.

  Solvent Ethaline",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Polarizable force fields are gradually becoming a common choice for ionic
soft matter, in particular for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ionic
liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs). The CL&Pol force field
introduced in 2019 is the first general, transferable and polarizable force
field for MD simulations of different types of DESs. The original formulation
contains, however, some problems that appear in simulations of ethaline and may
also have a broader impact. First, the originally proposed atomic diameter
parameters are unbalanced, resulting in too weak interactions between the
chlorides and the hydroxyl groups of the ethylene glycol molecules. This, in
turn, causes an artificial phase separation in long simulations. Second, there
is an overpolarization of chlorides due to strong induced dipoles that give
rise to the presence of peaks and antipeaks at very low $q$-vector values
(\SI{2.4}{\per\nano\meter}) in the partial components of the structure factors.
In physical terms, this is equivalent to overestimated spatial nano-scale
heterogeneity. To correct these problems, we adjusted the chloride-hydroxyl
radial distribution functions against \textit{ab initio} data and then extended
the use of the Tang-Toennis damping function for the chlorides' induced
dipoles. These adjustments correct the problems without losing the robustness
of the CL\&Pol force field. The results were also compared with the
non-polarizable version, the CL&P force field. We expect that the corrections
will facilitate reliable use of the CL&Pol force field for other types of DESs.

Boltzmann collisions of neutrino scatterings. In an idealized angular
distribution of neutrinos with electron-lepton number crossing, we find that
the collision terms of the neutrino scattering enhance the transition
probability of fast flavor conversions as in the previous study. We analyze the
dynamics of fast flavor conversions with collisions in detail based on the
motion of polarization vectors in cylindrical coordinate analogous to a
pendulum motion. The phase of the all polarization vector synchronizes in the
linear evolution, and the phase deviation from the Hamiltonian governs the
conversion of neutrino flavor. In the non-linear evolution, a closed orbit in
the phase space is observed. The collision terms break the closed orbit and
gradually make the phase space smaller. The flavor conversions are enhanced
during this limit cycle. After the significant flavor conversion, all of the
neutrino polarization vectors start to align with the z-axis owing to the
collision effect within the time scale of the collision term irrespective of
neutrino scattering angles. We also show the enhancement or suppression of the
flavor conversions in various setups of the collision terms and verify
consistency with previous studies. Though our analysis does not fully
understand the dynamics of fast flavor conversion, the framework gives a new
insight into this complicated phenomenon in further study.

generalization of obstruction tensors, which are Weyl-covariant tensors that
appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the bulk metric for even
boundary dimensions. We see that these Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as
building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual field theory. We then compute
the Weyl anomaly for $6d$ and $8d$ field theories in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham
formalism, and find that the contribution from the Weyl structure in the bulk
appears as cohomologically trivial modifications. Expressed in terms of the
Weyl-Schouten tensor and extended Weyl-obstruction tensors, the results of the

ability to probe time-dependent microstructural features, though they often
suffer from low SNR due to increased echo times. In this work we introduce
frequency tuned bipolar (FTB) gradients as a variation of oscillating gradients
with reduced echo time and demonstrate their utility by mapping the frequency
dispersion of diffusion kurtosis in human subjects. Methods: An FTB oscillating
gradient waveform is presented that provides encoding of 1.5 net oscillation
periods thereby reducing the echo time of the acquisition. Simulations were
performed to determine an optimal protocol based on SNR of kurtosis frequency
dispersion - defined as the difference in kurtosis between pulsed and
oscillating gradient acquisitions. Healthy human subjects were scanned at 7T
using pulsed gradient and an optimized 23 Hz FTB protocol, which featured a
maximum b-value of 2500 s/mm2. In addition, to directly compare existing
methods, measurements using traditional cosine OGSE were also acquired.
Results: FTB oscillating gradients demonstrated equivalent frequency dependent
diffusion measurements compared to cosine modulated OGSE while enabling a
significant reduction in echo time. Optimization and in vivo results suggest
FTB gradients provide increased SNR of kurtosis dispersion maps compared to
traditional cosine OGSE. The optimized FTB gradient protocol demonstrated
consistent reductions in apparent kurtosis values and increased diffusivity in
generated frequency dispersion maps. Conclusion: This work presents an
alternative to traditional cosine OGSE sequences enabling more time efficient
acquisitions of frequency dependent diffusion quantities as demonstrated
through in vivo kurtosis frequency dispersion maps.

to this work is the part of the phase diagram lying below a specific phase
boundary, $T^{*}_\text{{FL}}(p^{*})$, across which the transport and
thermodynamic properties switch over from non-FL into FL behavior. Remarkably,
this nontrivial manifestation of FL phase is accompanied by (i) the
characteristic $\rho_o + \textit{AT}^2$ dependence ($\rho_o$ = residual
resistivity), (ii) a superconductivity below $T_{c} \leq

defining characteristic is a spatially modulating superconducting energy gap
$\Delta(r)$. Recently, this concept has been generalized to the pair density
wave (PDW) state predicted to exist in a variety of strongly correlated
electronic materials such as the cuprates. Although the signature of a cuprate
PDW has been detected in Cooper-pair tunnelling, the distinctive signature in
single-electron tunneling of a periodic $\Delta(r)$ modulation has never been
observed. Here, using a new approach, we discover strong $\Delta(r)$
modulations in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$+$\delta$ that have eight-unit-cell
periodicity or wavevectors $Q=2{\pi}/a_0(1/8,0)$; $2{\pi}/a_0(0,1/8)$. This
constitutes the first energy-resolved spectroscopic evidence for the cuprate
PDW state. An analysis of spatial arrangements of $\Delta(r)$ modulations then
reveals that this PDW is predominantly unidirectional, but with an arrangement
of nanoscale domains indicative of a vestigial PDW. Simultaneous imaging of the
local-density-of-states $N(r,E)$ reveals electronic modulations with
wavevectors $Q$ and $2Q$, as anticipated when the PDW coexists with
superconductivity. Finally, by visualizing the topological defects in these
$N(r,E)$ density waves at $2Q$, we discover them to be concentrated in areas
where the PDW spatial phase changes by $\pi$, as predicted by the theory of
half-vortices in a PDW state. Overall, this is a compelling demonstration, from
multiple single-electron signatures, of a PDW state coexisting with
superconductivity at zero magnetic field, in the canonical cuprate
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$+$\delta$.

the physical processes that structure such clouds. One of such characteristics
is the $2D$ fractal dimension $D$ of a cloud projected onto the sky plane. In
previous studies, which were mostly based on infrared (IR) data, the fractal
dimension of individual clouds was found to be in a range from 1.1 to 1.7 with
a preferred value of 1.2--1.4. In the present work, we use data from Stripe82
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to measure the fractal dimension of the cirrus
clouds. This is done here for the first time for optical data with
significantly better resolution as compared to IR data. To determine the
fractal dimension, the perimeter-area method is employed. We also consider IR
(IRAS and Herschel) counterparts of the corresponding optical fields to compare
the results between the optical and IR. We find that the averaged fractal
dimension across all clouds in the optical is $\langle D \rangle
=1.69^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ which is significantly larger then the fractal dimension
of its IR counterparts $\langle D\rangle=1.38^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$. We examine
several reasons for this discrepancy (choice of masking and minimal contour
level, image and angular resolution, etc.) and find that for approximately half
of our fields the different angular resolution (point spread function) of the
optical and IR data can explain the difference between the corresponding
fractal dimensions. For the other half of the fields, the fractal dimensions of
the IR and visual data remain inconsistent, which can be associated with
physical properties of the clouds, but further physical simulations are
required to prove it.

depolarised filaments in the $2.3\,\rm GHz$ S-band Polarization All Sky Survey

RM is entirely an outcome of the magnetized supernova shell. Our analysis

marked attribute bias in natural language inference. Bias in downstream
applications can stem from training data, word embeddings, or be amplified by
the model in use. However, focusing on biased word embeddings is potentially
the most impactful first step due to their universal nature. Here we seek to
understand how the intrinsic properties of word embeddings contribute to this
observed marked attribute effect, and whether current post-processing methods
address the bias successfully. An investigation of the current debiasing
landscape reveals two open problems: none of the current debiased embeddings
mitigate the marked attribute error, and none of the intrinsic bias measures
are predictive of the marked attribute effect. By noticing that a new type of
intrinsic bias measure correlates meaningfully with the marked attribute
effect, we propose a new postprocessing debiasing scheme for static word
embeddings. The proposed method applied to existing embeddings achieves new
best results on the marked attribute bias test set. See

neural network (NN) to satisfy a set of properties. We formulate the properties
as a set of predicates that impose constraints on the output of NN over the
target input domain. We define the NN repair problem as a Mixed Integer
Quadratic Program (MIQP) to adjust the weights of a single layer subject to the
given predicates while minimizing the original loss function over the original

affine transformation, correcting an erroneous NN in classification, and
bounding the inputs of a NN controller.

an event is represented by finitely branching trees with respect to any given
arbitrary dynamics. We argue through basic topological properties of Cantor
space that under certain assumptions about the universe, spacetime structure
and causation, given any event $x$, the number of all possible future
worldlines of $x$ within the many-worlds interpretation is uncountable.
However, if all worldlines extending the event $x$ are `eventually
deterministic', then the cardinality of the set of future worldlines with
respect to $x$ is exactly $\aleph_0$, i.e., countably infinite. We also observe
that if there are countably many future worldlines with respect to $x$, then at
least one of them must be necessarily `decidable' in the sense that there is an
algorithm which determines whether or not any given event belongs to that
worldline. We then show that if there are only finitely many worldlines in the

velocity field due to lensing shear, an effect recently reported for the first
time by Gurri et al. based on a sample of 18 galaxies at $z \sim 0.1$. In this
paper, we develop a new formalism that combines the shape information from
imaging surveys with the kinematic information from resolved spectroscopy to
better constrain the lensing distortion of source galaxies and to potentially
address systematic errors that affect conventional weak-lensing analyses. Using
a Bayesian forward model applied to mock galaxy observations, we model
distortions in the source galaxy's velocity field simultaneously with the
apparent shear-induced offset between the kinematic and photometric major axes.
We show that this combination dramatically reduces the statistical uncertainty
on the inferred shear, yielding statistical error gains of a factor of 2--6
compared to kinematics alone. While we have not accounted for errors from
intrinsic kinematic irregularities, our approach opens kinematic lensing
studies to higher redshifts where resolved spectroscopy is more challenging.
For example, we show that ground-based integral-field spectroscopy of
background galaxies at $z \sim 0.7$ can deliver gravitational shear
measurements with S/N $\sim 1$ per source galaxy at 1 arcminute separations
from a galaxy cluster at $z \sim 0.3$. This suggests that even modest samples
observed with existing instruments could deliver improved galaxy cluster mass
measurements and well-sampled probes of their halo mass profiles to large
radii.

digital social networks. Network members are often under pressure from incoming
information with different sources, such as informative campaigns for
increasing awareness, viral marketing, rumours, fake news, or the results of
other activities. Messages are often repeated, and such repetition can improve
performance in the form of cumulative influence. Repeated messages may also be
ignored due to a limited ability to process information. Learning processes are
leading to the repeated messages being ignored, as their content has already
been absorbed. In such cases, responsiveness decreases with repetition, and the
habituation effect can be observed. Here, we analyse spreading processes while
considering the habituation effect and performance drop along with an increased
number of contacts. The the ability to recover when reducing the number of
messages is also considered. The results show that even low habituation and a
decrease in propagation probability may substantially impact network coverage.
This can lead to a significant reduction in the potential for a seed set
selected with an influence maximisation method. Apart from the impact of the
habituation effect on spreading processes, we show how it can be reduced with
the use of the sequential seeding approach. This shows that sequential seeding
is less sensitive to the habituation effect than single-stage seeding, and that
it can be used to limit the negative impact on users overloaded with incoming
messages.

learning in the pursuit of target quantities inspired by causal inference,
including inverse weighting, doubly robust estimating equations and
substitution estimators like targeted maximum likelihood estimation. There are
even more recent augmentations of these procedures that can increase
robustness, by adding a layer of cross-validation (cross-validated targeted
maximum likelihood estimation and double machine learning, as applied to
substitution and estimating equation approaches, respectively). While these
methods have been evaluated individually on simulated and experimental data
sets, a comprehensive analysis of their performance across ``real-world''
simulations have yet to be conducted.
  In this work, we benchmark multiple widely used methods for estimation of the
average treatment effect using ten different nutrition intervention studies
data. A realistic set of simulations, based on a novel method, highly adaptive
lasso, for estimating the data-generating distribution that guarantees a
certain level of complexity (undersmoothing) is used to better mimic the
complexity of the true data-generating distribution. We have applied this novel
method for estimating the data-generating distribution by individual study and
to subsequently use these fits to simulate data and estimate treatment effects
parameters as well as their standard errors and resulting confidence intervals.
Based on the analytic results, a general recommendation is put forth for use of
the cross-validated variants of both substitution and estimating equation
estimators. We conclude that the additional layer of cross-validation helps in
avoiding unintentional over-fitting of nuisance parameter functionals and leads
to more robust inferences.

either provide learned priors to iterative phase retrieval or in some cases
completely replace phase retrieval with networks that learn to recover the lost

vast amounts of labeled data, which can only be obtained through simulation or
performing computationally prohibitive phase retrieval on hundreds of or even
thousands of experimental datasets. Using a 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging modality

demonstrate AutoPhaseNN, a DL-based approach which learns to solve the phase

weak values are only measurable over ensembles, and so to infer properties of
individual particles from values of them is problematic. Finally, weak value
approaches to the path of a particle do not provide information beyond standard

that using both target and non-target events for only one of the phases

parameter and transmit them to a remote receiver. Age of Information (AoI) has
been studied extensively as a metric for the freshness of information in such
systems with and without an enforced hard or soft deadline. In this paper, we
propose three metrics for status update systems to measure the ability of
different queuing systems to meet a threshold requirement for the AoI. The {\em
overage probability} is defined as the probability that the age of the most
recent update packet held by the receiver is larger than the threshold. The
{\em stale update probability} is the probability that an update is stale,
i.e., its age has exceeded the deadline, when it is delivered to the receiver.
Finally, the {\em average overage} is defined as the time average of the
overage (i.e., age beyond the threshold), and is a measure of the average
``staleness'' of the update packets held by the receiver. We investigate these
metrics in three typical status update queuing systems -- M/G/1/1, M/G/1/$2^*$,
and M/M/1. Numerical results show the performances for these metrics under
different parameter settings and different service distributions. The
differences between the average overage and average AoI are also shown. Our
results demonstrate that a lower bound exists for the stale update probability
when the buffer size is limited. Further, we observe that the overage
probability decreases and the stale update probability increases as the update
arrival rate increases.

the two systems at once, allowing parallels to be drawn and contrast to be
created. Also, for DL we manage to obtain two closed form expressions for two
special cases. Moreover, for UL, notorious for being difficult, we develop a
clever approximation that overcomes the difficulty, yielding excellent results.
Additionally, we present two efficient Monte Carlo simulation algorithms,
designed primarily to validate the models, but can be of great use for SG
modelling of communications systems in general. Finally, we prove two theorems
at odds with popular belief in cellular communications research. Specifically,
we prove that under the SG model, the coverage probability in both DL and UL is
independent of BS density. Based on this revelation, a plethora of results in

fields is a topic of recurring interest in condensed matter physics. Recently,
the advent of Weyl and Dirac semimetals has brought about an interesting
platform for potentially uncovering phases of matter that combine nontrivial
band topology and interactions. While electronic instabilities of such
semimetals at strong magnetic fields have been explored theoretically and
experimentally, the role of electron-phonon interactions therein has been
largely neglected. In this paper, we study the interplay of electron-electron
and electron-phonon interactions in a minimal two-node model of Weyl semimetal.
Using a Kadanoff-Wilson renormalization group approach, we analyze lattice
(Peierls) instabilities emerging from chiral and nonchiral Landau levels as a
function of the magnetic field. We consider both the adiabatic and the
nonadiabatic phonon regimes, in the presence or in the absence of improper
symmetries that relate Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. We find that (i) the
Cooper channel, often neglected in recent studies, can prevent purely
electronic instabilities while enabling lattice instabilities that are not
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like; (ii) breaking the improper symmetry that
relates the two Weyl nodes suppresses the Cooper channel, thereby increasing
the critical temperature for the lattice instability; (iii) in the adiabatic
phonon regime, lattice instabilities can preempt purely electronic
instabilities; (iv) pseudoscalar phonons are more prone to undergo a Peierls
instability than scalar phonons. In short, our study emphasizes the importance
of taking electron-phonon interactions into account for a complete
understanding of interacting phases of matter in Dirac and Weyl semimetals at
high magnetic fields.

systems over graphs. In this paper, we consider the recovery of a
$k$-bandlimited graph signal that is an initial signal of a heat diffusion
process from its space-time samples. We propose three random space-time
sampling regimes, termed dynamical sampling techniques, that consist in
selecting a small subset of space-time nodes at random according to some
probability distribution. We show that the number of space-time samples
required to ensure stable recovery for each regime depends on a parameter
called the spectral graph weighted coherence, that depends on the interplay
between the dynamics over the graphs and sampling probability distributions. In
optimal scenarios, no more than $\mathcal{O}(k \log(k))$ space-time samples are
sufficient to ensure accurate and stable recovery of all $k$-bandlimited
signals. In any case, dynamical sampling typically requires much fewer spatial
samples than the static case by leveraging the temporal information. Then, we
propose a computationally efficient method to reconstruct $k$-bandlimited
signals from their space-time samples. We prove that it yields accurate
reconstructions and that it is also stable to noise. Finally, we test dynamical
sampling techniques on a wide variety of graphs. The numerical results support
our theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency.

in a hot IGrM or is generated in the boundary between the hotter IGrM and
cooler gas.

fake news dissemination can be mitigated by promoting greater competence

urgent need for models that can describe the growing infodemic of fake news has

campaigns due to misinformation and generally the inability of individuals to

of individuals through multi-population models in which fake news spreads
analogously to an infectious disease with different impact depending on the
level of competence of individuals. The level of competence, in particular, is
subject to an evolutionary dynamic due to both social interactions between
agents and external learning dynamics. The results show how the model is able

function or designing Markov chain Monte Carlo. Motivated by the seminal work
on distance and isomorphism between metric measure spaces, we propose a new
notion called the Reversible Gromov-Monge (RGM) distance and study how RGM can
be used to design new transform samplers to perform simulation-based inference.
Our RGM sampler can also estimate optimal alignments between two heterogeneous
metric measure spaces $(\cX, \mu, c_{\cX})$ and $(\cY, \nu, c_{\cY})$ from
empirical data sets, with estimated maps that approximately push forward one
measure $\mu$ to the other $\nu$, and vice versa. We study the analytic
properties of the RGM distance and derive that under mild conditions, RGM
equals the classic Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Curiously, drawing a connection
to Brenier's polar factorization, we show that the RGM sampler induces bias
towards strong isomorphism with proper choices of $c_{\cX}$ and $c_{\cY}$.
Statistical rate of convergence, representation, and optimization questions
regarding the induced sampler are studied. Synthetic and real-world examples
showcasing the effectiveness of the RGM sampler are also demonstrated.

both cases, we derive the corresponding macroscopic model and compare it with
the average behaviour of the ABM. We see good agreement between the ABM and the

addressed by using decentralized local observers, and the latter is achieved by
imposing unobservability conditions at the global level. Also, the

on those metastatic, secondary solid lesions that are still undetected and
non-vascularised. By using available experimental data, we analyse the effects

outcomes for secondary lesions are also investigated, showing that actions on
primary lesions could sometimes result in unexpected clearances of secondary

functional approximations improve from the local spin-density approximation

(GGA) to the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, and
their sensitivities to non-spherical components of the density increase in the
same order. Thus, these functional advances increase density sensitivity and
imitate the exact constrained search over correlated wavefunctions better than
that over ensembles. The diatomic molecules studied here, singlet C2 and F2
plus triplet B2 and O2, have cylindrically symmetric densities. Because the
densities of the corresponding atoms are non-spherical, the approximate
Kohn-Sham potentials for the atoms have a lower symmetry than that of the
external (nuclear) potential, so that the non-interacting wavefunctions are not
eigenstates of the square of total orbital angular momentum, breaking a
symmetry that yields a feature of the exact ground-state density. That spatial
symmetry can be preserved by a non-self-consistent approach in which a
self-consistent equilibrium-ensemble calculation is followed by integer
re-occupation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, as the first of several steps. The
symmetry-preserving approach is different from symmetry restoration based upon
projection. First-step space- (and space-spin-) symmetry preservation in atoms
is shown to have a small effect on the atomization energies of molecules,
quantifying earlier observations by Fertig and Kohn. Thus, the standard
Kohn-Sham way of calculating atomization energies, with self-consistent
symmetry breaking to minimize the energy, is justified, at least for the common
cases where the molecules cannot break symmetry.

seen in the the radio loud sub-sample of long GRBs. Additionally binary systems
can lead to rich and extended circumstellar environments that allow for the
presence of the long-lived radio afterglows seen in the radio loud systems.
Finally, the relative fraction of stars in binary systems versus single star
systems appears consistent with the fraction of radio loud versus radio quiet

engineers specify physical structures, from bicycle pedals to airplanes to

intent is encoded not only via geometric primitives, but also by parameterized
constraints between the elements. This relational specification can be viewed
as the construction of a constraint program, allowing edits to coherently
propagate to other parts of the design. Machine learning offers the intriguing
possibility of accelerating the design process via generative modeling of these
structures, enabling new tools such as autocompletion, constraint inference,
and conditional synthesis. In this work, we present such an approach to
generative modeling of parametric CAD sketches, which constitute the basic
computational building blocks of modern mechanical design. Our model, trained
on real-world designs from the SketchGraphs dataset, autoregressively
synthesizes sketches as sequences of primitives, with initial coordinates, and
constraints that reference back to the sampled primitives. As samples from the
model match the constraint graph representation used in standard CAD software,
they may be directly imported, solved, and edited according to downstream
design tasks. In addition, we condition the model on various contexts,
including partial sketches (primers) and images of hand-drawn sketches.
Evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its ability to synthesize
realistic CAD sketches and its potential to aid the mechanical design workflow.

overlay networks operate in fragile environments where processes are
susceptible to faults which may perturb a node's state and the network
topology. Self-stabilizing overlay networks have been proposed as one way to
manage these faults, promising to build or restore a particular topology from
any initial configuration or after the occurrence of any transient fault. To
date there have been several self-stabilizing protocols designed for overlay

topology, or provide very inefficient solutions for a general set of overlay
networks.
  In this paper, we analyze an existing algorithm and show it can be used as a
general framework for building many other self-stabilizing overlay networks.
Our analysis for time and space complexity depends upon several properties of
the target topology itself, providing insight into how topology selection
impacts the complexity of convergence. We then demonstrate the application of
this framework by analyzing the complexity for several existing topologies.
Next, using insights gained from our analysis, we present a new topology
designed to provide efficient performance during convergence with the general
framework. Our process demonstrates how the implications of our analysis help
isolate the factors of interest to allow a network designer to select an

Self-stabilizing overlay networks offer one approach for managing these faults,

the rise velocity as a critical bubble volume is exceeded. The phenomenon has
been extensively investigated in the literature, both by means of experiments
as well as via numerical simulations. The occurrence of the velocity jump has
been associated with a change of the bubble shape under the formation of a
pointed tip at the rear end and to the appearance of a so-called negative wake
with the liquid velocity behind the bubble, pointing in the opposite direction
to that in viscous Newtonian fluids. We revisit this topic, starting with a
review of the state of knowledge on the interrelations between the mentioned
characteristic features. In search for a convincing explanation of the jump
phenomenon, we performed detailed numerical simulations of the transient rise
of single bubbles in 3D, allowing for a local polymer molecular conformation
tensor analysis. The latter shows that polymer molecules traveling along the
upper bubble hemisphere are stretched in the circumferential direction, due to
the flow kinematics. Then, depending on the relaxation time scale of the
polymer, the stored elastic energy is either unloaded essentially above or
below the bubble's equator. In the former case, this slows down the bubble,
while the bubble gets accelerated otherwise. In this latter case, the relative
velocity of the polymer molecules against the bubble is increased, giving rise
to a self-amplification of the effect and thus causing the bubble rise velocity
to jump to a higher level. Detailed experimental velocity measurements in the
liquid field around the bubble confirmed the conclusion that the ratio of the
time scale of the Lagrangian transport of polymer molecules along the bubble
contour to the relaxation time scale of the polymer molecules determines the
sub- or supercritical state of the bubble motion.

performance of forecasting models. This is especially nonnegligible in highly

between groups are extremely complex and dynamic. In this paper, we present
Grouptron, a multi-scale dynamic forecasting framework that leverages
pedestrian group detection and utilizes individual-level, group-level and

pedestrian groups, creates spatio-temporal graphs at the individual, group, and

Recently, some works study the training process of over-parameterized neural
networks, and show that over-parameterized networks can learn functions in some
notable concept classes with a provable generalization error bound. In this
paper, we analyze the training and generalization for RNNs with random
initialization, and provide the following improvements over recent works:
  1) For a RNN with input sequence $x=(X_1,X_2,...,X_L)$, previous works study
to learn functions that are summation of $f(\beta^T_lX_l)$ and require
normalized conditions that $||X_l||\leq\epsilon$ with some very small
$\epsilon$ depending on the complexity of $f$. In this paper, using detailed
analysis about the neural tangent kernel matrix, we prove a generalization
error bound to learn such functions without normalized conditions and show that
some notable concept classes are learnable with the numbers of iterations and
samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.
  2) Moreover, we prove a novel result to learn N-variables functions of input
sequence with the form $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$, which do not belong
to the ""additive"" concept class, i,e., the summation of function $f(X_l)$. And
we show that when either $N$ or $l_0=\max(l_1,..,l_N)-\min(l_1,..,l_N)$ is
small, $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$ will be learnable with the number
iterations and samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.

  Modeling",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Disease progression modeling (DPM) involves using mathematical frameworks to
quantitatively measure the severity of how certain disease progresses. DPM is
useful in many ways such as predicting health state, categorizing disease
stages, and assessing patients disease trajectory etc. Recently, with wider
availability of electronic health records (EHR) and the broad application of
data-driven machine learning method, DPM has attracted much attention yet
remains two major challenges: (i) Due to the existence of irregularity,
heterogeneity and long-term dependency in EHRs, most existing DPM methods might
not be able to provide comprehensive patient representations. (ii) Lots of
records in EHRs might be irrelevant to the target disease. Most existing models
learn to automatically focus on the relevant information instead of explicitly
capture the target-relevant events, which might make the learned model
suboptimal. To address these two issues, we propose Temporal Clustering with
External Memory Network (TC-EMNet) for DPM that groups patients with similar
trajectories to form disease clusters/stages. TC-EMNet uses a variational
autoencoder (VAE) to capture internal complexity from the input data and
utilizes an external memory work to capture long term distance information,
both of which are helpful for producing comprehensive patient states. Last but
not least, k-means algorithm is adopted to cluster the extracted comprehensive
patient states to capture disease progression. Experiments on two real-world
datasets show that our model demonstrates competitive clustering performance
against state-of-the-art methods and is able to identify clinically meaningful
clusters. The visualization of the extracted patient states shows that the
proposed model can generate better patient states than the baselines.

from the Crab nebula, opening an ultra-high energy window for studying the

highest-energy end shows a possible hardening, which could indicate the
presence of a new component. A two-component scenario with a main electron
component and a secondary proton component has been proposed to explain the
whole spectrum of the Crab Nebula, requiring a proton energy of
$10^{46}-10^{47}{\rm ergs}$ remaining in the present Crab Nebula. In this
paper, we study the energy content of relativistic protons in pulsar winds with
the LHAASO data of the Crab Nebula, considering the effect of diffusive escape
of relativistic protons. Depending on the extent of the escape of relativistic
protons, the total energy of protons lost in the pulsar wind could be 10-100
times larger than that remaining in the nebula presently. We find that the
current LHAASO data allows up to $(10-50)\%$ of the spindown energy of pulsars
being converted into relativistic protons. The escaping protons from PWNe could
make a considerable contribution to the cosmic-ray flux of 10-100 PeV. We also

reinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing
neural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks. However, despite this
empirical success, these controllers still lack theoretical guarantees on their
performance, such as Lyapunov stability (i.e., all trajectories of the
closed-loop system are guaranteed to converge to a goal state under the control
policy). This is in stark contrast to traditional model-based controller
design, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable
controllers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic
method to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with
a neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our
approach formulates the Lyapunov condition verification as a mixed-integer
linear program (MIP). Our MIP verifier either certifies the Lyapunov condition,
or generates counter examples that can help improve the candidate controller
and the Lyapunov function. We also present an optimization program to compute
an inner approximation of the region of attraction for the closed-loop system.
We apply our approach to robots including an inverted pendulum, a 2D and a 3D

safely deploying machine learning models in the open-world environment.
Improved methods for OOD detection in multi-class classification have emerged,
while OOD detection methods for multi-label classification remain underexplored
and use rudimentary techniques. We propose JointEnergy, a simple and effective
method, which estimates the OOD indicator scores by aggregating energy scores
from multiple labels. We show that JointEnergy can be mathematically
interpreted from a joint likelihood perspective. Our results show consistent
improvement over previous methods that are based on the maximum-valued scores,
which fail to capture joint information from multiple labels. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method on three common multi-label classification
benchmarks, including MS-COCO, PASCAL-VOC, and NUS-WIDE. We show that
JointEnergy can reduce the FPR95 by up to 10.05% compared to the previous best
baseline, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

impossible even with a quantum verifier. In this work, we introduce a novel
compromise, which we call the certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for
QMA. It is a computational zero-knowledge proof for QMA, but the verifier
issues a classical certificate that shows that the verifier has deleted its
quantum information. If the certificate is valid, even unbounded malicious
verifier can no longer learn anything beyond the validity of the statement. We
construct a certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for QMA. For the
construction, we introduce a new quantum cryptographic primitive, which we call
commitment with statistical binding and certified everlasting hiding, where the
hiding property becomes statistical once the receiver has issued a valid
certificate that shows that the receiver has deleted the committed information.
We construct commitment with statistical binding and certified everlasting
hiding from quantum encryption with certified deletion by Broadbent and Islam
[TCC 2020] (in a black box way), and then combine it with the quantum
sigma-protocol for QMA by Broadbent and Grilo [FOCS 2020] to construct the
certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for QMA. Our constructions are
secure in the quantum random oracle model. Commitment with statistical binding
and certified everlasting hiding itself is of independent interest, and there
will be many other useful applications beyond zero-knowledge.

returning to the community, or they can be tested positive during the trip and
remain quarantined until fully recovered. To examine the predictive accuracies

annotated volumetric images for training. To overcome these problems, we
propose a novel convolutional neural network called PF-Net and incorporate it
into a semi-supervised learning framework based on Iterative Confidence-based
Refinement And Weighting of pseudo Labels (I-CRAWL). Our PF-Net combines 2D and
3D convolutions to deal with CT volumes with large inter-slice spacing, and
uses multi-scale guided dense attention to segment complex PF lesions. For
semi-supervised learning, our I-CRAWL employs pixel-level uncertainty-based
confidence-aware refinement to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels of
unannotated images, and uses image-level uncertainty for confidence-based image
weighting to suppress low-quality pseudo labels in an iterative training
process. Extensive experiments with CT scans of Rhesus Macaques with
radiation-induced PF showed that: 1) PF-Net achieved higher segmentation
accuracy than existing 2D, 3D and 2.5D neural networks, and 2) I-CRAWL
outperformed state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for the PF
lesion segmentation task. Our method has a potential to improve the diagnosis

with window size $m$ for accelerating fixed-point methods $x_{k+1}=q(x_{k})$,
$x_k \in R^n$. Convergence acceleration by AA($m$) has been widely observed but
is not well understood. We consider the case where the fixed-point iteration
function $q(x)$ is differentiable and the convergence of the fixed-point method
itself is root-linear. We identify numerically several conspicuous properties
of AA($m$) convergence: First, AA($m$) sequences $\{x_k\}$ converge
root-linearly but the root-linear convergence factor depends strongly on the
initial condition. Second, the AA($m$) acceleration coefficients $\beta^{(k)}$
do not converge but oscillate as $\{x_k\}$ converges to $x^*$. To shed light on
these observations, we write the AA($m$) iteration as an augmented fixed-point
iteration $z_{k+1} =\Psi(z_k)$, $z_k \in R^{n(m+1)}$ and analyze the continuity
and differentiability properties of $\Psi(z)$ and $\beta(z)$. We find that the
vector of acceleration coefficients $\beta(z)$ is not continuous at the fixed
point $z^*$. However, we show that, despite the discontinuity of $\beta(z)$,
the iteration function $\Psi(z)$ is Lipschitz continuous and directionally
differentiable at $z^*$ for AA(1), and we generalize this to AA($m$) with $m>1$
for most cases. Furthermore, we find that $\Psi(z)$ is not differentiable at
$z^*$. We then discuss how these theoretical findings relate to the observed
convergence behaviour of AA($m$). The discontinuity of $\beta(z)$ at $z^*$
allows $\beta^{(k)}$ to oscillate as $\{x_k\}$ converges to $x^*$, and the
non-differentiability of $\Psi(z)$ allows AA($m$) sequences to converge with
root-linear convergence factors that strongly depend on the initial condition.
Additional numerical results illustrate our findings.

  Strategy","ICDM 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a single-agent Monte Carlo based reinforced feature
selection (MCRFS) method, as well as two efficiency improvement strategies,
i.e., early stopping (ES) strategy and reward-level interactive (RI) strategy.
Feature selection is one of the most important technologies in data
prepossessing, aiming to find the optimal feature subset for a given downstream
machine learning task. Enormous research has been done to improve its
effectiveness and efficiency. Recently, the multi-agent reinforced feature
selection (MARFS) has achieved great success in improving the performance of
feature selection. However, MARFS suffers from the heavy burden of
computational cost, which greatly limits its application in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient reinforcement feature
selection method, which uses one agent to traverse the whole feature set, and
decides to select or not select each feature one by one. Specifically, we first
develop one behavior policy and use it to traverse the feature set and generate
training data. And then, we evaluate the target policy based on the training
data and improve the target policy by Bellman equation. Besides, we conduct the
importance sampling in an incremental way, and propose an early stopping
strategy to improve the training efficiency by the removal of skew data. In the
early stopping strategy, the behavior policy stops traversing with a
probability inversely proportional to the importance sampling weight. In
addition, we propose a reward-level interactive strategy to improve the
training efficiency via reward-level external advice. Finally, we design
extensive experiments on real-world data to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method.

  Convergence Analysis","this version resubmitted to journal on Nov 22, 2022",,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anderson acceleration (AA) is widely used for accelerating the convergence of
nonlinear fixed-point methods $x_{k+1}=q(x_{k})$, $x_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$, but
little is known about how to quantify the convergence acceleration provided by
AA. As a roadway towards gaining more understanding of convergence acceleration
by AA, we study AA($m$), i.e., Anderson acceleration with finite window size
$m$, applied to the case of linear fixed-point iterations $x_{k+1}=M x_{k}+b$.
We write AA($m$) as a Krylov method with polynomial residual update formulas,
and derive recurrence relations for the AA($m$) polynomials. Writing AA($m$) as
a Krylov method immediately implies that $k$ iterations of AA($m$) cannot
produce a smaller residual than $k$ iterations of GMRES without restart (but
without implying anything about the relative convergence speed of (windowed)
AA($m$) versus restarted GMRES($m$)). We find that the AA($m$) residual
polynomials observe a periodic memory effect where increasing powers of the
error iteration matrix $M$ act on the initial residual as the iteration number
increases. We derive several further results based on these polynomial residual
update formulas, including orthogonality relations, a lower bound on the AA(1)
acceleration coefficient $\beta_k$, and explicit nonlinear recursions for the
AA(1) residuals and residual polynomials that do not include the acceleration
coefficient $\beta_k$. Using these recurrence relations we also derive new
residual convergence bounds for AA(1) in the linear case, demonstrating how the
per-iteration residual reduction $||r_{k+1}||/||r_{k}||$ depends strongly on
the residual reduction in the previous iteration and on the angle between the
prior residual vectors $r_k$ and $r_{k-1}$. We apply these results to study the
influence of the initial guess on the asymptotic convergence factor of AA(1),
and to study AA(1) residual convergence patterns.

Players need to unearth artifacts hidden in a clod enclosure by using available

uncertainty in the exploration process to bring it closer to how archaeological
discovery happens in real life. Players do not know the shape or features of
the hidden artifact and have to take away the earth gradually but strategically
without hitting the artifact itself. From playtesting sessions with eight
participants, we found that the uncertainty elements are conducive to their

the client-server model with $3f + 1$ servers where up to $f$ servers may
suffer Byzantine faults, but assumes that clients are non-Byzantine. In this
work, we present Byz-Gentlerain, the first causal consistency protocol which
tolerates up to $f$ Byzantine servers among $3f + 1$ servers in each partition
and any number of Byzantine clients. Byz-GentleRain is inspired by the
stabilization mechanism of GentleRain for causal consistency. To prevent causal
violations due to Byzantine faults, Byz-GentleRain relies on PBFT to reach
agreement on a sequence of global stable times and updates among servers, and
only updates with timestamps less than or equal to such common global stable
times are visible to clients. We prove that Byz-GentleRain achieves Byz-CC, the

interesting biological consequences, such as long-period oscillations and
bistable states where two different outcomes can occur depending on the initial

parameter combinations where viral characteristics match well with the tumour
growth rate. Interestingly, the model shows that therapies with a high initial
injection or involving a highly infective virus do not universally result in
successful strategies for eradication. Further, the use of additional, boosting
injection schedules does not always lead to complete eradication. Our
framework, instead, suggests that low viral loads can be in some cases more
effective than high loads, and that a less resilient virus can help avoid high
amplitude oscillations between tumours and virus. Finally, the model points to
a number of interesting findings regarding the role of oscillations and
bistable states between a tumour and an oncolytic virus. Strategies for the
elimination of such fluctuations depend strongly on the initial viral load and
the combination of parameters describing the features of the tumour and virus.

First, most of the important pieces of information in a conversation are
scattered across utterances through multi-party interactions with different
textual styles. Second, dialogues are often informal structures, wherein
different individuals express personal perspectives, unlike text summarization,
tasks that usually target formal documents such as news articles. To address
these issues, we focused on the association between utterances from individual
speakers and unique syntactic structures. Speakers have unique textual styles
that can contain linguistic information, such as voiceprint. Therefore, we
constructed a syntax-aware model by leveraging linguistic information (i.e.,
POS tagging), which alleviates the above issues by inherently distinguishing
sentences uttered from individual speakers. We employed multi-task learning of
both syntax-aware information and dialogue summarization. To the best of our
knowledge, our approach is the first method to apply multi-task learning to the

discriminate speech sounds, segment words, and associate words with their
meanings. While gradual development of such capabilities is unquestionable, the
exact nature of these skills and the underlying mental representations yet
remains unclear. In parallel, computational studies have shown that basic
comprehension of speech can be achieved by statistical learning between speech
and concurrent referentially ambiguous visual input. These models can operate
without prior linguistic knowledge such as representations of linguistic units,
and without learning mechanisms specifically targeted at such units. This has
raised the question of to what extent knowledge of linguistic units, such as
phone(me)s, syllables, and words, could actually emerge as latent
representations supporting the translation between speech and representations
in other modalities, and without the units being proximal learning targets for
the learner. In this study, we formulate this idea as the so-called latent
language hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to
general predictive processing within and across sensory modalities. We review
the extent that the audiovisual aspect of LLH is supported by the existing
computational studies. We then explore LLH further in extensive learning
simulations with different neural network models for audiovisual
cross-situational learning, and comparing learning from both synthetic and real
speech data. We investigate whether the latent representations learned by the
networks reflect phonetic, syllabic, or lexical structure of input speech by
utilizing an array of complementary evaluation metrics related to linguistic

Probably, the main source of the PD state in Tb3RuO7 is the magnetic

nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) in polarization-maintaining (PM) fibers.
The reflectivity of the artificial saturable absorber (SA) is analyzed to
explain the mode-locking mechanism in the laser cavity. Experimentally, three
linear laser schemes that feature repetition rates 94 MHz, 124 MHz and 133 MHz
are systematically investigated. When the pump power is 1100 mW, the 124-MHz
laser cavity delivers highly stable pulses with a single-pulse energy of 0.92
nJ. After the compression, the pulse duration obtained from the 124-MHz fiber
laser is 250 fs, while the corresponding transform-limited pulse duration is
124 fs. The highest fundamental repetition rate that could be achieved in our
experiment is 133 MHz, as mentioned above. The noise characterization has been
performed with different cavity lengths and therefore different net-cavity
dispersion. The 68-fs timing jitter and the 0.01% relative intensity noise
(RIN) of the 133-MHz fiber laser have been realized integrated from 1 kHz to 10
MHz. Furthermore, the root-mean-square (RMS) power fluctuation is 0.35% in 2

fiber oscillator provides a competitive low-noise light source for optical
applications appropriate for complex environments.

consisting of a communication-based cooperative controller and a sensor-based
local controller and derive conditions to achieve global uniform exponential

The switching decision comes from game-theoretic analysis of the attacker and
the defender's interactions. In this framework, the attacker acts as a leader
that chooses whether to engage in malicious activities and the defender decides
which control system to deploy with the help of an anomaly detector. Imperfect
detection reports associate the game with imperfect information. A dedicated
state constraint further enhances safety against bounded but aggressive message
modifications in which a bounded solution may still violate practical
constraint e.g. vehicles nearly crashing. Our formulation uniquely combines
switched systems with security games to strategically improve the safety of
such autonomous vehicle systems.

consequences for societies and the environment. Population growth has come with
higher aggregate human welfare, but also climate change and biodiversity loss.
Based on the well-established empirical association and plausible causal
relationship between economic and population growth, we devised a novel method
for forecasting population based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
Although not mechanistically causal, our model is intuitive, transparent,
replicable, and grounded on historical data. Our central finding is that a
richer world is likely to be associated with a lower population, an effect
especially pronounced in rapidly developing countries. In our baseline
scenario, where GDP per capita follows a business-as-usual trajectory, global
population is projected to reach 9.2 billion in 2050 and peak in 2062. With 50%
higher annual economic growth, population peaks even earlier, in 2056, and
declines to below 8 billion by the end of the century. Without any economic
growth after 2020, however, the global population will grow to 9.9 billion in
2050 continue rising thereafter. Economic growth has the largest effect on
low-income countries. The gap between the highest and lowest GDP scenarios
reaches almost 4 billion by 2100. Education and family planning are important
determinants of population growth, but economic growth is also likely to be a
driver of slowing population growth by changing incentives for childbearing.
Since economic growth could slow population growth, it will offset
environmental impacts stemming from higher per-capita consumption of food,
water, and energy, and work in tandem with technological innovation.

$\left|M_{ee}\right|$. The overall scale of the neutrino mass is found to be
governed by non-zero $\left|M_{ee}\right|$. We have obtained interesting
correlations of relic density of DM($\Omega h^2$) with DM mass $M_1$ and
$\left|M_{ee}\right|$. Using experimental value of DM relic density($\Omega
h^2$), the DM mass $M_1$, is found to be $\mathcal{O}$(1TeV) which is within
reach of collider experiments. Specifically, for all five hybrid textures, the
range of upper bound on DM mass $M_1$ is found to be ($2.27$-$5.31$)TeV.
Another interesting feature of the model is the existence of lower bound on
$|M_{ee}|$ for all allowed hybrid textures except texture $T_5$ which can be
probed in current and future $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments. With high
sensitivities, these experiments shall establish the theoretical status of the

great performance in the training of both supervised and unsupervised machine

empirically as the default tool for training generative adversarial networks
(GANs). On the theory side, however, despite the existence of theoretical
results showing the efficiency of Adam-type methods in minimization problems,
the reason of their wonderful performance still remains absent in GAN's
training. In existing works, the fast convergence has long been considered as
one of the most important reasons and multiple works have been proposed to give
a theoretical guarantee of the convergence to a critical point of min-max
optimization algorithms under certain assumptions. In this paper, we firstly
argue empirically that in GAN's training, Adam does not converge to a critical
point even upon successful training: Only the generator is converging while the
discriminator's gradient norm remains high throughout the training. We name
this one-sided convergence. Then we bridge the gap between experiments and
theory by showing that Adam-type algorithms provably converge to a one-sided
first order stationary points in min-max optimization problems under the
one-sided MVI condition. We also empirically verify that such one-sided MVI
condition is satisfied for standard GANs after trained over standard data sets.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first result which provides an
empirical observation and a strict theoretical guarantee on the one-sided
convergence of Adam-type algorithms in min-max optimization.

a powerful and versatile method for sampling quantum states in accordance with
any desired properties that can be stated as inequalities. We apply the SCMC
algorithm to the generation of samples of bound entangled states; for example,
we obtain nearly ten thousand bound entangled two-qutrit states in a few
minutes -- a colossal speed-up over independence sampling, which yields less
than ten such states per day. In the second application, we draw samples of
high-dimensional quantum states from a narrowly peaked target distribution and
observe that SCMC sampling remains efficient as the dimension grows. In yet
another application, the SCMC algorithm produces uniformly distributed quantum
states in regions bounded by values of the problem-specific target
distribution; such samples are needed when estimating parameters from the
probabilistic data acquired in quantum experiments.

permutations of global indices of nodes, variable orderings within a factor,
and variable assignment orderings. However, existing neural network-based
inference procedures fail to take advantage of this inductive bias. In this
paper, we precisely characterize these isomorphic properties of factor graphs
and propose two inference models: Factor-Equivariant Neural Belief Propagation
(FE-NBP) and Factor-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (FE-GNN). FE-NBP is a
neural network that generalizes BP and respects each of the above properties of
factor graphs while FE-GNN is an expressive GNN model that relaxes an
isomorphic property in favor of greater expressivity. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both real-world and synthetic datasets, for both marginal
inference and MAP inference, that FE-NBP and FE-GNN together cover a range of
sample complexity regimes: FE-NBP achieves state-of-the-art performance on
small datasets while FE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on large
datasets.

modelling approach to study the rotation curves of these galaxies, which allow
us to dynamically calculate the physical properties associated with the baryons

the latter we employ the NFW and the Burkert halo profiles, separately. At the
end, we compare the results of both cases with state-of-the-art cosmological
galaxy simulations (EAGLE, TNG100 and TNG50). We find that the {\em cored} dark

outcome of hydrodynamical galaxy simulations. Remarkably, we found that the
dark matter core of $z\sim 1$ star-forming galaxies are smaller and denser than
their local counterparts. We conclude that dark matter halos have gradually
expanded over the past 6.5 Gyrs. That is, observations are capable of capturing
the dark matter response to the baryonic processes (e.g. feedbacks), and thus
giving us the first empirical evidence of {\em gravitational potential

(ES) populated above $\simeq$ 10 keV, for both parent and daughter nuclei. We
find increases in the half-lives for $T>10^8$ K (by more than a factor 3 for

our method in view of these previous calculations. An important impact on
half-lives comes from nuclear ES decays, while including electronic
temperatures yields further increases of about 20\% at energies 10-30 keV,
typical of AGB stars of moderate mass ($M \lesssim 8~M_{\odot}$). Despite
properly considering these effects, the new rates remain sensitively lower than
the TY values, implying longer half-lives at least above 8-9 keV. Our rate
predictions are in substantial accord with recent results based on the shell

aims at protecting the privacy of each user's individual model while allowing
for their global aggregation. It can be applied to any aggregation-based FL
approach for training a global or personalized model. Model aggregation needs
to also be resilient against likely user dropouts in FL systems, making its
design substantially more complex. State-of-the-art secure aggregation
protocols rely on secret sharing of the random-seeds used for mask generations
at the users to enable the reconstruction and cancellation of those belonging
to the dropped users. The complexity of such approaches, however, grows
substantially with the number of dropped users. We propose a new approach,
named LightSecAgg, to overcome this bottleneck by changing the design from
""random-seed reconstruction of the dropped users"" to ""one-shot aggregate-mask
reconstruction of the active users via mask encoding/decoding"". We show that
LightSecAgg achieves the same privacy and dropout-resiliency guarantees as the
state-of-the-art protocols while significantly reducing the overhead for
resiliency against dropped users. We also demonstrate that, unlike existing
schemes, LightSecAgg can be applied to secure aggregation in the asynchronous
FL setting. Furthermore, we provide a modular system design and optimized
on-device parallelization for scalable implementation, by enabling
computational overlapping between model training and on-device encoding, as
well as improving the speed of concurrent receiving and sending of chunked
masks. We evaluate LightSecAgg via extensive experiments for training diverse
models on various datasets in a realistic FL system with large number of users
and demonstrate that LightSecAgg significantly reduces the total training time.

the one between a pseudoscalar meson and a vector meson is repulsive or weakly
attractive; and the one between two pseudoscalar mesons is always repulsive.
However, there is still some exception. The interaction of the $IJ=00$ $\pi\pi$

methods to explore BH quantum properties by using the related properties of the
quantum deformed black hole. In this work, we study the effect of quantum
deformed black hole on BH shadow in two-dimensional Dilaton gravity. In this
model, quantum effects are reflected on the quantum correction parameter m. By
calculation, we find that: (1) the shape of the shadow boundary of a rotating
black hole is determined by the BH spin $a$, the quantum correction parameter
$m$ and the BH type parameter $n$; (2) when the spin $a=0$, the shape of the BH
shadow is a perfect circle; when $a\neq 0$, the shape is distorted; if the
quantum correction parameter $m=0$, their shapes reduce to the cases of
Schwarzschild BH and Kerr BH respectively; (3) the degree of distortion of the
BH shadow is different for various quantum correction parameters $m$; with the
increase of the values of $m$, the shadow will become more and more obvious;
(4) the results of different BH type parameter $n$ differ greatly. Since the
value of $m$ in actual physics should be very small, the current observations
of EHT cannot distinguish quantum effect from BH shadow, and can only constrain
the upper limit of $m$. In future BH shadow measurements, it will be possible
to distinguish quantum deformed black holes, which will help to better
understand the quantum effects of BHs.

energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, the
supervised training of SNNs remains a hard problem due to the discontinuity of
the spiking neuron model. Most existing methods imitate the backpropagation
framework and feedforward architectures for artificial neural networks, and use
surrogate derivatives or compute gradients with respect to the spiking time to
deal with the problem. These approaches either accumulate approximation errors
or only propagate information limitedly through existing spikes, and usually
require information propagation along time steps with large memory costs and
biological implausibility. In this work, we consider feedback spiking neural
networks, which are more brain-like, and propose a novel training method that
does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. First, we show
that the average firing rates of SNNs with feedback connections would gradually
evolve to an equilibrium state along time, which follows a fixed-point
equation. Then by viewing the forward computation of feedback SNNs as a
black-box solver for this equation, and leveraging the implicit differentiation
on the equation, we can compute the gradient for parameters without considering
the exact forward procedure. In this way, the forward and backward procedures
are decoupled and therefore the problem of non-differentiable spiking functions
is avoided. We also briefly discuss the biological plausibility of implicit
differentiation, which only requires computing another equilibrium. Extensive
experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate the superior performance of our method for feedback models with

critical in quantitative imaging and diagnosis. Convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), which are state of the art, have limitations owing to the lack of
image-specific adaptation, such as low tissue contrasts and structural
inhomogeneities, thereby leading to incomplete segmentation results. This paper
presents a deep learning based automatic segmentation framework for knee tissue
segmentation. A novel multipath CNN-based method is proposed, which consists of
an encoder decoder-based segmentation network in combination with a low rank
tensor-reconstructed segmentation network. Low rank reconstruction in MRI
tensor sub-blocks is introduced to exploit the structural and morphological
variations in knee tissues. To further improve the segmentation from CNNs,
trimap generation, which effectively utilizes superimposed regions, is proposed
for defining high, medium and low confidence regions from the multipath CNNs.
The secondary path with low rank reconstructed input mitigates the conditions
in which the primary segmentation network can potentially fail and overlook the
boundary regions. The outcome of the segmentation is solved as an alpha matting
problem by blending the trimap with the source input. Experiments on
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) datasets and a self prepared scan validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. We specifically demonstrate the
application of the proposed method in a cartilage segmentation based thickness

sub-sample of the observed short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The recent discovery
of the short GRB 200415A in the nearby galaxy NGC 253 established a
textbook-version connection between these two phenomena. Unlike previous
observations of the Galactic MGFs, the unsaturated instrument spectra of GRB
200415A provide for the first time an opportunity to test the theoretical
models with the observed $\gamma$-ray photons. This paper proposed a new
readily fit-able model for the MGFs, which invokes an expanding fireball
Comptonized by the relativistic magnetar wind at photosphere radius. In this
model, a large amount of energy is released from the magnetar crust due to the
magnetic reconnection or the starquakes of the star surface and is injected
into confined field lines, forming a trapped fireball bubble. After breaking
through the shackles and expanding to the photospheric radius, the thermal
photons of the fireball are eventually Comptonized by the relativistic
$e^{\pm}$ pairs in the magnetar wind region, which produces additional
higher-energy gamma-ray emission. The model predicts a modified thermal-like
spectrum characterized by a low-energy component in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime,
a smooth component affected by coherent Compton scattering (CC) in the
intermediate energy range, and a high-energy tail due to the inverse Compton
process. By performing a Monte-Carlo fit to the observational spectra of GRB

space-based gravitational-wave observatory LISA. The hunt for these is beset by
many open theoretical and computational problems in both source modeling and
data analysis. We draw attention here to one of the most poorly understood: the
phenomenon of non-local correlations in the space of
extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral signals. Such correlations are ubiquitous in the
continuum of possible signals (degeneracy), and severely hinder the search for
actual signals in LISA data. However, they are unlikely to manifest in a
realistic set of putative signals (confusion). We develop an inventory of new
analysis tools in order to conduct an extensive qualitative study of degeneracy
- its nature, causes, and implications. Previously proposed search strategies
for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals are reviewed in the light of our results, and
additional guidelines are suggested for the scientific analysis of such
sources.

This way, we can retain details in areas of interest at higher map resolutions

achieve a compact map representation of the environment. We evaluate the
performance of our approach on both synthetic and real-world data. Results show
that our method is more efficient in terms of mapping time and memory

the agents through a contract, based on the observed outcome.
  Our main results are for the case where the task delegated to the agent is a
project, which can be successful or not. We show that if the success
probability as a function of the set of actions is gross substitutes, then an
optimal contract can be computed with polynomially many value queries, whereas
if it is submodular, the optimal contract is NP-hard. All our results extend to
linear contracts for higher-dimensional outcome spaces, which we show to be

Nevertheless, these important enabling technologies have been studied
separately in most existing works. This article proposes a novel cooperative
task offloading and block mining (TOBM) scheme for a blockchain-based MEC
system where each edge device not only handles data tasks but also deals with
block mining for improving the system utility. To address the latency issues
caused by the blockchain operation in MEC, we develop a new Proof-of-Reputation

multi-objective function is then formulated to maximize the system utility of
the blockchain-based MEC system, by jointly optimizing offloading decision,
channel selection, transmit power allocation, and computational resource
allocation. We propose a novel distributed deep reinforcement learning-based
approach by using a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm.
We then develop a game-theoretic solution to model the offloading and mining
competition among edge devices as a potential game, and prove the existence of
a pure Nash equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate the significant system

the majority model, in each round all nodes simultaneously update their color
to the most frequent color among their connections.
  Experiments on the graph data from the real world social networks (SNs)
suggest that if all nodes in an extremely small set of high-degree nodes, often
referred to as the elites, agree on a color, that color becomes the dominant
color at the end of the process. We propose two countermeasures that can be
adopted by individual nodes relatively easily and guarantee that the elites
will not have this disproportionate power to engineer the dominant output
color. The first countermeasure essentially requires each node to make some new
connections at random while the second one demands the nodes to be more
reluctant towards changing their color (opinion). We verify their effectiveness
and correctness both theoretically and experimentally.
  We also investigate the majority model and a variant of it when the initial
coloring is random on the real world SNs and several random graph models. In

for given data without human expert opinion. We use two types of techniques,
neural networks and boosted decision trees. We concluded, based on our
experiments, that:
  1) Our selection framework recommends various pivot rules that improve
overall total performance over just using a fixed default pivot rule.
  Over many years experts identified steepest-edge pivot rule as a favorite
pivot rule. Our data analysis corroborates that the number of iterations by
steepest-edge is no more than 4 percent more than the optimal selection which
corroborates human expert knowledge, but this time the knowledge was obtained
using machine learning. Here our recommendation system is best when using
gradient boosted trees.
  2) For the all-pairs shortest path problem, the models trained made a large
improvement and our selection is on average .07 percent away from the optimal
choice. The conclusions do not seem to be affected by the machine learning
method we used.
  We tried to make a parallel analysis of both algorithmic problems, but it is
clear that there are intrinsic differences. For example, in the all-pairs
shortest path problem the graph density is a reasonable predictor, but there is
no analogous single parameter for decisions in the Simplex method.

data. While the problem of inverting deep models to synthesize images from the
training distribution has been explored, our goal is to develop a deep
inversion approach to generate counterfactual explanations for a given query
image. Despite their effectiveness in conditional image synthesis, we show that
existing deep inversion methods are insufficient for producing meaningful
counterfactuals. We propose DISC (Deep Inversion for Synthesizing
Counterfactuals) that improves upon deep inversion by utilizing (a) stronger
image priors, (b) incorporating a novel manifold consistency objective and (c)
adopting a progressive optimization strategy. We find that, in addition to
producing visually meaningful explanations, the counterfactuals from DISC are
effective at learning classifier decision boundaries and are robust to unknown
test-time corruptions.

Coriolis force terms have been investigated. When the flow is strongly
stratified, the wave frequencies of the convectively coupled model are almost
the same as those of shallow water model. However, when the flow is weakly
stratified, the wave frequencies are constrained by the buoyancy frequency. The
non-traditional Coriolis terms affect the widths and phases of the equatorial

parameter. Phase shift occurs when the non-traditional Coriolis parameter is
included. Magnetic effect is significant when the magnetic field is strong. We
have applied the model in the solar atmosphere and solar tachocline to explain
the Rieger type periodicities. For the solar atmosphere, when magnetic effect
is taken into account, we find that the magnetic field should be smaller than
$5G$ in the solar photosphere. Otherwise, the Rieger type periodicities can be
only attributed to long Rossby waves. For the solar tachocline, we find that
magnetic field of the solar tachocline should be smaller than $50kG$ to observe

calibration GNN model (CaGCN) to learn the calibration function. CaGCN is able
to obtain a unique transformation from logits of GNNs to the calibrated
confidence for each node, meanwhile, such transformation is able to preserve
the order between classes, satisfying the accuracy-preserving property.
Moreover, we apply the calibration GNN to self-training framework, showing that
more trustworthy pseudo labels can be obtained with the calibrated confidence
and further improve the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

appearance of large-scale vortices. However, the sustaining mechanism of these
large-scale vortices remains unclear. One possible mechanism is that these
large-scale vortices are driven by rotating convection. Here we present
numerical simulation results on rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection
at a small Prandtl number $Pr=0.1$ (close to the turbulent Prandtl numbers of
Jupiter and Saturn). We have identified four flow regimes in our simulation:
multiple small vortices, coexisted large-scale cyclone and anticyclone,
large-scale cyclone, and turbulence. The formation of large-scale vortices
requires two conditions to be satisfied: the vertical Reynolds number is large
($Re_{z}\ge 400$), and the Rossby number is small ($Ro\leq 0.4$). Large-scale
cyclone first appears when $Ro$ decreases to be smaller than 0.4. When $Ro$
further decreases to be smaller than 0.1, coexisted large-scale anticyclone
emerges. We have studied the heat transfer in rapidly rotating convection. The
result reveals that the heat transfer is more efficient in the anticyclonic
region than in the cyclonic region. Besides, we find that 2D effect increases
and 3D effect decreases in transporting convective flux as rotation rate
increases. We find that aspect ratio has an effect on the critical Rossby
number for the emergence of large-scale vortices. Our results provide helpful
insights on understanding the dynamics of large-scale vortices in gas giants.

corresponding Fresnel laws at the boundaries. Moreover, cavities based on
single-layer and double-layer graphene exhibit Klein- and anti-Klein tunneling,
respectively, leading to distinct differences with respect to dwell times and
resulting emission profiles of the cavity states. Moreover, we find a variety
of different emission characteristics depending on the position of the source
where charge carriers are fed into the cavites. Combining quantum mechanical
simulations with optical ray tracing and a corresponding phase-space analysis,
we demonstrate strong confinement of the emitted charge carriers in the mid
field of single-layer graphene systems and can relate this to a lensing effect.
For bilayer graphene, trapping of the resonant states is more efficient and the
emission characteristics do less depend on the source position.

the study of behavior and its relation to population structure. However, as
different rules and factors are added or altered, the dynamics of spatial
models often become increasingly complicated to interpret. To tackle this
problem, we introduce persistent homology as a rigorous framework that can be
used to both define and compute higher-order features of data in a manner which
is invariant to parameter choices, robust to noise, and independent of human
observation. Our work demonstrates its relevance for spatial games by showing
how topological features of simulation data that persist over different spatial
scales reflect the stability of strategies in 2D lattice games. To do so, we
analyze the persistent homology of scenarios from two games: a Prisoner's
Dilemma and a SIRS epidemic model. The experimental results show how the method
accurately detects features that correspond to real aspects of the game
dynamics. Unlike other tools that study dynamics of spatial systems, persistent
homology can tell us something meaningful about population structure while
remaining neutral about the underlying structure itself. Regardless of game
complexity, since strategies either succeed or fail to conform to shapes of a
certain topology there is much potential for the method to provide novel
insights for a wide variety of spatially extended systems in biology, social
science, and physics.

services (QoS), data privacy and system security vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we propose a new decentralized health architecture, called BEdgeHealth
that integrates MEC and blockchain for data offloading and data sharing in
distributed hospital networks. First, a data offloading scheme is proposed
where mobile devices can offload health data to a nearby MEC server for
efficient computation with privacy awareness. Moreover, we design a data
sharing scheme which enables data exchanges among healthcare users by
leveraging blockchain and interplanetary file system. Particularly, a smart
contract-based authentication mechanism is integrated with MEC to perform
decentralized user access verification at the network edge without requiring
any central authority. The real-world experiment results and evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BEdgeHealth architecture in terms
of improved QoS with data privacy and security guarantees, compared to the
existing schemes.

one of the major concern of many enterprise networks. As a common approach to
counter these attacks, security staff deploy a variety of security and
non-security sensors at different lines of defense (Network, Host, and
Application) to track the attacker's behaviors during their kill chain.
However, one of the drawbacks of this approach is the huge amount of events
raised by heterogeneous security and non-security sensors which makes it
difficult to analyze logged events for later processing i.e. event correlation
for timely detection of APT attacks. Till now, some research papers have been
published on event aggregation for reducing the volume of logged low-level
events. However, most research works have been provided a method to aggregate
the events of a single-type and homogeneous event source i.e. NIDS. In
addition, their main focus is only on the degree to which the event volume is
reduced, while the amount of security information lost during the event
aggregation process is also very important. In this paper, we propose a
three-phase event aggregation method to reduce the volume of logged
heterogeneous events during APT attacks considering the lowest rate of loss of
security information. To this aim, at first, low-level events of the sensors
are clustered into some similar event groups and then, after filtering noisy
event clusters, the remained clusters are summarized based on an
Attribute-Oriented Induction (AOI) method in a controllable manner to reduce
the unimportant or duplicated events. The method has been evaluated on the
three publicly available datasets: SotM34, Bryant, and LANL. The experimental
results show that the method is efficient enough in event aggregation and can
reduce events volume up to 99.7\% with an acceptable level of information loss
ratio (ILR).

Decomposition) is used to reduce the background noise in non-stationary
signals, which represent the forces measured in scaled model testing of the
emergency water landing of aircraft, generally referred to as ditching.
Ditching tests are performed at a constant horizontal speed of 12 m/s and a
vertical velocity at the beginning of the impact of 0.45 m/s. The measured data
are affected by a large amplitude broadband noise, which has both mechanical
and electronic origin. Noise sources cannot be easily avoided or removed, since
they are associated with the vibrations of the structure of the towing carriage
and to the interaction between the measurement chain and the electromagnetic
fields. The EEMD noise reduction method is based on the decomposition of the
signal into modes and on its partial reconstruction using the residue, the
signal-dominant modes and some further modes treated with a thresholding
technique, which helps to retain some of the sharp features of the signal. The
strategy is developed and tested first on a synthetic signal with a
superimposed and known background noise. The method is then verified on the
measurement of the inertial force acting on the fuselage when it is moving in
air, as in this case the added mass is negligible and the denoised force should
equal the product of the mass by the acceleration, both of them being known.
Finally, the procedure is applied to denoise the forces measured during the
actual ditching experiments. The results are superior to those obtained by
other classical filtering methods, such as a moving average filter and a
low-pass FIR filter, particularly due to the enhanced capabilities of the
EEMD-denoising strategy here developed to preserve the sharp features of the
signals and to reduce the residual low-frequency oscillations of spurious
origin.

($\lambda_{c}$=8.7$\mu$m, $\Delta\lambda$=1.1$\mu$m) using the CanariCam

nearest stellar systems within 5 pc of the Sun at declinations $\delta >
-25^{\circ}$ (at least half have planets from radial velocity), reaching a mean
detection limit of 11.3$\pm$0.2 mag (1.5 mJy) in the Si-2 8.7$\mu$m band over a
range of angular separations from 1 to 10 arcsec. This would have allowed us to
uncover substellar companions at projected orbital separations between $\sim$2
and 50 au, with effective temperatures down to 600 K and masses greater than 30
$M_{Jup}$ assuming an average age of 5 Gyr and down to the deuterium-burning
mass limit for objects with ages $<$1 Gyr. From the non-detection of such
companions, we determined upper limits on their occurrence rate at depths and
orbital separations yet unexplored by deep imaging programs. For the M dwarfs,
main components of our sample, we found with a 90% confidence level that less

is an important property of the solar magnetic field, but it is not well
constrained. One consequence is that it is a challenge for surface flux
transport models (SFTMs) based on sunspot observations to determine the details
of BMR emergence, which they require as input, from such data. We aimed to
establish the relationship between the amount of magnetic flux in newly emerged
BMRs and the area of the enclosed sunspots. Earlier attempts to constrain BMR
magnetic flux were hindered by the fact that there is no proper database of the
magnetic and physical properties of newly emerged BMRs currently available. We
made use of the empirical model of the relationship between the disc-integrated
facular and network magnetic flux and the total surface coverage by sunspots
reported in a recent study. The structure of the model is such that it enabled
us to establish, from these disc-integrated quantities, an empirical
relationship between the magnetic flux and sunspot area of individual newly
emerged BMRs, circumventing the lack of any proper BMR database. Applying the
constraint on BMR magnetic flux derived here to an established SFTM retained
its ability to replicate various independent datasets and the correlation
between the model output polar field at the end of each cycle and the observed
strength of the following cycle. The SFTM output indicates that facular and
network magnetic flux rises with increasing sunspot magnetic flux at a slowing
rate such that it appears to gradually saturate, analogous to earlier studies.
The activity dependence of the ratio of facular and network flux to sunspot
flux is consistent with the findings of recent studies: although the Sun is
faculae-dominated, it is only marginally so as facular and network brightening
and sunspot darkening appear to be closely balanced.

coalescence of jet-excited medium partons.Since the lost energy from jets can
diffuse to large angles, such baryon-to-meson-ratio enhancement is more
pronounced for larger relative distance from the jet axis.We argue that the

frequency constraints and natural gas system (NGS) operational constraints and
addresses the wind power uncertainty by designing DR joint chance constraints.
We show that this model admits a mixed-integer second-order cone programming.

regime switching model (RSM) map has been proposed to take advantage of these
numerous PSF-subtraction techniques; RSM uses several of these techniques to
generate a single probability map. Selection of the optimal parameters for

definition of the optimal set of parameters for the PSF-subtraction techniques
using the contrast as performance metric, (ii) optimisation of the RSM
algorithm, and (iii) selection of the optimal set of PSF-subtraction techniques
and ADI sequences used to generate the final RSM probability map. The
optimisation procedure is applied to the data sets of the exoplanet imaging

we characterize the performance of a commercial Google Edge TPU, using 24
Google edge NN models (which span a wide range of NN model types) and analyzing
each NN layer within each model. We find that the Edge TPU suffers from three
major shortcomings: (1) it operates significantly below peak computational
throughput, (2) it operates significantly below its theoretical energy
efficiency, and (3) its memory system is a large energy and performance

design of the Edge TPU ignores the high degree of heterogeneity both across
different NN models and across different NN layers within the same NN model,
leading to the shortcomings we observe.
  We propose a new acceleration framework called Mensa. Mensa incorporates
multiple heterogeneous edge ML accelerators (including both on-chip and
near-data accelerators), each of which caters to the characteristics of a
particular subset of NN models and layers. During NN inference, for each NN
layer, Mensa decides which accelerator to schedule the layer on, taking into
account both the optimality of each accelerator for the layer and
layer-to-layer communication costs. Averaged across all 24 Google edge NN

On the other hand, these models do not holistically or accurately capture the
effects of real-world RF front-end components. Recently, machine learning-based
algorithms have been proposed to estimate these impairments. However, these
algorithms are not capable of estimating multiple RF impairments jointly, which
leads to limited estimation accuracy. In this paper, the joint estimation of
multiple RF impairments by exploiting the relationship between them is
proposed. To do this, a deep multi-task learning-based algorithm is designed.
Extensive simulation results reveal that the performance of the proposed joint

technique to obtain the following bound. Let $K$ be a number field, $S$ a
finite set of places of $K$, and $f\in \mathfrak{o}_{K,S}[t]$ monic of degree
$d\geq 5$ with discriminant $\Delta_f\in \mathfrak{o}_{K,S}^\times$. Then:
$$\#|\{(x,y) : x,y\in \mathfrak{o}_{K,S}, y^2 = f(x)\}|\leq
2^{\mathrm{rank}\,\mathrm{Jac}(C_f)(K)}\cdot O(1)^{d^3\cdot ([K:\mathbb{Q}] +
\#|S|)}.$$
  This improves bounds of Evertse-Silverman and Bombieri-Gubler from $1986$ and
$2006$, respectively.
  The main point underlying our improvement is that, informally speaking, we
insist on ""executing the descents in the presence of only one root (and not
three) until the last possible moment"".

near-term quantum hardware is essential for any convincing demonstration of
quantum advantage. Indeed, in many cases it has been shown that noise renders
quantum circuits efficiently classically simulable, thereby destroying any
quantum advantage potentially offered by an ideal (noiseless) implementation of
these circuits.
  Although the technique of quantum error correction (QEC) allows to correct
these errors very accurately, QEC usually requires a large overhead of physical
qubits which is not reachable with currently available quantum hardware. This
has been the motivation behind the field of quantum error mitigation, which
aims at developing techniques to correct an important part of the errors in
quantum circuits, while also being compatible with current and near-term
quantum hardware.
  In this work, we present a technique for quantum error mitigation which is
based on a technique from quantum verification, the so-called accreditation
protocol, together with post-selection. Our technique allows for correcting the
expectation value of an observable $O$, which is the output of multiple runs of
noisy quantum circuits, where the noise in these circuits is at the level of
preparations, gates, and measurements. We discuss the sample complexity of our
procedure and provide rigorous guarantees of errors being mitigated under some
realistic assumptions on the noise. Our technique also allows for time
dependant behaviours, as we allow for the output states to be different between
different runs of the accreditation protocol. We validate our findings by
running our technique on currently available quantum hardware.

that operate on the whole graph. The most common approach to this problem
heretofore is graph pooling, where node features are typically averaged or
summed to obtain the graph representations. However, pooling operations like
averaging or summing inevitably cause massive information missing, which may
severely downgrade the final performance. In this paper, we argue what is
crucial to graph-level downstream tasks includes not only the topological
structure but also the distribution from which nodes are sampled. Therefore,
powered by existing Graph Neural Networks (GNN), we propose a new plug-and-play
pooling module, termed as Distribution Knowledge Embedding (DKEPool), where
graphs are rephrased as distributions on top of GNNs and the pooling goal is to
summarize the entire distribution information instead of retaining a certain
feature vector by simple predefined pooling operations. A DKEPool network de
facto disassembles representation learning into two stages, structure learning
and distribution learning. Structure learning follows a recursive neighborhood
aggregation scheme to update node features where structure information is
obtained. Distribution learning, on the other hand, omits node interconnections
and focuses more on the distribution depicted by all the nodes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed DKEPool significantly and
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

first in full detection against existing actuated controllers, then in partial
detection with loss estimates for proportions of connected vehicles. Finally,
from the obtained results, we define thresholds for detection rates with

processing may be effectively applied to represent and interpret social
cognition processes. From this viewpoint, individuals or, more generally,
social stimuli are thought of as a weighted sum of harmonics with different
frequencies: Low frequencies represent general categories such as gender,
ethnic group, nationality, etc., whereas high frequencies account for personal
characteristics. Individuals are then seen by observers as the output of a
filter that emphasizes a certain range of high or low frequencies. The
selection of the filter depends on the social distance between the observing
individual or group and the person being observed as well as on motivation,
cognitive resources and cultural background. Enhancing low- or high-frequency
harmonics is not on equal footing, the latter requiring supplementary energy.
This mirrors a well-known property of signal processing filters. More
generally, in the light of this correspondence, we show that several
established results of social cognition admit a natural interpretation and
integration in the signal processing language. While the potential of this
connection between an area of social psychology and one of information
engineering appears considerable (compression, information retrieval,
filtering, feedback, feedforward, sampling, aliasing, etc.), in this paper we
shall limit ourselves to laying down what we consider the pillars of this
bridge on which future research may be founded.

result from explosions of massive stars having lost their outer envelopes. The
favoured explosion mechanism is by core-collapse, with the shock later revived
by neutrino heating. However, there is an upper limit to the amount of
radioactive Nickel-56 that such models can accomplish. Recent literature point
to a tension between the maximum luminosity from such simulations and
observations. We use a well characterized sample of SE SNe from the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS) to collect a sample of
spectroscopically classified normal Type Ibc SNe for which we use the ZTF light
curves to determine the maximum luminosity. We cull the sample further based on
data quality, light-curve shape, distance and colors. The methodology of the
sample construction from this BTS sample can be used for many other future
investigations. In total we use 129 Type Ib or Type Ic BTS SNe with an initial
rough luminosity distribution peaked at Mr = -17.61 +- 0.72, and where 36% are
apparently brighter than the theoretically predicted maximum brightness of Mr =
-17.8. When we further cull this sample to ensure that the SNe are normal Type
Ibc with good LC data within the Hubble flow, the sample of 94 objects has Mr =
-17.64 +- 0.54. A main uncertainty in absolute magnitude determinations for SNe
is the host galaxy extinction correction, but the reddened objects only get
more luminous after corrections. If we simply exclude objects with red, unusual
or uncertain colors, we are left with 14 objects at M = -17.90 +- 0.73, whereof
a handful are most certainly brighter than the suggested theoretical limit. The
main result of this study is thus that normal SNe Ibc do indeed reach
luminosities above $10^{42.6}$ erg/s, apparently in conflict with existing
explosion models.

low-order reconstructions by judging the smoothness with the ENO-like stencil

adaptively, the flow scales are first measured by examining the first-order
undivided difference and the cut-off constant $C_T$ in the TENO weighting

excellent performance for predicting highly compressible flows with a wide

a behavior-modeling method that combines home state estimation and event

layout to access only the desired fields. On the other hand, storing data
row-first works great for accessing, inserting, or updating entire rows.
Transforming rows to columns at runtime is expensive, hence, many analytical
systems ingest data in row-first form and transform it in the background to
columns to facilitate future analytical queries. How will this design change if
we can always efficiently access only the desired set of columns? To address
this question, we present a radically new approach to data transformation from
rows to columns. We build upon recent advancements in embedded platforms with
re-programmable logic to design native in-memory access on rows and columns.
Our approach, termed Relational Memory, relies on an FPGA- based accelerator
that sits between the CPU and main memory and transparently transforms base
data to any group of columns with minimal overhead at runtime. This design
allows accessing any group of columns as if it already exists in memory. We
implement and deploy Relational Memory in real hardware, and we show that we
can access the desired columns up to 1.63x faster than accessing them from
their row-wise counterpart, while matching the performance of a pure columnar
access for low projectivity, and outperforming it by up to 1.87x as
projectivity (and tuple re-construction cost) increases. Moreover, our approach
can be easily extended to support offloading of a number of operations to
hardware, e.g., selection, group by, aggregation, and joins, having the
potential to vastly simplify the software logic and accelerate the query
execution.

cross-lingual transfer show remarkable performance in joint intent recognition
and slot filling. However, existing benchmarks lack of code-switched
utterances, which are difficult to gather and label due to complexity in the
grammatical structure. The evaluation of NLU models seems biased and limited,
since code-switching is being left out of scope.
  Our work adopts recognized methods to generate plausible and
naturally-sounding code-switched utterances and uses them to create a synthetic
code-switched test set. Based on experiments, we report that the
state-of-the-art NLU models are unable to handle code-switching. At worst, the
performance, evaluated by semantic accuracy, drops as low as 15\% from 80\%

show that the closer the languages are, the better the NLU model handles their
alternation. This is in line with the common understanding of how multilingual

generalising the Childs & Goldstone ($\mathcal{CG}$) algorithm via alternating

We determine closed form expressions for the optimal walk time and phase shift
parameters for periodic graphs. These parameters are chosen to rotate the
system about subsets of the graph Laplacian eigenstates, amplifying the
probability of measuring the marked vertex. The state evolution is
asymptotically optimal for any class of periodic graphs having a fixed number
of unique eigenvalues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by
applying it to obtain $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ search on a variety of graphs.
One important class is the $n \times n^3$ rook graph, which has $N=n^4$
vertices. On this class of graphs the $\mathcal{CG}$ algorithm performs
suboptimally, achieving only $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/8})$ overlap after time

type of communication are: reducing the transmission signal power and
increasing the duration of the device by reducing the consumption energy per
bit. Formulation and analysis of the tasks of minimizing transmission power and
spent energy per bit in systems without retransmissions and with
retransmissions to obtain achievability bounds. A model of the system is
described, within which four problems of minimizing signal power and energy
consumption for given parameters (the number of information bits, the spectral
efficiency of the system, and the Packet Delivery Ratio) are formulated and
described. The numerical results of solving these optimization problems are
presented, which make it possible to obtain the achievability bounds for the
considered characteristics in systems with and without losses. The lower bounds
obtained by the Shannon formula are presented, assuming that the message length
is not limited. The results obtained showed that solving the minimization
problem with respect to one of the parameters (signal power or consumption
energy per bit) does not minimize the second parameter. This difference is most
significant for small information message lengths, which corresponds to IoT
scenarios. The results obtained allow assessing the potential for minimizing

a sufficient infrastructure, locations have to be chosen deliberately.
  In this paper, three extensions considering different objectives and various
constraints to the deterministic flow refuelling location problem (DFRLP),
described 2017 by de Vries and Duijzer, are introduced. In the first extension
we ask how many charging stations (CS) are necessary to cover a pre-specified
number of EVs and therefore exchange the original objective function for a
minimizing cost function. Secondly, our research shows that, when considering
location-dependent construction costs, results heavily depend on the relations
of said cost differences. Tests for different cost scenarios are carried out
and policy implications are discussed. In the last extension, we consider the
capacity of a CS to be limited. The DFRLP assumes an unlimited capacity,
meaning it is always possible to refuel all EVs at all CSs, where they stop. In
our model the capacity is put into relation to the total sum of demands
generated by all EVs, passing a particular CS, which means that our model
determines the placement and the sizes of all CSs simultaneously.
  Finally, all extensions are evaluated using benchmarks instances based on
test instances from the literature.

photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) from chiral molecules in aqueous
solution. The effect is revealed from the intensity difference of photoelectron
emission into a backward-scattering angle relative to the photon propagation
direction when ionizing with circularly polarized light of different helicity.
This leads to asymmetries (normalized intensity differences) that depend on the
handedness of the chiral sample and exceed the ones in conventional dichroic
mechanisms by orders of magnitude. The asymmetry is largest for photon energies
within several electron volts above the ionization threshold. A primary aim is
to explore the effect of hydration on PECD. The modular and flexible design of
our experimental setup EASI (Electronic structure from Aqueous Solutions and
Interfaces) also allows for detection of more common photoelectron angular
distributions (PADs), requiring distinctively different detection geometries,
and typically using linearly polarized light. A microjet is used for
liquid-sample delivery. We describe EASI's technical features and present two

circulant embedding method used to sample the stochastic field. A novel

considering multiple levels substantially reduces the computational effort.
Numerical experiments confirm the improved rate of convergence and show that
the MLQMC method outperforms the multilevel Monte Carlo method and the single

infrared search and tracking system. Since the local regions similar to
infrared small-dim targets spread over the whole background, exploring the
interaction information amongst image features in large-range dependencies to
mine the difference between the target and background is crucial for robust
detection. However, existing deep learning-based methods are limited by the
locality of convolutional neural networks, which impairs the ability to capture
large-range dependencies. Additionally, the small-dim appearance of the
infrared target makes the detection model highly possible to miss detection. To
this end, we propose a robust and general infrared small-dim target detection
method with the transformer. We adopt the self-attention mechanism of the
transformer to learn the interaction information of image features in a larger
range. Moreover, we design a feature enhancement module to learn discriminative
features of small-dim targets to avoid miss detection. After that, to avoid the
loss of the target information, we adopt a decoder with the U-Net-like skip
connection operation to contain more information of small-dim targets. Finally,
we get the detection result by a segmentation head. Extensive experiments on
two public datasets show the obvious superiority of the proposed method over
state-of-the-art methods and the proposed method has stronger cross-scene

behaviour is an interesting fundamental challenge in the area of organisation
modelling. Specifications of organisational structure usually have a
diagrammatic form that abstracts from more detailed dynamics. Dynamic
properties of agent systems, on the other hand, are often specified in the form
of a set of logical formulae in some temporal language. This paper addresses
the question how these two perspectives can be combined in one framework. It is
shown how for different aggregation levels and other elements within an
organisation structure, sets of dynamic properties can be specified.
Organisational structure provides a structure of (interlevel) relationships
between these multiple sets of dynamic properties. Thus organisational
structure is reflected in the formalisation of the dynamics of organisational
behaviour. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach a formal foundation
is presented for the integrated specification of both structure and behaviour

correlation effects. Such variational 2RDM approaches can often provide a
highly accurate description of strong electron correlation, provided that the
2RDMs satisfy at least partial three-particle $N$-representability conditions
({\em e.g.}, the T2 condition). However, recent benchmark calculations on
hydrogen clusters [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 153}, 104108 (2020)] suggest that even
the T2 condition leads to unacceptably inaccurate results in the case of 2- and

significant linearity between thermal temperature and Tsallis-q parameter in
Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV. And the slope of
the T $-$ (q - 1) parameter is positively correlated with the hadron mass. In
addition, the charm mesons have higher thermal temperature than the light
hadrons at the same q - 1, indicating that charmed flavor requires a higher
temperature to achieve the same degree of non-extensive as light flavors in the
heavy-ion collision. The same fit is performed to the transverse momentum
spectra of charmed meson in pp($\overline{\text{p}}$) collision over a large
energy range with Tsallis-Pareto distribution. It is found that the thermal
temperature increases with system energy while the q parameter shows a
saturated trend and stops at pp($\overline{\text{p}}$) limit, q - 1 = 0.142

if induced by a $D$ meson, the $X(3872)$ can split into $D\bar{D}$ final state
which is forbidden due to the spin-parity conservation. The breeding of the $D$
meson of the reaction, such as $D^0X(3872)\to D^0\bar{D}^0D^0$, makes the chain
reaction of $X(3872)$ matter possible. We estimate the cross section of the $D$
meson induced fission-like process of $X(3872)$ into two $D$ mesons. With very
small $D^0$ beam momentum of 1 eV, the total cross section reaches an order of
1000 b, and decreases rapidly with the increasing of beam momentum. With the
transition of $D^*$ meson in molecular states to a $D$ meson, the $X(3872)$ can
release large energy, which is acquired by the final mesons. The momentum
distributions of the final $D$ mesons are analyzed. In the laboratory frame,
the spectator $D$ meson in molecular state concentrates in the low momentum
area. The energy from the transition frim $D^*$ to $D$ meson is mainly acquired
by two scattered $D$ mesons. The results suggest that the $D$ meson environment

crucial for KGE models to unify multiple geometric transformations so as to
fully cover the multifarious relations in KGs. To do so, we propose BiQUE, a
novel model that employs biquaternions to integrate multiple geometric

minimum a large portion of $\epsilon$ Eri's corona is covered with active
structures. Therefore, there is little space for additional magnetic regions
during the maximum, explaining the small observed cycle amplitude ($\Delta f
\sim 0.12$) in terms of the X-ray luminosity.
  Kepler 63 displays an even higher coverage with magnetic structure than the
corona of $\epsilon$ Eri. This supports the hypothesis that for stars younger
than $<400$ Myr the X-ray cycles are inhibited by a massive presence of coronal
regions.

glasses is not only essential for the understanding of the nature of disordered

hard combinatorial optimization problems across multiple disciplines. Despite
decades-long efforts, an algorithm with both high accuracy and high efficiency
is still lacking. Here we introduce DIRAC - a deep reinforcement learning
framework, which can be trained purely on small-scale spin glass instances and
then applied to arbitrarily large ones. DIRAC displays better scalability than
other methods and can be leveraged to enhance any thermal annealing method.
Extensive calculations on 2D, 3D and 4D Edwards-Anderson spin glass instances
demonstrate the superior performance of DIRAC over existing methods. As many
hard combinatorial optimization problems have Ising spin glass formulations,
our results suggest a promising tool in solving these hard problems. Moreover,
the presented algorithm will help us better understand the nature of the
low-temperature spin-glass phase, which is a fundamental challenge in

evolution in single crystals where the plastic flow is driven by the movement
of discrete dislocation lines. The model is geometrically and elastically
nonlinear, that is, the total deformation gradient splits multiplicatively into
elastic and plastic parts, and the elastic energy density is polyconvex. There
are two internal variables: The system of all dislocations is modeled via
$1$-dimensional boundaryless integral currents, whereas the history of plastic
flow is encoded in a plastic distortion matrix-field. As our main result we
construct an energetic solution in the case of a rate-independent flow rule.
Besides the classical stability and energy balance conditions, our notion of
solution also accounts for the movement of dislocations and the resulting
plastic flow. Because of the path-dependence of plastic flow, a central role is
played by so-called ``slip trajectories'', that is, the surfaces traced out by
moving dislocations, which we represent as integral $2$-currents in space-time.
The proof of our main existence result further crucially rests on careful
a-priori estimates via a nonlinear Gronwall-type lemma and a rescaling of time.
In particular, we have to account for the fact that the plastic flow may cause
the coercivity of the elastic energy functional to decay along the evolution,
and hence the solution may blow up in finite time.

search, current error correction approaches can only correct one sentence at a
time, failing to leverage the voting effect from multiple candidates to better
detect and correct error tokens. In this work, we propose FastCorrect 2, an
error correction model that takes multiple ASR candidates as input for better
correction accuracy. FastCorrect 2 adopts non-autoregressive generation for
fast inference, which consists of an encoder that processes multiple source
sentences and a decoder that generates the target sentence in parallel from the
adjusted source sentence, where the adjustment is based on the predicted
duration of each source token. However, there are some issues when handling
multiple source sentences. First, it is non-trivial to leverage the voting
effect from multiple source sentences since they usually vary in length. Thus,
we propose a novel alignment algorithm to maximize the degree of token
alignment among multiple sentences in terms of token and pronunciation
similarity. Second, the decoder can only take one adjusted source sentence as
input, while there are multiple source sentences. Thus, we develop a candidate
predictor to detect the most suitable candidate for the decoder. Experiments on
our inhouse dataset and AISHELL-1 show that FastCorrect 2 can further reduce
the WER over the previous correction model with single candidate by 3.2% and
2.6%, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging multiple candidates in ASR
error correction. FastCorrect 2 achieves better performance than the cascaded
re-scoring and correction pipeline and can serve as a unified post-processing
module for ASR.

address the compliant or structural response of confiners and particles due to
detonations, but the direct interaction of explosives remains a challenge for
most formulations and algorithms. The proposed formulation addresses this
problem by extending the conservation laws and mixture rules of an existing
hybrid formulation to model the interaction of multiple explosive mixtures. An
algorithm for the solution of the resulting system of partial differential
equations is presented, which includes a new robust method for the retrieval of
the densities of the constituents of each explosive mixture. The algorithm is
implemented in a hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement framework and validated
against results from problems with known solutions. It is evaluated for
robustness for rate-stick and shock-induced flows in particle-laden explosives

detonation waves produced by military grade and commercial explosives in direct

by $\widetilde{O}((d_u+d_x)\sqrt{d_xT})$ when $A$ and $B$ are unknown, (ii) by
$\widetilde{O}(d_x^2\log(T))$ if only $A$ is unknown, and (iii) by
$\widetilde{O}(d_x(d_u+d_x)\log(T))$ if only $B$ is unknown and under some mild
non-degeneracy condition ($d_x$ and $d_u$ denote the dimensions of the state
and of the control input, respectively). These regret scalings are minimal in
$T$, $d_x$ and $d_u$ as they match existing lower bounds in scenario (i) when
$d_x\le d_u$ [SF20], and in scenario (ii) [lai1986]. We conjecture that our
upper bounds are also optimal in scenario (iii) (there is no known lower bound
in this setting).
  Existing online algorithms proceed in epochs of (typically exponentially)
growing durations. The control policy is fixed within each epoch, which
considerably simplifies the analysis of the estimation error on $A$ and $B$ and
hence of the regret. Our algorithm departs from this design choice: it is a
simple variant of certainty-equivalence regulators, where the estimates of $A$
and $B$ and the resulting control policy can be updated as frequently as we
wish, possibly at every step. Quantifying the impact of such a
constantly-varying control policy on the performance of these estimates and on
the regret constitutes one of the technical challenges tackled in this paper.

learned binary hash codes discriminative and to minimize a quantization error.
With further constraints such as bit balance and code orthogonality, it is not
uncommon for existing models to employ a large number (>4) of losses. This
leads to difficulties in model training and subsequently impedes their
effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel deep hashing model with only a
single learning objective. Specifically, we show that maximizing the cosine
similarity between the continuous codes and their corresponding binary
orthogonal codes can ensure both hash code discriminativeness and quantization
error minimization. Further, with this learning objective, code balancing can
be achieved by simply using a Batch Normalization (BN) layer and multi-label
classification is also straightforward with label smoothing. The result is an
one-loss deep hashing model that removes all the hassles of tuning the weights
of various losses. Importantly, extensive experiments show that our model is
highly effective, outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-loss hashing models

these event-wise distributions over large data sets allows the determination of
parameters that influence the event kinematics, such as particle masses, which
are otherwise obscured by the missing information on the invisible final-state
particles. The method is demonstrated in simulation studies with $\tau^+
\tau^-$ events in $e^+ e^-$ collisions at the $\Upsilon$(4S) resonance,
presenting a new, promising approach for the measurement of the $\tau$ lepton

properties. The Philippines, due to its geographic location, is considered a
natural disaster-prone country experiencing an average of 20 tropical cyclones
annually. Understanding what factors significantly affect decision making
during crucial evacuation stages could help in making decisions on how to
prepare for disasters, how to act appropriately and strategically respond
during and after a calamity. In this work, an agent-based model for preemptive
evacuation decisions during typhoon is presented. In the model, civilians are
represented by households and their evacuation decisions were based from
calculated perceived risk. Also, rescuer and shelter manager agents were
included as facilitators during the preemptive evacuation process. National and
municipal census data were employed in the model, particularly for the
demographics of household agents. Further, geospatial data of a village in a
typhoon-susceptible municipality was used to represent the environment. The
decision to evacuate or not to evacuate depends on the agent's perceived risk
which also depends on three decision factors: characteristics of the decision
maker (CDM); capacity related factors (CRF); and hazard related factors (HRF).
Finally, the number of households who decided to evacuate or opted to stay as
influenced by the model`s decision factors were determined during simulations.
Sensitivity analysis using linear regression shows that all parameters used in
the model are significant in the evacuation decision of household agents.

on-shell lines and (iii). a term expressed by the sum of lower point
Berends-Giele currents in which some polarizations and momenta are replaced by
vectors proportional to off-shell momenta appropriately. In the on-shell limit,
the last two terms vanish while the decomposition of effective current
precisely reproduces the decomposition of on-shell YM amplitudes with the the

instability whose non-linear evolution is hydrodynamical turbulence. This
results in significant particle stirring, impacting on planetary growth
processes such as the streaming instability or pebble accretion. In this paper,
we present the results of three-dimensional, inviscid global hydrodynamical
simulations of circumbinary discs with embedded particles of 1 cm size.
Hydrodynamical turbulence develops in the disc, and we examine the effect of
the particle back-reaction on vertical dust. We find that higher solid-to-gas
ratios lead to smaller gas vertical velocity fluctuations, and therefore to
smaller dust scale heights. For a metallicity $Z=0.1$, the dust scale height
near the edge of the tidally-truncated cavity is $\sim 80\%$ of the gas scale
height, such that growing a Ceres-mass object to a 10 $M_\oplus$ core via
pebble accretion would take longer than the disc lifetime. Collision velocities
for small particles are also higher than the critical velocity for
fragmentation, which precludes grain growth and the possibility of forming a
massive planetesimal seed for pebble accretion. At larger distances from the
binary, turbulence is weak enough to enable not only efficient pebble accretion
but also grain growth to sizes required to trigger the streaming instability.
In these regions, an in-situ formation scenario of circumbinary planets
involving the streaming instability to form a massive planetesimal followed by
pebble accretion onto this core is viable. In that case, planetary migration
has to be invoked to explain the presence of circumbinary planets at their
observed locations.

non-normally distributed traits or a mixture of discrete-continuous traits.
However, most of the current region-based methods rely on multivariate linear
mixed models (mvLMMs) and assume a multivariate normal distribution for the
phenotypes of interest. Hence, these methods are not applicable to disease or
non-normally distributed traits. Therefore, there is a need to develop unified
and flexible methods to study association between a set of (possibly rare)
genetic variants and non-normal multivariate phenotypes. Copulas are
multivariate distribution functions with uniform margins on the $[0, 1]$
interval and they provide suitable models to deal with non-normality of errors
in multivariate association studies. We propose a novel unified and flexible
Copula-Based Multivariate Association Test (CBMAT) for discovering association
between a genetic region and a bivariate continuous or mixed phenotype. We also
derive a data-driven analytic p-value procedure of the proposed region-based
score-type test. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that CBMAT has well
controlled type I error rates and higher power to detect associations compared
with other existing methods, for discrete and non-normally distributed traits.
At last, we apply CBMAT to detect the association between two genes located on
chromosome 11 and several lipid levels measured on 1,477 subjects from the

comparable intensities. Furthermore, a comparison of samples with and without a

intensity, rather than its fluctuations, is the main driver for the FD.
Finally, the recovery phase of the FD for isolated magnetic ejecta shows an
anisotropy in the level of the GCRs. We relate this finding at 1 au to the

237.8588+12.5660 (hereafter Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively). Combining data
with earlier observations, we find a radial velocity of -149.25 $\pm$ 0.27 and
-3.18 $\pm$ 0.19 km/s for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively, with no evidence of
variability between 2018 and 2020.
  From a one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis,
we measure [Fe/H]$_{\rm LTE}$=-4.79 $\pm$ 0.14 for Pr 221 and [Fe/H]$_{\rm
LTE}$=-4.22 $\pm$ 0.12 for Pr 237, in good agreement with previous studies.
Abundances of Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Sr were derived based on the
non-LTE (NLTE) line formation calculations. When NLTE effects are included, we
measure slightly higher metallicities: [Fe/H]$_{\rm NLTE}$=-4.40 $\pm$ 0.13 and
[Fe/H]$_{\rm NLTE}$=-3.93 $\pm$ 0.12, for Pr 221 and Pr 237, respectively.
Analysis of the G-band yields [C/Fe]$_{\rm 1D-LTE} \leq$ +2.3 and [C/Fe]$_{\rm

band. Upper limits on nitrogen abundances are also derived. Abundances for
other elements exhibit good agreement with those of stars with similar
parameters.
  Finally, to get insight into the properties of their progenitors, we compare
NLTE abundances to theoretical yields of zero-metallicity supernovae. This
suggests that the supernovae progenitors had masses ranging from 10.6 to 14.4

teleportation protocol for an arbitrary isotropic distribution of input states

Bell basis, considering a Bell-diagonal resource state.
  We focus on three specific isotropic distributions of input states: 1)
completely mixed input states, 2) states with a certain (fixed) degree of
purity, and 3) quasi-pure input states. We show that the standard quantum
teleportation protocol can teleport arbitrary mixed states with higher average
fidelity than its classical counterpart even when the resource of the protocol
is a non-entangled state, specifically, a separable Werner state. Moreover, we
find that the maximum average fidelity obtained with classical-quantum states
used as a resource in a standard teleportation protocol also exceeds the
classical fidelity. To establish the role played by the presence or absence of
quantum correlations in the resource state and their relation with the
correlations present in the von Neumann measurement performed by Alice, we
analyze in detail the case of Bell diagonal resource states employing a family
of monoparametric basis for which both the Bell and the computational
(non-correlated) basis are included. Only in the case where the basis on which
Alice measures is completely uncorrelated (computational basis) the maximum
average fidelity does not exceed the classical fidelity for any resource state.
In all other cases, the maximum average fidelity exceeds the classical one for
a certain range of parameters describing the resource state, evidencing the
importance of the correlations present in the measurements.

of classical applications and quantum science experiments, ranging from
precision measurements, laser technologies to quantum control of mechanical
motion. The dissipative photon loss via absorption, present to some extent in
any optical cavity, is known to introduce thermo-optical effects and thereby
impose fundamental limits on precision measurements. Here, we theoretically and
experimentally reveal that such dissipative photon absorption can result in
quantum feedback via in-loop field detection of the absorbed optical field,
leading to the intracavity field fluctuations to be squashed or antisquashed.
Strikingly, this modifies the optical cavity susceptibility in coherent
response measurements and causes excess noise and correlations in incoherent
interferometric optomechanical measurements using a cavity. We experimentally
observe such unanticipated dissipative dynamics in optomechanical spectroscopy
of sideband-cooled optomechanical crystal cavitiess at both cryogenic
temperature (approximately 8 K) and ambient conditions. The dissipative
feedback introduces effective modifications to the optical cavity linewidth and
the optomechanical scattering rate and gives rise to excess imprecision noise
in the interferometric quantum measurement of mechanical motion. Such
dissipative feedback differs fundamentally from a quantum nondemolition
feedback, e.g., optical Kerr squeezing. The dissipative feedback itself always
results in an antisqueezed out-of-loop optical field, while it can enhance the
coexisting Kerr squeezing under certain conditions. Our result has wide-ranging
implications for future dissipation engineering, such as dissipation enhanced
sideband cooling and Kerr squeezing, quantum frequency conversion, and
nonreciprocity in photonic systems.

compromise accounts quite effectively even when the credential stuffing

discovery. In this work we leverage AI for strategy discovery for understanding
human planning. In the state-of-the-art methods data about the process of human
planning is often used to group similar behaviors together and formulate verbal
descriptions of the strategies which might underlie those groups. Here, we
automate these two steps. Our method utilizes a new algorithm, called
Human-Interpret, that performs imitation learning to describe sequences of
planning operations in terms of a procedural formula and then translates that
formula to natural language. We test our method on a benchmark data set that
researchers have previously scrutinized manually. We find that the descriptions

Our method saves scientists' time and effort as all the reasoning about human
planning is done automatically. This might make it feasible to more rapidly
scale up the search for yet undiscovered cognitive strategies to many new
decision environments, populations, tasks, and domains. Given these results, we
believe that the presented work may accelerate scientific discovery in
psychology, and due to its generality, extend to problems from other fields.

the linear maps $\rho$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes \mathbb{C}^d$ that can be
written as a convex combination of rank one matrices of the form $xx^*\otimes
yy^*$. Such maps are known in quantum information theory as the separable
bipartite states, while nonseparable states are called entangled. In particular
we introduce bounds for the separable rank $\mathrm{rank_{sep}}(\rho)$, defined
as the smallest number of rank one states $xx^*\otimes yy^*$ entering the
decomposition of a separable state $\rho$. Our approach relies on the moment
method and yields a hierarchy of semidefinite-based lower bounds, that
converges to a parameter $\tau_{\mathrm{sep}}(\rho)$, a natural convexification
of the combinatorial parameter $\mathrm{rank_{sep}}(\rho)$. A distinguishing
feature is exploiting the positivity constraint $\rho-xx^*\otimes yy^* \succeq
0$ to impose positivity of a polynomial matrix localizing map, the dual notion
of the notion of sum-of-squares polynomial matrices. Our approach extends
naturally to the multipartite setting and to the real separable rank, and it
permits strengthening some known bounds for the completely positive rank. In
addition, we indicate how the moment approach also applies to define
hierarchies of semidefinite relaxations for the set $\mathcal{SEP}_d$ and

generalization for the ultrastatic wormhole with a repulsive scalar field found
by Bronnikov and by Ellis in 1973. The extreme simplicity of this static
solution suggests that its stationary version could be obtainable analytically
and should be globally regular, but no such generalization has been found. We
analyze the problem and find that the difficulty originates in the vacuum
theory, since the scalar field can be eliminated within the Eris-Gurses
procedure. The problem then reduces to constructing the spinning generalization
for the vacuum wormhole sourced by a thin ring of negative tension. Solving the
vacuum Ernst equations determines the $g_{00}$, $g_{0\varphi}$ metric
components and hence the AMD mass ${\rm M}$ and angular momentum ${\rm J}$, all
of these being specified by the ring source. The scalar field can be included
into consideration afterwords, but this only affects $g_{rr}$ and
$g_{\vartheta\vartheta}$ without changing the rest. Within this approach, we
analyze a number of exact stationary generalizations for the wormhole, but none
of them are satisfactory. However, the perturbative expansion around the static
vacuum background contains only bounded functions and presumably converges to
an exact solution. Including the scalar field screens the singularity at the
ring source and renders the geometry regular. This solution describes a
globally regular spinning wormhole with two asymptotically flat regions. Even
though the source itself is screened and not visible, the memory of it remains
in $g_{00}$ and $g_{0\varphi}$ and accounts for the ${\rm M}\propto {\rm J}^2$
relation typical for a rotating extended source. Describing stationary
spacetimes with an extended source is a complicated problem, which presumably
explains the difficulty in finding the solution.

characterizing 21$^{st}$ century real world data problems, which are typically
characterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data

the amount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless

prove the relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show
how this framework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask,
meta, continual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge
the gap between empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world
problems. Finally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine
learning algorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of
this framework vis-\'a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning,

PIB, we can empirically identify the fitting to compressing phase transition

Recommender systems (RS), which are currently unexplored for the

Collaborative-Filtering (CF) recommender systems however hinges on the quality
of embedding vectors of users and items (enzymes and substrates in our case).
Importantly, enhancing CF embeddings with heterogeneous auxiliary data,
specially relational data (e.g., hierarchical, pairwise, or groupings), remains
a challenge. We propose an innovative general RS framework, termed Boost-RS,
that enhances RS performance by ""boosting"" embedding vectors through auxiliary
data. Specifically, Boost-RS is trained and dynamically tuned on multiple
relevant auxiliary learning tasks Boost-RS utilizes contrastive learning tasks
to exploit relational data. To show the efficacy of Boost-RS for the
enzyme-substrate prediction interaction problem, we apply the Boost-RS
framework to several baseline CF models. We show that each of our auxiliary
tasks boosts learning of the embedding vectors, and that contrastive learning
using Boost-RS outperforms attribute concatenation and multi-label learning. We
also show that Boost-RS outperforms similarity-based models. Ablation studies
and visualization of learned representations highlight the importance of using
contrastive learning on some of the auxiliary data in boosting the embedding
vectors.

obtained with synchronous vital signs from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
(NICU) based on electrocardiogram recordings. As reference, seven annotators
independently assessed the signal quality. For automatic quality
classification, 400 features were extracted from the chest sounds. After
feature selection using minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy algorithm,
class balancing, and hyper-parameter optimization, a variety of multi-class and
ordinal classification and regression algorithms were trained. Then, heart rate
and breathing rate were automatically estimated from the chest sounds using
adapted pre-existing methods. The results of subject-wise leave-one-out
cross-validation show that the best-performing models had a mean squared error
(MSE) of 0.49 and 0.61, and balanced accuracy of 57% and 51% for heart and lung

required for clinical usage.

be inaccessible for software outside a Device under Test (DuT), especially when
the latter is in a dysfunctional state.

part, which enables multiplexed access to a block device (e.g., an SD card) and
a software part which enables remote access to the block device (e.g., via HTTP

and the influence of the decoherent and dissipative cellular environment. We
determine that the quantum tunnelling contribution to the process is several
orders of magnitude larger than the contribution from classical
over-the-barrier hopping. Due to this significant quantum contribution, we find
that the canonical and tautomeric forms of G-C inter-convert over timescales
far shorter than biological ones and hence thermal equilibrium is rapidly
reached. Furthermore, we find a large tautomeric occupation probability of
$1.73\times 10^{-4}$, suggesting that such proton transfer may well play a far
more important role in DNA mutation than has hitherto been suggested. Our
results could have far-reaching consequences for current models of genetic

that are emitted from the central regions of the galaxy in the radial

the mass density of dark matter has the form $\rho \sim r^{-2}$, in contrast to
the homogeneous model $\rho=Const$. In the cosmological context, the
homogeneous model with massless particles corresponds to the radiation epoch of
the expansion of the universe, while the proposed inhomogeneous model turns out
to be equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM. In this paper, scenarios will be considered
in which the radial emission of dark matter is brought into hydrostatic
equilibrium with a uniform background. It is shown that solutions exist if the
uniform background has an equation of state typical for dark energy. Thus, this
model describes a phase transition from dark matter inside the galaxy to dark
energy outside of it. The specific mechanism for such a transition could be
Bose-Einstein condensation. In addition, the question of what happens if dark
matter particles are not sterile, for example, are photons of the Standard

  Fragments",,,,,"cs.LO cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Linear logic was conceived in 1987 by Girard and, in contrast to classical
logic, restricts the usage of the structural inference rules of weakening and
contraction. With this, atoms of the logic are no longer interpreted as truth,
but as information or resources. This interpretation makes linear logic a
useful tool for formalisation in mathematics and computer science. Linear logic
has, for example, found applications in proof theory, quantum logic, and the
theory of programming languages. A central problem of the logic is the question
whether a given list of formulas is provable with the calculus. In the research
regarding the complexity of this problem, some results were achieved, but other
questions are still open. To present these questions and give new perspectives,
this thesis consists of three main parts which build on each other: We present
the syntax, proof theory, and various approaches to a semantics for linear
logic. Here already, we will meet some open research questions. We present the
current state of the complexity-theoretic characterization of the most
important fragments of linear logic. Here, further research problems are
presented and it becomes apparent that until now, the results have all made use
of different approaches. We prove an original complexity characterization of a
fragment of the logic and present ideas for a new, structural approach to the
examination of provability in linear logic.

of normal samples far exceeds the number of abnormal samples. In such
class-imbalanced situations, reliable training of deep neural networks
continues to be a major challenge. Under these circumstances, the predicted
class probabilities may be biased toward the majority class. Calibration has
been suggested to alleviate some of these effects. However, there is
insufficient analysis explaining when and whether calibrating a model would be
beneficial in improving performance. In this study, we perform a systematic
analysis of the effect of model calibration on its performance on two medical
image modalities, namely, chest X-rays and fundus images, using various deep
learning classifier backbones. For this, we study the following variations: (i)
the degree of imbalances in the dataset used for training; (ii) calibration
methods; and (iii) two classification thresholds, namely, default decision
threshold of 0.5, and optimal threshold from precision-recall curves. Our
results indicate that at the default operating threshold of 0.5, the
performance achieved through calibration is significantly superior (p < 0.05)
to using uncalibrated probabilities. However, at the PR-guided threshold, these
gains are not significantly different (p > 0.05). This finding holds for both
image modalities and at varying degrees of imbalance.

as computation progresses. Updated output values are used as inputs for
computations in current or subsequent iterations; hence the number of
iterations required for values to converge can potentially reduce if the newest
values are asynchronously made available to other updates computed in the same
iteration. In a multi-threaded shared memory system, the immediate propagation
of updated values can cause memory contention that may offset the benefit of
propagating updates sooner. In some cases, the benefit of a smaller number of
iterations may be diminished by each iteration taking longer. Our key idea is
to combine the low memory contention that synchronous approaches have with the
faster information sharing of asynchronous approaches. Our hybrid approach
buffers updates from threads locally before committing them to the global store
to control how often threads may cause conflicts for others while still sharing
data within one iteration and hence speeding convergence. On a 112-thread CPU
system, our hybrid approach attains up to 4.5% - 19.4% speedup over an
asynchronous approach for Pagerank and up to 1.9% - 17% speedup over

which might delay further the access to therapeutic interventions. One
promising direction for improving the efficiency and accuracy of ASD detection
in toddlers is the use of machine learning techniques to build classifiers that
serve the purpose. This paper contributes to this area and uses the data
developed by Dr. Fadi Fayez Thabtah to train and test various machine learning

retrieval. In this approach, we place a tilted image sensor under the specimen
for linearly-increasing phase modulation along one lateral direction. Similar
to the operation of ptychography, we laterally translate the specimen and
acquire the diffraction images for reconstruction. Since the axial distance
between the specimen and the sensor varies at different lateral positions,
laterally translating the specimen effectively introduces defocus multi-height
measurements while eliminating axial scanning. Lateral translation further
introduces sub-pixel shift for pixel super-resolution imaging and naturally
expands the field of view for rapid whole slide imaging. We show that the
equivalent height variation can be precisely estimated from the lateral shift
of the specimen, thereby addressing the challenge of precise axial positioning
in conventional multi-height phase retrieval. Using a sensor with a 1.67-micron
pixel size, our low-cost and field-portable prototype can resolve 690-nm
linewidth on the resolution target. We show that a whole slide image of a blood
smear with a 120-mm^2 field of view can be acquired in 18 seconds. We also
demonstrate accurate automatic white blood cell counting from the recovered

the task to resolve the conflict between computationally-intensive mobile
applications and resource-limited mobile devices (MDs). As such, there has been
intense interest in this topic, especially in multi-user single-server and
homogeneous multi-server scenarios. However, the research in the heterogeneous
multi-server scenario is limited, where the servers are located at small
base-stations (SBSs), macro base-stations (MBSs), or the cloud with different
computing and communication capabilities. On the other hand,
computational-tasks offloading is limited by the type of MD-BS association with
almost all previous works focusing on offloading the MD's computational tasks
to the MEC servers/cloudlets at its serving BS. However, in multi-BS
association, or downlink/uplink decoupled (DUDe) scenarios, an MD can be served
by multiple BSs and hence has multiple offloading choices. Motivated by this,
we proposed a joint BS association and subchannel allocation algorithm based on
a student-project allocation (SPA) matching approach to minimize the network
sum-latency, which break the constraint that one MD must connect to the same BS
in the UL and DL, and jointly consider the communication and computational
disparity of SBS and MBS cloudlets in heterogeneous MEC networks. Moreover, an
optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to optimize the system performance
subject to the predefined quality of service constraints. Our results show that
the proposed scheme is superior to benchmark techniques in enabling effective

deploys an asymmetric time-stamp exchange mechanism between the MUs and the
Access Points (APs), which, traditionally, provides us with information about
the MUs' clock offset and skew. However, information about the distance between
an AP and an MU is also intrinsic to the propagation delay experienced by
exchanged time-stamps. In addition, to estimate the angle of arrival of the
received synchronization packet, DePF draws on the multiple signal
classification algorithm that is fed by Channel Impulse Response (CIR)
experienced by the sync packets. The CIR is also leveraged on to determine the
link condition, i.e. Line-of-Sight (LoS) or Non-LoS. Finally, to perform joint
sync\&loc, DePF capitalizes on particle Gaussian mixtures that allow for a
hybrid particle-based and parametric Bayesian Recursive Filtering (BRF) fusion
of the aforementioned pieces of information and thus jointly estimate the
position and clock parameters of the MUs. The simulation results verifies the
superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art schemes,
especially that of Extended Kalman filter- and linearized BRF-based joint

exchange and CIRs, for 90$\%$of the cases, the absolute position and clock

emergency planning for extreme events such as droughts and wildfires. Despite
its societal importance, SSF has stayed a challenging problem compared to both

Further, we illustrate that ML models make forecasting errors under extreme
weather conditions, e.g., cold waves due to the polar vortex, highlighting the
need for separate models for extreme events. Finally, we show that suitably
incorporating dynamical model forecasts as inputs to ML models can

forbidden line emission from small dense knots embedded in four of these SNRs.
The electron densities in some knots are higher than 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The size
and density of these knots are not characteristic for interstellar medium (ISM)
-- they most likely originate from a circumstellar medium (CSM) ejected by the
SN progenitor. Physical property variations of dense knots in the SNRs appear
to reflect an evolutionary effect. The recombination timescales for high
densities are short, and HST images of N103B taken 3.5 yr apart already show
brightness changes in some knots. VLT/MUSE observations detect [Fe XIV] line
emission from reverse shocks into SN ejecta as well as forward shocks into the
dense knots. Faint [O III] line emission is also detected from the Balmer shell
in 0519-69.0, N103B, and DEM L71. We exclude the postshock origin because the
[O III] line is narrow. For the preshock origin, we considered three
possibilities: photoionization precursor, cosmic ray precursor, and neutral

excited in a shock precursor heated mainly by cosmic rays.

Here we address this problem by introducing an alignment-free photonic coupler
robust to x, y, z displacement and angular misalignment. This alignment-free
coupler engineers a translationally-invariant evanescent interaction between
waveguides by intersecting them at an angle, which enables a lateral and
angular alignment tolerance fundamentally larger than non-evanescent approaches
such as edge coupling. We show that our approach can function as a universal

forecasting techniques to quickly predict wavefronts aberrated by the Turbulent
Boundary Layer (TBL) around an airborne optical system, and its study applies
to a multi-domain need from astronomy to microscopy for high-fidelity laser
propagation. We leverage the forecasting capabilities of the Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) -- an equation-free, data-driven method for identifying
coherent flow structures and their associated spatiotemporal dynamics -- in
order to estimate future state wavefront phase aberrations to feed into an
adaptive optic (AO) control loop. We specifically leverage the optimized DMD
(opt-DMD) algorithm on a subset of the Airborne Aero-Optics Laboratory
Transonic (AAOL-T) experimental dataset, characterizing aberrated wavefront
dynamics for 23 beam propagation directions via the spatiotemporal
decomposition underlying DMD. Critically, we show that opt-DMD produces an
optimally de-biased eigenvalue spectrum with imaginary eigenvalues, allowing
for arbitrarily long forecasting to produce a robust future-state prediction,
while exact DMD loses structural information due to modal decay rates.

ASRU 2021",,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Confidence estimate is an often requested feature in applications such as
medical transcription where errors can impact patient care and the confidence
estimate could be used to alert medical professionals to verify potential
errors in recognition.
  In this paper, we present a lightweight neural confidence model tailored for
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system with Recurrent Neural Network
Transducers (RNN-T). Compared to other existing approaches, our model utilizes:
(a) the time information associated with recognized words, which reduces the
computational complexity, and (b) a simple and elegant trick for mapping
between sub-word and word sequences. The mapping addresses the non-unique
tokenization and token deletion problems while amplifying differences between
confusable words. Through extensive empirical evaluations on two different
long-form test sets, we demonstrate that the model achieves a performance of
0.4 Normalized Cross Entropy (NCE) and 0.05 Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
It is robust across different ASR configurations, including target types
(graphemes vs. morphemes), traffic conditions (streaming vs. non-streaming),
and encoder types. We further discuss the importance of evaluation metrics to
reflect practical applications and highlight the need for further work in
improving Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Negative Precision Rate (NPV) and True
Negative Rate (TNR).

  Evaluation Framework and Case Study on Chinese MRC Datasets",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a challenging natural language
processing (NLP) task. Recently, the emergence of pre-trained models (PTM) has
brought this research field into a new era, in which the training objective
plays a key role. The masked language model (MLM) is a self-supervised training
objective that widely used in various PTMs. With the development of training
objectives, many variants of MLM have been proposed, such as whole word
masking, entity masking, phrase masking, span masking, and so on. In different
MLM, the length of the masked tokens is different. Similarly, in different
machine reading comprehension tasks, the length of the answer is also
different, and the answer is often a word, phrase, or sentence. Thus, in MRC
tasks with different answer lengths, whether the length of MLM is related to
performance is a question worth studying. If this hypothesis is true, it can
guide us how to pre-train the MLM model with a relatively suitable mask length
distribution for MRC task. In this paper, we try to uncover how much of MLM's
success in the machine reading comprehension tasks comes from the correlation
between masking length distribution and answer length in MRC dataset. In order
to address this issue, herein, (1) we propose four MRC tasks with different
answer length distributions, namely short span extraction task, long span
extraction task, short multiple-choice cloze task, long multiple-choice cloze
task; (2) four Chinese MRC datasets are created for these tasks; (3) we also
have pre-trained four masked language models according to the answer length
distributions of these datasets; (4) ablation experiments are conducted on the
datasets to verify our hypothesis. The experimental results demonstrate that
our hypothesis is true.

  Learning",,,,,"eess.IV physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Coherent beam combination of multiple fibres can be used to overcome
limitations such as the power handling capability of single fibre
configurations. In such a scheme, the focal intensity profile is critically
dependent upon the relative phase of each fibre and so precise control over the
phase of each fibre channel is essential. Determining the required phase
compensations from the focal intensity profile alone (as measured via a camera)
is extremely challenging with a large number of fibres as the phase information
is obfuscated. Whilst iterative methods exist for phase retrieval, in practice,
due to phase noise within a fibre laser amplification system, a single step
process with computational time on the scale of milliseconds is needed. Here,
we show how a neural network can be used to identify the phases of each fibre
from the focal intensity profile, in a single step of ~ 10 milliseconds, for a
simulated 3-ring hexagonal close packed arrangement, containing 19 separate
fibres and subsequently how this enables bespoke beam shaping. In addition, we
show that deep learning can be used to determine whether a desired intensity
profile is physically possible within the simulation. This, coupled with the
demonstrated resilience against simulated experimental noise, indicates a
strong potential for the application of deep learning for coherent beam
combination.

Human-Computer Interaction field as it can bridge the gap between humans and
machines. Current works train deep learning models on low-level data
representations to solve the emotion recognition task. Since emotion datasets
often have a limited amount of data, these approaches may suffer from
overfitting, and they may learn based on superficial cues. To address these
issues, we propose a novel cross-representation speech model, inspired by
disentanglement representation learning, to perform emotion recognition on
wav2vec 2.0 speech features. We also train a CNN-based model to recognize
emotions from text features extracted with Transformer-based models. We further
combine the speech-based and text-based results with a score fusion approach.
Our method is evaluated on the IEMOCAP dataset in a 4-class classification
problem, and it surpasses current works on speech-only, text-only, and
multimodal emotion recognition.
