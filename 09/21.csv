in an effort to associate function or structure with behaviour, health, or
other individual phenotypes. Such models often rely on low-dimensional maps
generated by complex processing pipelines. However, the numerical instabilities
inherent to pipelines limit the fidelity of these maps and introduce
computational bias. Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a technique for introducing
controlled amounts of numerical noise, was used to perturb a structural
connectome estimation pipeline, ultimately producing a range of plausible
networks for each sample. The variability in the perturbed networks was
captured in an augmented dataset, which was then used for an age classification
task. We found that resampling brain networks across a series of such
numerically perturbed outcomes led to improved performance in all tested
classifiers, preprocessing strategies, and dimensionality reduction techniques.
Importantly, we find that this benefit does not hinge on a large number of
perturbations, suggesting that even minimally perturbing a dataset adds
meaningful variance which can be captured in the subsequently designed models.

  Bioinspired Surface Riblets","7 Pages",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Emulating natural mechanisms in technology has become a very efficient
technique to optimize and improve the current machinery. Riblets are such kinds
of bio-inspired surface patterns which are seen on Sharks. Their geometric
properties induce secondary flows resulting in lower drag, allowing Sharks to
achieve such high speeds. Secondary flows are broadly subcategorized into
Prandtls first and second kind; the secondary flows induced by riblets belong
primarily to Prandtls second kind. These secondary flows have been proven to
delay the boundary layer separation by reducing momentum losses. This paper
aims to optimize the use of these bio-inspired patterns on an airfoil. By
applying the ribletted surface on an airfoil, the boundary layer separation can
be delayed, thus leading to a reduction in drag and increasing the critical
angle of attack. Specific geometric properties such as the height and the
wavelength of the riblets are varied to find the most optimal design. The
design framework couples the optimization algorithm, computational fluid
dynamics, and post-processing analysis. An Invasive Weed Model is implemented
for optimization due to its commendable performance in converging close to
global optima. The optimization process is initialized by generating a
population of riblet profiles with randomly distributed geometry parameters.
These profiles are then evolved over generations with the objective to minimize
the drag, which is computed through Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations
conducted on OpenFOAM. The optimized geometries show a significant reduction in
drag as compared to bare airfoils. Lastly, a flow field analysis of the
optimized geometry established using the genetic algorithm is done to
understand the riblets-induced enhancement in the aerodynamic efficiency of the
airfoil.

variables approaches infinity using an information-theoretic framework. We
define structural entropy of a causal model in terms of its description
complexity measured by the logarithmic growth rate, measured in bits, of all
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), parameterized by the edge density d. Structural
entropy yields non-intuitive predictions. If we randomly sample a DAG from the
space of all models, in the range d = (0, 1/8), almost surely the model is a
two-layer DAG! Semantic entropy quantifies the reduction in entropy where edges
are removed by causal intervention. Semantic causal entropy is defined as the
f-divergence between the observational distribution and the interventional
distribution P', where a subset S of edges are intervened on to determine their
causal influence. We compare the decomposability properties of semantic entropy
for different choices of f-divergences, including KL-divergence, squared
Hellinger distance, and total variation distance. We apply our framework to
generalize a recently popular bipartite experimental design for studying causal
inference on large datasets, where interventions are carried out on one set of
variables (e.g., power plants, items in an online store), but outcomes are
measured on a disjoint set of variables (residents near power plants, or
shoppers). We generalize bipartite designs to k-partite designs, and describe
an optimization framework for finding the optimal k-level DAG architecture for
any value of d \in (0, 1/2). As edge density increases, a sequence of phase
transitions occur over disjoint intervals of d, with deeper DAG architectures
emerging for larger values of d. We also give a quantitative bound on the

promising but has yet to tackle the problem of dataset shift, namely that the
joint distribution of examples and their labels associated with the test set is
different from that of the training set. This problem causes the degradation of
deep learning models without users' notice. In order to alleviate the problem,
one approach is to let a classifier not only predict the label on a given
example but also present its uncertainty (or confidence) on the predicted
label, whereby a defender can decide whether to use the predicted label or not.
While intuitive and clearly important, the capabilities and limitations of this
approach have not been well understood. In this paper, we conduct an empirical
study to evaluate the quality of predictive uncertainties of malware detectors.
Specifically, we re-design and build 24 Android malware detectors (by
transforming four off-the-shelf detectors with six calibration methods) and
quantify their uncertainties with nine metrics, including three metrics dealing
with data imbalance. Our main findings are: (i) predictive uncertainty indeed
helps achieve reliable malware detection in the presence of dataset shift, but
cannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (ii) approximate Bayesian methods
are promising to calibrate and generalize malware detectors to deal with
dataset shift, but cannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (iii)
adversarial evasion attacks can render calibration methods useless, and it is
an open problem to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predicted
labels of adversarial examples (i.e., it is not effective to use predictive
uncertainty to detect adversarial examples).

these structures are reinforced, apart by regular orbits, also by orbits in the
vicinity of complex unstable periodic orbits. We examine the evolution of the
phase space structure in the immediate neighbourhood of the periodic orbits in
cases where the stability of a family presents a successive transition from
stability to complex instability and then to stability again, as energy
increases. We find that we have a gradual reshaping of invariant structures
close to the transition points and we trace this evolution in both models. We
conclude that for time scales significant for the dynamics of galaxies, there
are weakly chaotic orbits associated with complex unstable periodic orbits,

  EV electricity demand response programs",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The global electric car sales in 2020 continued to exceed the expectations
climbing to over 3 millions and reaching a market share of over 4%. However,
uncertainty of generation caused by higher penetration of renewable energies
and the advent of Electrical Vehicles (EV) with their additional electricity
demand could cause strains to the power system, both at distribution and
transmission levels. Demand response aggregation and load control will enable
greater grid stability and greater penetration of renewable energies into the
grid. The present work fits this context in supporting charging optimization
for EV in parking premises assuming a incumbent high penetration of EVs in the
system. We propose a methodology to predict an estimation of the parking
duration in shared parking premises with the objective of estimating the energy
requirement of a specific parking lot, evaluate optimal EVs charging schedule
and integrate the scheduling into a smart controller. We formalize the
prediction problem as a supervised machine learning task to predict the
duration of the parking event before the car leaves the slot. This predicted
duration feeds the energy management system that will allocate the power over
the duration reducing the overall peak electricity demand. We structure our
experiments inspired by two research questions aiming to discover the accuracy
of the proposed machine learning approach and the most relevant features for
the prediction models. We experiment different algorithms and features
combination for 4 datasets from 2 different campus facilities in Italy and
Brazil. Using both contextual and time of the day features, the overall results
of the models shows an higher accuracy compared to a statistical analysis based
on frequency, indicating a viable route for the development of accurate
predictors for sharing parking premises energy management systems

understanding factors that determine their behavior, and attempting to improve

Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can be useful for
localization and mapping in low visibility, but return a lot of noise compared
to (more commonly used) lidar, which makes the detection task more challenging.
Our Bounded False-Alarm Rate (BFAR) detector is different from the classical
Constant False-Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector in that it applies an affine
transformation on the estimated noise level after which the parameters that
minimize the estimation error can be learned. BFAR is an optimized combination
between CFAR and fixed-level thresholding. Only a single parameter needs to be
learned from a training dataset. We apply BFAR to the use case of radar
odometry, and adapt a state-of-the-art odometry pipeline (CFEAR), replacing its
original conservative filtering with BFAR. In this way we reduce the
state-of-the-art translation/rotation odometry errors from 1.76%/0.5deg/100 m

input utterances for robust speaker verification. Given the embeddings from a
pair of input utterances, a graph model is designed to incorporate additional
information from a group of embeddings representing the so-called auxiliary
speakers. The relations between the input utterances and the auxiliary speakers
are represented by the edges and vertices in the graph. The similarity scores
are refined by iteratively updating the values of the graph's vertices using an
algorithm similar to the random walk algorithm on graphs. Through this updating
process, the information of auxiliary speakers is involved in determining the
relation between input utterances and hence contributing to the verification
process. We propose to create a set of artificial embeddings through the model
training process. Utilizing the generated embeddings as auxiliary speakers, no
extra data are required for the graph model in the verification stage. The
proposed model is trained in an end-to-end manner within the whole system.
Experiments are carried out with the Voxceleb datasets. The results indicate
that involving auxiliary speakers with graph is effective to improve speaker

high quality qubits are still needed for demonstrating such algorithms.
  Here, we report the results of an experimental demonstration of amplitude

estimation algorithms were used to estimate the inner product of randomly
chosen four-dimensional unit vectors, and were based on the maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) and the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) techniques.
Significant improvements in accuracy were observed for the MLE based approach
when deeper quantum circuits were taken into account, including circuits with
more than ninety two-qubit gates and depth sixty, achieving a mean additive
estimation error on the order of $10^{-2}$. The CRT based approach was found to
provide accurate estimates for many of the data points but was less robust
against noise on average. Last, we analyze two more amplitude estimation
algorithms that take into account the specifics of the hardware noise to
further improve the results.

ecosystem comprising multiple time series known as co-evolving time series.
Regime shifts refer to the changing behaviors exhibited by series at different
time intervals. Learning these changing behaviors is a key step toward time
series forecasting. While advances have been made, existing methods suffer from
one or more of the following shortcomings: (1) failure to take relationships
between time series into consideration for discovering regimes in multiple time
series; (2) lack of an effective approach that models time-dependent behaviors
exhibited by series; (3) difficulties in handling data discontinuities which
may be informative. Most of the existing methods are unable to handle all of
these three issues in a unified framework. This, therefore, motivates our
effort to devise a principled approach for modeling interactions and
time-dependency in co-evolving time series. Specifically, we model an ecosystem
of multiple time series by summarizing the heavy ensemble of time series into a
lighter and more meaningful structure called a \textit{mapping grid}. By using
the mapping grid, our model first learns time series behavioral dependencies
through a dynamic network representation, then learns the regime transition
mechanism via a full time-dependent Cox regression model. The originality of
our approach lies in modeling interactions between time series in regime
identification and in modeling time-dependent regime transition probabilities,
usually assumed to be static in existing work.

how to route service teams (i.e., vehicle routing problem),and how to schedule
the appointment times for the customers (i.e., appointment scheduling problem)

an efficient solution method that comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
present a column generation algorithm to solve the sizing, assignment, and
routing problem. The algorithm is enhanced by a high-quality initial solution
which is found using the route-first cluster-second principle and a
polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm. In the second stage, due to the
stochastic nature of travel time, service time, and cancellation, we propose a
simulation-driven approach to decide the appointment times such that a desired
on-time arrival probability is achieved. To ensure the suitability of the
simulation model, we discuss the characterization of the stochastic parameters.
The proposed ideas can be embedded in different solution schemes, including a
fast heuristic method that finds good solutions within seconds or a more
elaborate algorithm to find near-optimal solutions at the expense of longer
computational time. At last, we provide a high-level flexible decision support
tool implemented in AIMMS.

  Customer Power Outage Data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent decades, the weather around the world has become more irregular and
extreme, often causing large-scale extended power outages. Resilience -- the
capability of withstanding, adapting to, and recovering from a large-scale
disruption -- has become a top priority for the power sector. However, the
understanding of power grid resilience still stays on the conceptual level
mostly or focuses on particular components, yielding no actionable results or
revealing few insights on the system level. This study provides a
quantitatively measurable definition of power grid resilience, using a
statistical model inspired by patterns observed from data and domain knowledge.
We analyze a large-scale quarter-hourly historical electricity customer outage
data and the corresponding weather records, and draw connections between the
model and industry resilience practice. We showcase the resilience analysis
using three major service territories on the east coast of the United States.
Our analysis suggests that cumulative weather effects play a key role in
causing immediate, sustained outages, and these outages can propagate and cause
secondary outages in neighboring areas. The proposed model also provides some
interesting insights into grid resilience enhancement planning. For example,
our simulation results indicate that enhancing the power infrastructure in a
small number of critical locations can reduce nearly half of the number of
customer power outages in Massachusetts. In addition, we have shown that our
model achieves promising accuracy in predicting the progress of customer power
outages throughout extreme weather events, which can be very valuable for
system operators and federal agencies to prepare disaster response.

extremely large populations of agents. Yet, most of the literature assumes a
single initial distribution for the agents, which limits the practical
applications of MFGs. Machine Learning has the potential to solve a wider
diversity of MFG problems thanks to generalizations capacities. We study how to
leverage these generalization properties to learn policies enabling a typical
agent to behave optimally against any population distribution. In reference to
the Master equation in MFGs, we coin the term ``Master policies'' to describe
them and we prove that a single Master policy provides a Nash equilibrium,
whatever the initial distribution. We propose a method to learn such Master
policies. Our approach relies on three ingredients: adding the current
population distribution as part of the observation, approximating Master
policies with neural networks, and training via Reinforcement Learning and
Fictitious Play. We illustrate on numerical examples not only the efficiency of
the learned Master policy but also its generalization capabilities beyond the
distributions used for training.

Gravitational-wave birefringence, which can arise from the effective field
theory extension of general relativity, occurs when the parity symmetry is
broken, causing the left- and right-handed polarizations to propagate following
different equations of motion. We perform Bayesian inference on the 94 events
reported by the 4th-Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (4-OGC) using a
parity-violating waveform. We find no evidence for a violation of general
relativity in the vast majority of events. However, the most massive event,
GW190521, and the second most massive event, GW191109, show intriguing non-zero
results for gravitational-wave birefringence. We find that the probability of
association between GW190521 and the possible electromagnetic (EM) counterpart
reported by Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is increased when assuming
birefringence. Excluding GW190521 and GW191109, the parity-violating energy
scale is constrained to $M_\mathrm{PV} > 0.05$ GeV at $90\%$ credible interval,
which is an improvement over previous results from twelve events by a factor of
five. We discuss the implications of our results on modified gravity and
possible alternative explanations such as waveform systematics. More detections
of massive binary black hole mergers from the upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA run
will shed light on the true origin of the apparent birefringence.

the theoretical predictions for the anomalous magnetic moment of muon and the
results of the ""Muon g-2"" experiment. In doing so, we are discussing the new
effect exclusively within the Standard Model. In quantum physics a state with
spin perpendicular to a magnetic field can be expressed as a superposition of
energy eigenstates with spins parallel and antiparallel to the field: the
resultant spin precession is due to the energy difference between the two
eigenstates. If the state, like the muon, is unstable and can decay, it will
have a natural energy spread. As a result the frequency of the spin precession
can vary. For a constant magnetic field the measured spin precession velocity
will be spread according to the Lorentzian distribution with width
$\left(\gamma\tau\right)^{-1}$, for Lorentz gamma factor $\gamma=E/ m$, and
particle lifetime $\tau$. Although the true mean and variance of a Lorentzian
distribution is undefined, the latter can be estimated by the maximum
likelihood method to be ${2 \over N (\gamma \tau)^2}$, twice that of a normal
distribution. Thus, the statistical error on the anomalous magnetic moment in
reality should turn out to be wider than with $\chi^2$ analysis of the
experiment.

dissipative environments. In this work, we extend the tensor network path
integral (TNPI) framework to efficiently simulate such extended systems. The
Feynman-Vernon influence functional is a popular approach used to account for
the effect of environments on the dynamics of the system. In order to
facilitate the incorporation of the influence functional into a multisite
framework (MS-TNPI), we combine a matrix product state (MPS) decomposition of
the reduced density tensor of the system along the sites with a corresponding
tensor network representation of the time axis to construct an efficient 2D
tensor network. The 2D MS-TNPI network, when contracted, yields the
time-dependent reduced density tensor of the extended system as an MPS. The
algorithm presented is independent of the system Hamiltonian. We outline an
iteration scheme to take the simulation beyond the non-Markovian memory
introduced by solvents. Applications to spin chains coupled to local harmonic
baths are presented; we consider the Ising, XXZ and the Heisenberg models,
demonstrating that the presence of local environments can often dissipate the
entanglement between the sites. We discuss three factors causing the system to
transition from a coherent oscillatory dynamics to a fully incoherent dynamics.

took advantage of the recent corrected VIR visible data to map the radiance
factor at 550 nm, three color composites, two spectral slopes, and a band area
parameter relative to the 930 nm crystal field signature in pyroxene. Using the
howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites data as a reference, we derived
the lithology of Vesta using the variations of the 930 nm and 506 nm
(spin-forbidden) band centers observed in the VIR dataset. Our spectral
parameters highlight a significant spectral diversity at the surface of Vesta.
This diversity is mainly evidenced by impact craters and illustrates the
heterogeneous subsurface and upper crust of Vesta. Impact craters also
participate directly in this spectral diversity by bringing dark exogenous
material to an almost entire hemisphere. Our derived lithology agrees with
previous results obtained using a combination of infrared and visible data. We
therefore demonstrate that it is possible to obtain crucial mineralogical
information from visible wavelengths alone. In addition to the 506 nm band, we
identified the 550 nm spin-forbidden one. As reported by a laboratory study for
synthetic pyroxenes, we also do not observe any shift of the band center of
this feature across the surface of Vesta, and thus across different
mineralogies, preventing use of the 550 nm spin-forbidden band for the
lithology derivation. Finally, the largest previously identified olivine
rich-spot shows a peculiar behavior in two color composites but not in the
other spectral parameters.

Cook (2007), Subramaniam et al., (2018), and Adler and Lele (2019), in which
artificial diffusion terms are added to the conservation equations. The second
method is the gradient-form approach that is based on the quasi-conservative
method of Shukla et al., (2010) and Tiwari et al., (2013), in which the
diffusion and sharpening terms (together called regularization terms) are added
to the conservation equations. The third approach is the divergence-form
approach that is based on the fully conservative method of Jain et al., (2020),
in which the regularization terms are added to the conservation equations.
  The primary objective of this work is to compare these three methods in terms
of their ability to maintain: constant interface thickness; the conservation
property; and accurate interface shape for long-time integration. The second
objective of this work is to consistently extend these methods to model
interfaces between solid materials with strength. To assess and compare the
methods, they are used to simulate a wide variety of problems, including (1)
advection of an air bubble in water, (2) shock interaction with a helium bubble
in air, (3) shock interaction and the collapse of an air bubble in water, and
(4) Richtmyer-Meshkov instability of a copper-aluminum interface. The current
work focuses on comparing these methods in the limit of relatively coarse grid
resolution, which illustrates the true performance of these methods. This is
because it is rarely practical to use hundreds of grid points to resolve a
single bubble or drop in large-scale simulations of engineering interest.

likelihood-free forward modeling for Bayesian cosmological inference using the
redshift evolution of the cluster abundance combined with weak-lensing mass
calibration. We use two complementary likelihood-free methods, namely
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Density-Estimation Likelihood-Free
Inference (DELFI), to develop an analysis procedure for inference of the
cosmological parameters $(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\sigma_8)$ and the mass scale of
the survey sample. Adopting an eROSITA-like selection function and a 10-percent
scatter in the observable-mass relation in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.286$ and $\sigma_8=0.82$, we create a synthetic catalog of
observable-selected NFW clusters in a survey area of 50 deg$^2$. The stacked
tangential shear profile and the number counts in redshift bins are used as
summary statistics for both methods. By performing a series of forward
simulations, we obtain convergent solutions for the posterior distribution from
both methods. We find that ABC recovers broader posteriors than DELFI,
especially for the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ parameter. For a weak-lensing survey
with a source density of $n_\mathrm{g}=20$ arcmin$^{-2}$, we obtain posterior
constraints on $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.3}$ of $0.836 \pm 0.032$

redshifts below 0.05. While Chandra unveils the distribution of
X-ray-irradiated gas via Fe-K$\alpha$ emission, the CO($J$=2-1) observations
reveal that of cold molecular gas. At high resolutions $\lesssim$ 1 arcsec, we
derive Fe-K$\alpha$ and CO($J$=2-1) maps for the nuclear 2 arcsec region, and
for the external annular region of 2 arcsec-4 arcsec, where 2 arcsec is $\sim$
100-600 pc for most of our AGNs. First, focusing on the external regions, we
find the Fe-K$\alpha$ emission for six AGNs above 2$\sigma$. Their large
equivalent widths ($\gtrsim$ 1 keV) suggest a fluorescent process as their
origin. Moreover, by comparing 6-7 keV/3-6 keV ratio, as a proxy of
Fe-K$\alpha$, and CO($J$=2-1) images for three AGNs with the highest
significant Fe-K$\alpha$ detections, we find a possible spatial separation.
These suggest the presence of X-ray-irradiated ISM and the change in the ISM
properties. Next, examining the nuclear regions, we find that (1) The 20-50 keV
luminosity increases with the CO($J$=2-1) luminosity. (2) The ratio of
CO($J$=2-1)-to-HCN($J$=1-0) luminosities increases with 20-50 keV luminosity,
suggesting a decrease in the dense gas fraction with X-ray luminosity. (3) The
Fe-K$\alpha$-to-X-ray continuum luminosity ratio decreases with the molecular
gas mass. This may be explained by a negative AGN feedback scenario: the mass
accretion rate increases with gas mass, and simultaneously, the AGN evaporates
a portion of the gas, which possibly affects star formation.

that the majority (44-76%) of events cannot be explained by a smooth magnetar

events with and without bumps. By fitting a simple Gaussian model to the
light-curve residuals, we characterize each bump with an amplitude,
temperature, phase, and duration. We find that most bumps correspond with an
increase in the photospheric temperature of the ejecta, although we do not see
drastic changes in spectroscopic features during the bump. We also find a
moderate correlation ($\rho\approx0.5$; $p\approx0.01$) between the phase of
the bumps and the rise time, implying that such bumps tend to happen at a
certain ""evolutionary phase,"" $(3.7\pm1.4)t_\mathrm{rise}$. Most bumps are
consistent with having diffused from a central source of variable luminosity,
although sources further out in the ejecta are not excluded. With this
evidence, we explore whether the cause of these bumps is intrinsic to the
supernova (e.g., a variable central engine) or extrinsic (e.g., circumstellar
interaction). Both cases are plausible, requiring low-level variability in the
magnetar input luminosity, small decreases in the ejecta opacity, or a thin
circumstellar shell or disk.

circumstellar material (CSM) in the months--years preceding core-collapse. The
ensuing SN explosion launches ejecta that may subsequently collide with this
CSM, producing shocks that can power emission across the electromagnetic
spectrum. In this work we explore the thermal signatures of dense CSM
interaction, when the CSM density profile is truncated at some outer radius.
CSM with optical depth $>c/v$ (where $v$ is the shock velocity) will produce
primarily $\sim$blackbody optical/UV emission whereas lower optical-depth CSM
will power bremsstrahlung X-ray emission. Focusing on the latter, we derive
light-curves and spectra of the resulting X-ray transients, that include a
detailed treatment of Comptonization. Due to strong photoelectric absorption,
the X-ray light-curve is dominated by the `post-interaction' phase that occurs
after the shock reaches the CSM truncation radius. We treat this regime here
for the first time. Using these results, we present the phase-space of optical,
UV, and X-ray transients as a function of CSM properties, and discuss
detectability prospects. We find that ROSAT would not have been sensitive to
CSM X-ray transients but that eROSITA is expected to detect many such events.
Future wide-field UV missions such as ULTRASAT will dramatically enhance
sensitivity to large optical-depth CSM configurations. Finally, we present a
framework within which CSM properties may be directly inferred from observable
features of X-ray transients. This can serve as an important tool for studying
stellar mass loss using SN X-ray detections.

spanning a wide variety of cosmological and astrophysical models and generate
hundreds of thousands of 2-dimensional maps for 13 different fields: from dark
matter to gas and stellar properties. We use these maps to train convolutional
neural networks to extract the maximum amount of cosmological information while
marginalizing over astrophysical effects at the field level. Although our maps
only cover a small area of $(25~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^2$, and the different fields
are contaminated by astrophysical effects in very different ways, our networks
can infer the values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ with a few percent
level precision for most of the fields. We find that the marginalization
performed by the network retains a wealth of cosmological information compared
to a model trained on maps from gravity-only N-body simulations that are not

a gas outflow with speeds up to -1000 km s^-1, and of an inflow that is

measure relative elemental abundances from the interstellar absorption lines

resummation has been extended to next-to-leading power in the threshold
variable, using a variety of approaches. In this paper, we consider partonic
channels that turn on only at next-to-leading power, and show that it is
possible to resum leading logarithms using well-established diagrammatic
techniques in Quantum Chromodynamics. We first consider deep inelastic
scattering, where we reproduce the results of a recent study using an effective
theory approach. Next, we consider the quark-gluon channel in both Drell-Yan
and Higgs boson production, showing that an explicit all-order form for the
leading logarithmic partonic cross section can be obtained. Our results agree
with previous conjectures based on fixed-order results.

perform the first systematic search of dusty galaxies in high$-z$ quasar

emitters with S/N$\geq5.6$ within a projected radius of
$R\lesssim1.5\,h^{-1}\,$cMpc and a velocity range of
$\rm\Delta\,v=\pm1000\,$km\,s$^{-1}$ around the quasar. In blank fields, we
expect to detect only 0.28 CO emitters within the same volume, implying a total
overdensity of $17.6^{+11.9}_{-7.6}$ in our fields, and indicating that quasars
trace massive structures in the early universe. We quantify this overdensity by
measuring the small-scale clustering of CO emitters around quasars, resulting
in a cross-correlation length of $r_{\rm

This contradicts the reported mild overdensities (x1.4) of Lyman alpha emitters

described by a cross-correlation length 3 times lower than that measured for CO
emitters. We discuss some possibilities to explain this discrepancy, including
low star formation efficiency, and excess of dust in galaxies around quasars.
Finally, we constrain, for the first time, the clustering of CO emitters at
$z\sim4$, finding an auto-correlation length of $r_{\rm

collection of axions, commonly known as a string axiverse. Axions also have a
natural cosmological production mechanism, vacuum misalignment, making them
well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates. Much work on axion production has
considered the case of a single free axion, but in a realistic axiverse, string
axions are expected to be distributed densely over many orders of magnitude in
mass, and to interact with one another through their joint potential. In this
paper, we show that non-linearities in this potential lead to a new type of
resonant energy transfer between axions with nearby masses. This resonance
generically transfers energy from axions with larger decay constants to those
with smaller decay constants, and leads to a multitude of signatures. These
include enhanced direct detection prospects for a resonant pair comprising even
a small subcomponent of dark matter, and boosted small-scale structure if the
pair is the majority of DM. Near-future iterations of experiments such as ADMX

magnetism is the investigation of exotic spin states, most notably quantum spin
liquids (QSLs). Magnetic rare-earth ions go beyond the straightforward paradigm
of geometrical frustration in Heisenberg antiferromagnets by introducing
competing energy scales, and in particular their strong spin-orbit coupling
creates multiple split crystal electric-field (CEF) levels, leading to
anisotropic effective spin models with intrinsic frustration. While rare-earth
delafossites have a triangular-lattice geometry, and thus have gained recent
attention as candidates for hosting spin-1/2 QSL physics, the reliable
extraction of effective spin models from the initial many-parameter CEF
spectrum is a hard problem. Using the example of CsYbSe2, we demonstrate the
unambiguous extraction of the Stevens-operators coefficients dictating the full
CEF spectrum of Yb$^{3+}$ by translating these into parameters with a direct
physical interpretation. Specifically, we combine low-field susceptibility
measurements with resonant torsion magnetometry experiments in fields up to 60
T to determine a sufficiently large number of physical parameters -- effective
Zeeman splittings, anisotropic van Vleck coefficients, and magnetotropic
coefficients -- that the set of Stevens-operator coefficients is unique. Our
crucial identification of the strong corrections to the Zeeman splitting of
Kramers doublets as van Vleck coefficients has direct consequences for the
interpretation of all anisotropic magnetic susceptibility measurements. Our
results allow us to determine the nature and validity of an effective spin-1/2
model for CsYbSe2, to provide input for theoretical studies of such models on
the triangular lattice, and to provide additional materials insight into routes
for achieving magnetic frustration and candidate QSL systems in rare-earth

approach developed by Nielsen, parameterizing the path ordered unitary

many non-cold dark matter models, including thermal relic warm dark matter,
sterile-neutrinos, fuzzy dark matter, and a significant fraction of ETHOS

the following results. (1) Even after eliminating spurious haloes, the halo
mass function in the strongly suppressed regime ($n_{\rm{X}}/n_{\rm{CDM}} <
5\%$) remains uncertain because it depends strongly on the definition of a
halo. At these mass scales traditional halo finders primarily identify
overdensities that are unbound, highly elongated, dominated by tidal fields, or
far from virialized. (2) The regime where the suppression is smaller than a
factor of 20 is quite robust to these uncertainties, however, and can be
inferred reliably from suitable N-body simulations. (3) Parameterizing the
suppression in the halo- and subhalo mass functions through the scales where
the suppression reaches $20\%$, $50\%$ and $80\%$, we provide simple formulae
which enable predictions for many non-cold dark matter models. (4) The halo
mass-concentration relations in our sheet+release simulations agree well with
previous results based on N-body simulations. (5) In general, we confirm the
validity of previous N-body studies of warm dark matter models, largely
eliminating concerns about the effects of artificial haloes.

space to determine their ""spines,"" which we project on the sky to constrain
cloud distances with $\approx 1\%$ uncertainty. For each cloud, we determine an
average radial volume density profile around its 3D spine and fit the profiles
using Gaussian and Plummer functions. The radial volume density profiles are
well-described by a two-component Gaussian function, consistent with clouds
having broad, lower-density outer envelopes and narrow, higher-density inner
layers. The ratio of the outer to inner envelope widths is $\approx 3:1$. We
hypothesize that these two components may be tracing a transition between
atomic and diffuse molecular gas or between the unstable and cold neutral
medium. Plummer-like models can also provide a good fit, with molecular clouds
exhibiting shallow power-law wings with density, $n$, falling off like $n^{-2}$

pivot mass of $\log(M_{p}/M_{\odot})=10.2-10.6$ the relation follows
$R_{e}\propto M_{\ast}^{0.1}$; above $M_{p}$ the relation is steeper and
follows $R_{e}\propto M_{\ast}^{0.6-0.7}$. For star-forming galaxies, below
$\log(M_{p}/M_{\odot})\sim10.7$ the relation follows $R_{e}\propto
M_{\ast}^{0.2}$; above $M_{p}$ the relation evolves with redshift and follows
$R_{e}\propto M_{\ast}^{0.3-0.6}$. The shallow power-law slope for quiescent
galaxies below $M_{p}$ indicates that large low-mass quiescent galaxies have
sizes similar to those of their counterpart star-forming galaxies. We take this
as evidence that large low-mass quiescent galaxies have been recently quenched
(presumably through environment-specific process) without significant
structural transformation. Interestingly, the pivot stellar mass of the
$R_{e}-M_{\ast}$ relations coincides with mass at which half of the galaxy
population is quiescent, implied that the pivot mass represents the transition
of galaxy growth from being dominated by in-situ star formation to being
dominated by (dry) mergers.

Ising model gives rise to an exact scattering theory with seven massive

temperature phases of this model are related by duality. This duality
guarantees that the leading and sub-leading magnetisation operators,
$\sigma(x)$ and $\sigma'(x)$, in either phase are accompanied by associated
disorder operators, $\mu(x)$ and $\mu'(x)$. Working specifically in the high
temperature phase, we write down the sets of bootstrap equations for these four
operators. For $\sigma(x)$ and $\sigma'(x)$, the equations are identical in
form and are parameterised by the values of the one-particle form factors of
the two lightest $\mathbb{Z}_2$ odd particles. Similarly, the equations for
$\mu(x)$ and $\mu'(x)$ have identical form and are parameterised by two
elementary form factors. Using the clustering property, we show that these four
sets of solutions are eventually not independent; instead, the parameters of
the solutions for $\sigma(x)/\sigma'(x)$ are fixed in terms of those for
$\mu(x)/\mu'(x)$. We use the truncated conformal space approach to confirm
numerically the derived expressions of the matrix elements as well as the
validity of the $\Delta$-sum rule as applied to the off-critical correlators.
We employ the derived form factors of the order and disorder operators to
compute the exact dynamical structure factors of the theory, a set of
quantities with a rich spectroscopy which may be directly tested in future
inelastic neutron or Raman scattering experiments.

test these ideas with deep MUSE observations of NGC 5746, a massive ($\sim
10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) edge-on disc galaxy with no classical bulge. We analyse its
stellar kinematics and stellar populations, and infer that a massive and
extended disc formed very early: 80% of the galaxy's stellar mass formed more
than 10 Gyr ago. Most of the thick disc and the bar formed during that early
phase. The bar drove gas towards the center and triggered the formation of the
nuclear disc followed by the growth of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. Around
$\sim$ 8 Gyr ago, a $\sim$1:10 merger happened, possibly on a low-inclination
orbit. The satellite did not cause significant vertical heating, did not
contribute to the growth of a classical bulge, and did not destroy the bar and
the nuclear disc. It was however an important event for the galaxy: by
depositing its stars throughout the whole galaxy it contributed $\sim 30$% of
accreted stars to the thick disc. NGC 5746 thus did not completely escape
mergers, but the only relatively recent significant merger did not damage the
galaxy and did not create a classical bulge. Future observations will reveal if

massive stars, particularly massive binaries, is of great importance. In this
paper, by adopting the technique of measuring the equivalent widths of several
spectral lines, we identified 9,382 early-type stars from LAMOST
medium-resolution survey and divided the sample into four groups, T1
($\sim$O-B4), T2 ($\sim$B5), T3 ($\sim$B7), and T4 ($\sim$B8-A). The relative
radial velocities $RV_{\rm rel}$ were calculated using the Maximum Likelihood
Estimation. The stars with significant changes of $RV_{\rm rel}$ and at least
larger than 15.57km s$^{-1}$ were identified as spectroscopic binaries. We
found that the observed spectroscopic binary fractions for the four groups are
$24.6\%\pm0.5\%$, $20.8\%\pm0.6\%$, $13.7\%\pm0.3\%$, and $7.4\%\pm0.3\%$,
respectively. Assuming that orbital period ($P$) and mass ratio ($q$) have
intrinsic distributions as $f(P) \propto P^\pi$ (1\textless$P$\textless1000
days) and $f(q) \propto q^\kappa$ (0.1\textless$q$\textless1), respectively, we
conducted a series of Monte-Carlo simulations to correct observational biases
for estimating the intrinsic multiplicity properties. The results show that the
intrinsic binary fractions for the four groups are 68$\%\pm8\%$, 52$\%\pm3\%$,
44$\%\pm6\%$, and 44$\%\pm6\%$, respectively. The best estimated values for
$\pi$ are -1$\pm0.1$, -1.1$\pm0.05$, -1.1$\pm0.1$, and -0.6$\pm0.05$,
respectively. The $\kappa$ cannot be constrained for groups T1 and T2 and is
-2.4$\pm0.3$ for group T3 and -1.6$\pm0.3$ for group T4. We confirmed the
relationship of a decreasing trend in binary fractions towards late-type stars.
No correlation between the spectral type and the orbital period distribution
has been found yet, possibly due to the limitation of observational cadence.

protoplanetary disc. Recent ALMA observations have identified three dust rings
with a prominent gap at $100\, \rm au$ and misalignments between each of the
rings. A break in the gas disc may be driven either by the torque from the
triple star system or a planet that is massive enough to carve a gap in the
disc. Once the disc is broken, the rings nodally precess on different
timescales and become misaligned. We investigate the origins of the dust rings
by means of $N$-body integrations and 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations.
We find that for observationally-motivated parameters of protoplanetary discs,
the disc does not break due to the torque from the star system. We suggest that
the presence of a massive planet (or planets) in the disc separates the inner
and outer disc. We conclude that the disc breaking in GW Ori is likely caused
by undetected planets -- the first planet(s) in a circumtriple orbit.

distortions. In this work we present deep new imaging of the NGC1052 group,
obtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, to test this hypothesis. We find
that both galaxies show strong position angle twists and are significantly more
elongated at their outskirts than in their interiors. The group's central
massive elliptical NGC1052 is the most likely source of these tidal
disturbances. The observed distortions imply that the galaxies have a low total
mass or are very close to NGC1052. Considering constraints on the galaxies'
relative distances, we infer that the dark matter halo masses of these galaxies
cannot be much greater than their stellar masses. Calculating pericenters from
the distortions, we find that the galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits,
with a ratio of pericenter to present-day radius Rperi/R0~0.1 if the galaxies
are dark matter-free and Rperi/R0~0.01 if they have a normal dark halo. Our
findings provide strong evidence, independent of kinematic constraints, that
both galaxies are dark matter deficient. Furthermore, the similarity of the

expansion history and the composition of the Universe, the distribution of
stars and dark matter in galaxies, the host galaxies of quasars, and the
stellar initial mass function. Finding them in astronomical images is a classic
""needle in a haystack"" problem, as they are outnumbered by other (contaminant)
sources by many orders of magnitude. To solve this problem, we develop
state-of-the-art deep learning methods and train them on realistic simulated
quads based on real images of galaxies taken from the Dark Energy Survey, with
realistic source and deflector models, including the chromatic effects of
microlensing. The performance of the best methods on a mixture of simulated and
real objects is excellent, yielding area under the receiver operating curve in
the range 0.86 to 0.89. Recall is close to 100% down to total magnitude i~21
indicating high completeness, while precision declines from 85% to 70% in the
range i~17-21. The methods are extremely fast: training on 2 million samples
takes 20 hours on a GPU machine, and 10^8 multi-band cutouts can be evaluated
per GPU-hour. The speed and performance of the method pave the way to apply it
to large samples of astronomical sources, bypassing the need for photometric
pre-selection that is likely to be a major cause of incompleteness in current

matrix equivalence: if the assumed model is correctly specified, two
information matrices that are derived from the likelihood function are
equivalent. In the literature, this principle has been established for the
likelihood function with fully observed data, but it has not been verified
under the likelihood for censored data. In this manuscript, we prove the
information matrix equivalence in the framework of semiparametric copula models
for multivariate censored survival data. Based on this equivalence, we propose
an information ratio (IR) test for the specification of the copula function.
The IR statistic is constructed via comparing consistent estimates of the two
information matrices. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the IR statistic
and propose a parametric bootstrap procedure for the finite-sample $P$-value

affects the cosmological gravitational bending of light, by numerical
integration of the geodesic equations for a Swiss cheese model consisting of a
point mass and a compensated vacuole, in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
background. We find that there is virtually no dependence of the light bending
on the cosmological constant that is not already accounted for in the angular
diameter distances of the standard lensing equations, plus small modifications
that arise because the bending is restricted to a finite region covered by the
hole. The residual $\Lambda$ dependence for a $10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$ lens is at
the level of 1 part in $10^7$, and even this might be accounted for by small
changes in the hole size evolution as the photon crosses. We therefore conclude
that there is no need for modification of the standard cosmological lensing
equations in the presence of a cosmological constant.

constructed from MERA circuits can be interpreted in terms of the
renormalization group(RG), and their fixed points are RG fixed points, i.e.
scale-invariant systems such as conformal field theories. Here, building upon
the theoretical proposal of Kim and Swingle, we numerically and experimentally
study the robust preparation of the ground state of the critical Ising model
using circuits adapted from the work of Evenbly and White. The experimental
implementation exhibits self-correction through renormalization seen in the
convergence and stability of local observables, and makes essential use of the
ability to measure and reset individual qubits afforded by the ""quantum CCD""

mitigation by zero-noise extrapolation schemes specially adapted for

text alone is limited, recently introduced visually grounded syntax models make
use of multimodal information leading to improved performance in constituency
grammar induction. However, as compared to dependency grammars, constituency
grammars do not provide a straightforward way to incorporate visual information
without enforcing language-specific heuristics. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised grammar induction model that leverages word concreteness and a
structural vision-based heuristic to jointly learn constituency-structure and
dependency-structure grammars. Our experiments find that concreteness is a
strong indicator for learning dependency grammars, improving the direct
attachment score (DAS) by over 50\% as compared to state-of-the-art models
trained on pure text. Next, we propose an extension of our model that leverages
both word concreteness and visual semantic role labels in constituency and

outperforms the current state-of-the-art visually grounded models in
constituency parsing even with a smaller grammar size.

obtained with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and constraints are formulated as
chance-constraints. Our main theoretical contribution is a SMPC formulation
that optimizes over a novel feedback policy class designed to exploit
additional structure in the GMM predictions, and that is amenable to convex
programming. The use of feedback policies for prediction is motivated by the
need for reduced conservatism in handling multi-modal predictions of the
surrounding vehicles, especially prevalent in traffic intersection scenarios.
We evaluate our algorithm along axes of mobility, comfort, conservatism and
computational efficiency at a simulated intersection in CARLA. Our simulations
use a kinematic bicycle model and multimodal predictions trained on a subset of
the Lyft Level 5 prediction dataset. To demonstrate the impact of optimizing
over feedback policies, we compare our algorithm with two SMPC baselines that
handle multi-modal collision avoidance chance constraints by optimizing over

SoftDrop groomed momentum fraction (\zg), groomed jet radius (\rg), and subjet
momentum fraction (\zsj) and opening angle (\tsj). The latter observable is
introduced for the first time. Fully corrected subjet measurements are
presented for \pp collisions and are compared to leading order Monte Carlo
models. The subjet \tsj~distributions reflect the jets leading opening angle
and are utilized as a proxy for the resolution scale of the medium in \AuAu
collisions. We compare data from \AuAu collisions to those from \pp which are
embedded in minimum-bias \AuAu events in order to include the effects of
detector smearing and the heavy-ion collision underlying event. The subjet
observables are shown to be more robust to the background than \zg~and \rg.
  We observe no significant modifications of the subjet observables within the
two highest-energy, back-to-back jets, resulting in a distribution of opening
angles and the splittings that are vacuum-like. We also report measurements of
the differential di-jet momentum imbalance ($A_{\rm{J}}$) for jets of varying
\tsj. We find no qualitative differences in energy loss signatures for varying
angular scales in the range $0.1 < $ \tsj $ < 0.3$, leading to the possible
interpretation that energy loss in this population of high momentum di-jet
pairs, is due to soft medium-induced gluon radiation from a single color-charge
as it traverses the medium.

phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a-P and how this
structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains
abundant five-membered rings, as well as more complex seven- and eight-atom
clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during
compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of
medium-range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids
suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5 GPa) does not break the
connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. Our work provides a
starting point for further computational studies of the structure and
properties of a-P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML-driven modeling can
accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

oracle problem. It uses a set of metamorphic relations (MRs), which are
relations among multiple inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine
whether the program under test is faulty. Typically, MRs vary in their ability
to detect faults in the program under test, and some MRs tend to detect the
same set of faults. In this paper, we propose approaches to prioritize MRs to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MT for regression testing. We
present two MR prioritization approaches: (1) fault-based and (2)
coverage-based. To evaluate these MR prioritization approaches, we conduct
experiments on three complex open-source software systems. Our results show
that the MR prioritization approaches developed by us significantly outperform
the current practice of executing the source and follow-up test cases of the
MRs in an ad-hoc manner in terms of fault detection effectiveness. Further,
fault-based MR prioritization leads to reducing the number of source and
follow-up test cases that needs to be executed as well as reducing the average
time taken to detect a fault, which would result in saving time and cost during
the testing process.

investigate charging behavioral dynamics of a fully electrified shared mobility
system from both system-level and individual driver perspectives. The electric
taxi (ET) trajectory data contain detailed travel information of over 20,000

utilization, temporal and spatial charging dynamics as well as individual
driver level charging preferences. Specifically, we report that both temporal

within-day and daily regularities, and most charging activities are induced
from drivers' shift schedules. Further, with 425 charging stations, we observe
that the drivers show strong preferences over a small subset of charging
stations, and the power-law distribution can well characterize the charging
frequency at each charging station. Finally, we show that drivers' shift
schedules also dominate the individual charging behavior, and there are
strikingly stable daily charging patterns at the individual level. The results

16,480 rearrangements in mainland D. yakuba and two locally adapted populations
of D. santomea and D yakuba on Sao Tome. Three loci that are associated with
signals of strong differentiation in D. santomea lie adjacent to UV resistance

these mutations are facilitated by TE insertions, and 28% are TE facilitated
ectopic recombination. In D. santomea 468 mutations are associated with strong

associated with signals of local adaptation also show significant changes in

anisotropy in 2D materials to tailor of modal fields supported by 2D material

constituent 2D materials, the modal fields of these 2D modes can be tailored to
localize around the waveguide center, which in turn can improve the
efficiencies of coupling-based photonic functions using 2D materials, from
in-plane multimode-interference couplers to out-of-plane optical radiation.
Using natural anisotropic 2D materials such as black phosphorus, these pivotal

The proposed design ensures that the zone tracking objective is achieved in

invariant set within the target zone is determined and is used as the actual
zone tracked in the proposed EMPC. This approach ensures that the zone tracking
objective is achieved within finite steps and once the zone tracking objective
is achieved (the system state enters the robust control invariant set), the

introduce the notion of risk factor in the controller design. An algorithm to

numerical code to study the radial dynamics of and accretion onto AdS black
bubbles, with exterior matter provided by scalar fields. In doing so we develop
numerical methods that could be extended to future studies beyond spherical

molecules, and BBMM and AltBBMM scale the training of MOB-ML up by over 30
times to 6500 molecules (more than a million pair energies). The accuracy and
transferability of both algorithms are examined on the benchmark datasets of
organic molecules with 7 and 13 heavy atoms. These lower-scaling
implementations of the GP preserve the state-of-the-art learning efficiency in
the low-data regime while extending it to the large-data regime with better

However, currently there is no method that can automatically detect misaligned

""CorAl"", an alignment quality measure and alignment classifier for point cloud
pairs, which facilitates the ability to introspectively assess the performance
of registration. CorAl compares the joint and the separate entropy of the two
point clouds. The separate entropy provides a measure of the entropy that can
be expected to be inherent to the environment. The joint entropy should
therefore not be substantially higher if the point clouds are properly aligned.
Computing the expected entropy makes the method sensitive also to small
alignment errors, which are particularly hard to detect, and applicable in a
range of different environments. We found that CorAl is able to detect small
alignment errors in previously unseen environments with an accuracy of 95% and
achieve a substantial improvement to previous methods.

key-based cryptographic data protection by adopting data encryption with a
multi-level key protection scheme. It guarantees that the user data is visible
only in non-privileged mode to a designated program trusted by the data owner
on a designated hardware, thus protecting the data from an untrusted hardware,
hypervisor, OS, or other users' applications. The cryptographic keys and
protocols used for achieving these confidential computing requirements are
described in a use case example. Encrypting and decrypting data in an
EDAP-enabled processor can lead to performance degradation as it adds cycle
time to the overall execution. However, our simulation result shows that the
slowdown is only 6% on average across a collection of commercial workloads when
the data encryption engine is placed between the L1 and L2 cache. We
demonstrate that the EDAP architecture is valuable and practicable in the

asymptotically Gaussian. Such an asymptotic result validates the wide-accepted
assumption of Gaussian noise. We clarify that the recently observed phenomenon
of heavy tails within gradient noise may not be intrinsic properties, but the
consequence of insufficient mini-batch size; the gradient noise, which is a sum
of limited i.i.d. random variables, has not reached the asymptotic regime of
CLT, thus deviates from Gaussian. We quantitatively measure the goodness of
Gaussian approximation of the noise, which supports our conclusion. Secondly,
we analyze the noise-induced dynamics of stochastic gradient descent using the
Langevin equation, granting for momentum hyperparameter in the optimizer with a
physical interpretation. We then proceed to demonstrate the existence of the

  Communication Attacks",,,,,"cs.RO cs.DS cs.GT cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of multi-robot target tracking asks for actively planning the
joint motion of robots to track targets. In this paper, we focus on such target
tracking problems in adversarial environments, where attacks or failures may
deactivate robots' sensors and communications. In contrast to the previous
works that consider no attacks or sensing attacks only, we formalize the first
robust multi-robot tracking framework that accounts for any fixed numbers of
worst-case sensing and communication attacks. To secure against such attacks,
we design the first robust planning algorithm, named Robust Active Target
Tracking (RATT), which approximates the communication attacks to equivalent
sensing attacks and then optimizes against the approximated and original
sensing attacks. We show that RATT provides provable suboptimality bounds on
the tracking quality for any non-decreasing objective function. Our analysis
utilizes the notations of curvature for set functions introduced in
combinatorial optimization. In addition, RATT runs in polynomial time and
terminates with the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for
(non-robust) target tracking. Finally, we evaluate RATT with both qualitative
and quantitative simulations across various scenarios. In the evaluations, RATT
exhibits a tracking quality that is near-optimal and superior to varying
non-robust heuristics. We also demonstrate RATT's superiority and robustness
against varying attack models (e.g., worst-case and bounded rational attacks).

measurements has discovered measurable dysarthria.
  Objective: To determine the potential clinical utility of machine learning
and deep learning/AI approaches for the aiding of diagnosis, biomarker
extraction and progression monitoring of multiple sclerosis using speech
recordings.
  Methods: A corpus of 65 MS-positive and 66 healthy individuals reading the
same text aloud was used for targeted acoustic feature extraction utilizing
automatic phoneme segmentation. A series of binary classification models was
trained, tuned, and evaluated regarding their Accuracy and area-under-curve.

to be reached in 2031, and previous aphelion at $40,400\pm260$ au. Backwards
integration of the orbit under a standard Galactic tidal model and known
stellar encounters suggests this is a pristine new comet, with a perihelion of
$q\approx18$ au on its previous perihelion passage 3.5 Myr ago. The photometric
data show an unresolved nucleus with absolute magnitude $H_r=8.0,$ colors that
are typical of comet nuclei or Damocloids, and no secular trend as it traversed
the range 34--23 au. For $r$-band geometric albedo $p_r,$ this implies a
diameter of $150 (p_r/0.04)^{-0.5}$ km. There is strong evidence of brightness
fluctuations at $\pm0.2$ mag level, but no rotation period can be discerned. A
coma consistent with a ``stationary' $1/\rho$ surface-brightness distribution
grew in scattering cross-section at an exponential rate from $A f \rho\approx1$
m to $\approx150$ m as the comet approached from 28 to 20 au. The activity is
consistent with a simple model of sublimation of a surface species in radiative
equilibrium with the Sun. The inferred enthalpy of sublimation matches those of
$CO_2$ and $NH_3$. More-volatile species -- $N_2,$ $CH_4,$ and $CO$ -- must be
far less abundant on the sublimating surfaces.

actions, dubbed R(MA)^2B. The state of each arm evolves according to a
controlled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm
depends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action
taken. The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize
the expected value of the cumulative rewards collected. Since finding the
optimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing
index policy which we call Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Our policy
is well-defined even if the underlying MDPs are not indexable. We prove that it
is asymptotically optimal when the activation budget and number of arms are
scaled up, while keeping their ratio as a constant. For the case when the
system parameters are unknown, we develop a learning algorithm. Our learning
algorithm uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and further
uses a generative model in order to fully exploit the structure of
Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. We call it the R(MA)^2B-UCB algorithm.
As compared with the existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to an
offline optimum policy, and also achieves a sub-linear regret with a low
computational complexity. Experimental results show that R(MA)^2B-UCB

In this paper, we show how to resolve the problem of non-veridicality without
appealing to layered graphs through a mapping from AMRs into Simply-Typed
Lambda Calculus (STLC). At least for some cases, this requires the introduction
of a new role :content which functions as an intensional operator. The
translation proposed is inspired by the formal linguistics literature on the
event semantics of attitude reports. Next, we address the interaction of
quantifier scope and intensional operators in so-called de re/de dicto
ambiguities. We adopt a scope node from the literature and provide an explicit
multidimensional semantics utilizing Cooper storage which allows us to derive
the de re and de dicto scope readings as well as intermediate scope readings
which prove difficult for accounts without a scope node.

algorithms for this task from a random initialization. In particular, provided
each iteration can be written as the solution to a convex optimization problem
satisfying some natural conditions, we leverage Gaussian comparison theorems to
derive a deterministic sequence that provides sharp upper and lower bounds on
the error of the algorithm with sample-splitting. Crucially, this deterministic
sequence accurately captures both the convergence rate of the algorithm and the
eventual error floor in the finite-sample regime, and is distinct from the
commonly used ""population"" sequence that results from taking the
infinite-sample limit. We apply our general framework to derive several
concrete consequences for parameter estimation in popular statistical models
including phase retrieval and mixtures of regressions. Provided the sample size
scales near-linearly in the dimension, we show sharp global convergence rates
for both higher-order algorithms based on alternating updates and first-order
algorithms based on subgradient descent. These corollaries, in turn, yield
multiple consequences, including: (a) Proof that higher-order algorithms can
converge significantly faster than their first-order counterparts (and
sometimes super-linearly), even if the two share the same population update and
(b) Intricacies in super-linear convergence behavior for higher-order
algorithms, which can be nonstandard (e.g., with exponent 3/2) and sensitive to
the noise level in the problem. We complement these results with extensive
numerical experiments, which show excellent agreement with our theoretical
predictions.

pipelines (Jauhiainen et al.,2019) and is not a solved problem in real-world
settings. We present a lightweight and effective language identifier that is
robust to changes of domain and to the absence of copious training data.
  The key idea for classification is that the reciprocal of the rank in a
frequency table makes an effective additive feature score, hence the term
Reciprocal Rank Classifier (RRC). The key finding for language classification
is that ranked lists of words and frequencies of characters form a sufficient
and robust representation of the regularities of key languages and their
orthographies.
  We test this on two 22-language data sets and demonstrate zero-effort domain
adaptation from a Wikipedia training set to a Twitter test set. When trained on
Wikipedia but applied to Twitter the macro-averaged F1-score of a
conventionally trained SVM classifier drops from 90.9% to 77.7%. By contrast,
the macro F1-score of RRC drops only from 93.1% to 90.6%. These classifiers are
compared with those from fastText and langid. The RRC performs better than
these established systems in most experiments, especially on short Wikipedia
texts and Twitter.
  The RRC classifier can be improved for particular domains and conversational
situations by adding words to the ranked lists. Using new terms learned from
such conversations, we demonstrate a further 7.9% increase in accuracy of
sample message classification, and 1.7% increase for conversation
classification. Surprisingly, this made results on Twitter data slightly worse.
  The RRC classifier is available as an open source Python package

large degree of heterogeneity. In this study we propose that incorporating a
coarse velocity field in the input of neural networks is an effective way to
improve the prediction performance. The coarse velocity field can be simulated
with a low computational cost and provides global information to regularize the
ill-posedness of the learning problem, which is usually caused by the use of
local geometries due to the computational resource constraints. We show that
incorporating the coarse-mesh velocity field significantly improves the
prediction accuracy of the fine-mesh velocity field by comparison to the
prediction that relies on geometric information alone, especially for the
porous medium with a large interior vuggy pore space. We also show the
flexibility of training the network in using coarse velocity fields with
various resolutions. The results suggest that even using coarse velocity field
with a very low resolution, the predictions are still enhanced and close to the
ground truths. The feasibility of the method is further demonstrated by testing
the trained network on real rocks. This study highlights the merits of
incorporating a coarse-mesh velocity field into the input for neural networks,
which provides global, physics-based information for the model, thereby
improving the model's generalization capability.

behavior of $\Lambda$CDM model with viscous cold dark matter (CDM) and an
early-time viscous radiation domination era with cosmological constant (CC).
The fluids are described by the barotropic equation of state (EoS)
$p=(\gamma-1)\rho$, where $p$ is the equilibrium pressure of the fluid, $\rho$
their energy density, and $\gamma$ is the barotropic index. We explore two
particular cases for the bulk viscosity $\xi$, a constant bulk viscosity
$\xi=\xi_{0}$, and a bulk viscosity proportional to the energy density of the
fluid $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho$. Due to some previous investigations that have explored
to describe the behavior of the universe with a negative CC, we extend our
analysis to this case. We found that future singularities like Big-Rip are
allowed but without having a phantom EoS associated to the DE fluid. Big-Crunch
singularities also appears when a negative CC is present, but also de Sitter
and even Big-Rip types are allowed due to the negative pressure of the
viscosity, which opens the possibility of an accelerated expansion in AdS
cosmologies. We also discuss a very particular solution without Big Bang

resilient prediction serving systems that can effectively cope with
stragglers/failures and minimize response delays has attracted much interest.
The common approach for tackling this problem is replication which assigns the
same prediction task to multiple workers. This approach, however, is very
inefficient and incurs significant resource overheads. Hence, a learning-based
approach known as parity model (ParM) has been recently proposed which learns
models that can generate parities for a group of predictions in order to
reconstruct the predictions of the slow/failed workers. While this
learning-based approach is more resource-efficient than replication, it is
tailored to the specific model hosted by the cloud and is particularly suitable
for a small number of queries (typically less than four) and tolerating very
few (mostly one) number of stragglers. Moreover, ParM does not handle Byzantine
adversarial workers. We propose a different approach, named Approximate Coded
Inference (ApproxIFER), that does not require training of any parity models,
hence it is agnostic to the model hosted by the cloud and can be readily
applied to different data domains and model architectures. Compared with
earlier works, ApproxIFER can handle a general number of stragglers and scales
significantly better with the number of queries. Furthermore, ApproxIFER is
robust against Byzantine workers. Our extensive experiments on a large number
of datasets and model architectures also show significant accuracy improvement
by up to 58% over the parity model approaches.

due to their geological formation and mechanisms of weathering and
fragmentation. It is known that particle shape strongly affects shear strength.
However, the effects of shape can be modified by the role the particle plays in
a sample given its size. We explore the steady shear strength of samples
composed of particles presenting size-shape correlations and we focus on the
case of particle elongation in two opposite scenarios: (A) large elongated
grains with finer circular grains and (B) large circular grains with elongated
finer grains. By means of numerical simulations, we probe the shear strength of
samples of varying particle size span from mono to highly polydisperse and
particle aspect ratios varying between 1 and 5. We find that the two
correlations tested strongly impact the shear strength as particle size span
evolves. Microstructural analyses allow us to identify how each correlation
affects connectivity and anisotropies linked to the orientation of the
particles and load transmission. Decompositions of the stress tensor let us
identify the sources of the different mechanical behavior in each correlation
and determine the contributions of each particle shape to macroscopic shear
strength. This study proves that common small-scaling methods based on
truncated or parallel particle size distributions can incur in
under/over-estimations of shear strength if particle shapes are not considered
in the scaling process.

exist for describing coupled fluid-solid mechanics. However, these models are
not adapted to describe systems with multiple fluid phases or 'hybrid-scale'

unique set of volume-averaged partial differential equations that
asymptotically approach the Navier-Stokes Volume-of-Fluid equations in
solid-free-regions and Biot's Poroelasticity Theory in porous regions. Unlike
existing multiscale multiphase solvers, it can match analytical predictions of
capillary, relative permeability, and gravitational effects at both the pore

extensive benchmarking, we show that our model accurately captures the strong
two-way coupling that is often exhibited between multiple fluids and deformable
porous media during processes such as swelling, compression, and fracturing.
The versatility of the approach is illustrated through studies that 1)
quantified the effects of microporosity on sedimentary rock permeability, 2)
identified the governing non-dimensional parameters that predict capillary and
viscous fracturing in porous media, 3) characterised the effects of cracking on
hydraulic fracture formation, and 4) described wave absorption and propagation
in poroelastic coastal barriers. The approach's open-source numerical

uncertainty-guided sampling prevents the bias in training towards large planar

learning from just a few (typically, 1 to 5) labelled examples. An effective
approach to few-shot classification involves a prior model trained on a
large-sample base domain, which is then finetuned over the novel few-shot task
to yield generalizable representations. However, task-specific finetuning is
prone to overfitting due to the lack of enough training examples. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a new finetuning approach based on contrastive learning
that reuses unlabelled examples from the base domain in the form of
distractors. Unlike the nature of unlabelled data used in prior works,
distractors belong to classes that do not overlap with the novel categories. We
demonstrate for the first time that inclusion of such distractors can
significantly boost few-shot generalization. Our technical novelty includes a
stochastic pairing of examples sharing the same category in the few-shot task
and a weighting term that controls the relative influence of task-specific
negatives and distractors. An important aspect of our finetuning objective is
that it is agnostic to distractor labels and hence applicable to various base
domain settings. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method shows
accuracy gains of up to $12\%$ in cross-domain and up to $5\%$ in unsupervised
prior-learning settings.

thirty billion possibilities, we fully identified which norms achieve
cooperation and possess evolutionary stability against behavioural mutants. By
systematically categorizing all these norms according to their behaviours, we
found similarities and dissimilarities to their binary-reputation counterpart,
the leading eight. We obtained four rules that should be satisfied by the

particular, we find the achievable maximal values of the CHSH parameter for
unbiased measurements on arbitrary states, and, alternatively, for arbitrary
measurements on states with maximally-mixed marginals, and determine the

Existing pre-trained models (e.g., Word2vec and BERT) have greatly improved the
expressiveness for short text representations with more condensed,
low-dimensional and continuous features compared to the traditional
Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. However, these models are trained for general

paper, we propose two methods to exploit the unsupervised autoencoder (AE)
framework to further tune the short text representations based on these
pre-trained text models for optimal clustering performance. In our first method
Structural Text Network Graph Autoencoder (STN-GAE), we exploit the structural
text information among the corpus by constructing a text network, and then
adopt graph convolutional network as encoder to fuse the structural features
with the pre-trained text features for text representation learning. In our
second method Soft Cluster Assignment Autoencoder (SCA-AE), we adopt an extra
soft cluster assignment constraint on the latent space of autoencoder to
encourage the learned text representations to be more clustering-friendly. We
tested two methods on seven popular short text datasets, and the experimental
results show that when only using the pre-trained model for short text
clustering, BERT performs better than BoW and Word2vec. However, as long as we
further tune the pre-trained representations, the proposed method like SCA-AE
can greatly increase the clustering performance, and the accuracy improvement
compared to use BERT alone could reach as much as 14\%.

symmetries. This is explicitly demonstrated for the emergence of $S^n\
(n=1,2,3)$ for $SO(n+1)$ symmetries by checking the topological and the
geometric (Laplacian) properties of the emerging configurations. The transition
between the two phases has the form of splitting/merging of distributions of
variables, resembling a matrix model counterpart, namely, the transition
between one-cut and two-cut solutions. However this resemblance is obscured by
a difference of the mechanism of the distribution in our setup from that in the
matrix model. We also discuss this transition as a replica symmetry breaking.
We perform various preliminary studies of the properties of the phases and the
transition for such values of the argument.

maximum entropy production (MEP) principle that exploits higher order

the non-quadratic maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. We demonstrate that
the solution to the MaxSAT problem can be directly mapped to the entropy
production rate in the oscillator network, and subsequently, propose an
area-efficient hardware implementation that leverages Compute-in-Memory (CiM)

elucidate the performance of the proposed approach in computing high-quality
optimal / near-optimal solutions to the MaxSAT problem. Our work not only
reveals how oscillators can solve non-quadratic combinatorial optimization
problems such as MaxSAT but also extends the application of this dynamical

Calculations were performed on supercells of H$_3$S doped with 1.85-25\%
carbon, corresponding to SH$_3$~$\rightarrow$~CH$_3$ or
SH$_3$~$\rightarrow$~CH$_4$ substitutions, primarily at pressures of 270 GPa

a CH$_6$ configuration within the cubic H$_3$S framework structure that forms
under pressure. In the second, the carbon can be four-fold coordinated as
methane intercalated into the H-S lattice, with or without an additional
hydrogen in the framework. The results indicate that unusual local bonding
configurations with respect to carbon can be stabilized under pressure. The
doping breaks degenerate bands, lowering the density of states at the Fermi

doping do not increase $N_F$ to values as high as those calculated for

scattering sources with a broad range of sizes. Here we estimate the
probability of contribution of each scatterer size by modeling the measured
form factor as a linear combination of form factors from individual sacatterer

technique, we cast scatterer size distribution as an optimization problem, and
efficiently solve it using a linear system of equations. In the second
technique, we use the solution of this system of equations to constrain the
optimization function, and solve the constrained problem. The methods are
evaluated in simulated backscattered coefficients using Faran theory. We
evaluate the robustness of the proposed techniques by adding Gaussian noise.
The results show that both methods can accurately estimate the scatterer size

lack of consensus on what they are about. There are often two independent
motivations (i) symbols as a lingua franca for human-AI interaction and (ii)
symbols as system-produced abstractions used by the AI system in its internal

Whatever the answer there is, the need for (human-understandable) symbols in
human-AI interaction seems quite compelling. Symbols, like emotions, may well
not be sine qua non for intelligence per se, but they will be crucial for AI
systems to interact with us humans -- as we can neither turn off our emotions

to process materials to high strains and impart microstructural refinement.
High pressure torsion (HPT) is one technique that imparts inhomogeneous strain
to process discs with low strain in the center and high strain at the outer
edge. In the literature, this inhomogeneity is typically ignored when
characterizing wear properties after HPT. In this work, the wear rate of pure
copper discs processed by HPT was characterized by conducting dry sliding
reciprocating wear tests at a few judicious locations on the discs. From only
two discs, the wear resistance across many ranges of strains was captured.
These measurements agreed with the literature for other SPD processes at
varying strains. Wear rates dropped and plateaued at about 25% that of the
unprocessed state when processing past equivalent strains of around 15, after
which microstructural and microhardness saturation has also been observed. Some
indication of a relationship between the direction of the imposed SPD shearing
and the sliding wear direction was also observed. The incremental
microstructure, microhardness, and wear resistance evolution past equivalent
strains of ~15 indicate that for high purity copper these properties receive no
clear benefit from higher SPD strains.

from an infinite memoryless bath in two-dimensional holographic theories. We
find that an increase in both entropy and temperature, as implied by the
Clausius inequality of classical thermodynamics, are necessary but not
sufficient to not violate QNEC in quenches leading to transitions between
thermal states with momentum which are dual to Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli
geometries. For an arbitrary initial state, we can determine the lower and
upper bounds on the increase of entropy (temperature) for a fixed increase in
temperature (entropy). Our results provide explicit instances of quantum lower
and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production whose existence has been
established in literature. We also find monotonic behavior of the
non-saturation of the QNEC with time after a quench, and analytically determine
their asymptotic values. Our study shows that the entanglement entropy of an
interval of length $l$ always thermalizes in time $l/2$ with an exponent $3/2$.
Furthermore, we determine the coefficient of initial quadratic growth of
entanglement analytically for any $l$, and show that the slope of the
asymptotic ballistic growth of entanglement for a semi-infinite interval is
twice the difference of the entropy densities of the final and initial states.
We determine explicit upper and lower bounds on these rates of growth of
entanglement.

New physics contributions and collision energy can largely affect the kinematic

law, where $d=\dim M$. Given a dynamical assumption implying additional local
regularity, Duistermaat and Guillemin improve this to $o(\sigma^{d-1})$. By
examining the Tauberian step in the argument, we show how a quantitative
version \[N(\sigma) = Z(\sigma) + O(\sigma^{d-1}\mathcal{R}(\sigma)^{-1/2})\]
of the Duistermaat-Guillemin result follows under slightly stronger hypotheses,
these implying that the $(d-1)$-fold regularized half-wave trace \[\langle

point cloud is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision and geometry
processing due to its various applications such as compression, object

several efficient approaches for solving this problem for clean 3D point
clouds. However, this problem becomes difficult to solve in the presence of
outliers and missing parts due to occlusions while scanning the objects through

voting-based techniques but fail in challenging settings. In this work, we
propose a statistical estimator for the plane of reflection symmetry that is
robust to outliers and missing parts. We pose the problem of finding the
optimal estimator as an optimization problem on a 2-sphere that quickly
converges to the global solution. We further propose a 3D point descriptor that
is invariant to 3D reflection symmetry using the spectral properties of the
geodesic distance matrix constructed from the neighbors of a point. This helps
us in decoupling the chicken-and-egg problem of finding optimal symmetry plane

inference, provide assumption-free inference for treatment effects. They have
been the gold standard for drawing causal inference and provide excellent
internal validity. However, they have also been criticized for questionable
external validity, in the sense that the conclusion may not generalize well to
a larger population. The randomized survey experiment is a design tool that can
help mitigate this concern, by randomly selecting the experimental units from
the target population of interest. However, as pointed out by Morgan and Rubin
(2012), chance imbalances often exist in covariate distributions between
different treatment groups even under completely randomized experiments. Not
surprisingly, such covariate imbalances also occur in randomized survey
experiments. Furthermore, the covariate imbalances happen not only between
different treatment groups, but also between the sampled experimental units and
the overall population of interest. In this paper, we propose a two-stage
rerandomization design that can actively avoid undesirable covariate imbalances
at both the sampling and treatment assignment stages. We further develop
asymptotic theory for rerandomized survey experiments, demonstrating that
rerandomization provides better covariate balance, more precise treatment
effect estimators, and shorter large-sample confidence intervals. We also
propose covariate adjustment to deal with remaining covariate imbalances after
rerandomization, showing that it can further improve both the sampling and
estimated precision. Our work allows general relationship among covariates at
the sampling, treatment assignment and analysis stages, and generalizes both
rerandomization in classical randomized experiments (Morgan and Rubin 2012) and
rejective sampling in survey sampling (Fuller 2009).

recent years due to their better scalability, speed, rewritability, and yet
non-volatility. However, their \emph{limited endurance} is still a major
drawback that has to be improved before they can be widely adapted in
large-scale systems.
  In this work, in order to reduce the wear out of the cells, we propose a new
coding scheme, called \emph{endurance-limited memories} (\emph{ELM}) codes,
that increases the endurance of these memories by limiting the number of cell
programming operations. Namely, an \emph{$\ell$-change $t$-write ELM code} is a
coding scheme that allows to write $t$ messages into some $n$ binary cells
while guaranteeing that each cell is programmed at most $\ell$ times. In case
$\ell=1$, these codes coincide with the well-studied \emph{write-once memory}
(\emph{WOM}) codes. We study some models of these codes which depend upon
whether the encoder knows on each write the number of times each cell was
programmed, knows only the memory state, or even does not know anything. For
the decoder, we consider these similar three cases. We fully characterize the
capacity regions and the maximum sum-rates of three models where the encoder
knows on each write the number of times each cell was programmed. In
particular, it is shown that in these models the maximum sum-rate is $\log
\sum_{i=0}^{\ell} {t \choose i}$. We also study and expose the capacity regions
of the models where the decoder is informed with the number of times each cell
was programmed. Finally we present the most practical model where the encoder
read the memory before encoding new data and the decoder has no information

approach of QCD. In order to solve the quark gap equation, we approximate the
dressed quark-gluon vertex with the bare one and adopt both the Marris-Tandy
(MT) model and the infrared constant (Qin-Chang) model for the dressed gluon
propagator. Our results indicate that the second, third, and forth order
fluctuations of net quark number all diverge at the critical end point (CEP).
Around the CEP, the second order fluctuation possesses obvious pump while the
third and fourth order ones exhibit distinct wiggles between positive and
negative. For the MT model and the Qin-Chang model, we give the pseudo-critical
temperature at zero quark chemical potential as $T_{c}=146$ MeV and $150$ MeV,
and locate the CEP at $({\mu_{E}^{q}}, {T_{E}^{}}) = (120, 124)$ MeV and
$(124,129)$ MeV, respectively. In addition, our results manifest that the
fluctuations are insensitive to the details of the model, but the location of
the CEP shifts to low chemical potential and high temperature as the
confinement length scale increases.

Useful or meaningful information is extracted from these data often through
statistical learning or model fitting. In massive datasets, both sample size
and number of predictors can be large, in which case conventional methods face
computational challenges. Recently, an innovative and effective sampling scheme
based on leverage scores via singular value decompositions has been proposed to
select rows of a design matrix as a surrogate of the full data in linear
regression. Analogously, variable screening can be viewed as selecting rows of
the design matrix. However, effective variable selection along this line of
thinking remains elusive. In this article, we bridge this gap to propose a
weighted leverage variable screening method by utilizing both the left and
right singular vectors of the design matrix. We show theoretically and
empirically that the predictors selected using our method can consistently
include true predictors not only for linear models but also for complicated
general index models. Extensive simulation studies show that the weighted
leverage screening method is highly computationally efficient and effective. We
also demonstrate its success in identifying carcinoma related genes using

multi-level spectral-spatial correlation between the two streams, which is
vital to improving the fusion performance. In consideration of this, we propose
a Multi-level and Enhanced Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (MESSFN) with the
following innovations: First, to fully exploit and strengthen the above
correlation, a Hierarchical Multi-level Fusion Architecture (HMFA) is carefully
designed. A novel Spectral-Spatial (SS) stream is established to hierarchically
derive and fuse the multi-level prior spectral and spatial expertise from the
MS stream and the PAN stream. This helps the SS stream master a joint
spectral-spatial representation in the hierarchical network for better modeling
the fusion relationship. Second, to provide superior expertise, consequently,
based on the intrinsic characteristics of the MS image and the PAN image, two
feature extraction blocks are specially developed. In the MS stream, a Residual
Spectral Attention Block (RSAB) is proposed to mine the potential spectral
correlations between different spectra of the MS image through adjacent
cross-spectrum interaction. While in the PAN stream, a Residual Multi-scale
Spatial Attention Block (RMSAB) is proposed to capture multi-scale information
and reconstruct precise high-frequency details from the PAN image through an
improved spatial attention-based inception structure. The spectral and spatial
feature representations are enhanced. Extensive experiments on two datasets
demonstrate that the proposed network is competitive with or better than
state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in github.

performance, which holds for any specific detection method. Moreover, we
provide an analytic expression for the false alarm probability concerning the a

interval, the false alarm probability equals the a priori probability of the

mathematically, which indicates that DI is an achievable theoretical limit of
target detection. Specifically, when empirical DI is gained from the sampling a
posteriori detection method approaches the DI, the probability of failed

is more than DI. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the correctness

The microwave-generating interactions in CCTWTs take place mostly in coupled
resonant cavities positioned periodically along the electron beam axis.
Operational features of a CCTWT particularly the amplification mechanism are
similar to those of a multicavity klystron (MCK). We advance here a Lagrangian
field theory of CCTWTs with the space being represented by one-dimensional
continuum. The theory integrates into it the space-charge effects including the
so-called debunching (electron-to-electron repulsion). The corresponding
Euler-Lagrange equations are ODEs with coefficients varying periodically in the

the Floquet theory including the monodromy matrix and its Floquet multipliers.
We use them to derive closed form expressions for a number of physically
significant quantities. Those include in particular the dispersion relations
and the frequency dependent gain foundational to the RF signal amplification.
Serpentine (folded, corrugated) traveling wave tubes are very similar to CCTWTs

it is not possible to run LN and Bitcoin on resource-constrained IoT devices

idea is to involve the IoT device only in signing operations, which is possible
by replacing LN's original 2-of-2 multisignature channels with 3-of-3
multisignature channels. Once the gateway is delegated to open a channel for
the IoT device in a secure manner, our protocol enforces the gateway to request
the IoT device's cryptographic signature for all further operations on the
channel such as sending payments or closing the channel. LN's Bitcoin
transactions are revised to incorporate the 3-of-3 multisignature channels. In
addition, we propose other changes to protect the IoT device's funds from

medium. Processes that are believed to occur inside nuclei include quark energy
loss through medium-stimulated gluon bremsstrahlung and intra-nuclear
interactions of forming hadrons. More data are required to gain a more complete
understanding of these effects. Purpose: To test the theoretical models of
parton transport and hadron formation, we compared their predictions for the
nuclear and kinematic dependence of pion production in nuclei. Methods: We have
measured charged-pion production in semi-inclusive DIS off D, C, Fe, and Pb
using the CLAS detector and the CEBAF 5.014 GeV electron beam. We report
results on the nuclear-to-deuterium multiplicity ratio for $\pi^{+}$ and
$\pi^{-}$ as a function of energy transfer, four-momentum transfer, and pion
energy fraction or transverse momentum - the first three-dimensional study of
its kind. Results: The $\pi^{+}$ multiplicity ratio is found to depend strongly
on the pion fractional energy $z$, and reaches minimum values of $0.67\pm0.03$,
$0.43\pm0.02$, and $0.27\pm0.01$ for the C, Fe, and Pb targets, respectively.
The $z$ dependences of the multiplicity ratios for $\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{-}$ are
equal within uncertainties for C and Fe targets but show differences at the
level of 10$\%$ for the Pb-target data. The results are qualitatively described
by the GiBUU transport model, as well as with a model based on hadron
absorption, but are in tension with calculations based on nuclear fragmentation
functions. Conclusions: These precise results will strongly constrain the
kinematic and flavor dependence of nuclear effects in hadron production,
probing an unexplored kinematic region. They will help to reveal how the
nucleus reacts to a fast quark, thereby shedding light on its color structure,
transport properties, and on the mechanisms of the hadronization process.

diseases, using Few-Shot Learning (FSL). We learn a feature extractor to
generate embeddings and then update the embeddings using Transformers. Using
Mahalanobis distance, a class-covariance-based metric, we then calculate the
similarity of the transformed embeddings with the embedding of the image to be
classified. Using our proposed architecture, we conduct extensive experiments
on multiple datasets showing the effectiveness of our proposed model. We
conduct 42 experiments in total to comprehensively analyze the model and it
achieves up to 14% and 24% performance gains on few-shot image classification
benchmarks on two datasets.
  We also compile a new FSL dataset containing images of healthy and diseased
plants taken in real-world settings. Using our proposed architecture which has
been shown to outperform several existing FSL architectures in agriculture, we
provide strong baselines on our newly proposed dataset.

lately due to its efficacy in safeguarding the client's confidential
information. Nevertheless, despite the inherent and additional
privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy, secure multi-party
computation, etc.), the FL models are still vulnerable to various
privacy-violating and security-compromising attacks (e.g., data or model
poisoning) due to their numerous attack vectors which in turn, make the models
either ineffective or sub-optimal. Existing adversarial models focusing on
untargeted model poisoning attacks are not enough stealthy and persistent at
the same time because of their conflicting nature (large scale attacks are
easier to detect and vice versa) and thus, remain an unsolved research problem
in this adversarial learning paradigm. Considering this, in this paper, we
analyze this adversarial learning process in an FL setting and show that a
stealthy and persistent model poisoning attack can be conducted exploiting the
differential noise. More specifically, we develop an unprecedented DP-exploited
stealthy model poisoning (DeSMP) attack for FL models. Our empirical analysis
on both the classification and regression tasks using two popular datasets
reflects the effectiveness of the proposed DeSMP attack. Moreover, we develop a
novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based defense strategy against such model
poisoning attacks which can intelligently and dynamically select the privacy
level of the FL models to minimize the DeSMP attack surface and facilitate the
attack detection.

effectively exploit the unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image

models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain
and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g., adhesive
edges or thin branches) for medical image segmentation. Leveraging these
challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training
more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new
designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple slightly
different decoders (i.e., using different up-sampling strategies). The
statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the
model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, we
apply a novel mutual consistency constraint between one decoder's probability
output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the
discrepancy of multiple outputs (i.e., the model uncertainty) during training
and force the model to generate invariant results in such challenging regions,
aiming at regularizing the model training. We compared the segmentation results
of our MC-Net+ model with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on
three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two standard
semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over
other methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation. Our code is released publicly at

confidential cyber physical energy systems (CPES) data. However, applying DP
without analyzing the utility, privacy, and security requirements can affect
the data utility as well as help the attacker to conduct integrity attacks
(e.g., False Data Injection(FDI)) leveraging the differentially private data.
Existing anomaly-detection-based defense strategies against data integrity
attacks in DP-based smart grids fail to minimize the attack impact while
maximizing data privacy and utility. To address this challenge, it is
nontrivial to apply a defensive approach during the design process. In this
paper, we formulate and develop the defense strategy as a part of the design
process to investigate data privacy, security, and utility in a DP-based smart
grid network. We have proposed a provable relationship among the DP-parameters
that enables the defender to design a fault-tolerant system against FDI
attacks. To experimentally evaluate and prove the effectiveness of our proposed
design approach, we have simulated the FDI attack in a DP-based grid. The
evaluation indicates that the attack impact can be minimized if the designer
calibrates the privacy level according to the proposed correlation of the
DP-parameters to design the grid network. Moreover, we analyze the feasibility
of the DP mechanism and QoS of the smart grid network in an adversarial
setting. Our analysis suggests that the DP mechanism is feasible over existing
privacy-preserving mechanisms in the smart grid domain. Also, the QoS of the
differentially private grid applications is found satisfactory in adversarial
presence.

Adaptation (FDA) has been proposed in the field of computer vision to tackle
the domain shift problem by replacing the magnitude of the low-frequency
spectrum of a synthetic sample (source) with a real sample (target). This
method is attractive in ultrasound imaging given that two important differences
between synthetic and real ultrasound data are caused by unknown values of
attenuation and speed of sound (SOS) in real tissues. Attenuation leads to slow
variations in the amplitude of the B-mode image, and SOS mismatch creates
aberration and subsequent blurring. As such, both domain shifts cause
differences in the low-frequency components of the envelope data, which are
replaced in the proposed method. We demonstrate that applying the FDA method to

superconductors, its identity still remains debated to date. For this reason,
spectroscopic signatures of electron-boson interactions in cuprates have always
been a center of attention. For example, the kinks in the quasiparticle
dispersion observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
studies have motivated a decade-long investigation of electron-phonon as well
as electron-paramagnon interactions in cuprates. On the other hand, the overlap
between the charge-order correlations and the pseudogap in the cuprate phase
diagram has also generated discussions about the potential link between them.
In the present study, we provide a fresh perspective on these intertwined
interactions using the novel approach of Higgs spectroscopy, i.e. an
investigation of the amplitude oscillations of the superconducting order
parameter driven by a terahertz radiation. Uniquely for cuprates, we observe a
Fano interference of its dynamically driven Higgs mode with another collective
mode, which we reveal to be charge density wave fluctuations from an extensive
doping- and magnetic field-dependent study. This finding is further
corroborated by a mean field model in which we describe the microscopic
mechanism underlying the interaction between the two orders. Our work
demonstrates Higgs spectroscopy as a novel and powerful technique for
investigating intertwined orders and microscopic processes in unconventional
superconductors.

agents' futures are generated by deep neural networks (DNNs). The presented
methods address a wide range of representations for uncertain predictions
including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian mixture models to predict both agent
positions and control inputs conditioned on the scene contexts. We show that
the problem of risk assessment when Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of agent
positions are learned can be solved rapidly to arbitrary levels of accuracy
with existing numerical methods. To address the problem of risk assessment for
non-Gaussian mixture models of agent position, we propose finding upper bounds
on risk using nonlinear Chebyshev's Inequality and sums-of-squares (SOS)
programming; they are both of interest as the former is much faster while the
latter can be arbitrarily tight. These approaches only require higher order
statistical moments of agent positions to determine upper bounds on risk. To
perform risk assessment when models are learned for agent control inputs as
opposed to positions, we propagate the moments of uncertain control inputs
through the nonlinear motion dynamics to obtain the exact moments of uncertain
position over the planning horizon. To this end, we construct deterministic
linear dynamical systems that govern the exact time evolution of the moments of
uncertain position in the presence of uncertain control inputs. The presented
methods are demonstrated on realistic predictions from DNNs trained on the
Argoverse and CARLA datasets and are shown to be effective for rapidly
assessing the probability of low probability events.

Ni-Pb surface alloy has been fabricated on the Pb(111), where the appearance of
domain boundary as well as lattice transformation are further corroborated by
the STM simulations. Given the high spatial and energy resolution, tunnelling
conductance (dI/dU) spectra have resolved a reduced but anisotropic
superconducting gap NiPb about 1.0 meV, in stark contrast to the isotropic Pb
about 1.3 meV on the conventional Pb(111). In addition, the higher density of
states at Fermi energy (D(EF)) of Ni-Pb surface alloy results in an enhancement
of coherence peak height. According to the same Tc about 7.1 K with Pb(111)
from the temperature dependent NiPb and a short decay length Ld about 3.55 nm

the proximity-induced superconductivity. Despite a lack of bulk counterpart,
the atomic-thick Ni-Pb bimetallic compound opens a new pathway to engineer
superconducting properties down to the low-dimensional limit, giving rise to
the emergence of anisotropic superconductivity via proximity effect.

contemporary model for SNe Ia. The donor star in the DDet scenario is expected
to survive the explosion and to be ejected at the high orbital velocity of a
compact binary system. For the first time, we consistently perform 3D
hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of SN ejecta with a helium (He)
star companion within the DDet scenario. We map the outcomes of 3D impact
simulations into 1D stellar evolution codes and follow the long-term evolution
of the surviving He-star companions. Our main goal is to provide the
post-impact observable signatures of surviving He-star companions of DDet SNe
Ia, which will support the search for such companions in future observations.
We find that our surviving He-star companions become significantly overluminous
for about 1e6 yr during the thermal re-equilibration phase. After the star
re-establishes thermal equilibrium, its observational properties are not
sensitive to the details of the ejecta-donor interaction. We apply our results
to hypervelocity star US 708, which is the fastest unbound star in our Galaxy,
travelling with a velocity of about 1200 km/s, making it natural candidate for
an ejected donor remnant of a DDet SN Ia. We find that a He-star donor with an
initial mass of >0.5 Msun is needed to explain the observed properties of US
708. Based on our detailed binary evolution calculations, however, the
progenitor system with such a massive He-star donor cannot get close enough at
the moment of SN explosion to explain the high velocity of US 708. Instead, if
US 708 is indeed the surviving He-star donor of a DDet SN~Ia, it would require
the entire pre-SN progenitor binary to travel at a velocity of about 400 km/s.
It could, for example, have been ejected from a globular cluster in the
direction of the current motion of the surviving donor star.

mechanism somewhat similar to tidal locking. We dubbed it Tidal Locking Theory
(TLT). While Tidal Torque Theory is responsible for the initial angular
momentum of the dark matter halos, the Tidal locking Theory explains the
angular momentum evolution during non-linear ages. Our previous work showed
that close encounters between haloes could drastically change their angular
momentum. The current manuscript argues that the tidal locking theory predicts
partial alignment between speed and the spin direction for the large high-speed
halos. To examine this prediction, we use the IllustrisTNG simulation and look
for the alignment of the halos' rotation axis. We find that the excess
probability of alignment between spin and speed is about 10 percent at $z=0$
for fast haloes; with velocities larger than twice the median. We show that
tidal torque theory predicts that the spin of a halo tends to be aligned with
the middle eigendirection of the tidal tensor. Moreover, we find that the halos
at $z=10$ are preferentially aligned with the middle eigendirection of the
tidal tensor with an excess probability of 15 percent. We show that tidal
torque theory fails to predict correct alignment at $z=0$ while it works almost
flawlessly at $z=10$.

self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow (SG-CFD). Continuous mass
transfer from small to large mass scales (inverse) is formulated. Direct effect
of mass cascade on halo mass function is presented. Mass cascade is local,
two-way, and asymmetric in mass space. Halos inherit/pass their mass from/to
halos of similar size. Two regimes are identified: a propagation range with
scale-independent rate of mass transfer and a deposition range with cascaded
mass consumed to grow halos. Dimensional analysis leads to a power-law mass
function in propagation range with a geometry exponent ${\lambda}$. A
fundamental merging frequency $f_0{\sim}m_p^{\lambda-1}a^{-1}$ is identified,
where $a$ is scale factor. Particle mass $m_p$ can be determined if that
frequency is known. Rate of mass transfer ${\epsilon}_m{\sim}a^{-1}$ is
independent of halo mass, a key feature of propagation range. Typical halos
grow as $m_h{\sim}a^{3/2}$ and halo lifespan scales as ${\sim}m_h^{-\lambda}$.
Chain reaction of mass cascade provides non-equilibrium dark matter flow a
mechanism to continuously release energy and maximize entropy. Continuous
injection of mass (""free radicals"") at the smallest scale is required to
sustain the everlasting inverse mass cascade such that total halo mass $M_h$
increases as $a^{1/2}$. These ""radicals"" might be directly generated at the
smallest Planck scale or by a direct cascade from large to small scales. Entire
mass cascade can be formulated by random walk in mass space, where halos
migrate with an exponential distribution of waiting time. This results in a
heterogeneous diffusion model, where Press-Schechter mass function can be fully
derived without relying on any specific collapse models. A double-$\lambda$
mass function is proposed with different $\lambda$ for two ranges and agrees
with N-body simulations.

Photoheliograpic Results (GPR) and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) and
determined the yearly mean residual rotation rate and the meridional velocity
of sunspot groups in different 5-degree latitude intervals. The residual
rotation rate is found to be -120 m/s to 80 m/s. In a large number of solar
cycles the rotation is to some extent weaker during maxima than that of during
minima. There exist alternate bands of equatorward and poleward merdional
motions. The equatorward motion is dominant mostly around the maxima of solar
cycles with velocity 8-12 m/s, whereas the poleward motion is dominant mostly
around the minima but with a relatively weak velocity, only 4-6 m/s. This
analysis suggests the existence of equatorward migrating alternate bands of
slower and faster than average rotation within the activity belt and no clear
equatorward or poleward migrating bands of meridional motions. A statistically
significant anticorrelation exists between the meridional motion and residual
rotation. The corresponding linear-least-squares best-fit is found to be
reasonably good (slope, -0.028 + or - 0.008, is about 3.5 times larger than its
standard deviation). The significant negative value of the slope indicates the
existence of a strong angular momentum transport toward equator. The slope
leads sunspot number (SN) by about 4 and 9 years. The Morlet wavelet spectrum
of the slope suggests the existence of approximate 11-year periodicity in the
slope almost throughout the data window, but it was very weak during
1920-1940.Overall the results suggest there exits a strong relationship between
the slope and amount of activity during a solar cycle. However, no relationship
is found between the slope and strength of activity on a long-time scale
(longer than 11-year period).

After the SMBHs form a bound binary, gravitational slingshot interactions with
nearby stars drive the core regions towards a tangentially biased stellar
velocity distribution. We use collisionless galaxy merger simulations with
accurate collisional orbit integration around the central SMBHs to demonstrate
that the removal of stars from the centre by slingshot kicks accounts for the

demonstrate that slingshot kicks mostly affect box orbits with small pericentre
distances, leading to a velocity anisotropy of $\beta \lesssim -0.6$ within
several hundred Myr as observed in massive ellipticals with large cores. We
show how different SMBH masses affect the orbital structure of the merger

infections and deaths by sharing their budget with countries with which they
have a relatively high mobility exchange. The proposed framework can be used to

solving RPM problems. Since the ground truth labels are not allowed, we design
a pseudo target based on the prior constraints of the RPM formulation to
approximate the ground truth label, which effectively converts the unsupervised

labelled by the pseudo target, and thus the noisy contrast will lead to
inaccurate model training. To alleviate this issue, we propose to improve the
model performance with negative answers. Moreover, we develop a
decentralization method to adapt the feature representation to different RPM

determine the critical value $\tau(\beta)$ for all $\beta\in(1,2]$, answering a

$\tau(\beta)=(2-\beta)/(\beta-1)$. Furthermore, we show that (i) the function
$\tau: \beta\mapsto\tau(\beta)$ is left continuous on $(1,2]$ with right-hand
limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii)
$\tau$ has no downward jumps, with $\tau(1+)=0$ and $\tau(2)=1/2$; and (iii)
there exists an open set $O\subset(1,2]$, whose complement $(1,2]\setminus O$

bulk geometry of the object and the standard Schwarzschild vacuum solution in
its exterior region. By imposing a well-defined set of matching conditions, we
find a metric that describes this transitional layer and show that it satisfies

subjected to small perturbations about the background solution. In fact, we are
able to show that, at linearized order, all geometrical and matter fluctuations
are perfectly frozen in the transitional layer, just as they are known to be in

nonlinear structures. The parametrisation method of invariant manifolds is used
and adapted to the case of mechanical systems expressed in the physical basis,
so that the technique is directly applicable to problems discretised by the
finite element method. Two nonlinear mappings, respectively related to
displacement and velocity, are introduced, and the link between the two is made
explicit at arbitrary order of expansion. The same development is performed on
the reduced-order dynamics which is computed at generic order following the
different styles of parametrisation. More specifically, three different styles
are introduced and commented: the graph style, the complex normal form style
and the real normal form style. These developments allow making better
connections with earlier works using these parametrisation methods. The
technique is then applied to three different examples. A clamped-clamped arch
with increasing curvature is first used to show an example of a system with a
softening behaviour turning to hardening at larger amplitudes, which can be
replicated with a single mode reduction. Secondly, the case of a cantilever
beam is investigated. It is shown that the invariant manifold of the first mode
shows a folding point at large amplitudes which is not connected to an internal
resonance. This exemplifies the failure of the graph style due to the folding
point, whereas the normal form style is able to pass over the folding. Finally,
A MEMS micromirror undergoing large rotations is used to show the importance of
using high-order expansions on an industrial example.

Furthermore, the extraction of physics parameters is challenged by the large

simulations of idealized setups to study the effects of DM self-interactions
that are elastic and velocity-independent. We go beyond the commonly adopted
assumption of large-angle (rare) DM scatterings, paying attention to the impact
of small-angle (frequent) scatterings on astrophysical observables and related
quantities. Specifically, we focus on DM-galaxy offsets, galaxy--galaxy
distances, halo shapes, morphology, and the phase--space distribution.
Moreover, we compare two methods to identify peaks: one based on the
gravitational potential and one based on isodensity contours. We find that the
results are sensitive to the peak finding method, which poses a challenge for
the analysis of merging systems in simulations and observations, especially for
minor mergers. Large DM-galaxy offsets can occur in minor mergers, especially
with frequent self-interactions. The subhalo tends to dissolve quickly for
these cases. While clusters in late merger phases lead to potentially large
differences between rare and frequent scatterings, we believe that these
differences are non-trivial to extract from observations. We therefore study
the galaxy/star populations which remain distinct even after the DM haloes have
coalesced. We find that these collisionless tracers behave differently for rare

initial boundary value problems. The linearisation procedure frequently results
in a confusing contradiction where the nonlinear problem conserves energy and
has an energy bound but the linearised version does not (or vice versa). In
this paper we attempt to resolve that contradiction and relate nonlinear energy
conserving and bounded initial boundary value problems to their linearised
versions and the related dual problems. We start by showing that a specific
skew-symmetric form of the primal nonlinear problem leads to energy
conservation and a bound. Next, we show that this specific form together with a
non-standard linearisation procedure preserves these properties for the new
slightly modified linearised problem. We proceed to show that the corresponding
linear and nonlinear dual (or self-adjoint) problems also have bounds and
conserve energy due to this specific formulation. Next, the implication of the
new formulation on the choice of boundary conditions is discussed. A
straightforward nonlinear and linear analysis may lead to a different number
and type of boundary conditions required for an energy bound. We show that the
new formulation shed some light on this contradiction. We conclude by
illustrating that the new continuous formulation automatically lead to energy
stable and energy conserving numerical approximations for both linear and
nonlinear primal and dual problems if the approximations are formulated on
summation-by-parts form.

molecular structures and optical absorption spectra of small Ti$_n$C$_x$
clusters, with n = 1-4 and x = 1-4, and some selected larger clusters,

clusters having a single Ti atom, the rest exhibit three-dimensional

dimers. The optical spectra of Ti$_n$C$_x$, computed by time-dependent density
functional theory, using the corrected CAM-B3LYP functional, show absorption
features in the visible and near infrared regions which may help in the

show that the low-energy effective theory is described by a $(2+1)$-dimensional

nontrivial homotopy $\pi_2(SU(3)/U(1)^2)\simeq \mathbb{Z}^2$, this model has
two kinds of magnetic skyrmions, which can be created and annihilated by
monopole instantons. By careful analysis of the Wess-Zumino term in the spin
coherent path integral, we compute the Berry phase for these monopoles and it
produces the destructive interference. This restricts possible perturbations of
the effective Lagrangian by monopole operators, and we see that the
valence-bond-solid (VBS) phase should have degenerate ground states when
$p\not\in 3\mathbb{Z}$. We also compute 't Hooft anomalies to constrain

in interpretability and transparency and facilitate quick decision-making. As
such, scoring systems have been extensively used in a wide variety of
industries such as healthcare and criminal justice. However, the fairness
issues in these models have long been criticized, and the use of big data and
machine learning algorithms in the construction of scoring systems heightens
this concern. In this paper, we propose a general framework to create
fairness-aware, data-driven scoring systems. First, we develop a social welfare
function that incorporates both efficiency and group fairness. Then, we
transform the social welfare maximization problem into the risk minimization
task in machine learning, and derive a fairness-aware scoring system with the
help of mixed integer programming. Lastly, several theoretical bounds are
derived for providing parameter selection suggestions. Our proposed framework
provides a suitable solution to address group fairness concerns in the
development of scoring systems. It enables policymakers to set and customize
their desired fairness requirements as well as other application-specific
constraints. We test the proposed algorithm with several empirical data sets.
Experimental evidence supports the effectiveness of the proposed scoring system
in achieving the optimal welfare of stakeholders and in balancing the needs for
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency.

representation from the visual backbone, and 3) a landmark prediction head that
directly predicts the landmark coordinates from the Transformer's

trained end-to-end without requiring any post-processing steps. This paper also
introduces the smooth-Wing loss function, which addresses the gradient
discontinuity of the Wing loss, leading to better convergence than standard
loss functions such as L1, L2, and Wing loss. Experimental results on the JD

multiple dimensions in both CNNs and transformers, respectively. To ensure

accretion disk. HD141569 is the only known pre-main sequence star characterized
by a hybrid disk. Observations probed the outer-disk structure showing a
complex system of rings and interferometric observations attempted to
characterize its inner 5 au region, but derived limited constraints. The goal
of this work was to explore with new high-resolution interferometric
observations the properties of the dust and gas in the internal regions of
HD141569. We observed HD141569 on mas scales with GRAVITY/VLTI in the
near-infrared at low and high spectral resolution. We interpreted the
visibilities and spectral energy distribution with geometrical models and
radiative transfer techniques to constrain the dust emission. We analyzed the
high spectral resolution quantities to investigate the properties of the
Br-Gamma line emitting region. Thanks to the combination of three different
epochs, GRAVITY resolves the inner dusty disk in the K band. Data modeling
shows that an IR excess of about 6% is spatially resolved and that the origin
of this emission is confined in a ring of material located at a radius of 1 au
from the star with a width smaller than 0.3 au. The MCMax modeling suggests
that this emission could originate from a small amount of QHPs, while large
silicate grain models cannot reproduce at the same time the observational
constraints on the properties of near-IR and mid-IR fluxes. The differential
phases in the Br-Gamma line clearly show an S-shape that can be best reproduced
witha gas disk in Keplerian rotation, confined within 0.09 au. This is also
hinted at by the double-peaked Br-Gamma emission line shape. The modeling of
the continuum and gas emission shows that the inclination and position angle of
these two components are consistent with a system showing relatively coplanar
rings on all scales.

objective value of each solution is an affine function of real-valued
parameters. Then, the goal is to provide an optimal solution set, i.e., a set
containing an optimal solution for each non-parametric problem obtained by
fixing a parameter vector. For many multi-parametric optimization problems,
however, an optimal solution set of minimum cardinality can contain
super-polynomially many solutions. Consequently, no polynomial-time exact
algorithms can exist for these problems even if $\textsf{P}=\textsf{NP}$.
  We propose an approximation method that is applicable to a general class of
multi-parametric optimization problems and outputs a set of solutions with
cardinality polynomial in the instance size and the inverse of the
approximation guarantee. This method lifts approximation algorithms for
non-parametric optimization problems to their parametric version and provides
an approximation guarantee that is arbitrarily close to the approximation
guarantee of the approximation algorithm for the non-parametric problem. If the
non-parametric problem can be solved exactly in polynomial time or if an FPTAS
is available, our algorithm is an FPTAS. Further, we show that, for any given
approximation guarantee, the minimum cardinality of an approximation set is, in
general, not $\ell$-approximable for any natural number $\ell$ less or equal to
the number of parameters, and we discuss applications of our results to
classical multi-parametric combinatorial optimizations problems. In particular,
we obtain an FPTAS for the multi-parametric minimum $s$-$t$-cut problem, an
FPTAS for the multi-parametric knapsack problem, as well as an approximation
algorithm for the multi-parametric maximization of independence systems

encoder (or backbone) is the most commonly observed architectural pattern in
several computer vision methods, and semantic segmentation is no exception. The
two major drawbacks of this architectural pattern are: (i) the networks often
fail to capture small classes such as wall, fence, pole, traffic light, traffic
sign, and bicycle, which are crucial for autonomous vehicles to make accurate
decisions. (ii) due to the arbitrarily increasing depth, the networks require
massive labeled data and additional regularization techniques to converge and
to prevent the risk of over-fitting, respectively. While regularization
techniques come at minimal cost, the collection of labeled data is an expensive
and laborious process. In this work, we address these two drawbacks by
proposing a novel lightweight architecture named point-wise dense flow network

recognised and recent developments have led to the rapid emergence of
facilities, resulting in wider adoption worldwide. Nonetheless, the
availability of CPT and complete exploitation of dosimetric advantages are
still limited by high facility costs and technological challenges. There are
extensive ongoing efforts to improve upon these, which will lead to greater
accessibility, superior delivery, and therefore better treatment outcomes.
Several of these aspects can be addressed by developments to the beam delivery
system (BDS) which determine the overall shaping and timing capabilities to
provide high quality treatments. Modern delivery techniques are necessary but
are limited by extended treatment times. The energy layer switching time (ELST)
is a limiting constraint of the BDS and a determinant of the beam delivery time
(BDT), along with the accelerator and other factors. This review evaluates the
delivery process in detail, presenting the limitations and developments for the
BDS and related accelerator technology, toward decreasing the BDT. As extended
BDT impacts motion and has dosimetric implications for treatment, we discuss
avenues to minimise the ELST and overview the clinical benefits and feasibility
of a large energy acceptance BDS. These developments support the possibility of
delivering advanced methodologies such as volumetric rescanning, FLASH and arc
therapy and can further reduce costs given a faster delivery for a greater
range of treatment indications. Further work to realise multi-ion, image guided

increased treatment efficiency and efficacy could be achieved with an improved
BDS and how this could lead to faster and higher quality treatments for the

ESG ratings using fundamental data. This model is based on feedforward neural
network, CatBoost and XGBoost ensemble members. Given the public availability
of fundamental data, the proposed method would allow cost-efficient and
scalable creation of initial ESG ratings (also for companies without
sustainability reporting). Using our approach we are able to explain 54% of the
variation in ratings R2 using fundamental data and outperform prior work in
this area.

improving the first retriever in ranking pipelines. Learning dense embeddings

proven to work well. Meanwhile, there has been a growing interest in learning
\emph{sparse} representations for documents and queries, that could inherit
from the desirable properties of bag-of-words models such as the exact matching
of terms and the efficiency of inverted indexes. Introduced recently, the
SPLADE model provides highly sparse representations and competitive results
with respect to state-of-the-art dense and sparse approaches. In this paper, we
build on SPLADE and propose several significant improvements in terms of
effectiveness and/or efficiency. More specifically, we modify the pooling
mechanism, benchmark a model solely based on document expansion, and introduce
models trained with distillation. We also report results on the BEIR benchmark.
Overall, SPLADE is considerably improved with more than $9$\% gains on NDCG@10

organisms. We investigate, based on a simple self-propelled particle model, how
the emergence of ordered motion in a collectively moving group is influenced by
the local rules of interactions among the individuals, namely, metric versus
topological interactions as debated over in the current literature. In the case
of the metric ruling, the individuals interact with the neighbours within a
certain metric distance; in contrast, in the topological ruling, interaction is
confined within a number of fixed nearest neighbours. Here, we explore how the
range of interaction versus the number of fixed interacting neighbours affects
the dynamics of flocking in an unbounded space, as observed in natural
scenarios. Our study reveals the existence of a certain threshold value of the
interaction radius in the case of metric ruling and a threshold number of
interacting neighbours for the topological ruling to reach an ordered state.
Interestingly, our analysis shows that topological interaction is more
effective in bringing the order in the group, as observed in field studies. We
further compare how the nature of the interactions affects the dynamics for
various sizes and speeds of the flock.

accessible thanks to dissipative boundary conditions, applied to all but the

transport of a spin-polarization cloud through the helical edge states. The
cloud is formed at a distant edge site using a local magnetic field to inject
an electron spin density and released by suddenly switching off the injection
field. This basic process, consisting of spin injection, propagation of the

can be used to steer the spin state in a controlled way. We find that the

calibration, i.e., their predicted confidence scores do not reflect the
observed accuracy or precision. Recent work has introduced methods for post-hoc
confidence calibration for classification as well as for object detection to
address this issue. Especially in safety critical applications, it is crucial
to obtain a reliable self-assessment of a model. But what if the calibration
method itself is uncertain, e.g., due to an insufficient knowledge base?
  We introduce Bayesian confidence calibration - a framework to obtain
calibrated confidence estimates in conjunction with an uncertainty of the
calibration method. Commonly, Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are used to
indicate a network's uncertainty about a certain prediction. BNNs are
interpreted as neural networks that use distributions instead of weights for
inference. We transfer this idea of using distributions to confidence
calibration. For this purpose, we use stochastic variational inference to build
a calibration mapping that outputs a probability distribution rather than a
single calibrated estimate. Using this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art
calibration performance for object detection calibration. Finally, we show that
this additional type of uncertainty can be used as a sufficient criterion for
covariate shift detection. All code is open source and available at

produced at the MUonE experiment through the process $\mu e \to \mu e

and therefore we cannot observe the decay of $Z^\prime$ directly. It is,
however, still possible to probe this signature by searching for events with a
large scattering angle of muon and a less energetic final-state electron. The
background events coming from the elastic scattering $\mu e \to \mu e$ as well
as radiative process $\mu e \to \mu e \gamma$ can be removed by the kinematical
cuts on the muon scattering angle and the electron energy, in addition to a
photon veto. The background events from the electroweak process $\mu e \to \mu
e \nu \bar{\nu}$ are negligible. With our selection criteria, the number of
signal events $\mu e \to \mu e Z^\prime$ is found to be as large as $\sim 10^3$

therefore, quite feasible to probe the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ gauge boson at the

recommend recording the events relevant to this $Z^\prime$ production process.

can be transferred between different graphs. It is hence important to study the
GCNN transferability: the capacity of the network to have approximately the
same repercussion on different graphs that represent the same phenomenon.
Transferability ensures that GCNNs trained on certain graphs generalize if the
graphs in the test set represent the same phenomena as the graphs in the
training set. In this paper, we consider a model of transferability based on
graphon analysis. Graphons are limit objects of graphs, and, in the graph
paradigm, two graphs represent the same phenomenon if both approximate the same
graphon. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) we prove that
any fixed GCNN with continuous filters is transferable under graphs that
approximate the same graphon, 2) we prove transferability for graphs that
approximate unbounded graphon shift operators, which are defined in this paper,
and, 3) we obtain non-asymptotic approximation results, proving linear
stability of GCNNs. This extends current state-of-the-art results which show
asymptotic transferability for polynomial filters under graphs that approximate

dependence of the scattering polarization of spatially resolved circumstellar
disks illuminated by the central star. These parameters are based on the
natural Stokes $Q$ and $U$ quadrant pattern produced by circumstellar
scattering. They provide a simple test of the deviations of the disk geometry
from axisymmetry and can be used to constrain the scattering phase function for
optically thin disks without detailed model fitting of disk images. The
parameters are easy to derive from observations and model calculations and are
therefore well suited to systematic studies of the dust scattering in
circumstellar disks.
  It is shown for models of optically thin and rotationally symmetric debris
disks that the quadrant parameters normalized to the integrated azimuthal
polarization or quadrant ratios like $Q_{000}/Q_{180}$ depend only on the disk
inclination $i$ and the polarized scattering phase function of the dust, and
they do not depend on the radial distribution of the scattering emissivity.
Because $i$ is usually well known for resolved disk, we can derive the shape of
the phase function for the sampled scattering angle range. This finding also
applies to models with vertical extensions as observed for debris disks.
  Diagnostic diagrams are calculated for normalized quadrant parameters and
quadrant ratios for the determination of the asymmetry parameter $g$ of the
polarized Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase function. We apply these diagrams
to measurements of HR 4796A, and find that a phase function with only one
parameter does not reproduce the data well, but find a better solution with a

planning complex missions for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. This class of

associated with cross-schedule dependencies that constrain the schedules of the

block-fading AWGN channel with multiple receive antennas. Specifically, we
consider the slowly fading scenario where the coherence block-length is large
compared to the number of active users and the message can be transmitted in
one coherence block. Unsourced random access refers to a form of grant-free
random access where users are considered to be a-priori indistinguishable and
the receiver recovers a list of transmitted messages up to permutation. In this
work we show that, when the coherence block length is large enough, a
conventional approach based on the transmission of non-orthogonal pilot
sequences with subsequent channel estimation and Maximum-Ratio-Combining (MRC)
provides a simple energy-efficient solution whose performance can be well
approximated in closed form. Furthermore, we analyse the MRC step when
successive interference cancellation (SIC) is done in groups, which allows to
strike a balance between receiver complexity and reduced transmit powers.
Finally, we investigate the impact of power control policies taking into
account the unique nature of massive random access, including short message
lengths, uncoordinated transmission, a very large amount of concurrent
transmitters with unknown identities, channel estimation errors and decoding
errors. As a byproduct we also present an extension of the MMV-AMP algorithm
which allows to treat pathloss coefficients as deterministic unknowns by
performing maximum likelihood estimation in each step of the MMV-AMP algorithm.

where entanglement is used as a resource and local measurements on qubits are
used to drive the computation. It originates from the one-way quantum computer
of Raussendorf and Briegel, who introduced the so-called cluster state as the
underlying entangled resource state and showed that any quantum circuit could
be executed by performing only local measurement on individual qubits. The
randomness in the measurement outcomes can be dealt with by adapting future
measurement axes so that computation is deterministic. Subsequent works have
expanded the discussions of the measurement-based quantum computation to
various subjects, including the quantification of entanglement for such a
measurement-based scheme, the search for other resource states beyond cluster
states and computational phases of matter. In addition, the measurement-based
framework also provides useful connections to the emergence of time ordering,
computational complexity and classical spin models, blind quantum computation,
etc. and has given an alternative, resource-efficient approach to implement the
original linear-optic quantum computation of Knill, Laflamme and Milburn.
Cluster states and a few other resource states have been created experimentally
in various physical systems and the measurement-based approach offers a
potential alternative to the standard circuit approach to realize a practical

measurement are investigated. We noticed that the weak-to-strong measurement
transition characterized by the shifts of pointer's position and momentum
variables occurred in continuously by controlling a dimensionless parameter
associated with system-pointer coupling. We calculate the ratio between the
signal-to-noise ratio of nonpostselected and postselected measurements, and the
latter is used to find the quantum Fisher information. We found that the
single-photon-added coherent pointer state can improve the precision of the
measurement processes such as signal-to-noise ratio and parameter estimation
after postselected von Neumann measurement characterized by postselection and
weak value. Furthermore, contrary to the results of several previous studies,
we found that the anomalous large weak values can't improve the precision

domains can be expressed and learned in terms of a pool of features defined
from the domain predicates using a description logic grammar. At the same time,
most description logics correspond to a fragment of $k$-variable counting logic
($C_k$) for $k=2$, that has been shown to provide a tight characterization of
the expressive power of graph neural networks. In this work, we make use of
these results to understand the power and limits of using graph neural networks
(GNNs) for learning optimal general policies over a number of tractable
planning domains where such policies are known to exist. For this, we train a
simple GNN in a supervised manner to approximate the optimal value function
$V^{*}(s)$ of a number of sample states $s$. As predicted by the theory, it is
observed that general optimal policies are obtained in domains where general
optimal value functions can be defined with $C_2$ features but not in those
requiring more expressive $C_3$ features. In addition, it is observed that the
features learned are in close correspondence with the features needed to
express $V^{*}$ in closed form. The theory and the analysis of the domains let
us understand the features that are actually learned as well as those that
cannot be learned in this way, and let us move in a principled manner from a
combinatorial optimization approach to learning general policies to a
potentially, more robust and scalable approach based on deep learning.

with a cluster of nodes through two stratospheric HAPS systems. In the latter
model, we assume that the line of sight connectivity is inaccessible between
the two HAPS systems due to high attenuation caused by large propagation
distances. Thereby, we propose a low Earth orbit satellite-aided mixed
RF/FSO/FSO/RF communication. For the proposed scenarios, closed-form
expressions of outage probability (OP) and bit error rate are derived. In
addition, to illustrate the asymptotic behavior of the proposed models,
diversity gains are obtained. Furthermore, ergodic capacity and energy

engineering, we put forward an appraisal instrument for SLRs. The instrument is
intended for use by appraisers of reviews, but authors may also use it as a
checklist when designing and documenting their reviews. Method: A
well-established appraisal instrument from research in healthcare was used as a
starting point to develop a quality assessment instrument. It is adapted to
software engineering using guidelines, checklists, and experiences from
software engineering. As a validation step, the first version was reviewed by
four external experts on SLRs in software engineering and updated based on
their feedback. Results: The outcome of the research is an appraisal instrument
for the quality assessment of SLRs in software engineering. The instrument
intends to support the appraiser in assessing the quality of an SLR. The
instrument includes 16 items with different options to capture the quality. The
item is assessed on a two or three-grade scale, depending on the item. The
instrument also supports consolidating the items into groups, which are then
used to assess the overall quality of a systematic literature review.

fully utilise available data for selfsupervised identification of atypical

""structural"" peculiarity on typical images so that classifying these artefacts
can provide guidance for learning representations for the detection of
anomalous visual signals. In this paper, however, we argue that learning such
structure-sensitive representations can be a suboptimal approach to some
classes of anomaly (e.g., unhealthy fruits) which could be better recognised by
a different type of visual element such as ""colour"". We thus propose Channel
Randomisation as a novel data augmentation method for restricting neural
networks to learn encoding of ""colour irregularity"" whilst predicting
channel-randomised images to ultimately build reliable fruit-monitoring robots
identifying atypical fruit qualities. Our experiments show that (1) this
colour-based alternative can better learn representations for consistently
accurate identification of fruit anomalies in various fruit species, and also,
(2) unlike other methods, the validation accuracy can be utilised as a
criterion for early stopping of training in practice due to positive
correlation between the performance in the self-supervised
colour-differentiation task and the subsequent detection rate of actual
anomalous fruits. Also, the proposed approach is evaluated on a new

individual AGNs. The distribution of their LyC transmission shows values lower
than the range of LyC transmission values for IGM of the same redshift range,
which suggests that LyC escape fraction of AGNs at $z>3.3$ is considerably
lower than unity in most cases. We do not find any trend in LyC transmission
values depending on their UV luminosities. Based on the photometry of stacked
images we find the average flux ratio of LyC and non-ionizing UV photons
escaping from the objects $(f_{LyC}/f_{UV})^{out} = 0.182 \pm 0.043$ for AGNs
at $3.3<z<3.6$, which corresponds to LyC escape fraction $f_{esc} = 0.303 \pm

escape fraction and the UV luminosity function of AGNs, we argue that

allows to incorporate both probabilistic classical and coherent quantum

investigate how classical fluctuations due to temperature and quantum
fluctuations effectuated by coherent spin rotations affect the ability of the

in analogy to the classical Potts-Hopfield neural network. When increasing

wireless communication system by providing the extra link between the base
station (BS) and the user. In order to resist the ""multiplicative fading""
effect, RIS is more likely to develop into extremely large-scale RIS (XL-RIS)
for future 6G communications. Beam training is an effective way to acquire
channel state information (CSI) for the XL-RIS assisted system. Existing beam
training schemes rely on the far-field codebook, which is designed based on the
far-field channel model. However, due to the large aperture of XL-RIS, the user
is more likely to be in the near-field region of XL-RIS. The far-field codebook
mismatches the near-field channel model. Thus, the existing far-field beam
training scheme will cause severe performance loss in the XL-RIS assisted
near-field communications. To solve this problem, we propose the efficient
near-field beam training schemes by designing the near-field codebook to match
the near-field channel model. Specifically, we firstly design the near-field
codebook by considering the near-field cascaded array steering vector of
XL-RIS. Then, the optimal codeword for XL-RIS is obtained by the exhausted
training procedure between the XL-RIS and the user. In order to reduce the beam
training overhead, we further design a hierarchical near-field codebook and
propose the corresponding hierarchical near-field beam training scheme, where
different levels of sub-codebooks are searched in turn with reduced codebook
size. Simulation results show the two proposed near-field beam training schemes
both perform better than the existing far-field beam training scheme.
Particulary, the hierarchical near-field beam training scheme can greatly
reduce the beam training overhead with acceptable performance loss.

the inverse Zhukovskii function with the exponents from the set $\{\pm1/2\}$.
The Riemann surface corresponding to $f\in\mathbb C(z,w)$ is a four-sheeted

of useful quantum devices. Fast perfect state transfer can be exactly achieved
through additional counterdiabatic fields. We show that the additional
energetic overhead associated with implementing counterdiabatic driving can be
reduced while still maintaining high target state fidelities. This is achieved
by implementing control fields only during the impulse regime, as identified by
the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We demonstrate that this strategy successfully
suppresses most of the defects that would be generated due to the finite
driving time for two paradigmatic settings: the Landau-Zener model and the
Ising model. For the latter case, we also investigate the performance of our
impulse control scheme when restricted to more experimentally realistic local
control fields.

generalized Proca theory where the vector field belongs to the Lie algebra of

invariant. New interesting possibilities arise in this framework because of the
existence of new interactions of purely non-Abelian character and new
configurations of the vector field resulting in spatial spherical symmetry and
the cosmological dynamics being driven by the propagating degrees of freedom.
We study the two-dimensional phase space of the system that results when the
cosmic triad configuration is employed in the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background and find an attractor curve
whose attraction basin both covers almost all the allowed region and does not
include a Big-Bang singularity. Such an attractor curve corresponds to a
primordial inflationary solution that has the following characteristic
properties: 1.) it is a de Sitter solution whose Hubble parameter is regulated
by a generalized version of the SU(2) group coupling constant, 2.) it is
constant-roll including, as a limiting case, the slow-roll variety, 3.) a
number of e-folds $N > 60$ is easily reached, 4.) it has a graceful exit into a
radiation dominated period powered by the canonical kinetic term of the vector
field and the Einstein-Hilbert term. The free parameters of the action are
chosen such that the tensor sector of the theory is the same as that of general
relativity at least up to second-order perturbations, thereby avoiding the
presence of ghost and Laplacian instabilities in the tensor sector as well as
making the gravity waves propagate at light speed. This is a proof of concept
of the interesting properties we could find in this scenario when the coupling
constants be replaced by general coupling functions and more terms be
discovered in the GSU2P.

time-consuming activities in program debugging. This activity becomes even much
more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to variability of
failures. These unexpected behaviors are induced by variability faults which
can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. The interaction
among these features causes the failures of the system. Although localizing
bugs in single-system engineering has been studied in-depth, variability fault
localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. In this article,
we present VarCop, a novel and effective variability fault localization
approach. For an SPL system failed by variability bugs, VarCop isolates
suspicious code statements by analyzing the overall test results of the sampled
products and their source code. The isolated suspicious statements are the
statements related to the interaction among the features which are necessary
for the visibility of the bugs in the system. The suspiciousness of each
isolated statement is assessed based on both the overall test results of the
products containing the statement as well as the detailed results of the test
cases executed by the statement in these products. On a large dataset of buggy
SPL systems, empirical evaluation shows that VarCop significantly improves two
state-of-the-art fault localization techniques by 33% and 50% in ranking the
incorrect statements in the systems containing a single bug each. In about
two-thirds of the cases, VarCop ranks the buggy statements at the top-3
positions in the resulting lists. For multiple-bug cases, VarCop outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches 2 times and 10 times in the proportion of bugs
localized at the top-1 positions. In 22% and 65% of the buggy versions, VarCop
correctly ranks at least one bug in a system at the top-1 and top-5 positions.

overall doping, as widely assumed, but when it enhances $T_\mathrm{c}$ above
what can be achieved by doping, it leads to a hole redistribution favoring
planar O. This is similar to the observation that the family-specific maximum
$T_\mathrm{c}$ also increases if the hole content at planar O is raised at the

process: After the network design process, the lines and their frequencies are
planned. When these are fixed, a timetable is determined and based on the
timetable, the vehicle and crew schedules are optimized. After each step,
passenger routes are adapted to model the behavior of the passengers as
realistically as possible. It has been mentioned in many publications that such
a sequential process is sub-optimal, and integrated approaches, mainly
heuristics, are under consideration. Sequential planning is not only common in
public transportation planning but also in many other applied problems, among
others in supply chain management, or in organizing hospitals efficiently.
  The contribution of this paper hence is two-fold: on the one hand, we develop
an integrated integer programming formulation for the three planning stages
line planning, (periodic) timetabling, and vehicle scheduling which also
includes the integrated optimization of the passenger routes. This gives us an
exact formulation rewriting the sequential approach as an integrated problem.
We discuss properties of the integrated formulation and apply it experimentally
to data sets from the LinTim library.
  On the other hand, we propose a mathematical formulation for general
sequential processes which can be used to build integrated formulations. For
comparing sequential processes with their integrated counterparts we analyze
the price of sequentiality, i.e., the ratio between the solution obtained by
the sequential process and an integrated solution. We also experiment with
different possibilities for partial integration of a subset of the sequential
problems and again illustrate our results using the case of public
transportation. The obtained results may be useful for other sequential
processes.

the quasi-linear version of MOND (QUMOND). We compute the
`stellar-to-(phantom)halo-mass relation' (SHMR), a monotonically increasing
power-law resembling the SHMR observationally deduced from spiral galaxy
rotation curves in the Newtonian context. We show that the
gas-to-(phantom)halo-mass relation is flat. We generate a map of the Local
Volume in QUMOND, highlighting the important influence of distant galaxy
clusters, in particular Virgo. This allows us to explore the scatter of the
SHMR and the average density of PDM around galaxies in the Local Volume,
$\Omega_{\rm pdm} \approx 0.1$, below the average cold dark matter density in a
$\Lambda$CDM Universe. We provide a model of the Milky Way in its external
field in the MOND context, which we compare to an observational estimate of the
escape velocity curve. Finally, we highlight the peculiar features related to
the external field effect in the form of negative PDM density zones in the
outskirts of each galaxy, and test a new analytic formula for computing galaxy

adversarial samples that keep the geometric features in clean samples and
contain few outliers. In particular, we use principal directions to constrain
the adversarial perturbations for each input point. The gradient components in
the mean direction of principal directions are taken as adversarial
perturbations. In addition, we also investigate the effect of using the minimum
curvature direction. Besides, we adopt attack strength accumulation and
auxiliary Batch Normalization layers method to speed up the training process
and alleviate the distribution mismatch between clean and adversarial samples.
Experimental results show that training with the adversarial samples crafted by
our method effectively enhances the performance of PCN on the ShapeNet dataset.

tunable beamsplitters at the measurement stations, and the local oscillator
fields significantly varying between the settings, optimally being {\it on} or

advocate for the use of the Clauser-Horne Bell inequalities for detection

optimal measurement settings for the maximal violation of the Clauser-Horne

reflectivity of the local beamsplitter must be equal to the strength of the
local oscillator field. We show that this condition holds not only for the
vacuum-one-photon qubit input state, but also for the superposition of a photon

with a regularisation length parameter $\epsilon$ and obeying a minimum energy
principle. Mesh adaptivity naturally suggests itself as a means of supplying
spatial resolution were needed while simultaneously keeping the computational
size of the model as small as possible. Here, a variational-based spatial
adaptivity is proposed for a phase-field model of fracture.
  The conventional phase-field model is generalised by allowing a spatial
variation of the regularisation length $\epsilon$ in the energy functional. The
optimal spatial variation of the regularisation length then follows by energy
minimisation in the same manner as the displacement and phase fields. The
extended phase-field model is utilised as a basis for an adaptive mesh
refinement strategy, whereby the mesh size is required to resolve the optimal
length parameter locally. The resulting solution procedure is implemented in
the framework of the finite element library FEniCS. Selected numerical tests
suggest that the spatially adaptive phase-field model exhibits the same
convergence rate as the conventional phase-field model, albeit with a vastly
superior constant, which results in considerable computational savings.

boundary in-plane. The assemblies can be either ordered or disordered depending
on the intrinsic disk symmetry. By applying an external load to the assembly,
we observe the nucleation and propagation of different topological defects

gives rise to time-independent localized transition waves. Surprisingly, in the
presence of frustration, the applied load briefly introduces
deformation-induced order to the material. By further deforming the lattices,
new patterns emerge across all disk symmetries. We utilize these patterns to
tune sound propagation through the material. Our findings could open new

  Parallelogram",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Oriented object detection is a challenging task in aerial images since the
objects in aerial images are displayed in arbitrary directions and are
frequently densely packed. The mainstream detectors describe rotating objects
using a five-parament or eight-parament representations, which suffer from
representation ambiguity for orientated object definition. In this paper, we
propose a novel representation method based on area ratio of parallelogram,
called ARP. Specifically, ARP regresses the minimum bounding rectangle of the
oriented object and three area ratios. Three area ratios include the area ratio
of a directed object to the smallest circumscribed rectangle and two
parallelograms to the minimum circumscribed rectangle. It simplifies offset
learning and eliminates the issue of angular periodicity or label point
sequences for oriented objects. To further remedy the confusion issue of nearly
horizontal objects, the area ratio between the object and its minimal
circumscribed rectangle is employed to guide the selection of horizontal or
oriented detection for each object. Moreover, the rotated efficient
Intersection over Union (R-EIoU) loss with horizontal bounding box and three
area ratios are designed to optimize the bounding box regression for rotating
objects. Experimental results on remote sensing datasets, including HRSC2016,
DOTA, and UCAS-AOD, show that our method achieves superior detection
performance than many state-of-the-art approaches.

passive, with hardcore exclusion from environmental particles. In an active
hardcore environment, both active and passive tracers show long-time
subdiffusion: displacements scale as $t^{1/4}$ with a density-dependent
prefactor that is independent of tracer type, and differs from the
corresponding result for passive-in-passive subdiffusion. In an environment of
noninteracting active particles, the passive-in-passive results are recovered
at low densities for both active and passive tracers, but transient caging
effects slow the tracer motion at higher densities, delaying the onset of any
$t^{1/4}$ regime. For an active tracer in a passive environment, we find more
complex outcomes, which depend on details of the dynamical discretization
scheme. We interpret these results by studying the density distribution of
environmental particles around the tracer. In particular, sticking of
environment particles to the tracer cause it to move more slowly in
noninteracting than in interacting active environments, while the anomalous
behaviour of the active-in-passive cases stems from a `snowplough' effect
whereby a large pile of diffusive environmental particles accumulates in front
of a RTP tracer during a ballistic run.

context of domestic donor collection services. The problem we consider combines
the following attributes. Customers requesting services are variable, in the
sense that the customers are stochastic but are not restricted to a predefined
set, as they may appear anywhere in a given service area. Furthermore, demand
volumes are stochastic and observed upon visiting the customer. The objective
is to maximize the expected served demands while meeting vehicle capacity and
time restrictions. We call this problem the VRP with a highly Variable Customer
basis and Stochastic Demands (VRP-VCSD). For this problem, we first propose a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation representing the classical
centralized decision-making perspective where one decision-maker establishes
the routes of all vehicles. While the resulting formulation turns out to be
intractable, it provides us with the ground to develop a new MDP formulation,
which we call partially decentralized. In this formulation, the action-space is
decomposed by vehicle. However, the decentralization is incomplete as we
enforce identical vehicle-specific policies while optimizing the collective
reward. We propose several strategies to reduce the dimension of the state and
action spaces associated with the partially decentralized formulation. These
yield a considerably more tractable problem, which we solve via Reinforcement
Learning. In particular, we develop a Q-learning algorithm called DecQN,
featuring state-of-the-art acceleration techniques. We conduct a thorough
computational analysis. Results show that DecQN considerably outperforms three
benchmark policies. Moreover, we show that our approach can compete with
specialized methods developed for the particular case of the VRP-VCSD, where
customer locations and expected demands are known in advance.

density of states, but the symmetry is restored upon averaging over spin. On
the other hand, asymmetry appears again in tunneling junctions of spin-split
superconductors with a spin-polarized barrier. As demonstrated recently in both
theory and experiment, this fact leads to a particularly strong thermoelectric
effect in superconductor-ferromagnet structures. In this work we show another
important effect stemming from the electron-hole asymmetry - current
rectification. We calculate the charge current in spin-polarized tunnel
junctions of normal metal and a spin-split superconductor with AC and DC
voltage bias. In the DC case, the I-V curve is not fully antisymmetric and has
a voltage-symmetric component due to spin polarization. This translates to the
existence of a rectified current in the AC case, which is proportional to the
spin polarization of the junction and strongly depends on the frequency of the
applied bias. We discuss possible applications of the rectification effect,
including a diode for superconducting electronics and radiation detectors. The
analysis of the rectified charge current is supplemented by the discussion of
heat current and relevant noise correlators, where electron-hole asymmetry also
plays an important role, and which are useful for applications in detectors.

prove the tractability part, Hirai developed a theory of discrete convex

generalize Hirai's theory and define a larger class of discrete convex

  piezocomposite trailing control surfaces",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Morphing wings comprised of fixed leading sections with piezocomposite
trailing control surfaces have emerged as a novel active control technique for
unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the wake dynamics and aerodynamic
performance of such hybrid airfoil configuration has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional
flows over hybrid airfoils comprised of NACA 0012 leading sections with
piezocomposite trailing control surfaces are performed at a fixed Reynolds
number of 1000. The effects of length and camber of the trailing control
surface on the laminar aerodynamic characteristics are studied over a wide
range of angle of attack. It is shown that the flow behind the airfoil exhibits
different features, including steady flow, periodic vortex shedding, and
quasi-periodic vortex shedding for different configurations. The transition
between these wake states occurs at slightly smaller angles of attack compared
to the nominal NACA 0012 airfoil. While the drag coefficient remains close to
each other at a fixed angle of attack, the lift coefficient of the hybrid
airfoil is positively affected by the length and camber of the trailing control
surface. The mechanism of lift generation is examined by surface pressure
distributions and a force element analysis. It is revealed that with increased
camber of the trailing control surface, the flow on both the suction and
pressure sides of the airfoil are modified in a beneficial way to enhance lift.
Increasing the length ratio only significantly modifies the flow near the aft
section on the pressure side. The results herein provide a laminar aerodynamic
characterization of hybrid airfoils with trailing control surfaces, and could
potentially aid the design of control techniques for next-generation small
unmanned aerial vehicles.

e.g., spatially discretized stochastic partial differential equations. Since
asymptotic stability can often not be ensured in such a stochastic setting
(e.g. due to larger noise), the main focus is on establishing model order
reduction (MOR) schemes applicable to unstable systems. MOR is vital to reduce
the dimension of the problem in order to lower the enormous computational
complexity of for instance sampling methods in high dimensions. In particular,
a new type of Gramian-based MOR approach is proposed in this paper that can be
used in very general settings. The considered Gramians are constructed to
identify dominant subspaces of the stochastic system as pointed out in this
work. Moreover, they can be computed via Lyapunov equations. However,
covariance information of the underlying systems enters these equations which
is not directly available. Therefore, efficient sampling based methods relying
on variance reduction techniques are established to derive the required
covariances and hence the Gramians. Alternatively, an ansatz to compute the
Gramians by deterministic approximations of covariance functions is
investigated. An error bound for the studied MOR methods is proved yielding an
a-priori criterion for the choice of the reduced system dimension. This bound
is new and beneficial even in the deterministic case. The paper is concluded by
numerical experiments showing the efficiency of the proposed MOR schemes.

tasks, the act of object manoeuvre will change the underlying configuration

experience is summarised in a lazy graph structure, and LTR* is formulated to
be robust and beneficial regardless of the extent of changes in the workspace.
Our hybrid approach attains a faster speed in obtaining an initial solution
than existing roadmap-based planners and often with a lower cost in trajectory
length. Subsequent tasks can utilise the lazy experience graph to speed up
finding a solution and take advantage of the optimised graph to minimise the
cost objective. We provide proofs of probabilistic completeness and

are available. Physical experiments or detailed simulations that accurately
capture the behavior of the system are regarded as high-fidelity models with
low model uncertainty, however, they are expensive to run. On the other hand,
simplified physical experiments or numerical models are seen as low-fidelity
models that are cheaper to evaluate. Although low-fidelity models are often not
suitable for direct use in reliability analysis due to their low accuracy, they
can offer information about the trend of the high-fidelity model thus providing
the opportunity to explore the design space at a low cost. This study presents
a new approach called adaptive multi-fidelity Gaussian process for reliability
analysis (AMGPRA). Contrary to selecting training points and information
sources in two separate stages as done in state-of-the-art mfEGRA method, the
proposed approach finds the optimal training point and information source
simultaneously using the novel collective learning function (CLF). CLF is able
to assess the global impact of a candidate training point from an information
source and it accommodates any learning function that satisfies a certain
profile. In this context, CLF provides a new direction for quantifying the
impact of new training points and can be easily extended with new learning
functions to adapt to different reliability problems. The performance of the
proposed method is demonstrated by three mathematical examples and one
engineering problem concerning the wind reliability of transmission towers. It
is shown that the proposed method achieves similar or higher accuracy with
reduced computational costs compared to state-of-the-art single and

  regression",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Network meta-analysis (NMA) of rare events has attracted little attention in
the literature. Until recently, networks of interventions with rare events were
analyzed using the inverse-variance NMA approach. However, when events are rare
the normal approximation made by this model can be poor and effect estimates
are potentially biased. Other methods for the synthesis of such data are the
recent extension of the Mantel-Haenszel approach to NMA or the use of the
non-central hypergeometric distribution. In this article, we suggest a new
common-effect NMA approach that can be applied even in networks of
interventions with extremely low or even zero number of events without
requiring study exclusion or arbitrary imputations. Our method is based on the
implementation of the penalized likelihood function proposed by Firth for bias
reduction of the maximum likelihood estimate to the logistic expression of the
NMA model. A limitation of our method is that heterogeneity cannot be taken
into account as an additive parameter as in most meta-analytical models.
However, we account for heterogeneity by incorporating a multiplicative
overdispersion term using a two-stage approach. We show through simulations
that our method performs consistently well across all tested scenarios and most
often results in smaller bias than other available methods. We also illustrate
the use of our method through two clinical examples. We conclude that our
""penalized likelihood NMA"" approach is promising for the analysis of binary
outcomes with rare events especially for networks with very few studies per
comparison and very low control group risks.

accurate beamforming both at base station and user terminal sides, referred to
as beam alignment (BA). Existing BA algorithms provide initial yet coarse angle
estimates as they typically use a codebook of a finite number of discreteized
beams (angles). Towards emerging applications requiring timely and precise
tracking of dynamically changing state of users, we consider a system where a
base station with a co-located radar receiver estimates relevant state
parameters of users and simultaneously sends OFDM-modulated data symbols. In
particular, based on a hybrid digital analog data transmitter/radar receiver
architecture, we propose a simple beam refinement and initial state acquisition
scheme that can be used for beam and user location tracking in a dynamic
environment. Numerical results inspired by IEEE802.11ad parameters demonstrate
that the proposed method is able to improve significantly the communication
rate and further achieve accurate state estimation.

In the linear limit, the coupling of IAWs and drift waves by the density

the density gradient, the rotational frequency and the spectral indexes of
superthermal electrons. In the nonlinear regime, an evolution equation for the

formulated as a classification task to decide if a text contains HOF. We
investigate whether HOF detection can profit by taking into account the
relationships between HOF and similar concepts: (a) HOF is related to sentiment
analysis because hate speech is typically a negative statement and expresses a
negative opinion; (b) it is related to emotion analysis, as expressed hate
points to the author experiencing (or pretending to experience) anger while the
addressees experience (or are intended to experience) fear. (c) Finally, one
constituting element of HOF is the mention of a targeted person or group. On
this basis, we hypothesize that HOF detection shows improvements when being
modeled jointly with these concepts, in a multi-task learning setup. We base
our experiments on existing data sets for each of these concepts (sentiment,
emotion, target of HOF) and evaluate our models as a participant (as team
IMS-SINAI) in the HASOC FIRE 2021 English Subtask 1A. Based on model-selection
experiments in which we consider multiple available resources and submissions
to the shared task, we find that the combination of the CrowdFlower emotion
corpus, the SemEval 2016 Sentiment Corpus, and the OffensEval 2019 target
detection data leads to an F1 =.79 in a multi-head multi-task learning model
based on BERT, in comparison to .7895 of plain BERT. On the HASOC 2019 test
data, this result is more substantial with an increase by 2pp in F1 and a
considerable increase in recall. Across both data sets (2019, 2021), the recall
is particularly increased for the class of HOF (6pp for the 2019 data and 3pp
for the 2021 data), showing that MTL with emotion, sentiment, and target
identification is an appropriate approach for early warning systems that might
be deployed in social media platforms.

trend movement and fluctuation movement, were developed to represent the
slow-varying and fast-varying dynamics respectively. We investigated the

learning, where the view generators play a vital role in generating effective
contrastive samples. Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ
pre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation,
which usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic
structures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named
Automated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically,
AutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an
auto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a
probability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph
view generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the
original graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation
learns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole
contrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training
strategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the
classifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet
semantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive
experiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer
learning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the
state-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization
results further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more
compact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the
existing view generation methods.

electronic dynamics and the importance of their coupling to the mechanism of
high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). As evidenced by Extended X-ray
Absorption Fine Structure experiments (EXAFS), anharmonic structural effects
are correlated with the charge dynamics and the transition to a superconducting
phase in different HTSC compounds. Here we describe how structural anharmonic
effects can be coupled to electronic and lattice dynamics in cuprate systems by
performing the exact diagonalization of a prototype anharmonic many-body
Hamiltonian on a relevant six-atom cluster and show that the EXAFS results can
be understood as a Kuramoto synchronization between coupled internal quantum
tunneling polarons associated with the two-site distribution of the
copper-apical-oxygen ($Cu-O_{ap}$) pair in the dynamic structure. Furthermore,
we find that this first order, anti-phase synchronization transition can be
fine tuned by temperature and anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations, and
promotes the pumping of charge, initially stored at the apical oxygen
reservoirs, into the copper-oxide planes. Simultaneously, the internal quantum
tunneling polaron extends to the copper-planar-oxygen ($Cu-O_{pl}$) pair. All
these findings support an interpretation of the EXAFS data in terms of an
effective, quantum mechanical triple-well-potential, which accurately
represents the anti-phase synchronization of apical oxygens displacements and
lattice-assisted charge transfer to the $CuO_2$ plane.

Coupled Device (EMCCD) cameras recording 34761 two-station video meteor events
complete to a limiting magnitude of +6. The survey goal was to characterize
probable iron meteoroids. Using only physical properties of the meteor
trajectories including early peaking light curves, short luminous trajectories,
and high energies accumulated per area at beginning, we identified 1068 iron
meteors. Our iron candidates are most abundant at slow speeds < 15 km/s, where
they make up approximately 20% of the mm-sized meteoroid population. They are
overwhelmingly on asteroidal orbits, and have particularly low orbital
eccentricities and smaller semi-major axes when compared to non-irons between
10-20 km/s. Our iron population appears to be more numerous at fainter
magnitudes, comprising 15% of slow (10-15 km/s) meteors with peak brightness of
+3 with the fraction rising to 25% at +6 to +7, our survey limit. The iron
orbits are most consistent with an asteroidal source and are in highly evolved
orbits, suggesting long collisional lifetimes (107 years). Metal-rich
chondrules (nodules) found in abundance in EL Chondrites are one possible
source for this population. We also propose a possible technique using R-band
colours to more robustly identify fainter iron meteors with very high
confidence.

neuropsychological tool that has been designed to assess the severity of
cognitive symptoms of dementia. Personalized prediction of the changes in
ADAS-Cog scores could help in timing therapeutic interventions in dementia and
at-risk populations. In the present work, we compared single and multitask
learning approaches to predict the changes in ADAS-Cog scores based on
T1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to most
machine learning-based prediction methods ADAS-Cog changes, we stratified the
subjects based on their baseline diagnoses and evaluated the prediction
performances in each group. Our experiments indicated a positive relationship
between the predicted and observed ADAS-Cog score changes in each diagnostic
group, suggesting that T1-weighted MRI has a predictive value for evaluating
cognitive decline in the entire AD continuum. We further studied whether
correction of the differences in the magnetic field strength of MRI would
improve the ADAS-Cog score prediction. The partial least square-based domain
adaptation slightly improved the prediction performance, but the improvement
was marginal. In summary, this study demonstrated that ADAS-Cog change could
be, to some extent, predicted based on anatomical MRI. Based on this study, the
recommended method for learning the predictive models is a single-task
regularized linear regression due to its simplicity and good performance. It
appears important to combine the training data across all subject groups for
the most effective predictive models.

in different topological phases, with or without edge states. By means of
tight-binding and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we studied the
electronic and mechanical properties of some of these superlattices. MD shows
that fracture in modulated superlattices is brittle, as for unmodulated
ribbons, and that occurs at the thinner regions, with staggered superlattices
achieving a larger fracture strain. We found a general mechanism to induce a
topological transition with strain, related to the electronic properties of
each segment of the superlattice, and by studying the sublattice polarization
we were able to characterize the transition and the response of these states to
the strain. For the cases studied in detail here, the topological transition
occurred at $\sim$3-5 \% strain, well below the fracture strain. The
topological states of the superlattice -- if present -- are robust to strain
even close to fracture. Unlike the zero-energy edge states found in the zig-zag
edges of graphene nanoribbons, the superlattice states shows signatures of

the paper. The latter property enables one to describe images of the extended
map in terms of sequential up-downs and down-ups of the image of (the positive
cone of ) ${\mathrm C}_{\mathrm c}(X)$ when $\mathrm A$ has the countable sup
property.
  We apply the main results, which are obtained by purely order-theoretical
methods, to positive algebra homomorphisms from ${\mathrm C}_0(X)$ into the
order continuous operators on a Banach lattice, and to representations of
${\mathrm C}_0(X,\mathbb C)$ on Hilbert spaces.
  It is thus seen that, for representations on Banach lattices and on Hilbert
spaces, although situated in rather different contexts, spectral theorems can
be established that are both rooted in the same order-theoretical Riesz
representation theorem for positive algebra homomorphisms from ${\mathrm
C_\mathrm c}(X)$ into partially ordered algebras.

to examine the language used and understand the impact of digital activism on
social media within each social movement on a sentence-level, word-level, and

into 2D+3D facial expression recognition (FER), i.e., ViT training needs mass
data. Nonetheless, the number of samples in public 2D+3D FER datasets is far
from sufficient for evaluation. How to utilize the ViT pre-trained on RGB
images to handle 2D+3D data becomes a challenge. To solve this problem, we
propose a robust lightweight pure transformer-based network for multimodal

data, we devise an alternative fusion strategy, which replaces each of the
three channels of an RGB image with the depth-map channel and fuses them before
feeding them into the transformer encoder. Moreover, the designed sample
filtering module adds several subclasses for each expression and move the noisy
samples to their corresponding subclasses, thus eliminating their disturbance
on the network during the training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our MFEViT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with an accuracy of
90.83% on BU-3DFE and 90.28% on Bosphorus. Specifically, the proposed MFEViT is
a lightweight model, requiring much fewer parameters than multi-branch CNNs. To

platforms. While being disseminated online, it also poses a threat to
individuals and societies offline, for example, in the context of democratic
elections. Research and practice have investigated the detection of fake news
with behavioral science or method-related perspectives. However, to date, we
lack design knowledge on presenting fake news warnings to users to support
their individual news credibility assessment. We present the journey through
the first design cycle on developing a fake news detection service focusing on
the user interface design. The design is grounded in concepts from the field of
source credibility theory and instantiated in a prototype that was
qualitatively evaluated. The 13 participants communicated their interest in a
lightweight application that aids in the news credibility assessment and rated
the design features as useful as well as desirable.

only the output of the previous layer as input to the attention network, such
as SENet, CBAM, etc. In this paper, we propose a new attention modification
method that tries to get the output of the classification network in advance
and use it as a part of the input of the attention network. We used the
auxiliary classifier proposed in GoogLeNet to obtain the results in advance and
pass them into attention networks. we added this mechanism to SE-ResNet for our
experiments and achieved a classification accuracy improvement of at most 1.94%
on cifar100.

stable quasi-Keplerian rotation profile and non-uniform conductivity are probed
for dynamo instability. In spherical geometry the equations for the poloidal
and the toroidal field components completely decouple, resulting in free decay,
regardless of the spatial distribution of the electric conductivity. In
cylindrical geometry the poloidal and toroidal components do not decouple, but
here also we do not find dynamo excitations for the cases that the electric
conductivity only depends on the radius or -- much more complex -- that it only
depends on the azimuthal or the axial coordinate. The transformation of the
plane-flow dynamo model of Busse \& Wicht (1992) to cylindrical or spherical
geometry therefore fails. It is also shown that even the inclusion of axial
flows of both directions does {\em not} support the dynamo mechanism. The
Elsasser toroidal-velocity antidynamo theorem, according to which dynamos
without any radial velocity component cannot work, is thus not softened by
non-uniform conductivity distributions.

bounded set. Affine transformations given by an automorphism of $\mathbb{Z}^d$
and a translation in $A^d$ are called (affine) $A$-unimodular transformations.
The image of $X$ under such a transformation is called an $A$-unimodular copy
of $X$. It was shown in [Averkov, Hofscheier, Nill, 2019] that every convex
body whose width is ""big enough"" contains an $A$-unimodular copy of $X$. The
threshold when this happens is called the generalised flatness constant
$\mathrm{Flt}_d^A(X)$. It resembles the classical flatness constant if
$A=\mathbb{Z}$ and $X$ is a lattice point. In this work, we introduce a general
framework for the explicit computation of these numerical constants. The
approach relies on the study of $A$-$X$-free convex bodies generalising
lattice-free (also known as hollow) convex bodies. We then focus on the case
that $X=P$ is a full-dimensional polytope and show that inclusion-maximal
$A$-$P$-free convex bodies are polytopes. The study of those inclusion-maximal
polytopes provides us with the means to explicitly determine generalised
flatness constants. We apply our approach to the case $X=\Delta_2$ the standard
simplex in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of normalised volume $1$ and compute
$\mathrm{Flt}^{\mathbb{R}}_2(\Delta_2)=2$ and
$\mathrm{Flt}^{\mathbb{Z}}_2(\Delta_2)=\frac{10}3$.

in natural organisms remains under-investigated from optical, chemical and
biological perspectives. One example is the transparent wings of insects from
the order Hemiptera: fluorescence emission has so far not been reported in any
of the 3,000 described species of the superfamily Cicadoidea. The phenomenon
has however been investigated in several butterfly and moth species, in which
the coloured wing scales are known to embed fluorophores such as papiliochrome
II. Photonic structures present in these scales may mediate the associated
light emission. Fluorescence has also been described in the vein joints and the
membrane of the transparent wings of damselflies and dragonflies. This emission
was attributed to the presence of autofluorescent proteins such as resilin that
gives rise to low stiffness and high strain in the biological tissues, allowing
passive wing deformations. In this article, we characterised the fluorescence
emission from the transparent wings of the grey cicada \textit{Cicada orni}
(Linnaeus, 1758) and the common cicada \textit{Lyristes (Tibicen) plebejus}
(Scopoli, 1763), using linear and nonlinear optical methods. We compared their
properties with the fluorescence emission from two other insects exhibiting
transparent wings, namely, \textit{Hemaris fuciformis} (Linnaeus, 1758)
commonly known as the broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and the Bornean damselfly
\textit{Vestalis amabilis} Lieftinck, 1965. These fluorescent behaviours were
optically characterised by one- and multi-photon microscopy and spectrometry,
allowing us to infer the symmetry of the material as well as the biological
role of the fluorophores in the visual perception of insects and to explain the
high absorption by the material in the range 300-400~nm.

  Coverage and Equity in Access",,,,,"cs.CY math.OC stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  At the time of this article, COVID-19 has been transmitted to more than 42
million people and resulted in more than 673,000 deaths across the United
States. Throughout this pandemic, public health authorities have monitored the
results of diagnostic testing to identify hotspots of transmission. Such
information can help reduce or block transmission paths of COVID-19 and help
infected patients receive early treatment. However, most current schemes of
test site allocation have been based on experience or convenience, often
resulting in low efficiency and non-optimal allocation. In addition, the
historical sociodemographic patterns of populations within cities can result in
measurable inequities in access to testing between various racial and income
groups. To address these pressing issues, we propose a novel test site
allocation scheme to (a) maximize population coverage, (b) minimize prediction
uncertainties associated with projections of outbreak trajectories, and (c)
reduce inequities in access. We illustrate our approach with case studies
comparing our allocation scheme with recorded allocation of testing sites in
Georgia, revealing increases in both population coverage and improvements in
equity of access over current practice.

ways to improve on such a baseline LM. We develop a procedure to derive word
confusion networks from NMT beam search graphs and evaluate LMs trained on

perplexity of both n-gram and recurrent neural network LMs compared to those

amount of lexical knowledge, ranging from commonsense properties of everyday
concepts to detailed factual knowledge about named entities. Among others, this
makes it possible to distill high-quality word vectors from pre-trained
language models. However, it is currently unclear to what extent it is possible
to distill relation embeddings, i.e. vectors that characterize the relationship
between two words. Such relation embeddings are appealing because they can, in
principle, encode relational knowledge in a more fine-grained way than is
possible with knowledge graphs. To obtain relation embeddings from a
pre-trained language model, we encode word pairs using a (manually or
automatically generated) prompt, and we fine-tune the language model such that
relationally similar word pairs yield similar output vectors. We find that the
resulting relation embeddings are highly competitive on analogy (unsupervised)
and relation classification (supervised) benchmarks, even without any
task-specific fine-tuning. Source code to reproduce our experimental results

with external bodies is an open research problem. Continuum methods can be used
to capture complexities neglected by terramechanics models without the
computational expense of discrete element methods. Constitutive models and
numerical solvers are the two primary aspects of the continuum methods. The
viscoplastic size-dependent non-local granular fluidity (NGF) constitutive
model has successfully provided a quantitative description of experimental
flows in many different configurations in literature. This research develops a
numerical approach, within a hyperelasticity framework, for implementing the
dynamical form of NGF in three-dimensional material point method (3D MPM, an
appropriate numerical solver for granular flow modeling). This approach is
thermodynamically consistent to conserve energy, and the dynamical form
includes the nonlocal effect of flow cessation. Excavation data, both
quantitative measurements and qualitative visualization, are collected
experimentally via our robotic equipment to evaluate the model with respect to
the flow geometry as well as interaction forces. The results are further
compared with the results from a recent modified plastic Drucker-Prager
constitutive model, and in other configurations including wheel-soil
interactions, a gravity-driven silo, and Taylor-Couette flow.

exploiting the close connections between partially ordered set representations
of DAGs (posets) and finite Alexandroff topologies. Alexandroff spaces yield a
directional topological space: the topology is defined by a unique minimal
basis defined by an open set for each variable x, specified as the intersection
of all open sets containing x. Alexandroff spaces induce a (reflexive,
transitive) preorder. Alexandroff spaces satisfying the Kolmogorov T0
separation criterion, where open sets distinguish variables, converts the
preordering into a partial ordering. Our approach broadly is to construct a
topological representation of posets from data, and then use the poset
representation to build a conventional DAG causal model. We illustrate our
framework by showing how it unifies disparate algorithms and case studies
proposed previously. Topology plays two key roles in causal discovery. First,
topological separability constraints on datasets have been used in several
previous approaches to infer causal structure from observations and
interventions. Second, a diverse range ofgraphical models used to represent
causal structures can be represented in a unified way in terms of a topological
representation of the induced poset structure. We show that the homotopy theory
of Alexandroff spaces can be exploited to significantly efficiently reduce the
number of possible DAG structures, reducing the search space by several orders
of magnitude.
