surfaces in an $n(\geq 3)$-dimensional Generalized Robertson Walker spacetime
are obtained. In order to do that, we assume a natural inequality involving the
Gauss curvature of the surface, the restrictions of the warping function and
the sectional curvature of the fiber to the surface. This inequality gives the
parabolicity of the surface. Using this property, a distinguished non-negative
superharmonic function on the surface is shown to be constant, which implies
that the stationary spacelike surface must be totally geodesic. Moreover,
non-trivial examples of stationary spacelike surfaces in the four dimensional
Lorentz-Minkowski spacetime are exposed to show that each of our assumptions is
needed.

with the goal of ensuring recovery in low-latency fashion, of erased packets
over a communication network. It is well-known in the streaming code
literature, that diagonally embedding codewords of a $[\tau+1,\tau+1-a]$
Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code within the packet stream, leads to
rate-optimal streaming codes capable of recovering from $a$ arbitrary packet
erasures, under a strict decoding delay constraint $\tau$. Thus MDS codes are
geared towards the efficient handling of the worst-case scenario corresponding
to the occurrence of $a$ erasures. In the present paper, we have an increased
focus on the efficient handling of the most-frequent erasure patterns. We study
streaming codes which in addition to recovering from $a>1$ arbitrary packet
erasures under a decoding delay $\tau$, have the ability to handle the more
common occurrence of a single-packet erasure, while incurring smaller delay
$r<\tau$. We term these codes as $(a,\tau,r)$ locally recoverable streaming
codes (LRSCs), since our single-erasure recovery requirement is similar to the
requirement of locality in a coded distributed storage system. We characterize
the maximum possible rate of an LRSC by presenting rate-optimal constructions
for all possible parameters $\{a,\tau,r\}$. Although the rate-optimal LRSC
construction provided in this paper requires large field size, the construction
is explicit. It is also shown that our $(a,\tau=a(r+1)-1,r)$ LRSC construction
provides the additional guarantee of recovery from the erasure of $h, 1 \leq h
\leq a$, packets, with delay $h(r+1)-1$. The construction thus offers graceful
degradation in decoding delay with increasing number of erasures.

states of vanishing friction, i.e. superlubricity, in mesoscopic graphite
contacts. In this respect, superlubricity is known to appear upon formation of
a triboinduced transfer layer, originated by material transfer of graphene
flakes from the graphitic substrate to the colloidal probe. It was suggested
that friction vanishes due to crystalline incommensurability at the sliding
interface thus formed. However several details are missing, including the roles
of tribolayer roughness and of loading conditions. Hereafter we gain deeper
insight into the tribological response of micrometric silica beads sliding on
graphite under ambient conditions. We show that the tribotransferred flakes
increase interfacial roughness from tenths to several nanometers, in fact
causing a breakdown of adhesion and friction by one order of magnitude.
Furthermore, they behave as protruding asperities dissipating mechanical energy
via atomic-scale stick-slip instabilities. Remarkably, such contact junctions
can undergo a load-driven transition from continuous superlubric sliding to
dissipative stick-slip, that agrees with the single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson
model. Our results indicate that friction at mesoscopic silica-graphite
junctions depends on the specific energy landscape experienced by the
topographically-highest triboinduced nanoasperity. Superlubricity may arise
from the load-controlled competition between interfacial crystalline
incommensurability and contact pinning effects.

observe whether she wins or not) and \emph{full information feedback} (the
learner can observe $m_t$) at the end of each time $t$. For binary feedback,
when the noise distribution $\mathcal{F}$ is known, we propose a bidding
algorithm, by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to achieve at
most $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\log(d) T})$ regret. Moreover, we generalize this
algorithm to the setting with binary feedback and the noise distribution is
unknown but belongs to a parametrized family of distributions. For the full

algorithm that achieves regret at most $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$. Our approach
combines an estimator for log-concave density functions and then MLE method to
learn the noise distribution $\mathcal{F}$ and linear weight $\alpha_0$

In the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (STEGR), the connection is pure
gauge and hence unphysical. However, in the non-linear extension $f(\Q)$, it is
promoted to a dynamical field which changes the physics. Starting from a
general metric-affine geometry, we construct the most general static and
spherically symmetric forms of the metric and the affine connection. We then
use these symmetry reduced geometric objects to prove that the field equations
of $f(\Q)$ gravity admit GR solutions as well as beyond-GR solutions, contrary
to what has been claimed in the literature. We formulate precise criteria,
under which conditions it is possible to obtain GR solutions and under which
conditions it is possible to obtain beyond-GR solutions. We subsequently
construct several perturbative corrections to the Schwarzschild solution for
different choices of $f(\Q)$, which in particular include a hair stemming from
the now dynamical affine connection. We also present an exact beyond-GR vacuum

undergo magnetospheric accretion, suggesting the importance of planetary
magnetic fields. We explore the properties of accreting, magnetized giant
planets surrounded by their circumplanetary disks, using the physical
parameters inferred for PDS 70 b/c. We compute the magnetic field strength and
the resulting spin rate of giant planets, and find that these planets may
possess dipole magnetic fields of either a few 10 G or a few 100 G; the former
is the natural outcome of planetary growth and radius evolution, while the
resulting spin rate cannot reproduce the observations. For the latter, a
consistent picture can be drawn, where strong magnetic fields induced by hot
planetary interiors lead both to magnetospheric accretion and to spin-down due
to disk locking. We also compute the properties of circumplanetary disks in the
vicinity of these planets, taking into account planetary magnetic fields. The
resulting surface density becomes very low, compared with the canonical models,
implying the importance of radial movement of satellite-forming materials. Our
model predicts a positive gradient of the surface density, which invokes the
traps for both satellite migration and radially drifting dust particles. This
work thus concludes that the final formation stages of giant planets are
similar to those of low-mass stars such as brown dwarfs, as suggested by recent
studies.

be in the universality class of the $Z_6$ parafermion conformal field theory

influences the melting behaviour and long-wavelength properties over a fairly

strong conditions on a self-adjoint operator to be really measurable. This may

modelling the apparatus as a quantum field with coupling to the measured system
restricted to a region of spacetime. I highlight how this approach leads to a
causally well behaved theory. Finally, I attempt to formulate the causality

upon human-annotated datasets, which are expensive to obtain in practice. In
this work, we explore to train a conversation disentanglement model without
referencing any human annotations. Our method is built upon a deep co-training
algorithm, which consists of two neural networks: a message-pair classifier and
a session classifier. The former is responsible for retrieving local relations
between two messages while the latter categorizes a message to a session by
capturing context-aware information. Both networks are initialized respectively
with pseudo data built from an unannotated corpus. During the deep co-training
process, we use the session classifier as a reinforcement learning component to
learn a session assigning policy by maximizing the local rewards given by the
message-pair classifier. For the message-pair classifier, we enrich its
training data by retrieving message pairs with high confidence from the
disentangled sessions predicted by the session classifier. Experimental results
on the large Movie Dialogue Dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach
achieves competitive performance compared to the previous supervised methods.
Further experiments show that the predicted disentangled conversations can
promote the performance on the downstream task of multi-party response

sections using a Recoil Mass Spectrometer. Absolute differential $1p$ and

determined for the system $^{16}$O+$^{142}$Ce by detecting the heavier
target-like ions at the focal plane of the Heavy Ion Reaction Analyzer. Focal
plane spectra have been compared with the results of a semi-microscopic
Monte-Carlo simulation to unambiguously identify the transfer channels.
Transmission efficiency of the target-like ions through the spectrometer has
also been estimated using the simulation. The methodology adopted in this work
can be applied to other recoil separators. The measured excitation functions
for the reactions

$^{142}\mathrm{Ce(}^{16}\mathrm{O,}^{14}\mathrm{C)}^{144}\mathrm{Nd}$ have been
compared with coupled reaction channel calculations. An excellent matching
between measurement and theory has been obtained. For $1p$-stripping, major
contribution to the cross section has been found to be the transfer of a proton
from $^{16}\mathrm{O}$ to the $2d_{\frac{5}{2}}$ excited state of
$^{143}\mathrm{Pr}$, leaving behind $^{15}\mathrm{N}$ in the $1p_{\frac{1}{2}}$
ground state. Transfer of a cluster of two protons from $^{16}\mathrm{O}$ to
the $2^{+}$ excited state of $^{144}\mathrm{Nd}$, resulting in
$^{14}\mathrm{C}$ in the $0^{+}$ ground state, appears to be the most probable
cause for $2p$-stripping. Measured transfer probabilities for $1p$ and $2p$
channels have been compared with Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock calculations.
Proton stripping channels are found to be more favourable compared to neutron
pick-up channels. However, the theory overpredicts measurement hinting at the
need for extended approaches with explicit treatment of pairing correlations in
the calculations.

Although several studies have been conducted to analyze the contraction
properties of variational posteriors, there is still a lack of a general and

inference. To fill this gap, we propose a novel adaptive variational Bayes
framework, which can operate on a collection of models. The proposed framework
first computes a variational posterior over each individual model separately
and then combines them with certain weights to produce a variational posterior
over the entire model. It turns out that this combined variational posterior is
the closest member to the posterior over the entire model in a predefined
family of approximating distributions. We show that the adaptive variational
Bayes attains optimal contraction rates adaptively under very general
conditions. In addition, we provide a methodology to maintain the tractability
and adaptive optimality of the adaptive variational Bayes even in the presence
of an enormous number of individual models, such as sparse models. We apply the
general results to several examples, including deep learning and sparse factor
models, and derive new and adaptive inference results. Moreover, we consider
the use of quasi-likelihoods in our framework. We formulate theoretical
conditions on quasi-likelihoods to ensure adaptive concentration and discuss
specific applications to stochastic block models and nonparametric regression

For models with two structures, we propose a numerical technique to approximate
$R_{0}$, which measures the transmissibility of an infectious disease and,
rigorously, is defined as the dominant eigenvalue of a next-generation
operator. Via bivariate collocation and cubature on tensor grids, the latter is
approximated with a finite-dimensional matrix, so that its dominant eigenvalue
can easily be computed with standard techniques. We use test examples to
investigate experimentally the behavior of the approximation: the convergence
order appears to be infinite when the corresponding eigenfunction is smooth,
and finite for less regular eigenfunctions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the technique for more realistic applications, we present a new epidemic model

part due to their pivotal role in machine learning. Variance reduction for
these algorithms has become an important research topic. In contrast to common
approaches, which rarely leverage global models of the objective function, we
exploit convexity and L-smoothness to improve the noisy estimates outputted by
the stochastic gradient oracle. Our method, named COCO denoiser, is the joint
maximum likelihood estimator of multiple function gradients from their noisy
observations, subject to co-coercivity constraints between them. The resulting
estimate is the solution of a convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic
Problem. Although this problem is expensive to solve by interior point methods,
we exploit its structure to apply an accelerated first-order algorithm, the
Fast Dual Proximal Gradient method. Besides analytically characterizing the
proposed estimator, we show empirically that increasing the number and
proximity of the queried points leads to better gradient estimates. We also
apply COCO in stochastic settings by plugging it in existing algorithms, such
as SGD, Adam or STRSAGA, outperforming their vanilla versions, even in
scenarios where our modelling assumptions are mismatched.

mergers, as part of merger hierarchies in deep potential wells. We show that
binary black hole (BBH) merger rates in active galactic nuclei (AGN) should
always exceed merger rates in quiescent galactic nuclei (nuclear star clusters,
NSCs) around supermassive BHs (SMBHs) without accretion disks. This is
primarily due to average binary lifetimes in AGN that are significantly shorter
than in NSCs. The lifetime difference comes from rapid hardening of BBHs in
AGN, such that their semi-major axes are smaller than the hard-soft boundary of
their parent NSC; this contrasts with the large average lifetime to merger for
BBHs in NSCs around SMBHs, due to binary ionization mechanisms. Secondarily,
merger rates in AGNs are enhanced by gas-driven binary formation mechanisms.
Formation of new BHs in AGN disks are a minor contributor to the rate
differences. With the gravitational wave detection of several BBHs with at
least one progenitor in the upper mass gap, and signatures of dynamical
formation channels in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution, we argue that AGN
could contribute $\sim 25\%-80\%$ of the LIGO-Virgo measured rate of $\sim 24

closely related to compression. Prior work has convincingly argued why
minimizing information is useful in the supervised learning setting, but
standard RL algorithms lack an explicit mechanism for compression. The RL
setting is unique because (1) its sequential nature allows an agent to use past
information to avoid looking at future observations and (2) the agent can
optimize its behavior to prefer states where decision making requires few bits.
We take advantage of these properties to propose a method (RPC) for learning
simple policies. This method brings together ideas from information
bottlenecks, model-based RL, and bits-back coding into a simple and
theoretically-justified algorithm. Our method jointly optimizes a latent-space

small-scale neural networks, due to their fast convergence. However, previous
RLS algorithms are unsuitable for training deep neural networks (DNNs), since
they have high computational complexity and too many preconditions. In this
paper, to overcome these drawbacks, we propose three novel RLS optimization
algorithms for training feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural
networks and recurrent neural networks (including long short-term memory
networks), by using the error backpropagation and our average-approximation RLS
method, together with the equivalent gradients of the linear least squares loss
function with respect to the linear outputs of hidden layers. Compared with
previous RLS optimization algorithms, our algorithms are simple and elegant.
They can be viewed as an improved stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm,
which uses the inverse autocorrelation matrix of each layer as the adaptive
learning rate. Their time and space complexities are only several times those
of SGD. They only require the loss function to be the mean squared error and
the activation function of the output layer to be invertible. In fact, our
algorithms can be also used in combination with other first-order optimization
algorithms without requiring these two preconditions. In addition, we present
two improved methods for our algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness compared to the Adam algorithm on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and IMDB

information, presented as <instrument, verb, target> combinations, is highly
challenging to be accurately identified. Triplet components can be difficult to
recognize individually; in this task, it requires not only performing
recognition simultaneously for all three triplet components, but also correctly
establishing the data association between them. To achieve this task, we
introduce our new model, the Rendezvous (RDV), which recognizes triplets
directly from surgical videos by leveraging attention at two different levels.
We first introduce a new form of spatial attention to capture individual action
triplet components in a scene; called Class Activation Guided Attention

targets using activations resulting from instruments. To solve the association
problem, our RDV model adds a new form of semantic attention inspired by
Transformer networks; called Multi-Head of Mixed Attention (MHMA). This
technique uses several cross and self attentions to effectively capture
relationships between instruments, verbs, and targets. We also introduce
CholecT50 - a dataset of 50 endoscopic videos in which every frame has been
annotated with labels from 100 triplet classes. Our proposed RDV model

models. For massive single stars with initial masses between 8 - 30\msun the
implementation of cool supergiant mass loss in stellar models strongly affects
the resulting evolution, and the most commonly used prescription for these
cool-star phases is that of de Jager. Recently, we published a new \mdot\
prescription calibrated to RSGs with initial masses between 10 - 25\msun, which
unlike previous prescriptions does not over estimate \mdot\ for the most
massive stars. Here, we carry out a comparative study to the MESA-MIST models,
in which we test the effect of altering mass-loss by recomputing the evolution
of stars with masses 12-27\msun\ with the new \mdot-prescription implemented.
We show that while the evolutionary tracks in the HR diagram of the stars do
not change appreciably, the mass of the H-rich envelope at core-collapse is
drastically increased compared to models using the de Jager prescription. This
increased envelope mass would have a strong impact on the Type II-P SN
lightcurve, and would not allow stars under 30\msun\ to evolve back to the blue
and explode as H-poor SN. We also predict that the amount of H-envelope around
single stars at explosion should be correlated with initial mass, and we
discuss the prospects of using this as a method of determining progenitor
masses from supernova light curves.

Gravitational perturbations arising from an inhomogeneous environment could
manifest as detectable perturbations in the pulsation phase. Consequently,
pulsar timing arrays have been proposed as a probe of dark matter substructure
on mass scales as small as $10^{-11} M_\odot$. Since the small-scale mass
distribution is connected to early-Universe physics, pulsar timing can
therefore constrain the thermal history prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN), a period that remains largely unprobed. We explore here the prospects
for pulsar timing arrays to detect the dark substructure imprinted by a period
of early matter domination (EMD) prior to BBN. EMD amplifies density
variations, leading to a population of highly dense sub-Earth-mass dark matter
microhalos. We use recently developed semianalytic models to characterize the
distribution of EMD-induced microhalos, and we evaluate the extent to which the
pulsar timing distortions caused by these microhalos can be detected. Broadly,
we find that sub-0.1-$\mu$s timing noise residuals are necessary to probe EMD.
However, with 10-ns residuals, a pulsar timing array with just 70 pulsars could
detect the evidence of an EMD epoch with 20 years of observation time if the
reheat temperature is of order 10 MeV. With 40 years of observation time,
pulsar timing arrays could probe EMD reheat temperatures as high as 150 MeV.

monitoring the high radio frequency variability of 20 nearby, cool-core
brightest cluster galaxies. From our representative sample, we show that most
vary significantly over timescales of approximately one year and longer. Our
highest cadence observations are at 15 GHz and are from the Owens Valley Radio

the sources' lightcurves to analyse changes on week to decade long timescales.
Most notably, at least half of the sources show 20 per cent peak to trough
variability on 3 year timescales, while at least a third vary by 60 per cent on
6 year timescales. Significant variability, which is important to studies of
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the radio/sub-mm, is therefore a common

the recent emergence of muonic SN models. Our main innovations are to consider
scalars $\phi$ in addition to pseudoscalars $a$ and to include systematically
the generic two-photon coupling $G_{\gamma\gamma}$ implied by a muon triangle
loop. This interaction allows for Primakoff scattering and radiative boson
decays. The globular-cluster bound $G_{\gamma\gamma}<0.67\times10^{-10}~{\rm

couplings as $g_a<3.1\times10^{-9}$ and $g_\phi< 4.6\times10^{-9}$ for
$m_{a,\phi}\lesssim 100$ keV, so SN arguments become interesting mainly for
larger masses. If bosons escape freely from the SN core the main constraints
originate from SN1987A $\gamma$ rays and the diffuse cosmic $\gamma$-ray
background. The latter allows at most $10^{-4}$ of a typical total SN energy of
$E_{\rm SN}\simeq3\times10^{53}$erg to show up as $\gamma$ rays, for
$m_{a,\phi}\gtrsim 100$keV implying $g_a \lesssim 0.9\times10^{-10}$ and
$g_\phi \lesssim 0.4\times10^{-10}$. In the trapping regime the bosons emerge
as quasi-thermal radiation from a region near the neutrino sphere and match
$L_\nu$ for $g_{a,\phi}\simeq 10^{-4}$. However, the $2\gamma$ decay is so fast
that all the energy is dumped into the surrounding progenitor-star matter,
whereas at most $10^{-2}E_{\rm SN}$ may show up in the explosion. To suppress
boson emission below this level we need yet larger couplings, $g_{a}\gtrsim
2\times10^{-3}$ and $g_{\phi}\gtrsim 4\times10^{-3}$. Muonic scalars can
explain the muon magnetic-moment anomaly for $g_{\phi}\simeq 0.4\times10^{-3}$,
a value hard to reconcile with SN physics despite the uncertainty of the
explosion-energy bound. For generic axion-like particles, this argument covers
the ""cosmological triangle"" in the $G_{a\gamma\gamma}$--$m_a$ parameter space.

The non-linear relation between the ultraviolet (at 2500 A, $L_{O}$) and the

characterised by a smaller intrinsic dispersion than the observed one, as long

performed a complete spectral analysis of all the data available for the

of reducing the uncertainties on the source properties (e.g. flux, spectral
slope). We analysed whether any evolution of the $L_{X}-L_{O}$ relation exists
by dividing the sample in narrow redshift intervals across the redshift range
spanned by our sample, $z \simeq 0.5-4$. We find that the slope of the relation
does not evolve with redshift and it is consistent with the literature value of
$0.6$ over the explored redshift range, implying that the mechanism underlying
the coupling of the accretion disc and hot corona is the same at the different
cosmic epochs. We also find that the dispersion decreases when examining the
highest redshifts, where only pointed observations are available. These results
further confirm that quasars are `standardisable candles', that is we can
reliably measure cosmological distances at high redshifts where very few

for example, an agnostic Bayesian approach. In this paper we further examine
properties of one class of such viable, alternative theories, based on metrics
arising from ungauged supergravity. In particular, we examine the massless,
neutral, minimally coupled scalar wave equation in a general stationary,
axisymmetric background metric such as that of a charged rotating black hole,
when the scalar field is either time independent or in the low-frequency,
near-zone limit, with a view to calculating the Love numbers of tidal
perturbations, and of obtaining harmonic coordinates for the background metric.
For a four-parameter family of charged asymptotically flat rotating black hole
solutions of ungauged supergravity theory known as STU black holes, which
includes Kaluza-Klein black holes and the Kerr-Sen black hole as special cases,
we find that all time-independent solutions, and hence the harmonic coordinates
of the metrics, are identical to those of the Kerr solution. In the
low-frequency limit we find the scalar fields exhibit the same $SL(2,R)$
symmetry as holds in the case of the Kerr solution. We point out extensions of
our results to a wider class of metrics, which includes solutions of
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory.

significant heating occurs well above the Sun's surface. Two leading theories
seem incompatible: low-frequency ""Alfv\'enic"" turbulence, which transports
energy outwards and is observed ubiquitously by spacecraft but struggles to
explain the observed dominance of ion over electron heating; and high-frequency
ion-cyclotron waves (ICWs), which explain the nonthermal heating of ions but
lack an obvious source. Here, we argue that the recently proposed ""helicity
barrier"" effect, which limits electron heating by inhibiting the turbulent
cascade of energy to the smallest scales, can unify these two paradigms. Our
six-dimensional simulations show how the helicity barrier causes the
large-scale energy to grow in time, generating small parallel scales and
high-frequency ICW heating from low-frequency turbulence. The resulting
turbulence and ion distribution function also closely match in-situ
measurements from Parker Solar Probe and other spacecraft, explaining, among
other features, the decades-long puzzle of the steep ""transition range""
observed in magnetic fluctuation spectra. The theory predicts a causal link
between plasma expansion and the ion-to-electron heating ratio. Given the
observational association between wind speed and expansion, we argue that the
helicity barrier could play a key role in regulating the bimodal speed
distribution of the solar wind.

compute constraints on cosmological and model parameters through Monte Carlo
Markov chain techniques, testing both the constraining power of $P_{21}(k)$

complement our analysis by testing the effects of tomography from an ideal mock
data set of observations in multiple redshift bins. We conduct our analysis
numerically with the codes EFTCAMB/EFTCosmoMC, which we extend by implementing
a likelihood module fully integrated with original codes. We find that adding
$P_{21}(k)$ to CMB data provides significantly tighter constraints on
$\Omega_ch^2$ and $H_0$, with a reduction of the error with respect to Planck
results at the level of more than $60\%$. For the parameters describing beyond
$\Lambda$CDM theories, we observe a reduction in the error with respect to the
Planck constraints at the level of $\lesssim 10\%$. The improvement increases
up to $\sim 35\%$ when we constrain the parameters using ideal, tomographic
mock observations. We conclude that the power spectrum of the 21cm signal is
sensitive to variations of the parameters describing the examined beyond
$\Lambda$CDM models and, thus, $P_{21}(k)$ observations could help to constrain
dark energy. The constraining power on such theories is improved significantly
by tomography.

show, for $g_X\sim\mathcal{O}\left(10^{-5}\right)$, it is possible to produce

for the model to be explored in direct search experiment, which otherwise is

approaching Schwarzschild at null infinity in such coordinates, by Kauffman.
The generalized wave coordinates are obtained from a change of variables,
introduced by Lindblad, to asymptotically Schwarzschild coordinates at null
infinity. The main technical advances are that the change of coordinates makes
critical components of the metric decay faster, making the quasilinear wave
operator closer to the flat wave operator, and that commuting with modified Lie
derivatives preserves the geometric null structure, improving the error terms.
This improved decay of the metric is essential for proving our stability

cosmological dependency of the foreground signals, focusing first on the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) power spectrum, derived from the halo model.
We analyse the latest observations by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) of the
high-$\ell$ power (cross) spectra at 90, 150 and 220 GHz, as the sum of CMB and
tSZ signals, both depending on cosmological parameters, and remaining
contaminants. In order to perform faster analyses, we propose a new tSZ
modelling based on machine learning algorithms (namely Random Forest). We show
that the additional information contained in the tSZ power spectrum tightens
constraints on cosmological and tSZ scaling relation parameters. We combine for
the first time the Planck tSZ data with SPT high-$\ell$ to derive even stronger
constraints. Finally, we show how the amplitude of the remaining kSZ power
spectrum varies depending on the assumptions made on both tSZ and cosmological
parameters.

transceiver chains with a fully-digital beamforming architecture (with

beam-switchable antenna array for real-time antenna selection where the one

For the beam-switchable antenna array, we consider two kinds of UE antennas,
with different beam-width and different peak-gain. Based on this testbed, we

explore the potential benefit of the mmWave massive MIMO systems with antenna

the distance and delivers signal to the controller circuit. After receiving the
signal controller circuit increased current supply to the electromagnet through
power amplifier circuit. Magnetic force is expanded then, and object is
levitated in a stable position. If the load is decreased the proximity sensor
senses the distance and delivers signal to the controller circuit. Controller
circuit receives the signal and decreases current supply to the electromagnet

highly applicable for detecting direction that is magnetic levitation system

wave. The central lines are redshifted by $440\pm80$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect
to the LMC, and the [O III] emission displays a symmetry axis of ring-like
structures which could indicate that the pulsar shares the same general
redshift as the central supernova ejecta. [O II], [S II], [Ar III] and H$\beta$
have more compact structures than [O III], and possibly [Ne III]. The average
[O III] temperature is $23\,500 \pm 1\,800$ K, and the electron density from [S

of the central shocked ejecta are ${\rm O:Ne:S:Ar} \approx 1:0.07:0.10:0.02$,
consistent with explosion models of $13-20$ solar mass progenitors, and similar
to that of SN 1987A, as is also the mixing of hydrogen and helium into the

nebula out to well above $2\,000$ km s$^{-1}$. From this a pulsar age of
$\approx 1\,200$ years is estimated. Four filaments of shocked interstellar
medium with a wide range in degree of ionization of iron are identified. One
was observed in X-rays, and another has a redshift of $85\pm30$ km~s$^{-1}$

we present a new theoretical framework for the investigation of the interaction

Raman scattering. We express the Raman scattering process in the framework of
Fermi's golden rule and introduce the concept of Raman energy density (RED).
Similarly to the Raman-Brillouin electronic density (RBED) introduced for
semiconductors, this physical quantity is used as a theoretical tool for the
interpretation of resonant Raman scattering mediated by LSPs in metallic
nanoparticles. The RED represents the electromagnetic energy density excited in
the Raman scattering process and modulated by the acoustic vibrations of the
nanoparticle. We show that, similarly to the LDOS and the RBED, the RED can be
mapped in the near-field region, and provides a clear picture of the
interaction between LSPs and acoustic vibrations giving rise to inelastic
scattering measurable in the far-field. We use the newly introduced RED concept

spectral classes of galaxies and their position in the projected phase-space

observed positions and velocities with the projected phase-space constructed
from simulations, we constrain the accretion redshift of galaxies with
different spectral types. Passive galaxies are mainly located in the virialised
region, while emission-line galaxies are outside r_200, and are accreted later
into the cluster. Emission-lines and post-starbursts show an asymmetric
distribution in projected phase-space within r_200, with the first being
prominent at Delta_v/sigma <~-1.5$, and the second at Delta_v/ sigma >~ 1.5,
suggesting that backsplash galaxies lie at large positive velocities. We find
that low-mass passive galaxies are accreted in the cluster before the high-mass
ones. This suggests that we observe as passives only the low-mass galaxies
accreted early in the cluster as blue galaxies, that had the time to quench
their star formation. We also find that red galaxies move on more radial orbits
than blue galaxies. This can be explained if infalling galaxies can remain blue
moving on tangential orbits.

GHz. The suggested detection of optically thin free-free emission in NGC 1068,
on the sub pc torus scale, is excluded as the brightness temperature is too
high for optically thin free-free emission. However, excess emission observed
with ALMA above 150 GHz in NGC 1068, is consistent with the predicted free-free
emission from gas just outside the broad line region, a region which overlaps
the hot dust disc resolved with GRAVITY. Extended $\sim$100 pc scale free-free
emission is also likely present in NGC 1068. Future sub mm observation of radio
quiet AGN with ALMA may allow to image the free-free emission of warm
photoionized gas in AGN down to the 30 mas scale, including highly absorbed
AGN.

variational inequalities with relatively strongly monotone operators. We
consider two classes of variational inequalities related to some analogs of the
Lipschitz condition of the operator that appeared several years ago. One of
these classes is associated with the relative boundedness of the operator, and
the other one with the analog of the Lipschitz condition (namely, relative
smoothness). For variational inequalities with relatively bounded and
relatively strongly monotone operators, we introduce a modification of the
Mirror Descent method, which optimizes the convergence rate. We also propose
the adaptive Proximal Pirror algorithm and its restarted version with a linear
convergence rate for problems with relatively smooth and relatively strongly

the '90s, the performance of these rules is still rather limited. The machine
learning literature is developing a variety of methods to improve them, but the
resulting rules are difficult to interpret and do not generalise well for a
wide range of settings. This paper is the first major attempt at combining
machine learning with domain problem reasoning for scheduling. The idea
consists of using the insights obtained with the latter to guide the empirical
search of the former. Our hypothesis is that this guided empirical learning
process should result in dispatching rules that are effective and interpretable
and which generalise well to different instance classes. We test our approach
in the classical dynamic job shop scheduling problem minimising tardiness,
which is one of the most well-studied scheduling problems. Nonetheless, results
suggest that our approach was able to find new state-of-the-art rules, which
significantly outperform the existing literature in the vast majority of
settings, from loose to tight due dates and from low utilisation conditions to
congested shops. Overall, the average improvement is 19%. Moreover, the rules
are compact, interpretable, and generalise well to extreme, unseen scenarios.

widely attributed to be the cause of gap-ring structures in sub-mm images of
protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars. Numerical simulations of this
process have been used to propose scalings of characteristic dust gap
width/gap-ring distance with respect to planet mass. Applying such scalings to
analyze observed gap samples yields a continuous mass distribution for a rich
population of hypothetical planets in the range of several Earth to Jupiter
masses. In contrast, the conventional core-accretion scenario of planet
formation predicts a bi-modal mass function due to 1) the onset of runaway gas
accretion above \sim20 Earth masses and 2) suppression of accretion induced by
gap opening. Here we examine the dust disk response to the tidal perturbation
of eccentric planets as a possible resolution of this paradox. Based on
simulated gas and dust distributions, we show the gap-ring separation of
Neptune-mass planets with small eccentricities might become comparable to that
induced by Saturn-mass planets on circular orbits. This degeneracy may
obliterate the discrepancy between the theoretical bi-modal mass distribution
and the observed continuous gap width distribution. Despite damping due to
planet-disk interaction, modest eccentricity may be sustained either in the
outer regions of relatively thick disks or through resonant excitation among
multiple super Earths. Moreover, the ring-like dust distribution induced by
planets with small eccentricities is axisymmetric even in low viscosity
environments, consistent with the paucity of vortices in ALMA images.

show that while expert-augmented ratings provide better estimates of
explanation quality, both original (gold) and expert-augmented automatic

on ER relied on handcrafted features that were used to characterize facial

comprise end-to-end trainable deep learning methods that simultaneously learn
both, features and predictive model. Perhaps the most successful models are
based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While these models have excelled
at this task, they still fail at capturing local patterns that could emerge in
the learning process. We hypothesize these patterns could be captured by
variants based on locally weighted learning. Specifically, in this paper we
propose a CNN based architecture enhanced with multiple branches formed by
radial basis function (RBF) units that aims at exploiting local information at
the final stage of the learning process. Intuitively, these RBF units capture
local patterns shared by similar instances using an intermediate
representation, then the outputs of the RBFs are feed to a softmax layer that
exploits this information to improve the predictive performance of the model.
This feature could be particularly advantageous in ER as cultural / ethnicity
differences may be identified by the local units. We evaluate the proposed
method in several ER datasets and show the proposed methodology achieves
state-of-the-art in some of them, even when we adopt a pre-trained VGG-Face

makes the proposed model competitive.

hundreds or even thousands of independent random permutations to each data
vector in the dataset, in order to obtain reliable results for (e.g.,) building
large-scale learning models or approximate near neighbor search in massive

the surprising theoretical results that we just need \textbf{two} independent
random permutations. For C-MinHash, we first conduct an initial permutation on
the data vector, then we use a second permutation to generate hash values.
Basically, the second permutation is re-used $K$ times via circulant shifting
to produce $K$ hashes. Unlike classical MinHash, these $K$ hashes are obviously
correlated, but we are able to provide rigorous proofs that we still obtain an
unbiased estimate of the Jaccard similarity and the theoretical variance is
uniformly smaller than that of the classical MinHash with $K$ independent

  Interior-Point Method for Model Predictive Control",,,,,"math.OC cs.NA cs.PF cs.SY eess.SY math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely used method to control
systems with linear dynamics. Efficient interior-point methods have been
proposed which leverage the block diagonal structure of the quadratic program
(QP) resulting from the receding horizon control formulation. However, they
require two matrix factorizations per interior-point method iteration, one each
for the computation of the dual and the primal. Recently though an interior
point method based on the null-space method has been proposed which requires
only a single decomposition per iteration. While the then used null-space basis
leads to dense null-space projections, in this work we propose a sparse
null-space basis which preserves the block diagonal structure of the MPC
matrices. Since it is based on the inverse of the transfer matrix we introduce
the notion of so-called virtual controls which enables just that invertibility.
A combination of the reduced number of factorizations and omission of the
evaluation of the dual lets our solver outperform others in terms of
computational speed by an increasing margin dependent on the number of state
and control variables.

SMERCURY (Lissauer et al. 2012) and Mercury-T (Bolmont et al. 2015). The result
is a mixed-variable symplectic N-body integrator that can compute the orbital
and spin evolution of a planet within a multi-planet system under the influence
of tidal spin torques from its star. We validate our implementation by
comparing our experimental results to that of a secular model. As we
demonstrate in a series of experiments, SMERCURY-T allows for the study of
secular spin-orbit resonance crossings and captures for planets within complex
multi-planet systems. These processes can drive a planet's spin state to evolve
along vastly different pathways on its road toward tidal equilibrium, as tidal
spin torques dampen the planet's spin rate and evolve its obliquity.
Additionally, we show the results of a scenario that exemplifies the crossing
of a chaotic region that exists as the overlap of two spin-orbit resonances.
The test planet experiences violent and chaotic swings in its obliquity until
its eventual escape from resonance as it tidally evolves. All of these
processes are and have been important over the obliquity evolution of many
bodies within the Solar System and beyond, and have implications for planetary
climate and habitability. SMERCURY-T is a powerful and versatile tool that
allows for further study of these phenomena.

algorithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of outliers. Our
first contribution is to show that estimation using common robust costs, such
as truncated least squares (TLS), maximum consensus, Geman-McClure, Tukey's
biweight, among others, can be reformulated as polynomial optimization problems
(POPs). By focusing on the TLS cost, our second contribution is to exploit
sparsity in the POP and propose a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxation that is much smaller than the standard Lasserre's hierarchy while
preserving empirical exactness, i.e., the SDP recovers the optimizer of the
nonconvex POP with an optimality certificate. Our third contribution is to
solve the SDP relaxations at an unprecedented scale and accuracy by presenting
STRIDE, a solver that blends global descent on the convex SDP with fast local
search on the nonconvex POP. Our fourth contribution is an evaluation of the
proposed framework on six geometric perception problems including single and
multiple rotation averaging, point cloud and mesh registration, absolute pose
estimation, and category-level object pose and shape estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that (i) our sparse SDP relaxation is empirically exact
with up to 60%-90% outliers across applications; (ii) while still being far
from real-time, STRIDE is up to 100 times faster than existing SDP solvers on
medium-scale problems, and is the only solver that can solve large-scale SDPs
with hundreds of thousands of constraints to high accuracy; (iii) STRIDE
safeguards existing fast heuristics for robust estimation (e.g., RANSAC or
Graduated Non-Convexity), i.e., it certifies global optimality if the heuristic
estimates are optimal, or detects and allows escaping local optima when the
heuristic estimates are suboptimal.

the synchronization process occurs at two timescales: (i) macro-scale, where
global aggregations are carried out via device-server interactions, and (ii)
micro-scale, where local aggregations are carried out via D2D cooperative
consensus formation in different device clusters. Our theoretical analysis
reveals how device, cluster, and network-level parameters affect the
convergence of TT-HF, and leads to a set of conditions under which a

reconnection events and the associated impulsive heating (nanoflares) is a
strong candidate for solving the solar coronal heating problem. Whether
nanoflares accelerate particles to high energies like full-sized flares is
unknown. We investigate this question by studying the type III radio bursts
that the nanoflares may produce on closed loops. The characteristic
frequency-drifts that type III bursts exhibit can be detected using a novel
application of the time-lag technique developed by Viall & Klimchuk (2012) even
when there are multiple overlapping bursts. We present a simple numerical model
that simulates the expected radio emission from nanoflares in an active region
(AR), which we use to test and calibrate the technique. We find that in the
case of closed loops the frequency spectrum of type III bursts is expected to
be extremely steep such that significant emission is produced at a given
frequency only for a rather narrow range of loop lengths. We also find that the
signature of bursts in the time-lag signal diminishes as: (1)the variety of
participating loops within that range increases; (2)the occurrence rate of
bursts increases; (3) the duration of bursts increases; and (4) the brightness
of the bursts decreases relative to noise. In addition, our model suggests a
possible origin of type I bursts as a natural consequence of type III emission
in a closed-loop geometry.

number of broad emission features including the [FeII] at 1.644mu which is
highly asymmetric with a tilted top and a peak red-shifted by ~2,000km/s. In
comparison with 2-D non-LTE synthetic spectra computed from 3-D simulations of
off-center delayed-detonation Chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf(WD) models, we
find good agreement between the observed lines and the synthetic profiles, and
are able to unravel the structure of the progenitor's envelope. We find that
the size and tilt of the [Fe II] 1.644mu-profile (in velocity space) is an
effective way to determine the location of an off-center delayed-detonation
transition (DDT) and the viewing angle, and it requires a WD with a high
central density of ~4E9$g/cm^3$. We also tentatively identify a stable Ni
feature around 1.9mu characterized by a `pot-belly' profile that is slightly
offset with respect to the kinematic center. In the case of
SN~2020qxp/ASASSN-20jq, we estimate that the location of the DDT is ~0.3M(WD)
off-center, which gives rise to an asymmetric distribution of the underlying
ejecta. We also demonstrate that low-luminosity and high-density WD SNIa
progenitors exhibit a very strong overlap of Ca and 56Ni in physical space.
This results in the formation of a prevalent [Ca II] 0.73mu emission feature,
which is sensitive to asymmetry effects. Our findings are discussed within the
context of alternative scenarios, including off-center C/O detonations in

computing, many frameworks have been proposed. However, few of them treat the
in-storage security as the first citizen. Specifically, since modern SSD
controllers do not have a trusted execution environment, an offloaded
(malicious) program could steal, modify, and even destroy the data stored in
the SSD. In this paper, we first investigate the attacks that could be
conducted by offloaded in-storage programs. To defend against these attacks, we
build a lightweight trusted execution environment, named IceClave for
in-storage computing. IceClave enables security isolation between in-storage
programs and flash management functions that include flash address translation,
data access control, and garbage collection, with TrustZone extensions.
IceClave also achieves security isolation between in-storage programs by
enforcing memory integrity verification of in-storage DRAM with low overhead.
To protect data loaded from flash chips, IceClave develops a lightweight data
encryption/decryption mechanism in flash controllers. We develop IceClave with
a full system simulator. We evaluate IceClave with a variety of data-intensive
applications such as databases. Compared to state-of-the-art in-storage
computing approaches, IceClave introduces only 7.6% performance overhead, while
enforcing security isolation in the SSD controller with minimal hardware cost.
IceClave still keeps the performance benefit of in-storage computing by

collision avoidance constraints are imposed by obstacles in the workspace. In
general, closed-form expressions yielding feasible configurations do not exist,
motivating the use of numerical solution methods. However, these approaches
rely on local optimization of nonconvex problems, often requiring an accurate

years with many more ordinary devices gaining network capability and becoming
part of the ever growing IoT network. With this exponential growth and the
limitation of resources, it is becoming increasingly harder to protect against
security threats such as malware due to its evolving faster than the defence
mechanisms can handle with. The traditional security systems are not able to
detect unknown malware as they use signature-based methods. In this paper, we
aim to address this issue by introducing a novel IoT malware traffic analysis
approach using neural network and binary visualisation. The prime motivation of
the proposed approach is to faster detect and classify new malware (zero-day
malware). The experiment results show that our method can satisfy the accuracy
requirement of practical application.

with a rich dynamical structure. In addition, its non-polar solutions, which
grow without bounds as the iteration index $n$ increases, are of particular
relevance to other areas of mathematics. We combine theory and asymptotics with
high-precision numerical simulations to arrive at the following picture: when
extended to include backward iterates, known non-polar solutions of dP1 form a
family of heteroclinic connections between two fixed points at infinity. One of
these solutions, the Freud orbit of orthogonal polynomial theory, is a singular
limit of the other solutions in the family. Near their asymptotic limits, all
solutions converge to the Freud orbit, which follows invariant curves of dP1,
when written as a 3-D autonomous system, and reaches the point at positive
infinity along a center manifold. This description leads to two important
results. First, the Freud orbit tracks sequences of period-1 and 2 points of
the autonomous counterpart of dP1 for large positive and negative values of
$n$, respectively. Second, we identify an elegant method to obtain an
asymptotic expansion of the iterates on the Freud orbit for large positive
values of $n$. The structure of invariant manifolds emerging from this picture
contributes to a deeper understanding of the global analysis of an interesting
class of discrete dynamical systems.

algorithmic fairness, and domain adaptation, desire explicit control over
semantic information being discarded. This goal is formulated as satisfying two
objectives: maximizing utility for predicting a target attribute while
simultaneously being invariant (independent) to a known semantic attribute.
Solutions to invariant representation learning (IRepL) problems lead to a
trade-off between utility and invariance when they are competing. While
existing works study bounds on this trade-off, two questions remain
outstanding: 1) What is the exact trade-off between utility and invariance? and
2) What are the encoders (mapping the data to a representation) that achieve
the trade-off, and how can we estimate it from training data? This paper
addresses these questions for IRepLs in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHS)s. Under the assumption that the distribution of a low-dimensional
projection of high-dimensional data is approximately normal, we derive a
closed-form solution for the global optima of the underlying optimization
problem for encoders in RKHSs. This yields closed formulae for a near-optimal
trade-off, corresponding optimal representation dimensionality, and the
corresponding encoder(s). We also numerically quantify the trade-off on
representative problems and compare them to those achieved by baseline IRepL
algorithms.

among heterogeneous jobs in terms of shorter queueing delay and higher training
efficiency. This paper presents an optimal resource allocator for elastic

the input image sequence includes not only the action of interest but

accumulate unnecessary information for encoding features on the action of

Information Discrimination Unit (IDU), which explicitly discriminates the
information relevancy between an ongoing action and others to decide whether to
accumulate the input information. This enables learning more discriminative
representations for identifying an ongoing action. In this paper, we further
present a new recurrent unit, called Information Integration Unit (IIU), for
action anticipation. Our IIU exploits the outputs from IDU as pseudo action

effectively. In experiments on TVSeries and THUMOS-14, the proposed methods
outperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in online action

  Analysis",,,,,"stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Functional data analysis (FDA) methods have computational and theoretical
appeals for some high dimensional data, but lack the scalability to modern
large sample datasets. To tackle the challenge, we develop randomized
algorithms for two important FDA methods: functional principal component
analysis (FPCA) and functional linear regression (FLR) with scalar response.
The two methods are connected as they both rely on the accurate estimation of
functional principal subspace. The proposed algorithms draw subsamples from the
large dataset at hand and apply FPCA or FLR over the subsamples to reduce the
computational cost. To effectively preserve subspace information in the
subsamples, we propose a functional principal subspace sampling probability,
which removes the eigenvalue scale effect inside the functional principal
subspace and properly weights the residual. Based on the operator perturbation
analysis, we show the proposed probability has precise control over the first
order error of the subspace projection operator and can be interpreted as an
importance sampling for functional subspace estimation. Moreover, concentration
bounds for the proposed algorithms are established to reflect the low intrinsic
dimension nature of functional data in an infinite dimensional space. The
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated upon synthetic and
real datasets.

of master faces, i.e., faces that match multiple enrolled templates in face
recognition systems, and their existence extends the ability of presentation
attacks. In this paper, we perform an extensive study on latent variable
evolution (LVE), a method commonly used to generate master faces. We run an LVE
algorithm for various scenarios and with more than one database and/or face
recognition system to study the properties of the master faces and to
understand in which conditions strong master faces could be generated.
Moreover, through analysis, we hypothesize that master faces come from some
dense areas in the embedding spaces of the face recognition systems. Last but
not least, simulated presentation attacks using generated master faces
generally preserve the false-matching ability of their original digital forms,
thus demonstrating that the existence of master faces poses an actual threat.

In the H2O-deposition experiments, we found that three-dimensional islands of

crystallization experiments showed that uniform thin films of amorphous CO and
H2O became three-dimensional islands of polyhedral crystals; amorphous CO2, on
the other hand, became a thin film of nano crystalline CO2 covering the
amorphous H2O. Our observations show that crystal morphologies strongly depend
not only on the ice composition, but also on the substrate. Using experimental
data concerning the crystallinity of deposited ices and the crystallization
timescale of amorphous ices, we illustrated the criteria for ice crystallinity
in space and outlined the macroscopic morphology of icy grains in molecular

nano-crystals were embedded in the amorphous H2O, and a polyhedral CO crystal
was attached to the amorphous H2O. Furthermore, a change in the grain

addressable spin qubits in h-BN have been the focus of intensive research due
to their unique potential in quantum computing, communication, and sensing.
However, the number of high-symmetry high-spin defects that are desirable for
developing spin qubits in h-BN is highly limited. Here, we combine density
functional theory (DFT) and quantum embedding theories to show that
out-of-plane XY dimer defects (X, Y = C, N, P, Si) form a new class of stable
C3v spin-triplet defects in h-BN. We find that the dimer defects have a robust

bulk states. We show that 1E and 1A shelving states exist and they are
positioned between the 3E and 3A2 states for all the dimer defects considered
in this study. To support future experimental identification of the XY dimer
defects, we provide an extensive characterization of the defects in terms of
their spin and optical properties. We predict that the zero-phonon line of the

to describe diffusio-osmosis(phoresis), and we report non-equilibrium Molecular
Dynamics (NEMD) on such systems. We explore different simulation methods to
highlight some of the technical problems that arise in the calculations. For
diffusiophoresis, we use two NEMD methods: boundary-driven and field-driven.
Although the two methods should be equivalent in the limit of very weak
gradients, we find that finite Peclet-number effects are much stronger in
boundary-driven flows than in the case where we apply fictitious color forces.

at the quantum frontier. Recent surface sensitive studies of the topological

below the charge density wave (CDW) ordering temperature, which can be related
to the pair density modulations in the superconducting state. If the 4a$_0$

striking analogy to the stripe order and pair density wave discovered in the

twisted bilayer graphene. High-resolution X-ray diffraction has recently been
established as an ultra-sensitive probe for bulk translational
symmetry-breaking orders, even for short-range orders at the diffusive limit.
Here, combining high-resolution X-ray diffraction, scanning tunneling

the 4a$_0$ superstructure emerges uniquely on the surface and hence exclude the
4a$_0$ phase as the origin of any bulk transport or spectroscopic anomaly.
Crucially, we show that our detected 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW order breaks the
bulk rotational symmetry to C2, which can be the driver for the bulk nematic

clinical or biological features, in a discovery cohort; and then measure the
trial level association across studies in a meta-analysis to validate the SE.
To understand how well various patient level metrics would indicate the
eventual trial level association, we considered causal biological trajectories
based on bi-exponential functions, modeled the strength of their impact on
survival hazards via a parameter {\alpha}, and simulated the trajectories and
survival times in randomized trials simultaneously. We set an early time point
in the trials when the trajectory measurement became the SE value. From
simulated discovery cohorts, we compared patient level metrics including C
index, integrated brier score, and log hazard ratio between SE values and
survival times. We assembled multiple simulated studies to enable meta-analyses
to estimate the trial level association. Across all the simulation scenarios
considered here, we found tight correlations among the three patient level
metrics and similar correlations between any of them and the trial level
metric. Despite the continual increase in {\alpha}, both patient and trial
level metrics often plateaued together; their association always decreased
quickly as {\alpha} increased. This suggests that incorporating additional
biological factors into a composite SE is likely to have diminishing returns on
improving both patient level and trial level association.

quasipotential is a potential-like function for nongradient SDEs that gives
asymptotic estimates for the invariant probability measure, expected escape
times from basins of attractors, and maximum likelihood escape paths. The
quasipotential is a solution to an optimal control problem with an anisotropic
cost function which can be solved for numerically via Dijkstra-like
label-setting methods. Previous Dijkstra-like quasipotential solvers have
displayed in general 1st order accuracy in the mesh spacing. However, by
utilizing higher order interpolations of the quasipotential as well as more
accurate approximations of the minimum action paths (MAPs), EJM achieves
second-order accuracy for the quasipotential and nearly second-order for its
gradient. Moreover, by using targeted search neighborhoods for the fastest
characteristics following the ideas of Mirebeau, EJM also enjoys a reduction in
computation time. This highly accurate solver enables us to compute the
prefactor for the WKB approximation for the invariant probability measure and
the Bouchet-Reygner sharp estimate for the expected escape time for the
Maier-Stein SDE. Our codes are available on GitHub.

R-CNN attracts great attention and is widely adopted as a strong baseline for
arbitrary-shaped scene text detection and spotting. However, two issues remain
to be settled. The first is dense text case, which is easy to be neglected but
quite practical. There may exist multiple instances in one proposal, which
makes it difficult for the mask head to distinguish different instances and
degrades the performance. In this work, we argue that the performance
degradation results from the learning confusion issue in the mask head. We
propose to use an MLP decoder instead of the ""deconv-conv"" decoder in the mask
head, which alleviates the issue and promotes robustness significantly. And we
propose instance-aware mask learning in which the mask head learns to predict
the shape of the whole instance rather than classify each pixel to text or
non-text. With instance-aware mask learning, the mask branch can learn
separated and compact masks. The second is that due to large variations in
scale and aspect ratio, RPN needs complicated anchor settings, making it hard
to maintain and transfer across different datasets. To settle this issue, we
propose an adaptive label assignment in which all instances especially those
with extreme aspect ratios are guaranteed to be associated with enough anchors.
Equipped with these components, the proposed method named MAYOR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks including DAST1500, MSRA-TD500,
ICDAR2015, CTW1500, and Total-Text.

computing framework Vector Function Architecture (VFA). In VFAs, vectors can
represent individual data points as well as elements of a function space (a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space). The algebraic vector operations, inherited
from VSA, correspond to well-defined operations in function space. Furthermore,
we study a previously proposed method for encoding continuous data, fractional
power encoding (FPE), which uses exponentiation of a random base vector to
produce randomized representations of data points and fulfills the kernel
properties for inducing a VFA. We show that the distribution from which
elements of the base vector are sampled determines the shape of the FPE kernel,
which in turn induces a VFA for computing with band-limited functions. In
particular, VFAs provide an algebraic framework for implementing large-scale
kernel machines with random features, extending Rahimi and Recht, 2007.
Finally, we demonstrate several applications of VFA models to problems in image

number (e.g., over 1,000) of physical qubits to create one ""perfect"" qubit,
exceeding the capacity of the existing quantum computers. This paper aims to
tackle the noise issue from another angle: instead of creating perfect qubits
for general quantum algorithms, we investigate the potential to mitigate the
noise issue for dedicate algorithms. Specifically, this paper targets quantum
neural network (QNN), and proposes to learn the errors in the training phase,
so that the identified QNN model can be resilient to noise. As a result, the
implementation of QNN needs no or a small number of additional physical qubits,
which is more realistic for the near-term quantum computers. To achieve this
goal, an application-specific compiler is essential: on the one hand, the error
cannot be learned if the mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits exists
randomness; on the other hand, the compiler needs to be efficient so that the
lengthy training procedure can be completed in a reasonable time. In this
paper, we utilize the recent QNN framework, QuantumFlow, as a case study.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach can optimize QNN models
for different errors in qubits, achieving up to 28% accuracy improvement

to forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction
accuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning
studies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of
spatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of
explanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter
estimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may
limit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity,
this study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the
zone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing
services. Specifically, we develop a clustering framework to split the
origin-destination pairs into different clusters and ensemble the
cluster-specific machine learning models for prediction. We implement and test
the proposed methodology by using the ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago. The
results show that, with a more transparent and flexible model structure, the
CEM significantly improves the prediction accuracy than the benchmark models
(i.e., global machine-learning and statistical models directly trained on all

new methodology of travel demand forecasting, especially for new travel modes

  Peer-to-Peer Energy Sharing","11 pages, 10 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Flexible load at the demand-side has been regarded as an effective measure to
cope with volatile distributed renewable generations. To unlock the demand-side
flexibility, this paper proposes a peer-to-peer energy sharing mechanism that
facilitates energy exchange among users while preserving privacy. We prove the
existence and partial uniqueness of the energy sharing market equilibrium and
provide a centralized optimization to obtain the equilibrium. The centralized
optimization is further linearized by a convex combination approach, turning
into a multi-parametric linear program (MP-LP) with renewable output deviations
being the parameters. The flexibility requirement of individual users is
calculated based on this MP-LP. To be specific, an adaptive vertex generation
algorithm is established to construct a piecewise linear estimator of the
optimal total cost subject to a given error tolerance. Critical regions and
optimal strategies are retrieved from the obtained approximate cost function to
evaluate the flexibility requirement. The proposed algorithm does not rely on
the exact characterization of optimal basis invariant sets and thus is not
influenced by model degeneracy, a common difficulty faced by existing
approaches. Case studies validate the theoretical results and show that the
proposed method is scalable.

  medical image segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Automatic image segmentation is a critical component of medical image
analysis, and hence quantifying segmentation performance is crucial. Challenges
in medical image segmentation are mainly due to spatial variations of regions
to be segmented and imbalance in distribution of classes. Commonly used metrics
treat all detected pixels, indiscriminately. However, pixels in smaller
segments must be treated differently from pixels in larger segments, as
detection of smaller ones aid in early treatment of associated disease and are
also easier to miss. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation metric for
segmentation performance, emphasizing smaller segments, by assigning higher
weightage to smaller segment pixels. Weighted false positives are also
considered in deriving the new metric named, ""SSEGEP""(Small SEGment Emphasized
Performance evaluation metric), (range : 0(Bad) to 1(Good)). The experiments
were performed on diverse anatomies(eye, liver, pancreas and breast) from
publicly available datasets to show applicability of the proposed metric across
different imaging techniques. Mean opinion score (MOS) and statistical
significance testing is used to quantify the relevance of proposed approach.
Across 33 fundus images, where the largest exudate is 1.41%, and the smallest
is 0.0002% of the image, the proposed metric is 30% closer to MOS, as compared
to Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Statistical significance testing resulted
in promising p-value of order 10^{-18} with SSEGEP for hepatic tumor compared
to DSC. The proposed metric is found to perform better for the images having
multiple segments for a single label.

transferring a speaking style to the synthesised speech in a target speaker's

carrying desired speaking style during training and require a reference
utterance to obtain speaking style descriptors as conditioning on the
generation of a new sentence. This work presents Referee, a robust
reference-free CSST approach for expressive TTS, which fully leverages
low-quality data to learn speaking styles from text. Referee is built by
cascading a text-to-style (T2S) model with a style-to-wave (S2W) model.
Phonetic PosteriorGram (PPG), phoneme-level pitch and energy contours are
adopted as fine-grained speaking style descriptors, which are predicted from
text using the T2S model. A novel pretrain-refinement method is adopted to
learn a robust T2S model by only using readily accessible low-quality data. The
S2W model is trained with high-quality target data, which is adopted to
effectively aggregate style descriptors and generate high-fidelity speech in
the target speaker's voice. Experimental results are presented, showing that
Referee outperforms a global-style-token (GST)-based baseline approach in CSST.

Taylor's Approximations, we unfold Taylor's Formula to construct a novel

of Taylor's Approximations take the same effect as the two competing goals of
high-level contextualized information and spatial details of image restoration
respectively. Specifically, our framework consists of two steps,
correspondingly responsible for the mapping and derivative functions. The
former first learns the high-level contextualized information and the later
combines it with the degraded input to progressively recover local high-order
spatial details. Our proposed framework is orthogonal to existing methods and
thus can be easily integrated with them for further improvement, and extensive

low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs that are constructed
by a predetermined operation, e.g., bicubic downsampling. As existing methods
typically learn an inverse mapping of the specific function, they produce
blurry results when applied to real-world images whose exact formulation is
different and unknown. Therefore, several methods attempt to synthesize much
more diverse LR samples or learn a realistic downsampling model. However, due
to restrictive assumptions on the downsampling process, they are still biased
and less generalizable. This study proposes a novel method to simulate an
unknown downsampling process without imposing restrictive prior knowledge. We
propose a generalizable low-frequency loss (LFL) in the adversarial training
framework to imitate the distribution of target LR images without using any
paired examples. Furthermore, we design an adaptive data loss (ADL) for the
downsampler, which can be adaptively learned and updated from the data during

method for finding a zero or a fixed point of a vector-valued funtion, when
only noisy measurements of the function are available. In the literature to
date, one makes a distinction between ``synchronous'' updating, whereby every
component of the current guess is updated at each time, and ``asynchronous''
updating, whereby only one component is updated. In this paper, we study an
intermediate situation that we call ``batch asynchronous stochastic
approximation'' (BASA), in which, at each time instant, \textit{some but not
all} components of the current estimated solution are updated. BASA allows the
user to trade off memory requirements against time complexity. We develop a
general methodology for proving that such algorithms converge to the fixed
point of the map under study. These convergence proofs make use of weaker
hypotheses than existing results. Specifically, existing convergence proofs
require that the measurement noise is a zero-mean i.i.d\ sequence or a
martingale difference sequence. In the present paper, we permit biased
measurements, that is, measurement noises that have nonzero conditional mean.
Also, all convergence results to date assume that the stochastic step sizes
satisfy a probabilistic analog of the well-known Robbins-Monro conditions. We
replace this assumption by a purely deterministic condition on the
irreducibility of the underlying Markov processes.
  As specific applications to Reinforcement Learning, we analyze the temporal
difference algorithm $TD(\lambda)$ for value iteration, and the $Q$-learning
algorithm for finding the optimal action-value function. In both cases, we
establish the convergence of these algorithms, under milder conditions than in
the existing literature.

design is based on the idea of prioritizing the use of IBRs over conventional

loads and generations, and thereby mitigate any undesired dynamics in the
frequency or the voltage by exploiting their fast actuation time constants. A
new sequential optimization problem, referred to as Area Prioritized Power Flow

to conventional power flow APPF not only leads to a fairer balance between the
dispatch of active and reactive power from the IBRs and the synchronous
generators, but also limits the impact of any contingency from spreading out
beyond its respective control area, thereby guaranteeing a better collective
dynamic performance of the grid. This improvement, however, comes at the cost
of adding an extra layer of communication needed for executing APPF in a
hierarchical way. Results are validated using simulations of a 9-machine,

surfaces of the MX-layers. Although being an important parameter, experimental
studies on the bonding between the MX-layers and the termination species are
few and thus an interesting subject of investigation. Here we show that the
termination species fluorine (F) bonds to the Ti3C2-surface mainly through Ti
3p - F 2p hybridization and that oxygen (O) bonds through Ti 3p - O 2p
hybridization with a significant contribution of Ti 3d and Ti 4p. The study
further shows that the Ti3C2-surface is not only terminated by F and O on the
threefold hollow face-centered-cubic (fcc) site. A significant amount of O sits
on a bridge site bonded to two Ti surface atoms on the Ti3C2-surface. In
addition, the results provide no support for hydroxide (OH) termination on the
Ti3C2-surface. On the contrary, the comparison of the valence band intensity
distribution obtained through ultraviolet- and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

efficient intermediate features. However, the input representation plays a

representation of symbolic music data, which transforms a polyphonic score into
a continuous signal. We evaluate the ability to learn meaningful features from
this representation from a musical point of view. Hence, we introduce an
evaluation method relying on principled generation of synthetic data. Finally,
to test our proposed representation we conduct an extensive benchmark against
recent polyphonic symbolic representations. We show that our signal-like
representation leads to better reconstruction and disentangled features. This
improvement is reflected in the metric properties and in the generation ability
of the space learned from our signal-like representation according to music

anomalous threshold cusps, which are significantly more singular than the

that the double triangle amplitudes interfere with other common mechanisms to

complexity of GPs scales cubically in the number of datapoints. We here show
that in the context of inverse problems involving integral operators, one faces
additional difficulties that hinder inversion on large grids. Furthermore, in
that context, covariance matrices can become too large to be stored. By
leveraging results about sequential disintegrations of Gaussian measures, we
are able to introduce an implicit representation of posterior covariance
matrices that reduces the memory footprint by only storing low rank
intermediate matrices, while allowing individual elements to be accessed
on-the-fly without needing to build full posterior covariance matrices.
Moreover, it allows for fast sequential inclusion of new observations. These
features are crucial when considering sequential experimental design tasks. We
demonstrate our approach by computing sequential data collection plans for
excursion set recovery for a gravimetric inverse problem, where the goal is to
provide fine resolution estimates of high density regions inside the Stromboli
volcano, Italy. Sequential data collection plans are computed by extending the
weighted integrated variance reduction (wIVR) criterion to inverse problems.
Our results show that this criterion is able to significantly reduce the
uncertainty on the excursion volume, reaching close to minimal levels of
residual uncertainty. Overall, our techniques allow the advantages of
probabilistic models to be brought to bear on large-scale inverse problems

large model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area
of research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed
Ranking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in
the recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the
method still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the
prediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully
efficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which
provides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper
presents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the
ranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more
efficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the
teacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be
distilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored
to ""correcting"" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This
process is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side
as well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback. Our
experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art

causes it. This paper introduces an energy and level-set optimizer that
improves boundaries by encoding occlusion geometry. Our model applies to
two-layer, figure-ground scenes, and it can be implemented cooperatively using

large-scale denoising problems. Empirical Bayes is attractive in such settings,
but standard parametric approaches rest on assumptions about the form of the

tuning parameters. We extend the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator
(NPMLE) for Gaussian location mixture densities to allow for multivariate,
heteroscedastic errors. NPMLEs estimate an arbitrary prior by solving an
infinite-dimensional, convex optimization problem; we show that this convex
optimization problem can be tractably approximated by a finite-dimensional
version. We introduce a dual mixture density whose modes contain the atoms of
every NPMLE, and we leverage the dual both to show non-uniqueness in
multivariate settings as well as to construct explicit bounds on the support of
the NPMLE.
  The empirical Bayes posterior means based on an NPMLE have low regret,
meaning they closely target the oracle posterior means one would compute with
the true prior in hand. We prove an oracle inequality implying that the
empirical Bayes estimator performs at nearly the optimal level (up to
logarithmic factors) for denoising without prior knowledge. We provide
finite-sample bounds on the average Hellinger accuracy of an NPMLE for
estimating the marginal densities of the observations. We also demonstrate the
adaptive and nearly-optimal properties of NPMLEs for deconvolution. We apply
the method to two astronomy datasets, constructing a fully data-driven

caused by the disease; however, the effectiveness of this strategy needs to be
quantitatively assessed. We employ the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead
(SIRD) model to investigate various vaccination strategies. We constructed a
metapopulation model with heterogeneous contact and fatality rates and
investigated the effectiveness of vaccination strategies to reduce epidemic
mortality. We found that the fatality-based strategy, which is currently
employed in many countries, is more effective when the contagion rate is high
and vaccine supply is low, but the contact-based method outperforms the
fatality-based strategy when there is a sufficiently high supply of the
vaccine. We identified a discontinuous transition of the optimal vaccination
strategy and path-dependency analogous to hysteresis. This transition and
path-dependency imply that combining the fatality-based and contact-based
strategies is ineffective in reducing the number of deaths. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that such phenomena occur in real-world epidemic diseases, such as
tuberculosis and COVID-19. We also show that the conclusions of this research

the inner regions of accretion disks around black holes using the echoes of the
coronal emission reflected by the disk. While the theory of X-ray reverberation
has been developed almost exclusively for standard thin disks, recently
reverberation lags have been observed from likely super-Eddington accretion
sources such as the jetted tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. In this
paper, we extend X-ray reverberation studies into the super-Eddington accretion
regime, focusing on investigating the lags in the Fe K{\alpha} line region. We
find that the coronal photons are mostly reflected by the fast and optically
thick winds launched from super-Eddington accretion flow, and this funnel-like
reflection geometry produces lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra with unique
characteristics. The lag-frequency spectra exhibits a step-function like
decline near the first zero-crossing point. As a result, the shape of the
lag-energy spectra remains almost independent of the choice of frequency bands
and linearly scales with the black hole mass for a large range of parameter
spaces. Not only can these morphological differences be used to distinguish
super-Eddington accretion systems from sub-Eddington systems, they are also key
for constraining the reflection geometry and extracting parameters from the
observed lags. When explaining the X-ray reverberation lags of Swift J1644+57,
we find that the super-Eddington disk geometry is preferred over the thin disk,
for which we obtain a black hole mass of 5-6 million solar masses and a coronal
height around 10 gravitational radii by fitting the lag spectra to our

local relations with mask-guided features, while the inter-part relationship
builds correlations with transformers, to develop cross relationships between
part nodes. With the collaborative learning inter- and intra-part

duration, LPWAN devices inevitably suffer from high power Cross Technology
Interference (CTI), such as interference from Wi-Fi, coexisting in the same
spectrum. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces the Partial Symbol
Recovery (PSR) scheme for improving the CTI resilience of LPWAN. We verify our
idea on LoRa, a widely adopted LPWAN technique, as a proof of concept. At the
PHY layer, although CTI has much higher power, its duration is relatively
shorter compared with LoRa symbols, leaving part of a LoRa symbol uncorrupted.
Moreover, due to its high redundancy, LoRa chips within a symbol are highly
correlated. This opens the possibility of detecting a LoRa symbol with only
part of the chips. By examining the unique frequency patterns in LoRa symbols
with time-frequency analysis, our design effectively detects the clean LoRa
chips that are free of CTI. This enables PSR to only rely on clean LoRa chips
for successfully recovering from communication failures. We evaluate our PSR
design with real-world testbeds, including SX1280 LoRa chips and USRP B210,

demonstrate that our design offers reliable packet recovery performance,

  meta-analyses",,,,,"cs.CL q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It has been proposed that the order in which words are prepared for
production depends on the speaker's language. When producing the translation
equivalent of the small cat, speakers of German or Dutch select the
gender-marked determiner at a relatively early stage of production. Speakers of
French or Italian postpone the encoding of a determiner or adjective until the
phonological form of the noun is available. Hence, even though the words are
produced in the same order (e.g., die kleine Katze in German, le petit chat in
French), they are not planned in the same order and might require different
amounts of advanced planning prior to production onset. This distinction
between early and late selection languages was proposed to account for the
observation that speakers of Germanic and Slavic languages, but not of Romance
languages, are slower to name pictures in the context of a distractor word of a
different gender. Meta-analyses are conducted to provide the first direct test
of this cross-linguistic difference and to test a prediction of the late
selection hypothesis. They confirm the existence of the gender congruency
effect in German/Slavic languages and its absence in Romance languages when
target and distractor words are presented simultaneously. They do not allow
confirming the hypothesis that in the latter languages, a similar effect
emerges when the presentation of the distractor is delayed. Overall, these
analyses confirm the cross-linguistic difference but show that the evidence
available to date is not sufficient to confirm or reject the late selection
hypothesis as an explanation of this difference. We highlight specific
directions for future research.

we demonstrate the ability of HMMs to substantially rectify radiative heat

HMM-based terminals of a thermal diode feature overlapped hyperbolic bands
which result in a large heat current, and suppress the reverse heat flow by
creating spectrally mismatched density of states as the temperature bias is
flipped. As an example, we present a few high-performance thermal diodes by
pairing HMMs made of polar dielectrics and metal-to-insulator transition (MIT)
materials in the form of periodic nanowire arrays, and considering three
representative kinds of substrates. Upon optimization, we theoretically achieve
a rectification ratio of 324 at a 100 nm gap, which remains greater than 148

spin-polarization on the Nb atoms have marginal effects to the their positions.
Moreover, by scaling the exchange field on the Mn site we could explain the
lack of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-like YSR state in the spectrum. While our results for
a close packed ferromagnetic dimer are in satisfactory agreement with the
experimentally observed splitting of the YSR states, in case of an
antiferromagnetic dimer we find that the spin-orbit coupling is not
sufficiently large to explain the splitting of the YSR states seen in the

dimer induces splitting of the YSR states and also shifts their energy, leading
even to the formation of a zero bias peak in case of the deepest YSR state.

ESB is suitable for various bell-shaped distributions of weights and activation

turbulent Reynolds number, with focus on the geometrical representation of the
leading-edge (LE) corners. The study contributes to further our understanding
of the discrepancies between existing numerical and experimental BARC data. In
a first part, rounded LE corners with small curvature radii are considered.
Results show that a small amount of rounding does not lead to abrupt changes of
the mean fields, but that the effects increase with the curvature radius. The
shear layer separates from the rounded LE at a lower angle, which reduces the
size of the main recirculating region over the cylinder side. In contrast, the
longitudinal size of the recirculating region behind the trailing edge (TE)
increases, as the TE shear layer is accelerated. The effect of the curvature
radii on the turbulent kinetic energy and on its production, dissipation and
transport are addressed. The present results should be contrasted with the
recent work of Rocchio et al, JWEIA 2020, who found via implicit Large-Eddy
Simulations at larger Reynolds numbers than even a small curvature radius leads
to significant changes of the mean flow.
  In a second part, the LE corners are fully sharp and the exact analytical
solution of the Stokes problem in the neighborhood of the corner is used to
locally restore the solution accuracy degraded by the singularity. Changes in
the mean flow reveal that the analytical correction leads to streamlines that
better follow the corners. The flow separates from the LE with a lower angle,
resulting in a slightly smaller recirculating region. The corner-correction
approach is valuable in general, and is expected to help developing
high-quality numerical simulations at the high Reynolds numbers typical of the
experiments with reasonable meshing requirements.

problematic scaling makes simulations progressively less tractable at smaller
$q$. Here we propose and explore a method for alleviating the scale disparity
in simulations with mass ratios in the intermediate astrophysical range
($10^{-4} \lesssim q\lesssim 10^{-2}$), where purely perturbative methods may
not be adequate. A region of radius much larger than $m_2$ around the smaller
object is excised from the numerical domain, and replaced with an analytical
model approximating a tidally deformed black hole. The analytical model
involves certain a priori unknown parameters, associated with unknown bits of
physics together with gauge-adjustment terms; these are dynamically determined
by matching to the numerical solution outside the excision region. In this
paper we develop the basic idea and apply it to a toy model of a scalar charge
in a circular geodesic orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, solving for the
massless Klein-Gordon field in a 1+1D framework. Our main goal here is to
explore the utility and properties of different matching strategies, and to
this end we develop two independent implementations, a finite-difference one
and a spectral one. We discuss the extension of our method to a full 3D
numerical evolution and to gravity.

what specific traits in the pre-training data, other than the semantics, make a
pre-trained LM superior to their counterparts trained from scratch on
downstream tasks. We propose to use artificially constructed datasets as the
pre-training data to exclude the effect of semantics, and further control what
characteristics the pre-training corpora have. By fine-tuning the pre-trained
models on GLUE benchmark, we can learn how beneficial it is to transfer the
knowledge from the model trained on the dataset possessing that specific trait.
We define and discuss three different characteristics in the artificial
dataset: 1) matching the token's uni-gram or bi-gram distribution between
pre-training and downstream fine-tuning, 2) the presence of the explicit
dependencies among the tokens in a sequence, 3) the length of the implicit
dependencies among the tokens in a sequence. Our experiments show that the
explicit dependencies in the sequences of the pre-training data are critical to
the downstream performance. Our results also reveal that models achieve better
downstream performance when pre-trained on a dataset with a longer range of
implicit dependencies. Based on our analysis, we find that models pre-trained
with artificial datasets are prone to learn spurious correlation in downstream
tasks. Our work reveals that even if the LMs are not pre-trained on natural
language, they still gain transferability on certain human language downstream
tasks once the LMs learn to model the token dependencies in the sequences. This
result helps us understand the exceptional transferability of pre-trained LMs.

related to software quality. Static software metrics, e.g., size, complexity
and coupling are used in defect prediction research as well as software quality
models to evaluate software quality. While this indicates a relationship
between quality and software metrics, the extent of it is not well understood.
Moreover, recent studies found that complexity metrics may be unreliable
indicators for understandability of the source code. To explore this
relationship, we leverage the intent of developers about what constitutes a
quality improvement in their own code base. We manually classify a randomized
sample of 2,533 commits from 54 Java open source projects as quality improving
depending on the intent of the developer by inspecting the commit message. We
distinguish between perfective and corrective maintenance via predefined
guidelines and use this data as ground truth for the fine-tuning of a
state-of-the art deep learning model for natural language processing. We use
the model to increase our data set to 125,482 commits. Based on the resulting
data set, we investigate the differences in size and 14 static source code
metrics between changes that increase quality, as indicated by the developer,
and other changes. We find that quality improving commits are smaller than
other commits. Perfective changes have a positive impact on static source code
metrics while corrective changes do tend to add complexity. Furthermore, we
find that files which are the target of perfective maintenance already have a
lower median complexity than other files. Our study results provide empirical
evidence for which static source code metrics capture quality improvement from
the developers point of view. This has implications for program understanding
as well as code smell detection and recommender systems.

adversarial jammer to mitigate effective utilization of the electromagnetic

The main idea of this paper is to show that ECCM involving a radar and a jammer
can be formulated as a principal-agent problem (PAP) - a problem widely studied
in microeconomics. With the radar as the principal and the jammer as the agent,
we design a PAP to optimize the radar's ECCM strategy in the presence of a
jammer. The radar seeks to optimally trade-off signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
the target measurement with the measurement cost: cost for generating radiation
power for the pulse to probe the target. We show that for a suitable choice of
utility functions, PAP is a convex optimization problem. Further, we analyze
the structure of the PAP and provide sufficient conditions under which the
optimal solution is an increasing function of the jamming power observed by the
radar; this enables computation of the radar's optimal ECCM within the class of
increasing affine functions at a low computation cost. Finally, we illustrate
the PAP formulation of the radar's ECCM problem via numerical simulations. We
also use simulations to study a radar's ECCM problem wherein the radar and the

  Meta-Learning",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are typically confined to accomplishing
pre-defined tasks by learning a set of static parameters. In contrast,
biological neural networks (BNNs) can adapt to various new tasks by continually
updating the neural connections based on the inputs, which is aligned with the
paradigm of learning effective learning rules in addition to static parameters,
e.g., meta-learning. Among various biologically inspired learning rules,
Hebbian plasticity updates the neural network weights using local signals
without the guide of an explicit target function, thus enabling an agent to
learn automatically without human efforts. However, typical plastic ANNs using
a large amount of meta-parameters violate the nature of the genomics bottleneck
and potentially deteriorate the generalization capacity. This work proposes a
new learning paradigm decomposing those connection-dependent plasticity rules
into neuron-dependent rules thus accommodating $\Theta(n^2)$ learnable
parameters with only $\Theta(n)$ meta-parameters. We also thoroughly study the
effect of different neural modulation on plasticity. Our algorithms are tested
in challenging random 2D maze environments, where the agents have to use their
past experiences to shape the neural connections and improve their performances
for the future. The results of our experiment validate the following: 1.
Plasticity can be adopted to continually update a randomly initialized RNN to
surpass pre-trained, more sophisticated recurrent models, especially when
coming to long-term memorization. 2. Following the genomics bottleneck, the
proposed decomposed plasticity can be comparable to or even more effective than
canonical plasticity rules in some instances.

have gained much attention from both researchers and practitioners. For a
static method-level bug localization technique, a key but challenging step is
to fully retrieve the semantics of methods and bug reports. Currently, existing
studies mainly use the same bag-of-word space to represent the semantics of
methods and bug reports without considering structure information of methods
and textual contexts of bug reports, which largely and negatively affects bug
localization performance.
  To address this problem, we develop BLESER, a new bug localization technique
based on enhanced semantic retrieval. Specifically, we use an AST-based code
embedding model (capturing code structure better) to retrieve the semantics of
methods, and word embedding models (capturing textual contexts better) to
represent the semantics of bug reports. Then, a deep learning model is built on
the enhanced semantic representations. During model building, we compare five
typical word embedding models in representing bug reports and try to explore
the usefulness of re-sampling strategies and cost-sensitive strategies in
handling class imbalance problems. We evaluate our BLESER on five Java projects
from the Defects4J dataset. We find that: (1) On the whole, the word embedding
model ELMo outperformed the other four models (including word2vec, BERT, etc.)
in facilitating bug localization techniques. (2) Among four strategies aiming
at solving class imbalance problems, the strategy ROS (random over-sampling)
performed much better than the other three strategies (including random
under-sampling, Focal Loss, etc.). (3) By integrating ELMo and ROS into BLESER,
at method-level bug localization, we could achieve MAP of 0.108-0.504, MRR of
0.134-0.510, and Accuracy@1 of 0.125-0.5 on five Defects4J projects.

Numerical calculations are performed using the GiBUU microscopic transport
model supplemented by the parity-doublet model for the mean fields of the
nucleon and the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. In this chiral model, a strong dropping
of the Dirac mass of the $N^*(1535)$ in the high-density stage of a collision
leads to a considerable enhancement in the production of this resonance as
compared to the standard (non-linear) Walecka model. As the system expands, the
Dirac masses of these abundant soft $N^*(1535)$ resonances gradually increase
and ultimately cross the $N \eta$ decay threshold. As a result, an enhanced
low-energy $\eta$ production is observed in the calculations with chiral mean
fields. Comparing with TAPS data on $\eta$ and $\pi^0$ production we find that
the chiral model improves the agreement for the $m_t$-spectra of $\eta$'s at
small $m_t$ in heavy colliding systems. A similar enhancement is also observed
in the soft $\rho$ production due to chiral symmetry and its partial
restoration. The resulting dilepton yields at low and intermediate invariant
masses are slightly enhanced due to these chiral effects which further improve
the agreement between GiBUU transport simulations and HADES data for C+C at 1A
GeV.

attracted plenty of attention. A fundamental challenge for graph learning is
how to train an effective Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder without labels,
which are expensive and time consuming to obtain. Contrastive Learning (CL) is
one of the most popular paradigms to address this challenge, which trains GNNs
by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. Despite the success of
recent CL methods, there are still two under-explored problems. First, how to
reduce the semantic error introduced by random topology based data
augmentations. Traditional CL defines positive and negative node pairs via the
node-level topological proximity, which is solely based on the graph topology
regardless of the semantic information of node attributes, and thus some
semantically similar nodes could be wrongly treated as negative pairs. Second,
how to effectively model the multiplexity of the real-world graphs, where nodes
are connected by various relations and each relation could form a homogeneous
graph layer. To solve these problems, we propose a novel multiplex
heterogeneous graph prototypical contrastive leaning (X-GOAL) framework to
extract node embeddings. X-GOAL is comprised of two components: the GOAL
framework, which learns node embeddings for each homogeneous graph layer, and
an alignment regularization, which jointly models different layers by aligning
layer-specific node embeddings. Specifically, the GOAL framework captures the
node-level information by a succinct graph transformation technique, and
captures the cluster-level information by pulling nodes within the same
semantic cluster closer in the embedding space. The alignment regularization
aligns embeddings across layers at both node and cluster levels. We evaluate
X-GOAL on various real-world datasets and downstream tasks to demonstrate its
effectiveness.

environment and the propagation channel. To solve the SLAM problem, existing
approaches rely on sigma-point or particle-based approximations, leading to
high computational complexity, precluding real-time execution. We propose a
novel low-complexity SLAM filter, based on the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture
(PMBM) filter. It utilizes the extended Kalman (EK) first-order Taylor series
based Gaussian approximation of the filtering distribution, and applies the
track-oriented marginal multi-Bernoulli/Poisson (TOMB/P) algorithm to
approximate the resulting PMBM as a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB). The filter
can account for different landmark types in radio SLAM and multiple data
association hypotheses. Hence, it has an adjustable complexity/performance
trade-off. Simulation results show that the developed SLAM filter can greatly
reduce the computational cost, while it keeps the good performance of mapping
and user state estimation.

Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where devices generate synchronized
time-triggered traffic (e.g., measurements or updates). The data granularity,
in terms of information content and temporal resolution, is parameterized by
the sizes of the generated packets and the duty cycle of packet generation. The
generated data packets at the devices are aggregated through static terrestrial
gateways. Universal frequency reuse is adopted across all gateways and
randomized scheduling is utilized for the IoT devices associated with each
gateway. Such network model finds applications in environmental sensing,
precision agriculture, and geological seismic sensing to name a few. To this
end, we develop a novel spatiotemporal mathematical model to characterize the
interplay between data granularity, transmission reliability, and delay. The
developed model accounts for several IoT design parameters, which include
packet sizes, generation duty cycle, devices and gateways spatial densities,
transmission rate adaptation, power control, and antenna directivity. For
tractable analysis, we propose two accurate approximations, based on the
Poisson point process, to characterize the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) based transmission reliability.
For the delay analysis, we propose a phase-type arrival/departure (PH/PH/1)
queueing model that accounts for packet generation, transmission scheduling,
and rate-sensitive SINR-based packet departure. The developed model is utilized
to obtain the optimal transmission rate for the IoT devices that minimizes
delay. The numerical results delineate the joint feasibility range of packet
sizes and inter-arrival times for data aggregation and reveal significant gains
when deploying directional antennas.

Nonetheless, virtually all prompt-based methods are token-level, meaning they

often relies on a single camera or several independent ones. In such a
monocular setup, dense depth is obtained with either additional input from one
or several expensive LiDARs, e.g., with 64 beams, or camera-only methods, which
suffer from scale-ambiguity and infinite-depth problems. In this paper, we
propose a new alternative of densely estimating metric depth by combining a
monocular camera with a light-weight LiDAR, e.g., with 4 beams, typical of
today's automotive-grade mass-produced laser scanners. Inspired by recent
self-supervised methods, we introduce a novel framework, called LiDARTouch, to
estimate dense depth maps from monocular images with the help of ``touches'' of
LiDAR, i.e., without the need for dense ground-truth depth. In our setup, the
minimal LiDAR input contributes on three different levels: as an additional
model's input, in a self-supervised LiDAR reconstruction objective function,
and to estimate changes of pose (a key component of self-supervised depth
estimation architectures). Our LiDARTouch framework achieves new state of the
art in self-supervised depth estimation on the KITTI dataset, thus supporting
our choices of integrating the very sparse LiDAR signal with other visual
features. Moreover, we show that the use of a few-beam LiDAR alleviates scale
ambiguity and infinite-depth issues that camera-only methods suffer from. We
also demonstrate that methods from the fully-supervised depth-completion
literature can be adapted to a self-supervised regime with a minimal LiDAR
signal.

experimenting with different pretraining choices, such as masking at word and

enough clinical data to train a model from scratch, we applied mixed-domain
pretraining and cross-domain transfer approaches to generate a performant
bio-clinical model suitable for real-world clinical data. We evaluated our
models on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for biomedical documents and
challenging hospital discharge reports. When compared against the competitive
mBERT and BETO models, we outperform them in all NER tasks by a significant
margin. Finally, we studied the impact of the model's vocabulary on the NER
performances by offering an interesting vocabulary-centric analysis. The
results confirm that domain-specific pretraining is fundamental to achieving
higher performances in downstream NER tasks, even within a mid-resource

Kolmogorov's theory of fully developed Turbulence is not in accordance with

dissipation, and thus singularities, are not space filling for high Reynolds

equations energy conservation holds if the upper Minkowski dimension of the
spatial singular set $S \subseteq \T^3$ (possibly also time-dependent) is
small, or more precisely if $\overline{\dim}_{\mathcal{M}}(S)<2+3\theta\,.$ In
particular, the spatial singularities of \emph{non-conservative}
$\theta-$H\""older continuous weak solutions of Euler are concentrated on a set
with dimension lower bound $2+3\theta$. This result can be viewed as the
fractal counterpart of the celebrated Onsager conjecture and it matches both

Initially, we consider two state-of-the-art deep saliency models, namely UNISAL
and MSI-Net for our interpretation. We use a set of biologically plausible
log-gabor filters for identifying and reconstructing the activation maps of
them using our explainable saliency model. The final saliency map is generated
using these reconstructed activation maps. We also build our own deep saliency
model named cross-concatenated multi-scale residual block based network
(CMRNet) for saliency prediction. Then, we evaluate and compare the performance
of the explainable models derived from UNISAL, MSI-Net and CMRNet on three

this approach of explainability can be applied to any deep visual saliency

information transmission through a communication channel. Use of the correlated
quantum states instead of the factorized ones may result in an increase in the

simple physical models of channels it is rather difficult to detect the
superadditivity and find the advantageous multipartite states. Here we consider
the case of polarization dependent losses and propose some physically motivated
multipartite entangled states which outperform all factorized states in a wide
range of the channel parameters. We show that in the asymptotic limit of the
infinite number of channel uses the superadditivity phenomenon takes place
whenever the channel is neither degradable nor antidegradable. Besides the
superadditivity identification, we also provide a method how to modify the
proposed states and get a higher quantum communication rate by doubling the
number of channel uses. The obtained results give a deeper understanding of
coherent information in the multishot scenario and may serve as a benchmark for
quantum capacity estimations and future approaches toward an optimal strategy

experimentally yet. Here we report the first experimental manifestation of HBG
created in the form of a waveguide with depressed-index cladding. Few-mode
channel helical-depressed-cladding waveguides (HDCWs) have been written in a
YAG crystal by a femtosecond laser beam. The HDCW pitches were comparable to
near-IR wavelengths. The spectral and polarization characteristics of the
transmitted and reflected light have been studied. It was shown that HDCWs
behave like HBGs providing narrowband resonance coupling of the counter
propagating modes, the OAM of the modes differing by the Bragg order or, what
is the same, the topological charge of the helical cladding structure.
Adjusting the HDCW parameters allows one to excite a reflected wave at the
predetermined wavelength and with the predetermined OAM change with respect to
the light coupled to the waveguide. Thus, for the first time, the HBGs suitable
for the generation and filtration of the vortex light have been experimentally
demonstrated. The experimental results obtained agree well with the coupled

frequencies of the fields are shifted due to the Doppler effect. When the
control and probe fields are incident to the NV center from the same direction,
the two-photon resonance still holds as the Doppler shifts of the two fields
are the same. Thus, due to the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT),
the probe light can pass through the NV center nearly without absorption.
However, when the two fields propagate in opposite directions, the probe light

composition of planetary atmospheres with the ultimate goal to link it to the
formation history of the planet. Here, we investigate how drifting and
evaporating pebbles that enrich the gas phase of the disk influence the
chemical composition of growing and migrating gas giants. To achieve this goal,
we perform semi analytical 1D models of protoplanetary disks including viscous
evolution, pebble drift and evaporation to simulate the growth of planets from
planetary embryos to Jupiter mass objects by the accretion of pebbles and gas
while they migrate through the disk. The gas phase of the protoplanetary disk
is enriched due to the evaporation of inward drifting pebbles crossing
evaporation lines, leading to the accretion of large amounts of volatiles into
the planetary atmosphere. As a consequence, gas accreting planets are enriched
in volatiles (C, O, N) compared to refractories (e.g., Mg, Si, Fe) by up to a
factor of 100, depending on the chemical species, its exact abundance and
volatility as well as the disk's viscosity. A simplified model for the
formation of Jupiter reveals that its nitrogen content can be explained by
inward diffusing nitrogen rich vapor, implying that Jupiter does not need to
form close to the N2 evaporation front as indicated by previous simulations.
However, our model predicts a too low oxygen abundance for Jupiter, implying
either Jupiter's migration across the water ice line or an additional accretion
of solids into the atmosphere, which can also increase Jupiter's carbon
abundance. The accretion of solids will increase the refractory to volatile
ratio in planetary atmospheres substantially. We thus conclude that the
volatile to refractory ratio can place a strong constraint on planet formation
theories making it an important target for future observations.

T(x) such that the generated computation x \otimes T(x) satisfies \psi. In
practice, the requirement to satisfy the specification in all environments is
often too strong, and it is common to add assumptions on the environment. We
introduce a new type of relaxation on this requirement. In good-enough
synthesis (GE-synthesis), the system is required to generate a satisfying
computation only if one exists. Formally, an input sequence x is hopeful if
there exists some output sequence y such that the computation x \otimes y

that satisfies \psi on all hopeful input sequences. GE-synthesis is
particularly relevant when the notion of correctness is multi-valued (rather

when synthesizing autonomous systems, which interact with unexpected
environments and are often only expected to do their best. We study
GE-synthesis in Boolean and multi-valued settings. In both, we suggest and
solve various definitions of GE-synthesis, corresponding to different ways a
designer may want to take hopefulness into account. We show that in all

synthesis, and can be implemented on top of existing tools. Our algorithms are
based on careful combinations of nondeterministic and universal automata. We
augment systems that GE-realize their specifications by monitors that provide

a rapid magnetorotational explosion in the strong-field case and a delayed

example, the disk-like surface structure of the proto-neutron star proves
highly sensitives to numerical details. The electron fraction distribution in

a gap between GNN research driven by benchmarks which contain graphs that
differ from power grids in several important aspects. Additionally, inductive
learning of GNNs across multiple power grid topologies has not been explored

graph datasets in inductive settings, (ii) an exploratory analysis of graph
properties, and (iii) an empirical study of the concrete learning task of state
estimation on real-world power grids. Our results show that GNNs are more
robust to noise with up to 400% lower error compared to baselines. Furthermore,
due to the unique properties of electrical grids, we do not observe the well
known over-smoothing phenomenon of GNNs and find the best performing models to
be exceptionally deep with up to 13 layers. This is in stark contrast to
existing benchmark datasets where the consensus is that 2 to 3 layer GNNs

previously adopted approximations, showing that existing simplified
prescriptions can easily lead to large errors. In particular, in the context of
pulsar wind nebulae modelling, an accurate description for the supernova
remnant reverse shock is required. We also study in depth the self-similar

$L^p$-based homogeneous Besov spaces, which allow general and highly
oscillating initial velocity. The well-posedness problem studied here is
extremely challenging due to the lack of the magnetic diffusion, and remains
open for the corresponding 3D MHD equations. Our approach exploits the enhanced
dissipation and stabilizing effect resulting from the background magnetic
field, a phenomenon observed in physical experiments. In addition, we obtain
the solution's optimal decay rate when the initial data is further assumed to
be in a Besov space of negative index.

knowledge bases. It aims to build correct executable queries for questions.
Recent methods try to rank candidate queries generated by a state-transition
strategy. However, this candidate generation strategy ignores the structure of
queries, resulting in a considerable number of noisy queries. In this paper, we
propose a new formal query building approach that consists of two stages. In
the first stage, we predict the query structure of the question and leverage
the structure to constrain the generation of the candidate queries. We propose
a novel graph generation framework to handle the structure prediction task and
design an encoder-decoder model to predict the argument of the predetermined
operation in each generative step. In the second stage, we follow the previous
methods to rank the candidate queries. The experimental results show that our
formal query building approach outperforms existing methods on complex
questions while staying competitive on simple questions.

properties of a medium by emitting waves into it and recording their

algorithm forms images using the main path on which reflected signals travel
back to the transducers. In some applications, different insonification paths
can be considered, for instance by placing the transducers at different
locations or if strong reflectors inside the medium are known a-priori. These
different modes give rise to multiple DAS images reflecting different geometric
information about the scatterers and the challenge is to either fuse them into
one image or to directly extract higher-level information regarding the
materials of the medium, e.g., a segmentation map. Traditional image fusion
techniques typically use ad-hoc combinations of pre-defined image transforms,
pooling operations and thresholding. In this work, we propose a deep neural
network (DNN) architecture that directly maps all available data to a
segmentation map while explicitly incorporating the DAS image formation for the
different insonification paths as network layers. This enables information flow
between data pre-processing and image post-processing DNNs, trained end-to-end.
We compare our proposed method to a traditional image fusion technique using
simulated data experiments, mimicking a non-destructive testing application

reflection boundaries. Using our approach, it is possible to obtain much more
accurate segmentation of defects.

competing events, various statistical estimands have been suggested for
defining the causal effect of treatment on the event of interest. Depending on
the estimand, the competing events are either accommodated or eliminated,
resulting in causal effects with different interpretation. The former approach
captures the total effect of treatment on the event of interest while the
latter approach captures the direct effect of treatment on the event of
interest that is not mediated by the competing event. Separable effects have
also been defined for settings where the treatment effect can be partitioned
into its effect on the event of interest and its effect on the competing event
through different causal pathways. We outline various causal effects that may
be of interest in the presence of competing events, including total, direct and
separable effects, and describe how to obtain estimates using regression
standardisation with the Stata command standsurv. Regression standardisation is
applied by obtaining the average of individual estimates across all individuals

most popular ones are Time-Of-Arrival (TOA), Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA),
and Received Signal Strength (RSS) based. Since the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds
(CRLB) of these methods depend on the sensor geometry explicitly, sensor
placement becomes a crucial issue in source localization applications. In this
paper, we consider finding the optimal sensor placements for the TOA, TDOA and
RSS based localization scenarios. We first unify the three localization models
by a generalized problem formulation based on the CRLB-related metric. Then a
unified optimization framework for optimal sensor placement (UTMOST) is
developed through the combination of the alternating direction method of

majority of the state-of-the-art works, the proposed UTMOST neither
approximates the design criterion nor considers only uncorrelated noise in the
measurements. It can readily adapt to to different design criteria (i.e. A, D
and E-optimality) with slight modifications within the framework and yield the
optimal sensor placements correspondingly. Extensive numerical experiments are
performed to exhibit the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed framework.

COMs from the icy grains - where they predominately form - to the gas phase is
still an open question. We investigate the origin of COM emission in a
protostellar source, CygX-N30, through high-angular-resolution interferometric
observations over a continuous broad frequency range. We used 32 GHz
Submillimeter Array observations with continuous frequency coverage from 329 to
361 GHz at an angular resolution of ~1"" to do a line survey and obtain a
chemical inventory of the source. The line emission was used to determine
column densities and excitation temperatures for the COMs. We mapped out the
intensity distribution of the different species and identified approximately
400 lines that can be attributed to 29 different molecular species and their
isotopologues. We find that the molecular peak emission is along a linear
gradient, coinciding with the axis of red- and blueshifted H2CO and CS
emission. Chemical differentiation is detected along this gradient, with the
O-bearing molecular species peaking towards one component of the system and the
N- and S-bearing species peaking towards the other. The inferred column
densities and excitation temperatures are compared to other sources where COMs
are abundant. The origin of the observed COM emission is probably a combination
of the young stellar sources along with accretion of infalling material onto a
disc-like structure surrounding a young protostar. The low D/H ratio observed
(<0.1%) likely reflects a pre-stellar phase where COMs formed on the ices at
warm temperatures (~ 30 K), with inefficient deuterium fractionation. The
observations and results presented here demonstrate the importance of good
frequency coverage and high angular resolution when disentangling the origin of
COM emission.

limit theory. On the one hand, for a fixed argument $t$ of the functions $
X_{i,n}$, the maximum absolute deviation between an estimate and the time
dependent regression function exhibits (after appropriate standardization) an
extreme value behaviour with a Gumbel distribution in the limit. On the other
hand, for stationary functional data, simultaneous confidence bands can be
built on classical central theorems for Banach space valued random variables
and the limit distribution of the maximum absolute deviation is given by the
sup-norm of a Gaussian process. As both limit theorems have different rates of
convergence, they are not compatible, and a weak convergence result, which
could be used for the construction of a confidence surface in the locally

First, we consider different sets of yields and study the importance of the

that: i) primary N produced by rotating massive stars is required to reproduce
the plateau in log(N/O) and [N/Fe] ratios at low metallicity, as well as the
secondary and primary production from low- and intermediate-mass stars to
reproduce the data of the thin disc. ii) The parallel model can provide a good
explanation of the evolution of N abundance in the thick and thin discs; we
confirm that the thick disc has evolved much faster than the thin disc, in
agreement with the results from the abundance patterns of other chemical
elements. iii) Finally, we present new model predictions for N evolution in the

that the thermal gradients typical of arctic sea ice can have a decisive impact
on the mode of pinch-off of cylindrical brine inclusions and on the size

techniques may be used for generating additional training samples when the
available parallel data are scarce. Many DA approaches aim at expanding the
support of the empirical data distribution by generating new sentence pairs
that contain infrequent words, thus making it closer to the true data
distribution of parallel sentences. In this paper, we propose to follow a
completely different approach and present a multi-task DA approach in which we
generate new sentence pairs with transformations, such as reversing the order
of the target sentence, which produce unfluent target sentences. During
training, these augmented sentences are used as auxiliary tasks in a multi-task
framework with the aim of providing new contexts where the target prefix is not
informative enough to predict the next word. This strengthens the encoder and
forces the decoder to pay more attention to the source representations of the
encoder. Experiments carried out on six low-resource translation tasks show
consistent improvements over the baseline and over DA methods aiming at
extending the support of the empirical data distribution. The systems trained
with our approach rely more on the source tokens, are more robust against
domain shift and suffer less hallucinations.

encoded in modern pretrained language models (PLMs) have negative ethical
implications for widespread adoption of state-of-the-art language technology.
To remedy for this, a wide range of debiasing techniques have recently been
introduced to remove such stereotypical biases from PLMs. Existing debiasing
methods, however, directly modify all of the PLMs parameters, which -- besides
being computationally expensive -- comes with the inherent risk of
(catastrophic) forgetting of useful language knowledge acquired in pretraining.
In this work, we propose a more sustainable modular debiasing approach based on
dedicated debiasing adapters, dubbed ADELE. Concretely, we (1) inject adapter
modules into the original PLM layers and (2) update only the adapters (i.e., we
keep the original PLM parameters frozen) via language modeling training on a
counterfactually augmented corpus. We showcase ADELE, in gender debiasing of
BERT: our extensive evaluation, encompassing three intrinsic and two extrinsic
bias measures, renders ADELE, very effective in bias mitigation. We further
show that -- due to its modular nature -- ADELE, coupled with task adapters,
retains fairness even after large-scale downstream training. Finally, by means
of multilingual BERT, we successfully transfer ADELE, to six target languages.

the mobility services according to a multinomial logit model, and the operators
aim at maximizing their joint profit under a constant market share constraint.
After showing that various well-known allocation rules (i.e., proportional
rules and the Shapley value) do not always generate core allocations, we
present a core-guaranteeing allocation rule, the market share exchange rule.
This rule first allocates to each transport operator the profit he or she
generates under collaboration, and then subsequently compensates those
transport operators that lose part of their market share, which is paid by the
ones that receive some extra market share. This exchange of market share is
facilitated by a unique price, which can be expressed as the additional return
by cooperating per unit of market share. Finally, we show that, under some
natural conditions, the market share exchange rule still sustains the
collaboration when the transport operators need to pay back part of the joint

highway environments, the developed novel enhancements aim at empowering the
toolchain to be able to deal with the increased complexity due to the more
complex road networks with multi-modal interactions of various traffic
participants. Based on derived requirements, a thorough explanation of
different modules constituting the toolchain is given, showing first results

cases: First, it is investigated whether the toolchain is capable to serve as
synthetic data source within the development phase of ADS-equipped vehicles to
enrich a scenario database in terms of extent, complexity and impacts of
different what-if-scenarios for future mixed traffic. Second, it is analyzed
how to combine the individual advantages of real recorded data and an
agent-based simulation within a so-called adaptive replay-to-sim approach to

Saturn have always maintained their current eccentric orbits (EJS), we are able
to achieve a reasonably good match to the current inner solar system
architecture. However, due to the strong radial mixing that occurs in the EJS
scenario, it has difficulties in explaining the known isotopic differences
between bodies in the inner solar system, most notably between Earth and Mars.
On the other hand, assuming initially circular orbits for Jupiter and Saturn
(CJS) can reproduce the observed low degree of radial mixing in the inner solar
system, while failing to reproduce the current architecture of the inner solar
system. These outcomes suggest a possible paradox between dynamical structure

metrics $\{g_c = g_\circ-\frac{1}{c^2}dt^2 \}_{c\in\mathbb{N}^+}$. We obtain
that these are the lens spaces $L(2c,1)$ and that the contact structures are
the pushforward of the canonical contact structure on $ST\mathbb{S}^2\cong
L(2,1)$ under the projection map. We also study the applicability of Engel
geometry on the discussion of three-dimensional spacetimes. We show that, for a
particular type of three-dimensional spacetimes, one can obtain the space of
null geodesics and its contact structure solely from the information of the
Lorentz prolongation of the spacetime. We present an approach that makes use of
this result to recover the spacetime from its space of null geodesics and
skies.

between frame-rate and image quality, with single-plane-wave (SPW) imaging
being the fastest possible modality with the worst image quality. Recently,
deep learning methods have been proposed to improve ultrasound imaging. One
approach is to use image-to-image networks that work on the formed image and
another is to directly learn a mapping from data to an image. Both approaches
utilize purely data-driven models and require deep, expressive network
architectures, combined with large numbers of training samples to obtain good
results. Here, we propose a data-to-image architecture that incorporates a
wave-physics-based image formation algorithm in-between deep convolutional

method as network layers and train the whole network end-to-end. We compare our
proposed data-to-image network with an image-to-image network in simulated data
experiments, mimicking a medical ultrasound application. Experiments show that
it is possible to obtain high-quality SPW images, almost similar to an image

stellar mass and sSFRs may be explained by misaligned viewing angles and/or
non-coincident timescales of starburst activity and periods of high
$f_{\rm{esc}}$. Alternatively, escaping radiation may predominantly occur in
highly localised star-forming regions, or $f_{\rm{esc}}$ measurements may be
impacted by stochasticity of the intervening neutral medium, obscuring any
global trends with galaxy properties. These hypotheses have important

of multi-specular fading in a mobile environment. Moreover, a novel heuristic
for phase-shift selection at the RISs is developed, inspired by signal
processing methods that are effective in conventional massive MIMO. Simulation

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance for such data auditing. However, it fails
under certain practical conditions. In this paper, we propose a new method
called Ensembled Membership Auditing (EMA) for auditing data removal to
overcome these limitations. We compare both methods using benchmark datasets

approaches are not sufficiently robust when the variation of conditional

concept of distributional robust optimization to solve the class-conditional

performance of a classifier over class-conditional distributions within a
Wasserstein ball centered around the barycenter of the source conditional
distributions. We also propose an iterative algorithm for learning the optimal
radius of the Wasserstein balls automatically. Experiments show that the
proposed framework has better performance on unseen target domain than

observational probe of their explosions and progenitors. Here we present a 3D
reconstruction of the ejecta in SNR 0540-69.3, which is an O-rich remnant with
a pulsar wind nebula located in the LMC. We use observations from VLT/MUSE to
study H\beta, [O III] \lambda \lambda 4959, 5007, H\alpha, [S II] \lambda
\lambda 6717, 6731, [Ar III] \lambda 7136 and [S III] \lambda 9069. This is
complemented by 2D spectra from VLT/X-shooter, which also cover [O II] \lambda
\lambda 3726, 3729 and [Fe II] \lambda 12567. We identify three main emission
components: (i) Clumpy rings in the inner nebula (<1000 km/s) with similar
morphologies in all lines; (ii) Faint extended [O III] emission dominated by an
irregular ring-like structure with radius ~1600 km/s and inclination ~40 \dg,
but with maximal velocities reaching ~3000 km/s; and (iii) A blob of H\alpha
and H\beta located southeast of the pulsar at velocities ~1500-3500 km/s. We
analyze the geometry using a clump-finding algorithm and use the clumps in the
[O III] ring to estimate an age of 1146 \pm 116 years. The observations favor
an interpretation of the [O III] ring as ejecta, while the origin of the H-blob
is more uncertain. An alternative explanation is that it is the blown-off
envelope of a binary companion. From the detection of Balmer lines in the
innermost ejecta we confirm that SNR 0540 was a Type II supernova and that
hydrogen was mixed down to low velocities in the explosion.

Out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements reveal Gilbert damping

film microstructure strongly suggests that intrinsic Gilbert damping in
polycrystalline metals at room temperature is a local property of nanoscale
crystal grains, with limited impact from grain boundaries and film roughness.
By contrast, the in-plane FMR linewidths of the Fe films exhibit distinct
nonlinear frequency dependences, indicating the presence of strong extrinsic
damping. To fit our in-plane FMR data, we have used a grain-to-grain two-magnon
scattering model with two types of correlation functions aimed at describing
the spatial distribution of inhomogeneities in the film. However, neither of
the two correlation functions is able to reproduce the experimental data
quantitatively with physically reasonable parameters. Our findings advance the
fundamental understanding of intrinsic Gilbert damping in structurally
disordered films, while demonstrating the need for a deeper examination of how
microstructural disorder governs extrinsic damping.

distribution other than the one from which data are actually observed; as an
additional complication, the object of interest is often a marginal quantity of
this other probability distribution. This creates many practical complications
for statistical inference, even where the problem is non-parametrically
identified. In particular, it is difficult to perform likelihood-based
inference, or even to simulate from the model in a general way.
  We introduce the `frugal parameterization', which places the causal effect of
interest at its centre, and then builds the rest of the model around it. We do
this in a way that provides a recipe for constructing a regular, non-redundant
parameterization using causal quantities of interest. In the case of discrete
variables we can use odds ratios to complete the parameterization, while in the
continuous case copulas are the natural choice; other possibilities are also
discussed.
  Our methods allow us to construct and simulate from models with
parametrically specified causal distributions, and fit them using
likelihood-based methods, including fully Bayesian approaches. Our proposal
includes parameterizations for the average causal effect and effect of
treatment on the treated, as well as other causal quantities of interest.

Supervised training allows for more flexibility. If we allow for tokens outside

idiosyncrasies. Contrasting patterns where a ""token"" can be any continuous
vector vs. those where a discrete choice between vocabulary elements has to be
made, we call our method CONtinuous pAtterNs (CONAN). We evaluate CONAN on two

Especially remarkable is the very good matching obtained for our new IHRG model

spanning subgraph of $F$, $G$ is called weakly $H$-saturated in $F$ if the
edges in $E(F)\setminus E(G)$ admit an ordering $e_1,\dots, e_k$ so that for
all $i\in [k]$ the hypergraph $G\cup \{e_1,\dots,e_i\}$ contains an isomorphic
copy of $H$ which in turn contains the edge $e_i$. The weak saturation number
of $H$ in $F$ is the smallest size of an $H$-weakly saturated subgraph of $F$.
Weak saturation was introduced by Bollob\'as in 1968, but despite decades of
study our understanding of it is still limited. The main difficulty lies in
proving lower bounds on weak saturation numbers, which typically withstands
combinatorial methods and requires arguments of algebraic or geometrical
nature.
  In our main contribution in this paper we determine exactly the weak
saturation number of complete multipartite $q$-graphs in the directed setting,
for any choice of parameters. This generalizes a theorem of Alon from 1985. Our
proof combines the exterior algebra approach from the works of Kalai with the
use of the colorful exterior algebra motivated by the recent work of Bulavka,
Goodarzi and Tancer on the colorful fractional Helly theorem. In our second
contribution answering a question of Kronenberg, Martins and Morrison, we
establish a link between weak saturation numbers of bipartite graphs in the
clique versus in a complete bipartite host graph. In a similar fashion we
asymptotically determine the weak saturation number of any complete $q$-partite
$q$-graph in the clique, generalizing another result of Kronenberg et al.

Oscillator, the Smorodinsky-Winternitz (S-W) system and the Harmonic Oscillator
with ratio of frequencies 1:1:2 and additional nonlinear terms on the
3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ ($\kp>0)$ and on the hyperbolic space $H^3$

curved spaces, $S^3$ ($\kp>0)$ and $H^3$ ($\kp<0$). We prove their
superintegrability and we obtain, in all the cases, the maximal number of
functionally independent integrals of motion.
  All the mathematical expressions are presented using the curvature $\kp$ as a

associated trajectories. We study vector fields which are analogue of the
gradient vector field of a function in the smooth case. Our goal is to define a
nice theory of trajectories of such vector fields, so that the set of them
captures the topology of the polyhedral complex, as in classical Morse theory.
Since we do not assume the polyhedral complex to be a manifold, the definition
of vector fields on it is very different from the smooth case. Nevertheless, we
will show that there exist nice classes of functions and metrics which give
gradient vector fields with desired properties. Our construction relies on
Forman's discrete Morse theory. In particular, the class of functions we use is
an improvement of Forman's discrete Morse functions. A notable feature of our
theory is that our gradient vector fields are defined purely from functions and
metrics as in the smooth case, contrary to the case of discrete Morse theory
where we need the data of dimension of cells. This allows us to implement
several useful constructions which were not available in the discrete case.

business, and other fields. Despite the tremendous accomplishments of machine
learning and deep learning methods, many challenges still remain. In
particular, the performance of machine learning methods is often severely
affected in case of diverse data, usually associated with smaller data sets or
data related to areas of study where the size of the data sets is constrained
by the complexity and/or high cost of experiments. Moreover, data with limited
labeled samples is a challenge to most learning approaches. In this paper, the
aforementioned challenges are addressed by integrating graph-based frameworks,
multiscale structure, modified and adapted optimization procedures and
semi-supervised techniques. This results in two innovative multiscale Laplacian
learning (MLL) approaches for machine learning tasks, such as data
classification, and for tackling diverse data, data with limited samples and
smaller data sets. The first approach, called multikernel manifold learning
(MML), integrates manifold learning with multikernel information and solves a
regularization problem consisting of a loss function and a warped kernel
regularizer using multiscale graph Laplacians. The second approach, called the
multiscale MBO (MMBO) method, introduces multiscale Laplacians to a
modification of the famous classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, and
makes use of fast solvers for finding the approximations to the extremal
eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the performance of our
methods experimentally on a variety of data sets, such as biological, text and
image data, and compare them favorably to existing approaches.

the precession period. In contrast, the valley coherence is improved by
thermally activated scattering, but not by charge doping induced scattering. We
propose that this is due to anisotropic pseudospin scattering and generalize
the Maialle-Silva-Sham model to quantitatively explain our experimental
results. Our work illustrates that cleaner samples with minimal scattering,
such as those carefully suspended or protected by hexagonal boron nitride, do
not necessarily lead to good valley polarization. Well-controlled scattering

purely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN
individuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus AD). Second, analogous
groups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2
and SPARE-AD2: amyloid-positive (A+) AD continuum group (consisting of A+AD,
A+MCI, and A+ and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative (A-) CN
group. Finally, the combined group of the AD continuum and A-/CN individuals
was used to train SPARE-BA3, with the intention to estimate brain age

Correlation between the SPARE-BA and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced.
Correlation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to the molecular

results on extending quasi-Moebius maps between boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic
spaces to quasi-isometries between the spaces.
  For CAT(-1) spaces, and more generally boundary continuous Gromov hyperbolic

structure. It is then natural to ask whether there exists a functorial
hyperbolic filling of the boundary by a boundary continuous Gromov hyperbolic
space with an identification between boundaries which is not just
quasi-Moebius, but in fact Moebius.
  We give a positive answer to this question for a large class of boundaries
satisfying one crucial hypothesis, the {\it antipodal property}. This gives a
class of compact spaces called {\it quasi-metric antipodal spaces}. For any
such space $Z$, we give a functorial construction of a boundary continuous
Gromov hyperbolic space $\mathcal{M}(Z)$ together with a Moebius identification
of its boundary with $Z$. The space $\mathcal{M}(Z)$ is maximal amongst all
fillings of $Z$. These spaces $\mathcal{M}(Z)$ give in fact all examples of a
natural class of spaces called {\it maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces}.
  We prove an equivalence of categories between quasi-metric antipodal spaces
and maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces. This is part of a more general
equivalence we prove between the larger categories of certain spaces called
{\it antipodal spaces} and {\it maximal Gromov product spaces}. We prove that
the injective hull of a Gromov product space $X$ is isometric to the maximal

generated from different dependence models is proposed. Different amounts of
dissimilarity between the generating models or changes on the dynamic
behaviours over time are some arguments justifying a fuzzy approach, where each
series is associated to all the clusters with specific membership levels. Our
procedure considers quantile-based cross-spectral features and consists of
three stages: (i) each element is characterized by a vector of proper estimates
of the quantile cross-spectral densities, (ii) principal component analysis is
carried out to capture the main differences reducing the effects of the noise,
and (iii) the squared Euclidean distance between the first retained principal
components is used to perform clustering through the standard fuzzy C-means and
fuzzy C-medoids algorithms. The performance of the proposed approach is
evaluated in a broad simulation study where several types of generating
processes are considered, including linear, nonlinear and dynamic conditional
correlation models. Assessment is done in two different ways: by directly
measuring the quality of the resulting fuzzy partition and by taking into
account the ability of the technique to determine the overlapping nature of
series located equidistant from well-defined clusters. The procedure is
compared with the few alternatives suggested in the literature, substantially
outperforming all of them whatever the underlying process and the evaluation
scheme. Two specific applications involving air quality and financial databases

to a policy (e.g. a claim is valid according to government rules or a post in

previously instantiated as a form of textual entailment, which results in poor
accuracy due to the complexity of the policies. In this paper we propose to
address policy compliance detection via decomposing it into question answering,
where questions check whether the conditions stated in the policy apply to the
scenario, and an expression tree combines the answers to obtain the label.
Despite the initial upfront annotation cost, we demonstrate that this approach
results in better accuracy, especially in the cross-policy setup where the
policies during testing are unseen in training. In addition, it allows us to
use existing question answering models pre-trained on existing large datasets.
Finally, it explicitly identifies the information missing from a scenario in
case policy compliance cannot be determined. We conduct our experiments using a
recent dataset consisting of government policies, which we augment with expert
annotations and find that the cost of annotating question answering

as an integration cell with a geometric mapping from a standard parent domain

no constraint is imposed on the decomposition, certain resulting pyramids may
intersect with themselves, and thus their geometric mappings may present
negative Jacobian values. We call such cells the folded cells and refer to the
corresponding decomposition as a folded decomposition. We show that folded
cells do not cause any issues in practice as they are only used to numerically
compute certain integrals of interest. The same idea can be applied to planar
curved polygons as well. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that
folded cells can retain the same accuracy as the cells with strictly positive
Jacobians. On the other hand, folded cells allow for a much easier and much
more flexible decomposition for general curved polyhedra, on which one can
robustly compute integrals. In the end, we show that folded cells can flexibly

a compliant conduit, is a central problem in microfluidics. We analyze
Newtonian fluid flow in a rectangular duct with a soft top wall at steady
state. The resulting fluid--structure interaction (FSI) is formulated for both
vanishing and finite flow inertia. At the leading-order in the small aspect
ratio, the lubrication approximation implies that the pressure only varies in
the streamwise direction. Meanwhile, the compliant wall's slenderness makes the
fluid--solid interface behave like a Winkler foundation, with the displacement
fully determined by the local pressure. Coupling flow and deformation and
averaging across the cross-section leads to a one-dimensional reduced model. In
the case of vanishing flow inertia, an effective deformed channel height is
defined rigorously to eliminate the spanwise dependence of the deformation. It
is shown that a previously-used averaged height concept is an acceptable
approximation. From the one-dimensional model, a friction factor and the
corresponding Poiseuille number are derived. Unlike the rigid duct case, the
Poiseuille number for a compliant duct is not constant but varies in the
streamwise direction. Compliance can increase the Poiseuille number by a factor
of up to four. The model for finite flow inertia is obtained by assuming a
parabolic vertical variation of the streamwise velocity. To satisfy the
displacement constraints along the edges of the channel, weak tension is
introduced in the streamwise direction to regularize the
Winkler-foundation-like model. Matched asymptotic solutions of the regularized
model are derived.

equation with a focusing power nonlinearity and a damping term in the energy
space on the Euclidean space. We give a complete classification of solutions
into 5 types of global behavior for all initial data in a small neighborhood of
each superposition of two ground states (2-solitons) with the opposite signs
and sufficient spatial distance. The neighborhood contains, for each sign of
the ground state, the manifold with codimension one in the energy space,
consisting of solutions that converge to the ground state at time infinity. The
two manifolds are joined at their boundary by the manifold with codimension two
of solutions that are asymptotic to 2-solitons moving away from each other. The
connected union of these three manifolds separates the rest of the neighborhood
into the open set of global decaying solutions and that of blow-up. The main
ingredient in the proof is a difference estimate on two solutions starting near
2-solitons and asymptotic to 1-solitons. The main difficulty is in controlling
the direction of the two unstable modes attached to 2-solitons, while the
soliton interactions are not uniformly integrable in time. It is resolved by
showing that the non-scalar part of the interaction between the unstable modes
is uniformly integrable due to the symmetry of the equation and the 2-solitons.

increase in computational power, large datasets, deep convolutional neural
networks, optimizers etc. Particularly, the choice of optimizer affects the
generalization, convergence rate, and training stability. Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) is a first order iterative optimizer that updates the gradient
uniformly for all parameters. This uniform update may not be suitable across
the entire training phase. A rudimentary solution for this is to employ a
fine-tuned learning rate scheduler which decreases learning rate as a function
of iteration. To eliminate the dependency of learning rate schedulers, adaptive
gradient optimizers such as AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp, Adam employ a
parameter-wise scaling term for learning rate which is a function of the
gradient itself. We propose Tom (Trend over Momentum) optimizer, which is a
novel variant of Adam that takes into account of the trend which is observed
for the gradients in the loss landscape traversed by the neural network. In the
proposed Tom optimizer, an additional smoothing equation is introduced to
address the trend observed during the process of optimization. The smoothing
parameter introduced for the trend requires no tuning and can be used with
default values. Experimental results for classification datasets such as
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10 image datasets show that Tom outperforms
Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSProp and Adam in terms of both accuracy and has a faster

presence of temperature gradient between reservoirs play a significant role in
robustness of multipartite correlation against environmental decoherence.
Considering a bilinear form of interaction Hamiltonian, an exact expression for
time evolved density matrix is presented. Interestingly, it is observed that
the preservation duration of genuine multipartite concurrence for GHZ class
Werner state increases as the temperature gradient between reservoirs are
increased. However, this increase is non-linear and the preservation duration
is shown to saturate for large temperature gradients. It is also observed that,
for large temperature gradient, there are multiple intervals in which coherence
and consequently the tripartite negativity shows robustness (freezing of
correlation) against the environmental decoherence for W class Werner states.
For the common temperature case, we show that the genuine multipartite
concurrence for the GHZ class Werner state decays irreversibly, and the state
experiences correlation sudden death, with a rate dependent on spectral density
of the reservoirs under consideration. For the Ohmic reservoirs at low
temperature, we observe that the state retains initial multipartite correlation
upto a characteristic time and then sharply decays to zero with a correlation
sudden death. We further investigate the dynamics of tripartite negativity and
$l_{1}$ norm of coherence in the W class Werner states, and show irreversible
degradation in these correlations.

subhalo dark matter interacting with Standard Model particles: (1) subhalo
collisions with old neutron stars can transfer kinetic energy and brighten the
latter to luminosities within the reach of imminent infrared, optical, and
ultraviolet telescopes; we identify new detection strategies involving
single-star measurements and Galactic disk surveys, and obtain the first bounds
on self-interacting dark matter in subhalos from the coldest known pulsar, PSR
J2144-3933, (2) subhalo dark matter scattering with cosmic rays results in
detectable effects, (3) historic Earth-subhalo encounters can leave dark matter

dark matter subhalos weighing between gigaton and solar masses, with

quarks and gluons have the color degrees of freedom. However, a single quark or

states. Color confinement or quark confinement conjecture can be proved by
considering not only the strong interaction but also the electroweak
interaction which is $SU(3)_c$ invariant. Any measurable state has to be color
singlet is the direct consequence of the common symmetry of the standard model.
Color non-singlet objects are created from the big bang when the interaction
breaks $SU(3)_c$ symmetry based on the nonlocal Lagrangian. There is nearly no
interaction between colored objects and color singlet universe when the
momentum transfer is not large enough. Colored objects are reasonable
candidates of dark matter and the missing of anti-matter in the universe can
also be easily explained. Dark matter can be produced in the laboratory which
can be tested by measuring the energy loss and baryon number change in the
extremely high energy collisions of particles and anti-particles.

Our short-term predictions ($<30$ days) may be helpful for policymakers in

  Networks","9 Pages, 22 Figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The identification of out-of-distribution data is vital to the deployment of
classification networks. For example, a generic neural network that has been
trained to differentiate between images of dogs and cats can only classify an
input as either a dog or a cat. If a picture of a car or a kumquat were to be
supplied to this classifier, the result would still be either a dog or a cat.
In order to mitigate this, techniques such as the neural network watchdog have
been developed. The compression of the image input into the latent layer of the
autoencoder defines the region of in-distribution in the image space. This
in-distribution set of input data has a corresponding boundary in the image
space. The watchdog assesses whether inputs are in inside or outside this
boundary. This paper demonstrates how to sharpen this boundary using generative
network training data augmentation thereby bettering the discrimination and
overall performance of the watchdog.

  of Autonomous Vehicles",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the unavailability of prototypes, the early adopters of novel products
actively seek information from multiple sources (e.g., media and social
networks) to minimize the potential risk. The existing behavior models not only
fail to capture the information propagation within the individual's social
network, but also they do not incorporate the impact of such word-of-mouth
(WOM) dissemination on the consumer's risk preferences. Moreover, even
cutting-edge forecasting models rely on crude/synthetic consumer behavior
models. We propose a general framework to forecast the adoption of novel
products by developing a new consumer behavior model and integrating it into a
population-level agent-based model. Specifically, we extend the hybrid choice
model to estimate consumer behavior, which incorporates social network effects
and interplay between WOM and risk aversion. The calibrated consumer behavior
model and synthetic population are passed through the agent-based model for
forecasting the product market share. We apply the proposed framework to
forecast the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Nashville, USA. The
consumer behavior model is calibrated with a stated preference survey data of
1,495 Nashville residents. The output of the agent-based model provides the
effect of the purchase price, post-purchase satisfaction, and safety
measures/regulations on the forecasted AV market share. With an annual AV price
reduction of 5% at the initial purchase price of $40,000 and 90% of satisfied
adopters, AVs are forecasted to attain around 85% market share in thirty years.
These findings are crucial for policymakers to develop infrastructure plans and
manufacturers to conduct an after-sales cost-benefit analysis.

by the emergence of new variants and successful roll-out of vaccination
campaigns. To anticipate this scenario, we used a multilayer network model
developed to forecast the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in Costa Rica, and
to estimate the impact of the introduction of the Delta variant in the country,
under two plausible vaccination scenarios, one sustaining Costa Rica's July
2021 vaccination pace of 30,000 doses per day and with high acceptance from the
population and another with declining vaccination pace to 13,000 doses per day
and with lower acceptance. Results suggest that the introduction and gradual
dominance of the Delta variant would increase Covid-19 hospitalizations and ICU
admissions between $35\%$ and $33.25\%$, from August 2021 to December 2021,
depending on vaccine administration and acceptance. In the presence of the
Delta variant, new Covid-19 hospitalizations and ICU admission would experience
an average increase of $24.26\%$ and $27.19\%$ respectively in the same period
if the vaccination pace drops. Our results can help decision-makers better
prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic in the months to come.

Mutual In-formation (MMI) distributions and ME distributions are expressed by
Bayes-like formulas, in-cluding Negative Exponential Functions (NEFs) and
partition functions. Why do these non-probability functions exist in Bayes-like
formulas? On the other hand, the rate-distortion function has three
disadvantages: (1) the distortion function is subjectively defined; (2) the
defi-nition of the distortion function between instances and labels is often
difficult; (3) it cannot be used for data compression according to the labels'
semantic meanings. The author has proposed using the semantic information G
measure with both statistical probability and logical probability before. We
can now explain NEFs as truth functions, partition functions as logical
probabilities, Bayes-like formulas as semantic Bayes' formulas, MMI as Semantic
Mutual Information (SMI), and ME as extreme ME minus SMI. In overcoming the
above disadvantages, this paper sets up the relationship between truth
functions and distortion functions, obtains truth functions from samples by
machine learning, and constructs constraint conditions with truth functions to
extend rate-distortion functions. Two examples are used to help readers
understand the MMI iteration and to support the theoretical results. Using
truth functions and the semantic information G measure, we can combine machine
learning and data compression, including semantic com-pression. We need further
