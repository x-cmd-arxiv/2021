corner-sharing trigonal bipyramids is exactly solved by imposing three mobile
electrons per triangular cluster of each bipyramid by means of a generalized
decoration-iteration mapping transformation. It is shown that the ground state
of the model involves two spontaneously long-range ordered phases, namely, the
classical phase with a perfect ferromagnetic arrangement of all particles and
the macroscopically degenerate quantum one. The macroscopic degeneracy of the
quantum phase lies in chiral degrees of freedom of the mobile electrons.
Finite-temperature phase diagrams as well as temperature variations of the
spontaneous magnetization, entropy, and specific heat clearly prove that the
classical spin-electron arrangement is thermally almost twice more stable than
the quantum one for some combinations of the model's parameters.

applications such as precision measurement, quantum communication and quantum
computation. Coherent manipulation of ions' oscillatory motions in an ion trap
is important for quantum information processing by ions, however, unwanted
decoherence caused by fluctuating electric-field environment often hinders
stable and high-fidelity operations.. One way to avoid this is to adopt pulsed
laser ablation for ion loading, a loading method with significantly reduced
pollution and heat production. Despite the usefulness of the ablation loading
such as the compatibility with cryogenic environment, randomness of the number
of loaded ions is still problematic in realistic applications where definite
number of ions are preferably loaded with high probability. In this paper, we
demonstrate an efficient loading of a single strontium ion into a surface
electrode trap generated by laser ablation and successive photoionization. The
probability of single-ion loading into a surface electrode trap is measured to
be 82\,\%, and such a deterministic single-ion loading allows for loading ions
into the trap one-by-one. Our results open up a way to develop more functional
ion-trap quantum devices by the clean, stable, and deterministic ion loading.

The interplay between inter- and intracycle interference processes give rise to
multiphoton peaks which can be named as main or ATI peaks and sidebands, in
analogy to the well-known RABBIT (reconstruction of attosecond harmonic beating
by interference of two-photon transitions). We use the saddle point
approximation (SPA) to extract the complex ionization times of the interfering
electron trajectories. Changing the relative phase between the two colors, the
doubly differential momentum distribution of emitted electrons can be
controlled. We study the dependence of the electron emission as a function of
the relative phase between the $\omega $ and $% 2\omega $ fields within the
strong field approximation (SFA) but beyond the perturbative regime. We focus
on the extraction of the phase delays accounting the electron forward emission
in the direction of the polarized electric fields. We characterize the time

first harmonic as a probe [Ti:Sapphire laser ($800$ nm) together with the first

performance, which circumvent painstaking collection procedure of noisy-clean
image pairs in supervised denoising methods and boost denoising applicability
in real world. One of well-known self-supervised denoising strategies is the
blind-spot training scheme. However, a few works attempt to improve blind-spot
based self-denoiser in the aspect of network architecture. In this paper, we
take an intuitive view of blind-spot strategy and consider its process of using
neighbor pixels to predict manipulated pixels as an inpainting process.
Therefore, we propose a novel Mask Guided Residual Convolution (MGRConv) into
common convolutional neural networks, e.g. U-Net, to promote blind-spot based
denoising. Our MGRConv can be regarded as soft partial convolution and find a
trade-off among partial convolution, learnable attention maps, and gated
convolution. It enables dynamic mask learning with appropriate mask constrain.
Different from partial convolution and gated convolution, it provides moderate
freedom for network learning. It also avoids leveraging external learnable
parameters for mask activation, unlike learnable attention maps. The
experiments show that our proposed plug-and-play MGRConv can assist blind-spot
based denoising network to reach promising results on both existing
single-image based and dataset-based methods.

temperatures for AGN jets in our sample is much larger than the variations

We combine the observed median brightness temperatures with apparent jet speed
measurements to find the typical intrinsic Gaussian brightness temperature of
(4.1 +- 0.6)*10^10 K, suggesting that jet cores are at or below equipartition
between particle and magnetic field energy in their median state. We use this
value to derive estimates for the Doppler factor for every source in our

data, we estimate their Lorentz factors and viewing angles to the line of

solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation (not necessarily bijective), we introduce
an associative algebraic structure, called a YB-semitruss, that forms a
subclass of the category of semitrusses as introduced by Brzezi\'nski.
Fundamental examples of YB-semitrusses are structure monoids of left
non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions and (skew) left braces. Gateva-Ivanova
and Van den Bergh introduced structure monoids and showed their importance (as
well as that of the structure algebra) for studying involutive non-degenerate
solutions. Skew left braces were introduced by Guarnieri, Vendramin and Rump to
deal with bijective non-degenerate solutions. Hence, YB-semitrusses also yield
a unified treatment of these different algebraic structures. The algebraic
structure of YB-semitrusses is investigated, and as a consequence, it is
proven, for example, that any finite left non-degenerate set-theoretic solution
of the Yang-Baxter equation is right non-degenerate if and only if it is
bijective. Furthermore, it is shown that some finite left non-degenerate
solutions can be reduced to non-degenerate solutions of smaller size. The
structure algebra of a finitely generated YB-semitruss is an algebra defined by
homogeneous quadratic relations. We prove that it often is a left Noetherian
algebra of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension that satisfies a polynomial
identity, but in general, it is not right Noetherian.

orthogonal to the best-fit relation ($\sigma_{\perp}=0.07\pm0.01$), comparable

  In a wide range of areas non-compact spaces come with a Gaussian weight and a
drift Laplacian. Eigenfunctions are $L^2$ in the weighted space allowing for
extremely rapid growth. Rapid growth would be disastrous for many applications.
Surprisingly, for very general tensors, manifolds and weights, we show the same
polynomial growth bounds that Laplace and Hermite observed for functions on
Euclidean space for the standard Gaussian. This covers all shrinkers for Ricci

  These results open a door for understanding general non-compact spaces. It
provides an analytic framework for doing nonlinear PDE on Gaussian spaces where
previously the Gaussian weight allowed wild growth that made it impossible to
approximate nonlinear by linear. It is key to bound the growth of
diffeomorphisms of non-compact manifolds and is the key for solving the ""gauge

the model might end up learning spurious artifacts present in the dataset. This
problem gets compounded by the prevalence of heavily parameterized and complex
deep neural networks, which can, with their high capacity, end up memorizing
the noise present in the dataset. This paper proposes a novel statistic --
noise score, as a measure for the quality of each data point to identify such
mislabeled samples based on the variations in the latent space representation.
In our work, we use the representations derived by the inference network of
data quality supervised variational autoencoder (AQUAVS). Our method leverages
the fact that samples belonging to the same class will have similar latent
representations. Therefore, by identifying the outliers in the latent space, we
can find the mislabeled samples. We validate our proposed statistic through
experimentation by corrupting MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10/100 datasets in
different noise settings for the task of identifying mislabelled samples. We
further show significant improvements in accuracy for the classification task
for each dataset.

A potential event is recorded when the SNR from a specific template exceeds a
threshold set by a desired false positive rate. In template bank searches, the
generalization of the SNR statistic is the SNR-max statistic, defined as the
maximum of the absolute value of SNRs from individual template matching. While
individual SNR realizations are Gaussian distributed, SNR-max probability
distribution is non-Gaussian. Moreover, as the individual template-bank SNRs
are computed using the same network data streams, SNRs become correlated
between templates. Cross-template correlations have sizable effect on the
SNR-max probability distribution, and the threshold SNR-max values. Computing
threshold SNR-max values for large banks is computationally prohibitive and we
develop analytic approaches to computing properties of SNR-max statistic. This
is done for nearly orthogonal template banks and for banks with cross-template
correlation coefficients ""squeezed"" about the most probable cross-template
correlation value. Since cross-template correlation coefficients quantify
similarity of templates, increasing correlations decrease SNR-max thresholds
for specific values of false positive rates. Increasing the number of templates
in the bank increases the SNR-max thresholds. Our derivations are carried out
for networks that may exhibit colored noise and cross-node correlations.
Specific applications are illustrated with a dark matter search with atomic
clocks and a ''toy'' planar network with cyclic rotational symmetry.

this challenge, we propose PICa, a simple yet effective method that Prompts
GPT3 via the use of Image Captions, for knowledge-based VQA. Inspired by
GPT-3's power in knowledge retrieval and question answering, instead of using

providing a few in-context VQA examples. We further boost performance by
carefully investigating: (i) what text formats best describe the image content,

the first use of GPT-3 for multimodal tasks. By using only 16 examples, PICa
surpasses the supervised state of the art by an absolute +8.6 points on the

variety of purposes in non-linear field theories, including establishing no-go
theorems for solitonic and black hole solutions, as well as for checking the
accuracy of numerical solutions. In this paper, we provide a pedagogical
rationale for the derivation of such integral identities, starting from the
standard variational treatment of particle mechanics. In the framework of
one-dimensional (1D) effective actions, the treatment presented here yields a
set of useful formulas for computing virial identities in any field theory.
Then, we propose that a complete treatment of virial identities in relativistic
gravity must take into account the appropriate boundary term. For General
Relativity this is the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We test and confirm
this proposal with concrete examples. Our analysis here is restricted to
spherically symmetric configurations, which yield 1D effective actions (leaving
higher-D effective actions and in particular the axially symmetric case to a
companion paper). In this case, we show that there is a particular ""gauge""
choice, $i.e.$ a choice of coordinates and parameterizing metric functions,
that simplifies the computation of virial identities in General Relativity,
making both the Einstein-Hilbert action and the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary
term non-contributing. Under this choice, the virial identity results
exclusively from the matter action. For generic ""gauge"" choices, however, this

early-type stars are a rich source of information about both the planet and

of the planet. Although it is possible to determine the true spin-orbit angle
$\Psi$, a notoriously difficult parameter to measure, from any transit
asymmetry resulting from gravity darkening induced by the stellar rotation, the
correlations that exist between the transit parameters have led to large
disagreements in published values of $\Psi$ for some systems. We aimed to study
these phenomena in the light curves of the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-1 b. We
obtained optical CHEOPS transit and occultation light curves of MASCARA-1 b,
and analysed them jointly with a Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m full-phase curve. When
fitting the CHEOPS and Spitzer transits together, the degeneracies are greatly
diminished and return results consistent with previously published Doppler
tomography. Placing priors informed by the tomography achieves even better
precision, allowing a determination of $\Psi=72.1^{+2.5}_{-2.4}$ deg. From the
occultations and phase variations, we derived dayside and nightside
temperatures of $3062^{+66}_{-68}$ K and $1720\pm330$ K, respectively. In
addition, we could separately derive geometric albedo
$A_g=0.171^{+0.066}_{-0.068}$ and spherical albedo
$A_s=0.266^{+0.097}_{-0.100}$ from the CHEOPS data, and Bond albedo
$A_B=0.057^{+0.083}_{-0.101}$ from the Spitzer phase curve. Where possible,
priors informed by Doppler tomography should be used when fitting transits of
fast-rotating stars, though multi-colour photometry may also unlock an accurate
measurement of $\Psi$. Our approach to modelling the phase variations at
different wavelengths provides a template for how to separate thermal emission
from reflected light in spectrally resolved JWST phase curves.

observations on correlated electron materials. Strong correlations in metals
are often associated with their proximity to a Mott transition to an insulator
created by the local Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. We explore the
phase diagrams of a number of models of such local electronic correlation,
employing a dynamical mean field theory in the presence of random spin exchange
interactions. Numerical analyses and analytical solutions, using
renormalization group methods and expansions in large spin degeneracy, lead to
critical regions which display SYK physics. The models studied include the
single-band Hubbard model, the $t$-$J$ model and the two-band Kondo-Heisenberg
model in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. We also examine
non-Fermi liquids obtained by considering each SYK model with random
four-fermion interactions to be a multi-orbital atom, with the SYK-atoms
arranged in an infinite lattice. We connect to theories of sharp Fermi surfaces
without any low-energy quasiparticles in the absence of spatial disorder,
obtained by coupling a Fermi liquid to a gapless boson; a systematic large $N$
theory of such a critical Fermi surface, with SYK characteristics, is obtained
by averaging over an ensemble of theories with random boson-fermion couplings.
Finally, we present an overview of the links between the SYK model and quantum
gravity and end with an outlook on open questions.

inclination-dependent fits for the far-UV-band attenuation and recent

the optical attenuation (AV) that is strongly correlated with inclination
(p-value < 10^-11). For more face-on galaxies, with i < 50 deg, (edge-on, i =
90 deg), the average derived AV is 0.31 +\- 0.11 magnitudes lower (0.56 +\-
0.16 magnitudes higher) for the inclination-dependent model compared to
traditional methods. Further, the ratio of stellar masses between prescriptions
also has a significant (p-value < 10^-2) trend with inclination. For i = 0-65
deg, stellar masses are systematically consistent between fits, with
log(Mstar_inc/Mstar_Calzetti) = -0.05 +/- 0.03 dex and scatter of 0.11 dex.

collision checking only on the partial path segment close to the robot within a
feasibility checking horizon. If the path is infeasible, then tree parts
associated with the path inside the horizon are pruned while maintaining the
maximal tree structure of already-explored regions. Then, a multi-resolution
utility map is created to capture the environmental information used to compute
the replanning utility for each cell on the multi-scale tiling. A hierarchical
searching method is applied on the map to find the sampling cell efficiently.
Finally, uniform samples are drawn within the sampling cell for fast
replanning. The SMARRT method is validated via simulation runs, and the results
are evaluated in comparison to four existing methods. The SMARRT method yields
significant improvements in travel time, replanning time, and success rate

observationally. High-resolution observations of the CO emission around AGB
stars now have the brightness temperature sensitivity to detect possible weak
CO maser emission. We used high angular resolution observations taken with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the small-scale
structure of CO $J=3-2$ emission around the oxygen-rich AGB star W Hya. We find
CO maser emission amplifying the stellar continuum with an optical depth
$\tau\approx-0.55$. The maser predominantly amplifies the limb of the star
because CO $J=3-2$ absorption from the extended stellar atmosphere is strongest
towards the centre of the star. The CO maser velocity corresponds to a
previously observed variable component of high-frequency H$_2$O masers and with
the OH maser that was identified as the amplified stellar image. This implies
that the maser originates beyond the acceleration region and constrains the
velocity profile since we find the population inversion primarily in the inner
circumstellar envelope. We find that inversion can be explained by the
radiation field at 4.6 $\mu$m and that the existence of CO maser emission is
consistent with the estimated mass-loss rates for W Hya. However, the pumping
mechanism requires a complex interplay between absorption and emission lines in
the extended atmosphere. Excess from dust in the circumstellar envelope of W
Hya is not sufficient to contribute significantly to the required radiation
field at 4.6 $\mu$m. The interplay between molecular lines that cause the
pumping can be constrained by future multi-level CO observations.

typed code, enabling them to incrementally reap the benefits of static typing
as they add type annotations to their code. However, this type migration
process is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper
examines the problem of \emph{automated type migration}: given a dynamic
program, infer additional or improved type annotations.
  Existing type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as
maximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and
preserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type
migration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single
goal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would
flexibly accommodate a range of user priorities.
  We present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the
gradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which
relies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf
MaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing
the number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the
migration to be compatible with unmigrated code.
  We present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration
algorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our
evaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ``challenge problems.''
Moreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties
of gradual type migration. In addition, we apply TypeWhich to a suite of
benchmarks for Grift, a programming language based on the GTLC. TypeWhich is
able to reconstruct all human-written annotations on all but one program.

to accurately model the wide range of thermodynamic conditions material
experiences during an impact event and in the debris disk. Since differences in
the thermodynamics may influence the system dynamics, we seek to evaluate how
the choice of an equation of state (EOS) alters the system's evolution.
Specifically, we compare two EOSs that are constructed by different approaches:
either by a simplified analytic description (Tillotson), or by interpolation of
tabulated data (Sesame). Approximately $50$ pairs of Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics impact simulations were performed, with similar initial
conditions but different EOSs, in the parameter space in which the Pluto-Charon

Generally, we show that impact outcomes (e.g., circumplanetary debris disk) are
consistent between EOSs. Some differences arise, importantly in the production
of satellitesimals (large intact clumps) that form in the post-impact debris
disk. When utilizing an analytic EOS, the emergence of satellitesimals is
highly certain, while when using the tabulated EOS it is less common. This is
because for the typical densities and energies experienced in these impacts,
the analytic EOS predicts very low pressure values, leading to particles
artificially aggregating by a tensile instability.

cuts of materials to create black phosphorus nanoribbons. Edges of nanoribbons

we show a reconstruction of the armchair edge that introduces a new valence

explained by the polarization selection rule, which considers the parity of the
wave function to a reflection plane. The flattened-edge reconstruction
originates from the inversion of chirality of the P atoms at the edges and

a tracking system and a separate residual energy (or range) detector to measure
the RSP distribution directly. This paper introduces a novel pCT system based
on a single detector technology, namely low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs).
LGADs are fast 4D-tracking detectors, which can be used to simultaneously
measure the particle position and time with precise timing and spatial
resolution. In contrast to standard pCT systems, the residual energy is
determined via a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement between different 4D-tracking
stations. The design parameters for a realistic proton computed tomography
system based on 4D-tracking detectors were studied and optimized using Monte
Carlo simulations. The RSP accuracy and RSP resolution were measured inside the
inserts of the CTP404 phantom to estimate the performance of the pCT system.
After introducing a dedicated calibration procedure for the TOF calorimeter,
RSP accuracies < 0.6 % could be achieved. Furthermore, the design parameters

algebra along a surjective map, which we term BUG (Blow Up Gorenstein) for
short. This is intended to translate to an algebraic context the cohomology
ring of a blow up of a projective manifold along a projective submanifold. We
show, among other things, that a BUG is a connected sum, that it is the general
fiber in a flat family of algebras, and that it preserves the strong Lefschetz
property. We also show that standard graded compressed algebras are rarely
BUGs, and we classify those BUGs that are complete intersections. We have
included many examples throughout this manuscript.

around the world, policymakers have debated how governments can attain the
benefits of algorithms while preventing the harms of algorithms. One mechanism
that has become a centerpiece of global efforts to regulate government
algorithms is to require human oversight of algorithmic decisions. Despite the
widespread turn to human oversight, these policies rest on an uninterrogated
assumption: that people are able to effectively oversee algorithmic
decision-making. In this article, I survey 41 policies that prescribe human
oversight of government algorithms and find that they suffer from two
significant flaws. First, evidence suggests that people are unable to perform
the desired oversight functions. Second, as a result of the first flaw, human
oversight policies legitimize government uses of faulty and controversial
algorithms without addressing the fundamental issues with these tools. Thus,
rather than protect against the potential harms of algorithmic decision-making
in government, human oversight policies provide a false sense of security in
adopting algorithms and enable vendors and agencies to shirk accountability for
algorithmic harms. In light of these flaws, I propose a shift from human
oversight to institutional oversight as the central mechanism for regulating
government algorithms. This institutional approach operates in two stages.
First, agencies must justify that it is appropriate to incorporate an algorithm
into decision-making and that any proposed forms of human oversight are
supported by empirical evidence. Second, these justifications must receive
democratic public review and approval before the agency can adopt the
algorithm.

caused high density of unavoidable structural defects of the HfO2-based
ferroelectrics, obscuring the intrinsic ferroelectricity inherited from the
crystal space group of bulk HfO2. Here, we demonstrate the intrinsic
ferroelectricity in Y-doped HfO2 films of high crystallinity. Contrary to the
common expectation, we show that in the 5% Y-doped HfO2 epitaxial thin films,
high crystallinity enhances the spontaneous polarization up to a record-high 50
{\mu}C/cm2 value at room temperature. The high spontaneous polarization
persists at reduced temperature, with polarization values consistent with our
theoretical predictions, indicating the dominant contribution from the
intrinsic ferroelectricity. The crystal structure of these films reveals the
Pca21 orthorhombic phase with a small rhombohedral distortion, underlining the
role of the anisotropic stress and strain. These results open a pathway to
controlling the intrinsic ferroelectricity in the HfO2-based materials and

framework wherein an agent senses only the task-relevant information. This
formulation differs from that of a partially observable Markov decision
process, since the agent is free to synthesize not only its policy for action
selection but also its belief-dependent observation function. The method
enables the agent to balance its perception costs with those incurred by
operating in its environment. To obtain a computationally tractable solution,
we approximate the value function using a novel method of invariant finite
belief sets, wherein the agent acts exclusively on a finite subset of the
continuous belief space. We solve the approximate problem through value
iteration in which a linear program is solved individually for each belief
state in the set, in each iteration. Finally, we prove that the value
functions, under an assumption on their structure, converge to their continuous
state-space values as the sample density increases.

transportation infrastructure for extending their service lives. The
advancement of mobile robotic technology allows the rapid collection of a large
amount of inspection video data. However, the data are mainly images of complex
scenes, wherein a bridge of various structural elements mix with a cluttered
background. Assisting bridge inspectors in extracting structural elements of
bridges from the big complex video data, and sorting them out by classes, will
prepare inspectors for the element-wise inspection to determine the condition
of bridges. This paper is motivated to develop an assistive intelligence model
for segmenting multiclass bridge elements from inspection videos captured by an
aerial inspection platform. With a small initial training dataset labeled by
inspectors, a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN)
pre-trained on a large public dataset was transferred to the new task of
multiclass bridge element segmentation. Besides, the temporal coherence
analysis attempts to recover false negatives and identify the weakness that the
neural network can learn to improve. Furthermore, a semi-supervised
self-training (S$^3$T) method was developed to engage experienced inspectors in
refining the network iteratively. Quantitative and qualitative results from
evaluating the developed deep neural network demonstrate that the proposed
method can utilize a small amount of time and guidance from experienced
inspectors (3.58 hours for labeling 66 images) to build the network of
excellent performance (91.8% precision, 93.6% recall, and 92.7% f1-score).
Importantly, the paper illustrates an approach to leveraging the domain
knowledge and experiences of bridge professionals into computational
intelligence models to efficiently adapt the models to varied bridges in the

optimization module for HDRBT of gynecological cancer. By efficiently solving
an optimization problem in real time, it allows a user to visualize a plan and
interactively modify it to improve quality. We formulated an optimization
problem with an objective function containing a weighted sum of doses to normal
organs subject to user-specified target coverage. A user interface was
developed that allows a user to adjust organ weights using scroll bars. With a
simple mouse click, the optimization problem is solved in seconds with a highly
efficient alternating-direction method of multipliers and a warm start
optimization strategy. Resulting clinically relevant D2cc of organs are
displayed immediately. This allows a user to intuitively adjust plans with
satisfactory quality. We tested the effectiveness of our development in cervix
cancer cases treated with a tandem-and-ovoid applicator. It took a maximum of 3

optimization capability, a satisfactory plan can be obtained in <1 min. In our
clinic, although the time for plan adjustment was typically <10min with simple
interactive plan modification tools in TPS, the resulting plans do not ensure
optimality. Our plans achieved on average 5% lower D2cc than clinical plans,

The challenge of
predicting the motion of a crowd around a robot makes it hard to ensure human
safety and comfort. Recent approaches often employ end-to-end techniques for
robot control or deep architectures for high-fidelity human motion prediction.
While these methods achieve important performance benchmarks in simulated
domains, dataset limitations and high sample complexity tend to prevent them
from transferring to real-world environments. Our key insight is that a
low-dimensional representation that captures critical features of crowd-robot
dynamics could be sufficient to enable a robot to wind through a crowd
smoothly. To this end, we mathematically formalize the act of passing between
two agents as a rotation, using a notion of topological invariance. Based on
this formalism, we design a cost functional that favors robot trajectories
contributing higher passing progress and penalizes switching between different
sides of a human. We incorporate this functional into a model predictive
controller that employs a simple constant-velocity model of human motion
prediction. This results in robot motion that accomplishes statistically
significantly higher clearances from the crowd compared to state-of-the-art

system of governing equations. Numerical solution procedures for many dynamical
systems have existed for several decades, but can be slow due to
high-dimensional state space of the dynamical system. Thus, deep learning-based
reduced order models (ROMs) are of interest and one such family of algorithms
along these lines are based on the Koopman theory. This paper extends a
recently developed adversarial Koopman model (Balakrishnan \& Upadhyay,
arXiv:2006.05547) to stochastic space, where the Koopman operator applies on
the probability distribution of the latent encoding of an encoder.
Specifically, the latent encoding of the system is modeled as a Gaussian, and
is advanced in time by using an auxiliary neural network that outputs two
Koopman matrices $K_{\mu}$ and $K_{\sigma}$. Adversarial and gradient losses
are used and this is found to lower the prediction errors. A reduced Koopman
formulation is also undertaken where the Koopman matrices are assumed to have a
tridiagonal structure, and this yields predictions comparable to the baseline
model with full Koopman matrices. The efficacy of the stochastic Koopman model
is demonstrated on different test problems in chaos, fluid dynamics,
combustion, and reaction-diffusion models. The proposed model is also applied
in a setting where the Koopman matrices are conditioned on other input
parameters for generalization and this is applied to simulate the state of a
Lithium-ion battery in time. The Koopman models discussed in this study are
very promising for the wide range of problems considered.

communication hardware in realistic environments are often needed to develop
and assess spectrum-sharing technologies and practices, e.g., for training and
testing spectrum sensing algorithms and for interference testing.
Unfortunately, the time-consuming, expensive nature of such data collections
together with data-sharing restrictions pose significant challenges that limit
data set availability. Furthermore, developing accurate models of real-world RF
emissions from first principles is often very difficult because system
parameters and implementation details are at best only partially known, and
complex system dynamics are difficult to characterize. Hence, there is a need
for flexible, data-driven methods that can leverage existing data sets to
synthesize additional similar waveforms. One promising machine-learning
approach is unsupervised deep generative modeling with generative adversarial
networks (GANs). To date, GANs for RF communication signals have not been
studied thoroughly. In this paper, we present the first in-depth investigation
of generated signal fidelity for GANs trained with baseband orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, where each subcarrier is
digitally modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Building on
prior GAN methods, we developed two novel GAN models and evaluated their
performance using simulated data sets with known ground truth. Specifically, we
investigated model performance with respect to increasing data set complexity
over a range of OFDM parameters and conditions, including fading channels. The
findings presented here inform the feasibility of use cases and provide a
foundation for further investigations into deep generative models for RF
communication signals.

approach to accelerate training of large scale machine learning models such as
deep neural networks. With the increasing computation power of GPUs, the
bottleneck of training speed in distributed training is gradually shifting from
computation to communication. Meanwhile, in the hope of training machine
learning models on mobile devices, a new distributed training paradigm called
``federated learning'' has become popular. The communication time in federated
learning is especially important due to the low bandwidth of mobile devices.
While various approaches to improve the communication efficiency have been
proposed for federated learning, most of them are designed with SGD as the
prototype training algorithm. While adaptive gradient methods have been proven
effective for training neural nets, the study of adaptive gradient methods in
federated learning is scarce. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gradient
method that can guarantee both the convergence and the communication efficiency
for federated learning.

  the Four Rooms Environment","13 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many off-policy prediction learning algorithms have been proposed in the past
decade, but it remains unclear which algorithms learn faster than others. We
empirically compare 11 off-policy prediction learning algorithms with linear
function approximation on two small tasks: the Rooms task, and the High
Variance Rooms task. The tasks are designed such that learning fast in them is
challenging. In the Rooms task, the product of importance sampling ratios can
be as large as $2^{14}$ and can sometimes be two. To control the high variance
caused by the product of the importance sampling ratios, step size should be
set small, which in turn slows down learning. The High Variance Rooms task is
more extreme in that the product of the ratios can become as large as
$2^{14}\times 25$. This paper builds upon the empirical study of off-policy
prediction learning algorithms by Ghiassian and Sutton (2021). We consider the
same set of algorithms as theirs and employ the same experimental methodology.
The algorithms considered are: Off-policy TD($\lambda$), five Gradient-TD
algorithms, two Emphatic-TD algorithms, Tree Backup($\lambda$),
Vtrace($\lambda$), and ABTD($\zeta$). We found that the algorithms' performance
is highly affected by the variance induced by the importance sampling ratios.
The data shows that Tree Backup($\lambda$), Vtrace($\lambda$), and
ABTD($\zeta$) are not affected by the high variance as much as other algorithms
but they restrict the effective bootstrapping parameter in a way that is too
limiting for tasks where high variance is not present. We observed that
Emphatic TD($\lambda$) tends to have lower asymptotic error than other
algorithms, but might learn more slowly in some cases. We suggest algorithms
for practitioners based on their problem of interest, and suggest approaches
that can be applied to specific algorithms that might result in substantially
improved algorithms.

we construct a multi-domain hybrid system model that combines the system

stable walking gaits can then be generated for this model via the hybrid zero

achieving multicontact locomotion on a dual-actuated transfemoral prosthesis,
AMPRO3, for two subjects. The results demonstrate that enforcing muscle model
constraints produces gaits that yield natural locomotion (as analyzed via
comparison to motion capture data and electromyography). Moreover, gaits
generated with our framework were strongly preferred by the non-disabled
prosthetic users as compared to gaits generated with the nominal HZD method,
even with the use of systematic tuning methods. We conclude that the novel
approach of combining robotic walking methods (specifically HZD) with muscle

focuses on the training approach that uses existing fully paired image-caption

paired data). We create synthetic paired captioning data for novel objects by
leveraging context from existing image-caption pairs. We then create
pseudo-label captions for partially paired images with novel objects, and use
this additional data to fine-tune the captioning model. We also propose a
variant of SCST within PS-NOC, called SCST-F1, that directly optimizes the
F1-score of novel objects. Using a popular captioning model (Up-Down) as

terrestrial bodies including the planets,comets,and asteroids are depleted in
$^{16}$O compared to the Sun. The most favored mechanism,the selective
photodissociation of CO gas to produce $^{16}$O depleted water,requires finely
tuned mixing timescales to transport $^{16}$O depleted water from the cold
outer solar system to exchange isotopically with dust grains to produce the
$^{16}$O depleted planetary bodies observed today. Here we show that energetic
particle irradiation of SiO$_2$ (and Al$_2$O$_3$) makes them susceptible to
anomalous isotope exchange with H$_2$O ice at temperatures as low as 10 K. The
observed magnitude of the anomalous isotope exchange (D$^{17}$O) is sufficient
to generate the $^{16}$O depletion characteristic of the terrestrial bodies in
the solar system. We calculated the cosmic-ray exposure times needed to produce
the observed $^{16}$O depletions in silicate (SiO2) dust in the interstellar
medium and early solar system and find that radiation damage induced oxygen
isotope exchange could have rapidly (~10-100 yrs) depleted dust grains of
$^{16}$O during the Sun's T-Tauri phase. Our model explains whythe oldest and
most refractory minerals found in the solar system, the anhydrous Calcium with
Aluminum Inclusions (CAIs),are generally $^{16}$O enriched compared to
chondrules and the bulk terrestrial solids and provides a mechanism for
producing $^{16}$O depleted grains very early in the solar system's history.
Our findings have broad implications for the distribution of oxygen isotopes in
the solar system, the interstellar medium, the formation of the planets and its
building blocks as well as the nature of mass-independent isotope effects.

matches or exceeds ALIGN's cross-modal retrieval performance on well-resourced

performance on under-resourced languages, showing that text-text learning can
overcome a paucity of image-caption examples for these languages. On the

solve a continuous motion planning problem under these behaviors, which

finite set of policies of the uncontrolled agent, and the branch MPC solves for
a feedback policy in the form of a trajectory tree, which shares the same

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are used as a tuning knob to adjust the
tradeoff between performance and robustness. The proposed branch MPC framework
is tested on an overtake and lane change task and a merging task for autonomous

demonstrates interesting human-like behaviors, achieving a balance between

procedure first involves a change of basis to a set of atom-centered Wannier
functions constructed from the natural orbitals of the exact DMRG one-particle
density matrix. The Wannier function model is then reduced to a fewer-parameter
Hubbard-like model, whose parameters are determined by minimizing the
expectation value of the Wannier Hamiltonian in the ground state of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian. This indirect variational procedure not only yields compact and
simple models for the hydrogen chain, but also allows us to explore the
importance of constraints in the effective Hamiltonian, such as the restricting
the range of the single-particle hopping and two-particle interactions, and to
assess the reliability of more conventional downfolding. The entanglement
entropy for a model's ground state, cut in the middle, is an important property
determining the ability of DMRG and tensor networks to simulate the model, and
we study its variation with the range of the interactions. Counterintuitively,
we find that shorter ranged interactions often have larger entanglement.

starburst in GSE, but this galaxy shows the strongest initial star formation as
compared to the other four galaxies. All dwarf galaxies had greater relative
contributions of AGB stars to their enrichment than the MW. Comparing and
contrasting these chemical patterns highlight the importance of galaxy

The quality of localization with range measurements depends on the

localization errors. To reduce the effect of network configuration on
localization error for moving networks we consider various optimality measures
of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which have well-studied relationships
with the localization error. In particular, we pose a trajectory planning
problem with constraints on the FIM optimality measures. By constraining these
optimality measures we can control the statistical properties of the
localization error. To efficiently generate trajectories which satisfy these
FIM constraints we present a prioritized planner which leverages graph-based
planning and unique properties of the range-only FIM. We show results in
simulated experiments that demonstrate the trajectories generated by our
algorithm reduce worst-case localization error by up to 42\% in comparison to
existing planning approaches and can scalably plan distance-efficient
trajectories in complicated environments for large numbers of robots.

trigger-action routines. While such routines enable flexible automation, they
also lead to an instance of the integrity problem in these systems: untrusted
third-parties may use platform APIs to modify the abstract home objects (AHOs)
that privileged, high-integrity devices such as security cameras rely on (i.e.,
as triggers), thereby transitively attacking them. As most accesses to AHOs are
legitimate, removing the permissions or applying naive information flow
controls would not only fail to prevent these problems, but also break useful
functionality. Therefore, this paper proposes the alternate approach of home
abstraction endorsement, which endorses a proposed change to an AHO by
correlating it with certain specific, preceding, environmental changes. We
present the HomeEndorser framework, which provides a policy model for
specifying endorsement policies for AHOs as changes in device states, relative
to their location, and a platform-based reference monitor for mediating all API
requests to change AHOs against those device states. We evaluate HomeEndorser
on the HomeAssistant platform, finding that we can derive over 1000 policy
rules for HomeEndorser to endorse changes to 6 key AHOs, preventing malice and
accidents for less than 10% overhead for endorsement check microbenchmarks, and
with no false alarms under realistic usage scenarios. In doing so, HomeEndorser
lays the first steps towards providing a practical foundation for ensuring that
API-induced changes to abstract home objects correlate with the physical
realities of the user's environment.

interpreted as steady-states of a learning process because players may discover
novel actions during play. In this sense, many games with unawareness are
""self-destroying"" as a player's representation of the game may change after
playing it once. We define discovery processes where at each state there is an
extensive-form game with unawareness that together with the players' play
determines the transition to possibly another extensive-form game with
unawareness in which players are now aware of actions that they have
discovered. A discovery process is rationalizable if players play
extensive-form rationalizable strategies in each game with unawareness. We show
that for any game with unawareness there is a rationalizable discovery process
that leads to a self-confirming game that possesses a self-confirming
equilibrium in extensive-form rationalizable conjectures. This notion of
equilibrium can be interpreted as steady-state of both a discovery and learning
process.

efficient estimators of average treatment effect (ATE) from observational data,
especially under the existence of confounding factors. When estimating,
deciding which type of covariates need to be included in the propensity score
function is important, since incorporating some unnecessary covariates may
amplify both bias and variance of estimators of ATE. In this paper, we show
that including additional instrumental variables that satisfy the exclusion
restriction for outcome will do harm to the statistical efficiency. Also, we
prove that, controlling for covariates that appear as outcome predictors, i.e.
predict the outcomes and are irrelevant to the exposures, can help reduce the
asymptotic variance of ATE estimation. We also note that, efficiently
estimating the ATE by non-parametric or semi-parametric methods require the
estimated propensity score function, as described in Hirano et al.
(2003)\cite{Hirano2003}. Such estimation procedure usually asks for many
regularity conditions, Rothe (2016)\cite{Rothe2016} also illustrated this point
and proposed a known propensity score (KPS) estimator that requires mild
regularity conditions and is still fully efficient. In addition, we introduce a
linearly modified (LM) estimator that is nearly efficient in most general
settings and need not estimation of the propensity score function, hence
convenient to calculate. The construction of this estimator borrows idea from
the interaction estimator of Lin (2013)\cite{Lin2013}, in which regression
adjustment with interaction terms are applied to deal with data arising from a
completely randomized experiment. As its name suggests, the LM estimator can be
viewed as a linear modification on the IPW estimator using known propensity

distributed Laplacian solver recently developed by Forster, Goranci, Liu, Peng,
Sun, and Ye (FOCS `21) into an (almost) \emph{universally optimal} distributed
Laplacian solver.
  Specifically, when the topology is known, we show that any Laplacian system
on an $n$-node graph with \emph{shortcut quality} $\text{SQ}(G)$ can be solved
within $n^{o(1)} \text{SQ}(G) \log(1/\varepsilon)$ rounds, where $\varepsilon$
is the required accuracy. This almost matches our lower bound which guarantees
that any correct algorithm on $G$ requires $\widetilde{\Omega}(\text{SQ}(G))$
rounds, even for a crude solution with $\varepsilon \le 1/2$. Even in the
unknown-topology case (i.e., standard CONGEST), the same bounds also hold in
most networks of interest. Furthermore, conditional on conjectured improvements
in state-of-the-art constructions of low-congestion shortcuts, the CONGEST
results will match the known-topology ones.
  Moreover, following a recent line of work in distributed algorithms, we
consider a hybrid communication model which enhances CONGEST with limited
global power in the form of the node-capacitated clique (NCC) model. In this
model, we show the existence of a Laplacian solver with round complexity
$n^{o(1)} \log(1/\varepsilon)$.
  The unifying thread of these results, and our main technical contribution, is
the study of novel \emph{congested} generalization of the standard
\emph{part-wise aggregation} problem. We develop near-optimal algorithms for
this primitive in the Supported-CONGEST model, almost-optimal algorithms in
(standard) CONGEST, as well as a very simple algorithm for bounded-treewidth
graphs with slightly worse bounds. This primitive can be readily used to
accelerate the FOCS`21 Laplacian solver. We believe this primitive will find
further independent applications.

polarization still remains an open question in the multiferroic materials
$R$Mn$_2$O$_5$ ($R$ = rare-earth, Bi, Y). While previous diffraction studies
have indicated that $R$Mn$_2$O$_5$ possesses the centro-symmetric space group
P$bam$, an atomic displacement allowing for the electric polarization would
require a non-centrosymmetric crystal symmetry. Our single crystal neutron
diffraction experiments on TbMn$_2$O$_5$ provide direct evidence of a reduced
crystallographic symmetry already above the magnetic and ferroelectric phase
transitions and a change in magnetic order upon entering the ferroelectric
phase. This is indicated through the presence of additional nuclear Bragg
reflections that are otherwise forbidden for the space group P$bam$ but are in
good agreement with the polar space group P$12_11$. It implies that the
exchange-striction, which arises from a symmetric $S_i \cdot S_j$ spin
coupling, is the dominating mechanism for the generation of the electric
polarization in the commensurate magnetic phase of TbMn$_2$O$_5$. Furthermore,
the commensurate magnetic reflections are in accordance with a quartile step
spin-spiral along the $c$-axis. Therefore, the antisymmetric $S_i \times S_j$
exchange via the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction contributes as well
and becomes the leading term in the low temperature incommensurate spin-spiral
magnetic phase. These new findings provide important information for the
understanding of the complex interplay between the magnetic and the structural
order throughout the $R$Mn$_2$O$_5$ series of type-II multiferroics.

integration, preparation, and search. Table understanding methods aim at
detecting a table's topic, semantic column types, column relations, or
entities. With the rise of deep learning, powerful models have been developed
for these tasks with excellent accuracy on benchmarks. However, we observe that
there exists a gap between the performance of these models on these benchmarks
and their applicability in practice. In this paper, we address the question:
what do we need for these models to work in practice?
  We discuss three challenges of deploying table understanding models and
propose a framework to address them. These challenges include 1) difficulty in
customizing models to specific domains, 2) lack of training data for typical
database tables often found in enterprises, and 3) lack of confidence in the
inferences made by models. We present SigmaTyper which implements this
framework for the semantic column type detection task. SigmaTyper encapsulates
a hybrid model trained on GitTables and integrates a lightweight

compliance with a treatment assignment is incomplete. The previously proposed
methods for LATE estimation required all relevant variables to be jointly
observed in a single dataset; however, it is sometimes difficult or even
impossible to collect such data in many real-world problems for technical or
privacy reasons. We consider a novel problem setting in which LATE, as a
function of covariates, is nonparametrically identified from the combination of
separately observed datasets. For estimation, we show that the direct least
squares method, which was originally developed for estimating the average
treatment effect under complete compliance, is applicable to our setting.
However, model selection and hyperparameter tuning for the direct least squares
estimator can be unstable in practice since it is defined as a solution to the
minimax problem. We then propose a weighted least squares estimator that
enables simpler model selection by avoiding the minimax objective formulation.
Unlike the inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator, the proposed estimator
directly uses the pre-estimated weight without inversion, avoiding the problems
caused by the IPW methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Instead, we consider the multiple partonic interaction (MPI) picture originally
developed in the context of the PYTHIA event generator. We find that
strangeness enhancement in PYTHIA is hidden by a large excess of low-$p_{\rm
T}$ multi-strange baryons, which mainly results from the hadronization of
$u$-quark, $d$-quark and gluon ($udg$) strings. Strange baryons produced in
strings formed from parton showers initiated by strange quarks
($s$-fragmentation), however, describe well the spectral shapes of $\Xi$ and
$\Omega$ baryons and their multiplicity dependence. Since the total particle
yield contains contributions from soft and hard particle production, which
cannot be experimentally separated, we argue that the correct description of
the $p_{\rm T}$-spectra is a minimum requirement for meaningful comparisons of
multiplicity dependent yield measurements to MPI based calculations. We
demonstrate that the $s$-fragmentation component describes the increase of
average $p_{\rm T}$ and yields with multiplicity seen in the data, including
the approximate multiplicity scaling for different collision energies. When
restricted to processes that reproduce the measured $p_{\rm T}$-spectra, the
MPI framework exhibits a smooth evolution from strictly proportional
multiplicity scaling ($K_{\rm S}^0$, $\Lambda$, where the $udg$-hadronization
component dominates) to linearity ($s$-fragmentation) and on to increasingly
non-linear behavior ($c$-, $b$-quark and high-$p_{\rm T}$ jet fragmentation),
hence providing a unified approach for particle production in pp collisions.

psychological, and socio-cultural ideas. Although memes are typically humorous,
recent days have witnessed an escalation of harmful memes used for trolling,
cyberbullying, and abuse. Detecting such memes is challenging as they can be
highly satirical and cryptic. Moreover, while previous work has focused on
specific aspects of memes such as hate speech and propaganda, there has been
little work on harm in general. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. We focus on
two tasks: (i)detecting harmful memes, and (ii)identifying the social entities
they target. We further extend a recently released HarMeme dataset, which
covered COVID-19, with additional memes and a new topic: US politics. To solve
these tasks, we propose MOMENTA (MultimOdal framework for detecting harmful
MemEs aNd Their tArgets), a novel multimodal deep neural network that uses
global and local perspectives to detect harmful memes. MOMENTA systematically
analyzes the local and the global perspective of the input meme (in both
modalities) and relates it to the background context. MOMENTA is interpretable
and generalizable, and our experiments show that it outperforms several strong
rivaling approaches.

fields to direct currents, a process known as rectification. While rectifiers
are normally based on semiconductor diodes, quantum mechanical non-reciprocal
transport effects that enable highly controllable rectification have recently
been discovered. One such effect is magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA), where the
resistance of a material or a device depends on both the direction of current
flow and an applied magnetic field. However, the size of rectification possible
due to MCA is usually extremely small, because MCA relies on inversion symmetry
breaking leading to the manifestation of spin-orbit coupling, which is a
relativistic effect. In typical materials the rectification coefficient
$\gamma$ due to MCA is usually $|\gamma| \lesssim 1$ ${\rm A^{-1} T^{-1}}$ and
the maximum values reported so far are $|\gamma| \sim 100$ ${\rm A^{-1}
T^{-1}}$ in carbon nanotubes and ZrTe$_5$. Here, to overcome this limitation,
we artificially break inversion symmetry via an applied gate voltage in thin
topological insulator (TI) nanowire heterostructures and theoretically predict
that such a symmetry breaking can lead to a giant MCA effect. Our prediction is
confirmed via experiments on thin bulk-insulating

framework is an end-to-end trainable network, consisting of a simulator and a

patient bone to a normal bone to generate a simulated deformed bone. The
corrector then restores the simulated deformed bone back to normal. In the
inference stage, the trained corrector is applied to generate a
patient-specific normal-looking reference bone from a real deformed bone. The
proposed framework was evaluated using a clinical dataset and compared with a
state-of-the-art method that is based on a supervised point-cloud network.
Experimental results show that the estimated shape models given by our approach

by using cloud assistance. Those methods transmit the RSSI samples and
corrupted packets to the cloud to restore the correct message. However, the
effectiveness of those methods is challenged by the high transmission data
amount. This paper presents a novel method for interference mitigation in a
Edge-Cloud collaborative manner, namely ECCR. It does not require transmitting
RSSI sample any more, whose length is eight times of the packet's. We
demonstrate the disjointness of the bit errors of packets at the base stations
via real-word experiments. ECCR leverages this to collaborate with multiple
base stations for error recovery. Each base station detects and reports bit
error locations to the cloud, then both error checking code and interfered
packets from other receivers are utilized to restore correct packets. ECCR
takes the advantages of both the global management ability of the cloud and the
signal to perceive the benefit of each base station, and it is applicable to
deployed LP-WAN systems (e.g. sx1280) without any extra hardware requirement.
Experimental results show that ECCR is able to accurately decode packets when
packets have nearly 51.76% corruption.

the performance. The proposed method exhibits 2.5 -- 4 dB SNR gain for the
equivalent image quality compared to conventional schemes that employ
state-of-the-art but separate source and channel coding such as BPG and LDPC.
The performance further improves when the system incorporates the channel state

the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically
generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a
target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an
inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we
present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that
combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information
Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing
semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition
(PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC
can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant
to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the
latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various
characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. Experiments on a
GPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate
various forms of spatiotemporal aggregates across different geographic
locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road
network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic

parareal algorithms for solving parabolic problems. The coarse propagator is
fixed to the backward Euler method and the fine propagator is a high-order
single step integrator. Under some conditions on the fine propagator, we show
that there exists some critical $J_*$ such that the parareal solver converges
linearly with a convergence rate near $0.3$, provided that the ratio between
the coarse time step and fine time step named $J$ satisfies $J \ge J_*$. The
convergence is robust even if the problem data is nonsmooth and incompatible
with boundary conditions. The qualified methods include all absolutely stable
single step methods, whose stability function satisfies $|r(-\infty)|<1$, and
hence the fine propagator could be arbitrarily high-order. Moreover, we examine
some popular high-order single step methods, e.g., two-, three- and four-stage
Lobatto IIIC methods, and verify that the corresponding parareal algorithms
converge linearly with a factor $0.31$ and the threshold for these cases is
$J_* = 2$. Intensive numerical examples are presented to support and complete
our theoretical predictions.

System (ADS) scenarios focus on the description at one particular abstraction

at higher levels, such that this data has to be re-synthesized if needed. As
the abstraction granularity should be adapted to the task at hand, however,
engineers currently have the choice between re-calculating the needed data or
operating on the wrong level of abstraction. For instance, the search in a
scenario database for a driving scenario with a map of a given road-shape
should abstract over the lane markings, adjacent vegetation, or weather
situation. Often though, the general road shape has to be synthesized (e.g.
interpolated) from the precise GPS information of road boundaries. This paper
outlines our vision for multi-level ADS scenario models that facilitate
scenario search, generation, and design. Our concept is based on the common
modelling philosophy to interact with scenarios at the most appropriate

and suggest a template abstraction hierarchy. Our vision enables seamless

motion in affecting the head-on collision of binary droplets. In this paper, we
present a computational study by using the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method to
investigate the spin-affected droplet separation of off-center collisions,
which are more probable in reality and phenomenologically richer than head-on
collisions. Different separation modes are identified through a parametric
study with varying spinning speed and impact parameter. A prominent finding is
that increasing the droplet spinning speed tends to suppress the reflexive
separation and to promote the stretching separation. Physically, the reflexive
separation is suppressed because the increased rotational energy reduces the
excessive reflexive kinetic energy within the droplet, which is the cause for
the droplet reflexive separation. The stretching separation is promoted because
the increased droplet angular momentum enhances the local stretching flow
within the droplet, which tends to separate the droplet. The roles of orbital
angular momentum and spin angular momentum in affecting the droplet separation
are further substantiated by studying the collision between two spinning
droplets with either the same or opposite chirality. In addition, a theoretical
model based on conservation laws is proposed to qualitatively describe the
boundaries of coalescence-separation transition influenced by droplet self-spin
motion.

the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $P/\sigma^2$. We derive bounds for the

bound for the convergence rate showing that any code must slowdown the
convergence rate by a factor of roughly $\sqrt{d/\log(1+\mathtt{SNR})}$. Next,
we consider a popular class of schemes called $analog$ $coding$, where a linear
function of the gradient is sent. We show that a simple scaled transmission
analog coding scheme results in a slowdown in convergence rate by a factor of
$\sqrt{d(1+1/\mathtt{SNR})}$. This matches the previous lower bound up to
constant factors for low SNR, making the scaled transmission scheme optimal at
low SNR. However, we show that this slowdown is necessary for any analog coding
scheme. In particular, a slowdown in convergence by a factor of $\sqrt{d}$ for
analog coding remains even when SNR tends to infinity. Remarkably, we present a

billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have excited an explosive demand
for intelligent IoT devices equipped with domain-specific DNN accelerators.
However, the deployment of DNN accelerator enabled intelligent functionality
into real-world IoT devices still remains particularly challenging. First,
powerful DNNs often come at prohibitive complexities, whereas IoT devices often
suffer from stringent resource constraints. Second, while DNNs are vulnerable
to adversarial attacks especially on IoT devices exposed to complex real-world
environments, many IoT applications require strict security. Existing DNN
accelerators mostly tackle only one of the two aforementioned challenges (i.e.,
efficiency or adversarial robustness) while neglecting or even sacrificing the
other. To this end, we propose a 2-in-1 Accelerator, an integrated
algorithm-accelerator co-design framework aiming at winning both the
adversarial robustness and efficiency of DNN accelerators. Specifically, we
first propose a Random Precision Switch (RPS) algorithm that can effectively
defend DNNs against adversarial attacks by enabling random DNN quantization as
an in-situ model switch. Furthermore, we propose a new precision-scalable
accelerator featuring (1) a new precision-scalable MAC unit architecture which
spatially tiles the temporal MAC units to boost both the achievable efficiency
and flexibility and (2) a systematically optimized dataflow that is searched by
our generic accelerator optimizer. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
validate that our 2-in-1 Accelerator can not only aggressively boost both the
adversarial robustness and efficiency of DNN accelerators under various
attacks, but also naturally support instantaneous robustness-efficiency
trade-offs adapting to varied resources without the necessity of DNN
retraining.

  Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in urban computing. The challenge
arises as traffic flows often exhibit intrinsic and latent spatio-temporal
correlations that cannot be identified by extracting the spatial and temporal
patterns of traffic data separately. We argue that such correlations are
universal and play a pivotal role in traffic flow. We put forward {spacetime
interval learning} as a paradigm to explicitly capture these correlations
through a unified analysis of both spatial and temporal features. Unlike the
state-of-the-art methods, which are restricted to a particular road network, we
model the universal spatio-temporal correlations that are transferable from
cities to cities. To this end, we propose a new spacetime interval learning
framework that constructs a local-spacetime context of a traffic sensor
comprising the data from its neighbors within close time points. Based on this
idea, we introduce local spacetime neural network (STNN), which employs novel
spacetime convolution and attention mechanism to learn the universal
spatio-temporal correlations. The proposed STNN captures local traffic
patterns, which does not depend on a specific network structure. As a result, a
trained STNN model can be applied on any unseen traffic networks. We evaluate
the proposed STNN on two public real-world traffic datasets and a simulated
dataset on dynamic networks. The experiment results show that STNN not only
improves prediction accuracy by 4% over state-of-the-art methods, but is also
effective in handling the case when the traffic network undergoes dynamic
changes as well as the superior generalization capability.

Beyond the inspection of static road infrastructure, we also demonstrate the

deploying our system in the real-world, we investigate the strengths and
shortcomings of computer vision techniques on thirteen condition-based
hierarchical labels. These conditions include different timings, road type,
traffic density, and state of road damage. Our demonstrations are then carried
out on 2000 km of unconstrained road scenes, captured across an entire city.

volatility also has a dynamic structure and it comprises a large proportion of
the total volatility. Furthermore, we often observe that the financial market
exhibits heavy tails. To account for these stylized features in financial
returns, we introduce a novel It\^{o} diffusion process for both factor and
idiosyncratic volatilities whose eigenvalues follow the vector auto-regressive
(VAR) model. We call it the factor and idiosyncratic VAR-It\^{o} (FIVAR-It\^o)

robust parameter estimation method for a high-dimensional VAR model. We apply
the robust estimator to predicting large volatility matrices and investigate
its asymptotic properties. Simulation studies are conducted to validate the

Using high-frequency trading data, we apply the proposed method to large

deep representation learning and deep clustering. Some recent works propose to
simultaneously learn representation using deep neural networks and perform
clustering by defining a clustering loss on top of embedded features. However,
these approaches are sensitive to imbalanced data and out-of-distribution
samples. As a consequence, these methods optimize clustering by pushing data
close to randomly initialized cluster centers. This is problematic when the
number of instances varies largely in different classes or a cluster with few

learning models, a deep representation network that captures the data
distribution, and a deep clustering network that learns embedded features and
performs clustering. Specifically, the clustering network and learning
representation network both take advantage of our proposed statistics pooling
block that represents mean, variance, and cardinality to handle the
out-of-distribution samples and class imbalance. Our experiments show that
using these representations, one can considerably improve results on imbalanced

all the data from the source domains without considering inter-domain relations
and implicitly assume each sample in the domain contributes equally. However,
our experiments show that the data distribution bias among different domains
will significantly affect the adaption performance. Moreover, transferring
knowledge from dissimilar domains will even introduce some extra noises so that
affect the performance of models. To tackle this problem, we propose an
effective similarity-based method to select data from the source domains. In
addition, we propose a Shared-Private Network (SP-Net) for the few-shot slot
tagging task. The words from the same class would have some shared features. We
extract those shared features from the limited annotated data on the target

Following a widely used paradigm in real-world recommender systems, our
framework contains two stages. The first one is for candidate news generation

ranking). At the recall stage, each client locally learns multiple interest
representations from clicked news to comprehensively model user interests.
These representations are uploaded to the server to recall candidate news from
a large news pool, which are further distributed to the user client at the
ranking stage for personalized news display. In addition, we propose an
interest decomposer-aggregator method with perturbation noise to better protect
private user information encoded in user interest representations. Besides, we
collaboratively train both recall and ranking models on the data decentralized

excellent way to observe charge-carrier dynamics in semiconductors as a
function of time after photoexcitation. However, a conductivity measurement
alone cannot separate the effects of charge-carrier recombination from
effective mass changes as charges cool and experience different regions of the
electronic band structure. Here we present a form of time-resolved magneto-THz
spectroscopy which allows us to measure cyclotron effective mass on a
picosecond time scale. We demonstrate this technique by observing electron
cooling in the technologically-significant narrow-bandgap semiconductor indium
antimonide (InSb). A significant reduction of electron effective mass from
0.032$m_\mathrm{e}$ to 0.017$m_\mathrm{e}$ is observed in the first 200ps after
injecting hot electrons. Measurement of electron effective mass in InSb as a
function of photo-injected electron density agrees well with conduction band
non-parabolicity predictions from ab initio calculations of the quasiparticle
band structure.

lexical diversity. We propose an unsupervised method named XCoref, which is a
CDCR method that capably resolves not only previously prevalent entities, such
as persons, e.g., ""Donald Trump,"" but also abstractly defined concepts, such as
groups of persons, ""caravan of immigrants,"" events and actions, e.g., ""marching

modeling counterfactual data distribution. Specifically, given an observed

are made available by the World Bank, we predict the maximum values of the
growth of GDP and trade, as well as the duration over which exponential growth
can be sustained. We set up the correlated growth of GDP and trade as the phase
solutions of an autonomous second-order dynamical system. GDP and trade are
related to each other by a power law, whose exponent seems to differentiate the
six national economies into two types. Under conducive conditions for economic
growth, our conclusions have general validity.

  Deep Learning",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite impressive accuracy, deep neural networks are often miscalibrated and
tend to overly confident predictions. Recent techniques like temperature
scaling (TS) and label smoothing (LS) show effectiveness in obtaining a
well-calibrated model by smoothing logits and hard labels with scalar factors,
respectively. However, the use of uniform TS or LS factor may not be optimal
for calibrating models trained on a long-tailed dataset where the model
produces overly confident probabilities for high-frequency classes. In this
study, we propose class-distribution-aware TS (CDA-TS) and LS (CDA-LS) by
incorporating class frequency information in model calibration in the context
of long-tailed distribution. In CDA-TS, the scalar temperature value is
replaced with the CDA temperature vector encoded with class frequency to
compensate for the over-confidence. Similarly, CDA-LS uses a vector smoothing
factor and flattens the hard labels according to their corresponding class
distribution. We also integrate CDA optimal temperature vector with
distillation loss, which reduces miscalibration in self-distillation (SD). We
empirically show that class-distribution-aware TS and LS can accommodate the
imbalanced data distribution yielding superior performance in both calibration
error and predictive accuracy. We also observe that SD with an extremely
imbalanced dataset is less effective in terms of calibration performance. Code

manifestation in 3D world understanding is an intuitive phenomenon. However, an
innate rigid calibration of binocular vision sensors is crucial for accurate
depth estimation. Alternatively, a monocular camera alleviates the limitation
at the expense of accuracy in estimating depth, and the challenge exacerbates
in harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, an optical sensor often fails to
acquire vital signals in harsh environments, and radar is used instead, which
gives coarse but more accurate signals. This work explores the utility of
coarse signals from radar when fused with fine-grained data from a monocular
camera for depth estimation in harsh environmental conditions. A variant of
feature pyramid network (FPN) extensively operates on fine-grained image
features at multiple scales with a fewer number of parameters. FPN feature maps
are fused with sparse radar features extracted with a Convolutional neural
network. The concatenated hierarchical features are used to predict the depth
with ordinal regression. We performed experiments on the nuScenes dataset, and
the proposed architecture stays on top in quantitative evaluations with reduced
parameters and faster inference. The depth estimation results suggest that the
proposed techniques can be used as an alternative to stereo depth estimation in

in a wireless Internet of things (IoT) network evading data collection cost in
terms of energy, time, and privacy. In this paper, for a FL setting, we model
the learning gain achieved by an IoT device against its participation cost as
its utility. The local model quality and the associated cost differs from
device to device due to the device-heterogeneity which could be time-varying.
We identify that this results in utility unfairness because the same global
model is shared among the devices. In the vanilla FL setting, the master is
unaware of devices' local model computation and transmission costs, thus it is
unable to address the utility unfairness problem. In addition, a device may
exploit this lack of knowledge at the master to intentionally reduce its
expenditure and thereby boost its utility. We propose to control the quality of
the global model shared with the devices, in each round, based on their
contribution and expenditure. This is achieved by employing differential
privacy to curtail global model divulgence based on the learning contribution.
Furthermore, we devise adaptive computation and transmission policies for each
device to control its expenditure in order to mitigate utility unfairness. Our
results show that the proposed scheme reduces the standard deviation of the
energy cost of devices by 99% in comparison to the benchmark scheme, while the
standard deviation of the training loss of devices varies around 0.103.

coupled with scalar matter are compared as classically-equivalent
reparametrisation-invariant versions of classical mechanics, but such that only
the latter admits a strict BV-BFV formulation. They are shown to be equivalent

better understand and discuss the game of baseball, with an entire discipline
of statistics dedicated to the craft, known as sabermetrics. At their core, all
sabermetrics seek to quantify some aspect of the game, often a specific aspect
of a player's skill set - such as a batter's ability to drive in runs (RBI) or
a pitcher's ability to keep batters from reaching base (WHIP). While useful,
such statistics are fundamentally limited by the fact that they are derived
from an account of what happened on the field, not how it happened. As a first
step towards alleviating this shortcoming, we present a novel, contrastive
learning-based framework for describing player form in the MLB. We use form to
refer to the way in which a player has impacted the course of play in their
recent appearances. Concretely, a player's form is described by a
72-dimensional vector. By comparing clusters of players resulting from our form
representations and those resulting from traditional abermetrics, we
demonstrate that our form representations contain information about how players
impact the course of play, not present in traditional, publicly available
statistics. We believe these embeddings could be utilized to predict both
in-game and game-level events, such as the result of an at-bat or the winner of
a game.

informally, actions played by non-team members (i.e., the opposing team or
nature) are either unknown to the entire team, or common knowledge within the
team -- then polynomial-time algorithms exist (Kaneko & Kline 1995). In this
paper, we devise a completely new algorithm for solving team games. It uses a
tree decomposition of the constraint system representing each team's strategy
to reduce the number and degree of constraints required for correctness
(tightness of the mathematical program). Our approach has the bags of the tree
decomposition correspond to team-public states. Our algorithm reduces the
problem of solving team games to a linear program with at most $O(NW^{w+1})$
nonzero entries in the constraint matrix, where $N$ is the size of the game
tree, $w$ is a parameter that depends on the amount of uncommon external
information, and $W$ is the treewidth of the tree decomposition. In
public-action games, our program size is bounded by the tighter $2^{O(nt)}N$
for teams of $n$ players with $t$ types each. Our algorithm is based on a new
way to write a custom, concise tree decomposition, and its fast run time does
not assume that the decomposition has small treewidth. Since our algorithm
describes the polytope of correlated strategies directly, we get equilibrium
finding in correlated strategies for free -- instead of, say, having to run a
double oracle algorithm. We show via experiments on a standard suite of games
that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on all benchmark game
classes except one.

solutions to the cosmological constant problem. In these models, the universe
undergoes a long period of inflation followed by a contraction and a bounce
that sets the stage for the hot big bang era. A requirement of any successful
early universe model is that it must reproduce the observed scale-invariant
density perturbations at CMB scales. While these class of models involve a long
period of inflation, the inflationary Hubble scale during their observationally
relevant stages is at or below the current Hubble scale, rendering the de
Sitter fluctuations too weak to seed the CMB anisotropies. We show that
sufficiently strong perturbations can still be sourced thermally if the
relaxion field serving as the inflaton interacts with a thermal bath, which can
be generated and maintained by the same interaction. We present a simple model
where the relaxion field is derivatively (i.e. technically naturally) coupled
to a non-abelian gauge sector, which gets excited tachyonically and
subsequently thermalizes due to its nonlinear self-interactions. This model
explains both the smallness of the cosmological constant and the amplitude of
CMB anisotropies.

field-of-views (FoVs) using a 2D sensor (detector) in a single snapshot,
achieving joint FoV and temporal compressive sensing, and thus enjoying the
advantages of low-bandwidth, low-power, and low-cost. However, it is
challenging for existing model-based decoding algorithms to reconstruct each
individual scene, which usually require exhaustive parameter tuning with
extremely long running time for large scale data. In this paper, we propose an
optical flow-aided recurrent neural network for dual video SCI systems, which
provides high-quality decoding in seconds. Firstly, we develop a diversity
amplification method to enlarge the differences between scenes of two FoVs, and
design a deep convolutional neural network with dual branches to separate
different scenes from the single measurement. Secondly, we integrate the
bidirectional optical flow extracted from adjacent frames with the recurrent
neural network to jointly reconstruct each video in a sequential manner.
Extensive results on both simulation and real data demonstrate the superior

graphs, although using ad-hoc approaches which in some cases do not generalize
to all input graphs. In the absence of a ubiquitous tool like the suffix tree
for labeled graphs, we introduce the labeled direct product of two graphs as a
general tool for obtaining optimal algorithms: we obtain conceptually simpler
algorithms for the quadratic problems of string matching (SMLG) and longest
common substring (LCSP) in labeled graphs. Our algorithms are also more
efficient, since they run in time linear in the size of the labeled product
graph, which may be smaller than quadratic for some inputs, and their run-time
is predictable, because the size of the labeled direct product graph can be
precomputed efficiently. We also solve LCSP on graphs containing cycles, which
was left as an open problem by Shimohira et al. in 2011. To show the power of
the labeled product graph, we also apply it to solve the matching statistics
(MSP) and the longest repeated string (LRSP) problems in labeled graphs.
Moreover, we show that our (worst-case quadratic) algorithms are also optimal,
conditioned on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis. Finally, we complete the

application to real data. The requirement for accurate labels forces us to
develop solutions using synthetic data, where labels are readily available.
However, synthetic data often do not capture the reality of the field/real
experiment, and we end up with poor performance of the trained neural network
(NN) at the inference stage. We describe a novel approach to enhance supervised
training on synthetic data with real data features (domain adaptation).
Specifically, for tasks in which the absolute values of the vertical axis (time
or depth) of the input data are not crucial, like classification, or can be
corrected afterward, like velocity model building using a well-log, we suggest
a series of linear operations on the input so the training and application data
have similar distributions. This is accomplished by applying two operations on
the input data to the NN model: 1) The crosscorrelation of the input data
(i.e., shot gather, seismic image, etc.) with a fixed reference trace from the
same dataset. 2) The convolution of the resulting data with the mean (or a
random sample) of the autocorrelated data from another domain. In the training
stage, the input data are from the synthetic domain and the auto-correlated
data are from the real domain, and random samples from real data are drawn at
every training epoch. In the inference/application stage, the input data are
from the real subset domain and the mean of the autocorrelated sections are
from the synthetic data subset domain. Example applications on passive seismic
data for microseismic event source location determination and active seismic
data for predicting low frequencies are used to demonstrate the power of this
approach in improving the applicability of trained models to real data.

optogenetically probe the animal's behavioral response to competing
mechanosensory stimuli in the the anterior and posterior soft touch receptor

anterior-posterior intensity combinations were measured. The animal's

depended on both the anterior and posterior stimulation intensity, while the
probability of reversing depended primarily on the posterior stimulation
intensity. We also probed the animal's response to mechanosensory stimulation
during the onset of turning, a relatively rare behavioral event, by delivering
stimuli automatically when the animal began to turn. Using this closed-loop

Cloud (SMC) by S-CUBED, a weekly X-ray/UV survey of the SMC by the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory. Observations show an approximately 3 month outburst from
Swift J011511.0-725611, the first detected by S-CUBED since it began in 2016
June. Swift J011511.0-725611 shows super-soft X-ray emission, indicative of a
White Dwarf compact object, which is further strengthened by the presence of an
0.871 keV edge, commonly attributed to O viii K-edge in the WD atmosphere.
Spectroscopy by SALT confirms the Be nature of the companion star, and long
term light-curve by OGLE finds both the signature of a circumstellar disk in
the system at outburst time, and the presence of a 17.4 day periodicity, likely
the orbital period of the system. Swift J011511.0-725611 is suggested to be
undergoing a Type-II outburst, similar to the previously reported SMC Be White
Dwarf binary (BeWD), Swift J004427.3-734801. It is likely that the rarity of
known BeWD is in part due to the difficulty in detecting such outbursts due to
both their rarity, and their relative faintness compared to outbursts in
Neutron Star BeXRBs.

spin 1 representation, namely the binary tetrahedral, binary octahedral and
binary icosahedral groups. In previous papers I have shown how the binary
tetrahedral group gives rise to all the necessary ingredients for a
non-relativistic model of quantum mechanics and elementary particles, and how a
modification of the binary octahedral group extends this to the ingredients of
a relativistic model. Here I investigate the possibility that the binary
icosahedral group might be related in a similar way to grand unified theories
such as the Georgi--Glashow model, the Pati--Salam model, various $E_8$ models
and perhaps even M-theory.
  This analysis suggests a possible way to combine the best parts of all these
models into a new model that goes further than any of them individually. The
key point is to separate the Dirac spinor into two separate concepts, one of
which is Lorentz-covariant, and the other Lorentz-invariant. This produces a
model which does not have a CPT-symmetry, and therefore supports an asymmetry
between particles and antiparticles. The Lagrangian has four terms, and there
is a gauge group GL(4,R) which permits the terms to be separated in an
arbitrary way, so that the model is generally covariant. Quantum gravity in
this model turns out to be described by quite a different gauge group, namely
SO(5), acting on a 5-dimensional space that behaves like a spin 2
representation after suitable symmetry-breaking. I then use this proposed model
to make a few predictions and postdictions, and compare the results with
experiment.

major cropped regions (in China, France, and the United States) we first
demonstrate that GEDI energy profiles are capable of reliably distinguishing
maize, a crop typically above 2m in height, from crops like rice and soybean
that are shorter. We further show that these GEDI profiles provide much more
invariant features across geographies compared to spectral and phenological
features detected by passive optical sensors. GEDI is able to distinguish maize
from other crops within each region with accuracies higher than 84%, and able
to transfer across regions with accuracies higher than 82% compared to 64% for
transfer of optical features. Finally, we show that GEDI profiles can be used
to generate training labels for models based on optical imagery from
Sentinel-2, thereby enabling the creation of 10m wall-to-wall maps of tall

to a generalization of qubits known as quregisters or as we call them here
qunits (quantum units of information analogous to qubits that use any natural
number n of basis states instead of 2 as qubits do). In this paper we will
first do a review of the theory behind some essential proofs of quantum gate
universality for qubit gates. After that we will show a new way of extending
those statements to arbitrary qutrit gates in an analogous manner.

  composites using fully convolutional network-based ultrasonic inversion",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ultrasonic methods have great potential applications to detect and
characterize defects in multi-layered bonded composites. However, it remains
challenging to quantitatively reconstruct defects, such as disbonds and kissing
bonds, that influence the integrity of adhesive bonds and seriously reduce the
strength of assemblies. In this work, an ultrasonic method based on the
supervised fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed to quantitatively
reconstruct defects hidden in multi-layered bonded composites. In the training
process of this method, an FCN establishes a non-linear mapping from measured
ultrasonic data to the corresponding velocity models of multi-layered bonded
composites. In the predicting process, the trained network obtained from the
training process is used to directly reconstruct the velocity models from the
new measured ultrasonic data of adhesively bonded composites. The presented
FCN-based inversion method can automatically extract useful features in
multi-layered composites. Although this method is computationally expensive in
the training process, the prediction itself in the online phase takes only
seconds. The numerical results show that the FCN-based ultrasonic inversion
method is capable to accurately reconstruct ultrasonic velocity models of the
high contrast defects, which has great potential for online detection of
adhesively bonded composites.

professional and college sports. We find that during the pandemic, the
moneyline betting markets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) became
very inefficient. During this period, if one bet uniformly on underdog teams in
the NBA, one could achieve a 16.7% profit margin. It is hypothesized that this
inefficiency is due to the absence of live audiences during the NBA games. Such
inefficiencies are not seen for any other sport. Much of the inefficiency comes
from a small fraction of games with moneyline odds in the 233 to 400 range. We
find that with clever strategies, one is able to achieve a 26-fold gain on an
initial investment by betting on NBA underdogs during this time period.

  tightly-coupled state Estimation and mapping package","Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this letter, we propose a novel LiDAR-Inertial-Visual sensor fusion
framework termed R3LIVE, which takes advantage of measurement of LiDAR,
inertial, and visual sensors to achieve robust and accurate state estimation.
R3LIVE is contained of two subsystems, the LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The LIO subsystem (FAST-LIO) takes advantage of
the measurement from LiDAR and inertial sensors and builds the geometry
structure of (i.e. the position of 3D points) global maps. The VIO subsystem
utilizes the data of visual-inertial sensors and renders the map's texture
(i.e. the color of 3D points). More specifically, the VIO subsystem fuses the
visual data directly and effectively by minimizing the frame-to-map photometric
error. The developed system R3LIVE is developed based on our previous work
R2LIVE, with careful architecture design and implementation. Experiment results
show that the resultant system achieves more robustness and higher accuracy in
state estimation than current counterparts (see our attached video).
  R3LIVE is a versatile and well-engineered system toward various possible
applications, which can not only serve as a SLAM system for real-time robotic
applications, but can also reconstruct the dense, precise, RGB-colored 3D maps
for applications like surveying and mapping. Moreover, to make R3LIVE more
extensible, we develop a series of offline utilities for reconstructing and
texturing meshes, which further minimizes the gap between R3LIVE and various of
3D applications such as simulators, video games and etc (see our demos video).
To share our findings and make contributions to the community, we open source
R3LIVE on our Github, including all of our codes, software utilities, and the
mechanical design of our device.

as diverse as nuclear resonances, neural networks and black hole evaporation.
Here we revisit an elegant argument by the British physicist Dennis Sciama,
which demonstrated that were our universe random, it would almost certainly
have a negligible chance for life. Under plausible assumptions, we show that a
random universe can masquerade as `intelligently designed,' with the
fundamental constants instead appearing to be fined tuned to achieve the
highest probability for life to occur. For our universe, this mechanism may
only require there to be around a dozen currently unknown fundamental
constants. More generally, this mechanism appears to be important for data
science analysis on constrained sets. Finally, we consider wider applications.

wireless sensor networks (WSN) to measure highly local phenomenon such as air
quality. The emergence of wireless sensor networks in locations without
available reference data makes calibrating such networks without the aid of
true values a key area of research. While deep learning (DL) has proved
successful on numerous other tasks, it is under-researched in the context of
blind WSN calibration, particularly in scenarios with networks that mix static
and mobile sensors. In this paper we investigate the use of DL architectures
for such scenarios, including the effects of weather in both drifting and
sensor measurement. New models are proposed and compared against a baseline,
based on a previous proposed model and extended to include mobile sensors and
weather data. Also, a procedure for generating simulated air quality data is
presented, including the emission, dispersion and measurement of the two most
common particulate matter pollutants: PM 2.5 and PM 10 . Results show that our
models reduce the calibration error with an order of magnitude compared to the
baseline, showing that DL is a suitable method for WSN calibration and that
these networks can be remotely calibrated with minimal cost for the deployer.
