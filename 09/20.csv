literature formulate it as a Sense-And-Avoid (SAA) problem and address it by
either developing new sensing capabilities or small form-factor processors.
However, the SAA, with the high-speed operation, remains an open problem. The
significant complexity arises due to the computational latency, which is
critical for fast-moving quadcopters. In this paper, a novel Fast Obstacle
Avoidance Motion (FOAM) algorithm is proposed to perform SAA operations. FOAM
is a low-latency perception-based algorithm that uses multi-sensor fusion of a
monocular camera and a 2-D LIDAR. A 2-D probabilistic occupancy map of the
sensing region is generated to estimate a free space for avoiding obstacles.
Also, a local planner is used to navigate the high-speed quadcopter towards a
given target location while avoiding obstacles. The performance evaluation of
FOAM is evaluated in simulated environments in Gazebo and AIRSIM. Real-time
implementation of the same has been presented in outdoor environments using a
custom-designed quadcopter operating at a speed of $4.5$ m/s. The FOAM
algorithm is implemented on a low-cost computing device to demonstrate its
efficacy. The results indicate that FOAM enables a small quadcopter to operate
at high speed in a cluttered environment efficiently.

the embedding layer of the pre-trained language model with the acoustic

result in the ejection of a few percents of a solar mass of matter expanding at
high speed in space. Being matter coming from the violent disruption of a
neutron star, these ejecta are initially very dense, hot and extremely rich in
neutrons. The few available protons form heavy nuclei (""seeds"") that absorb the
more abundant free neutrons, increasing their size. The neutron density is so
high that a substantial number of neutron captures occur before the resulting
unstable nuclei can decay toward more stable configurations, converting
neutrons into protons. Depending mostly on the initial neutron richness, this
mechanism leads to the formation of up to half of the heavy elements that we
observe in nature and it is called rapid neutron capture process
(""$r$-process""). The prediction of the precise composition of the ejecta
requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of very exotic nuclei, that
have never been produced in a laboratory. Despite having long been a
speculative scenario, nowadays several observational evidences point to compact
binary mergers as one of the major sites where heavy elements are formed in the
Universe. The most striking one was the detection of a kilonova following the
merger of a neutron star binary: the light emitted by this astronomical
transient is indeed powered by the radioactive decay of freshly synthesized

ignores, however, the ensemble properties at the model-fitting stage,
potentially resulting in a loss of efficiency. We therefore propose
$\textit{optimal ensemble construction}$, an $\textit{all-in-one}$ approach to
multi-study stacking whereby we jointly estimate ensemble weights as well as

end-to-end translation is prescribed. For isotropic Cosserat rods, certain
looping boundary value problems admit non-isolated families of critical points
of the energy due to an associated continuous symmetry. For the first time,
taking inspiration from (imaginary) path integral techniques, a quantum
mechanical probabilistic treatment of Goldstone modes in statistical rod
mechanics sheds light on J-factor computations for isotropic rods in the
semi-classical context. All the results are achieved exploiting appropriate
Jacobi fields arising from Gaussian path integrals, and show good agreement
when compared with intense Monte Carlo simulations for the target examples.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate two novel approaches for implementing an
all-optical neural nonlinear activation function based on utilising unique
light-matter interactions in 2D Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ (MXene) in the infrared (IR)
range in two configurations: 1) a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film,
and 2) a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer. These configurations
may serve as nonlinear units in photonic neural networks, while their nonlinear
transfer function can be flexibly designed to optimise the performance of
different neuromorphic tasks, depending on the operating wavelength. The
proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for
various applications without the need to modify the physical structure. We
confirm the capability and feasibility of the obtained results in
machine-learning applications via an Modified National Institute of Standards

constitute a major step towards the realization of all-optically implemented

we use additional data collected with VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NACO to assess the

derived from Gaia alone. We discover a new brown dwarf companion, TYC

DeepPoint, a deep learning model that generates 3D objects in point cloud
format that significantly outperforms the original 3DRIMR design. The model
adopts a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep neural
network architecture. It takes as input the 2D depth images of an object
generated by 3DRIMR's Stage 1, and outputs smooth and dense 3D point clouds of
the object. The model consists of a novel generator network that utilizes a
sequence of DeepPoint blocks or layers to extract essential features of the
union of multiple rough and sparse input point clouds of an object when
observed from various viewpoints, given that those input point clouds may
contain many incorrect points due to the imperfect generation process of
3DRIMR's Stage 1. The design of DeepPoint adopts a deep structure to capture
the global features of input point clouds, and it relies on an optimally chosen
number of DeepPoint blocks and skip connections to achieve performance
improvement over the original 3DRIMR design. Our experiments have demonstrated

under harsh environment, which will lead to unexpected breakdown of machinery
system and cause severe accidents. Deep learning methods recently have gained
growing interests and extensively applied in the data-driven bearing fault
diagnosis. However, current deep learning methods perform the bearing fault
diagnosis in the form of deterministic classification, which overlook the
uncertainties that inevitably exist in actual practice. To tackle this issue,
in this research we develop a probabilistic fault diagnosis framework that can
account for the uncertainty effect in prediction, which bears practical
significance. This framework fully leverages the probabilistic feature of
Gaussian process classifier (GPC). To facilitate the establishment of
high-fidelity GPC, the tailored feature extraction with dimensionality
reduction method can be optimally determined through the cross validation-based
grid search upon a prespecified method pool consisting of various kernel
principal component analysis (KPCA) methods and stacked autoencoder. This
strategy can ensure the complex nonlinear relations between the features and
faults to be adequately characterized. Furthermore, the sensor fusion concept
is adopted to enhance the diagnosis performance. As compared with the
traditional deep learning methods, this proposed framework usually requires
less labeled data and less effort for parameter tuning. Systematic case studies
using the publicly accessible experimental rolling bearing dataset are carried
out to validate this new framework. Various influencing factors on fault
diagnosis performance also are thoroughly investigated.

include social-circles awareness. We validate the prediction performance of
these circle-aware algorithms against several benchmarks (including their

whereby no human-annotated data is used anywhere during training and models are
trained purely on synthetic data. At the core of our framework is a novel

Specifically, inspired by the recent success of few-shot inference on GPT-3, we
present a training data creation procedure named Unsupervised Data Generation
(UDG), which leverages few-shot prompts to synthesize high-quality training
data without real human annotations. Our method enables zero-label learning as
we train task-specific models solely on the synthetic data, yet we achieve
better or comparable results from strong baseline models trained on
human-labeled data. Furthermore, when mixed with labeled data, our approach
serves as a highly effective data augmentation procedure, achieving new

at half filling, the on-site Coulomb repulsion, $U$, between up and down
electrons induces antiferromagnetic (AF) order and a Mott insulating phase. On
the other hand, for the SSH model, there is an AF phase when the
electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ is less than a critical value $\lambda_c$
and a bond order wave when $\lambda > \lambda_c$. In this work, we perform
numerical studies on the square lattice optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard

quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method which does not suffer from the fermionic sign
problem at half filling. We map out the phase diagram and find that it exhibits
a direct first-order transition between an antiferromagnetic phase and a
bond-ordered wave as $\lambda$ increases. The AF phase is characterized by two
different regions. At smaller $\lambda$ the behavior is similar to that of the
pure Hubbard model; the other region, while maintaining long range AF order,
exhibits larger kinetic energies and double occupancy, i.e. larger quantum
fluctuations, similar to the AF phase found in the pure SSH model.

sciences to explain non-equilibrium phenomena and to design efficient
stochastic algorithms. Our main goal in this thesis is to analyse their
dynamics by means of large deviation theory. We focus on processes that become
deterministic in a certain limit, and characterize their fluctuations around
that deterministic limit by Lagrangian rate functions. Our main techniques for
establishing these characterizations rely on the connection between large
deviations and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We sketch this connection with
examples in the introductory parts of this thesis.
  The second part of the thesis is devoted to irreversible processes that are
motivated from molecular motors, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and
stochastic slow-fast systems. We characterize the asymptotic dynamics of
molecular motors by Hamiltonians defined in terms of principal-eigenvalue
problems. From our results about the zig-zag sampler used in MCMCs, we learn
that maximal irreversibility corresponds to an optimal rate of convergence. In
stochastic slow-fast systems, our main theoretical contributions are techniques
to work with the variational formulas of Hamiltonians that one encounters in
mean-field systems coupled to fast diffusions.
  In the final part of the thesis, we study a family of Fokker-Planck equations
whose solutions become singular in a certain limit. The associated
gradient-flow structures do not converge since the relative entropies diverge
in the limit. To remedy this, we propose to work with a different variational
formulation that takes fluxes into account, which is motivated by density-flux
large deviations.

centroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule's
input is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives. The
centroid that comes from a cluster with a smaller variance is assigned a larger
weight in the weighted sum process. Compared with the state-of-the-art capsule
networks, the proposed capsule networks achieve the best accuracy on the
Fashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets with fewer parameters, and achieve the best
accuracy on the smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets with a moderate number of
parameters. The proposed capsule networks also produce capsules with
disentangled representation and generalize well to images captured at novel
viewpoints. The proposed capsule networks also preserve 2D spatial information
of an input image in the capsule channels: if the capsule channels are rotated,
the object reconstructed from these channels will be rotated by the same
transformation. Codes are available at

(r.e.) Turing degrees $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{T}}$, it is not known how one can
characterize the degrees $\mathbf{d}\in\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{T}}$ below which
$L$ can be bounded. Two important characterizations are of the $L_7$ and $M_3$
lattices, where the lattices are bounded below $\mathbf{d}$ if and only if
$\mathbf{d}$ contains sets of ``\emph{fickleness}'' $>\omega$ and
$\geq\omega^\omega$ respectively. We work towards finding a lattice that
characterizes the levels above $\omega^2$, the first non-trivial level after
$\omega$. We considered lattices that are as ``short'' and ``narrow'' as $L_7$
and $M_3$, but the lattices characterize also the $>\omega$ or
$\geq\omega^\omega$ levels, if the lattices are not already embeddable below
all non-zero r.e.\ degrees. We also considered upper semilattices (USLs) by
removing the bottom meet(s) of some previously considered lattices, but the
removals did not change the levels characterized. This leads us to conjecture
that a USL characterizes the same r.e.\ degrees as the lattice it is based on.
We discovered three lattices besides $M_3$ that also characterize the
$\geq\omega^\omega$-levels. Our search for a $>\omega^2$-candidate therefore
involves the lattice-theoretic problem of finding lattices that do not contain
any of the four $\geq\omega^\omega$-lattices as sublattices.

common but important tasks in not only basic sciences but also many practical
industries. We here propose a quantum variational (QuVa) PDE solver with the
aid of machine learning (ML) schemes to synergise two emerging technologies in
mathematically hard problems. The core quantum processing in this solver is to
calculate efficiently the expectation value of specially designed quantum
operators. For a large quantum system, we only obtain data from measurements of
few control qubits to avoid the exponential cost in the measurements of the
whole quantum system and optimise a pathway to find possible solution sets of
the desired PDEs using ML techniques. As an example, a few different types of
the second-order DEs are examined with randomly chosen samples and a regression
method is implemented to chase the best candidates of solution functions with
another trial samples. We demonstrated that a three-qubit system successfully
follows the pattern of analytical solutions of three different DEs with high
fidelity since the variational solutions are given by a necessary condition to
obtain the exact solution of the DEs. Thus, we believe that final solution
candidate sets are efficiently extracted from the QuVa PDE solver with the
support of ML techniques and this algorithm could be beneficial to search for
the solutions of complex mathematical problems as well as to find good ansatzs
for eigenstates in large quantum systems (e.g., for quantum chemistry).

proved very useful in a variety of applications. The main persistence tool from
TDA is persistent homology in which data structure is examined at many scales.
Representations of persistent homology include persistence barcodes and
persistence diagrams, both of which are not straightforward to reconcile with
traditional machine learning algorithms as they are sets of intervals or
multisets. The problem of faithfully representing barcodes and persistent
diagrams has been pursued along two main avenues: kernel methods and
vectorizations. One vectorization is the Betti sequence, or Betti curve,
derived from the persistence barcode. While the Betti sequence has been used in
classification problems in various applications, to our knowledge, the
stability of the sequence has never before been discussed. In this paper we
show that the Betti sequence is unstable under the 1-Wasserstein metric with
regards to small perturbations in the barcode from which it is calculated. In
addition, we propose a novel stabilized version of the Betti sequence based on
the Gaussian smoothing seen in the Stable Persistence Bag of Words for
persistent homology. We then introduce the normalized cumulative Betti sequence
and provide numerical examples that support the main statement of the paper.

spirit of random matrix theory, to model chaotic or disordered PT-symmetric
quantum systems, or their gain-loss-balanced classical analogs, in the phase of
broken PT-symmetry. The eigenvalues of pseudo-hermitian matrices are either

large matrix size $N$. As a concrete example, which is essentially an ensemble
of elements of the non-compact unitary Lie algebra, we choose a particularly
simple set of metrics, and compute the resulting resolvent and density of

complex eigenvalues, which occupy uniformly two two-dimensional blobs,
symmetric with respect to the real axis, as well as the complimentary fraction
of real eigenvalues, condensed in a finite segment, with a known non-uniform
density. The numbers of complex and real eigenvalues depend on the signature of
the metric, that is, the numbers of its positive and negative eigenvalues. We
have also carried thorough numerical analysis of the model for these particular

movement sleep and non-REMS. Although the mechanism of state transition is
unknown, it has been proposed that functional activation/deactivation among
different brain regions leads to such transition. As analysis of
electroencephalogram allows us exploring properties and association among brain
regions, we exploited it to address our query. We have recorded the frontal and
occipital cortical EEG from surgically prepared chronic freely moving, normally
behaving rats and classified their vigilance states and vigilance
state-transitions. The complexity analysis carried out by computing
multifractal spectrum width categorized VST as highly non-linear and complex
than their participating vigilance states. The EEG signals were decomposed into
frequency ranges as that of classical human Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma
oscillations. The dynamic network attributes of these oscillations has shown
compelling topological correlation between the frontal and occipital regions of
the brain during conscious states. The topological trends of the underlying
hierarchical network organization have been characterized by the percentage of
the hub and non-hub nodes, that further determines the global and local
connectivity trends. This has revealed interesting insights of functional
disconnection during NREMS due to decrease in their number of hub-nodes as
compared to waking state. There is also switching behaviour in the ratio of
hub/non-hub nodes between frontal and occipital region during NREMS-Wake and
Wake-NREMS transitions. Our findings provide support as proof-of-principle of
functional regional inactivation or activation of hub-nodes as the gradual
switching mechanism towards transitioning of cognitive states in a graded
manner, wake to sleep or vice versa; the detailed neuro-physio-chemical
mechanism needs further study.

measurements on suspended crystals, where we identify and eliminate crucial

strongly with thickness, yet (sub)nanometer thin TMD films exhibit a similar

($\sim$40~Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$). This is the result of compensating phonon
contributions, in particular low-frequency modes with a surprisingly long mean
free path of several micrometers that contribute significantly to thermal
transport for monolayers. We furthermore demonstrate that out-of-plane heat

Humeans, who think that laws merely describe the distribution of matter, and

on the proper formulations of physical theories. It is sometimes assumed that
the governing view requires a fundamental / intrinsic direction of time: to
govern, laws must be dynamical, producing later states of the world from
earlier ones, in accord with the fundamental direction of time in the universe.
In this paper, we propose a minimal primitivism about laws of nature (MinP)

constraining the physical possibilities. Our view captures the essence of the
governing view without taking on extraneous commitments about the direction of
time or dynamic production. Moreover, as a version of primitivism, our view
requires no reduction / analysis of laws in terms of universals, powers, or
dispositions. Our view accommodates several potential candidates for
fundamental laws, including the principle of least action, the Past Hypothesis,
the Einstein equation of general relativity, and even controversial examples
found in the Wheeler-Feynman theory of electrodynamics and retrocausal theories
of quantum mechanics. By understanding governing as constraining, non-Humeans
who accept MinP have the same freedom to contemplate a wide variety of

make properties -- like part-of-speech -- predictable. One suggests that a
representation encodes a property if probing that representation produces
higher accuracy than probing a baseline representation like non-contextual word
embeddings. Instead of using baselines as a point of comparison, we're
interested in measuring information that is contained in the representation but
not in the baseline. For example, current methods can detect when a
representation is more useful than the word identity (a baseline) for
predicting part-of-speech; however, they cannot detect when the representation
is predictive of just the aspects of part-of-speech not explainable by the word
identity. In this work, we extend a theory of usable information called
$\mathcal{V}$-information and propose conditional probing, which explicitly
conditions on the information in the baseline. In a case study, we find that
after conditioning on non-contextual word embeddings, properties like
part-of-speech are accessible at deeper layers of a network than previously
thought.

anti-electron-neutrinos with leptonic force, which is produced by the conserved
leptonic charge $g_\ell$ associated with Lee-Yang's $U_1$ gauge symmetry. Based
on particle-cosmology for early universe, the high energy neutrino (HEN) model
of dark matter assumes that the neutron decay processes, $n\to p^+ + e^-
+\ov{\nu}_e$, dominate the epoch after the creation, collision and confinement
processes of quarks and antiquarks in the beginning. The HEN model implies the
following results: There are almost equal numbers of electrons, protons and
anti-electron-neutrinos dominated the matter cosmos. There are unobservable and
ubiquitous anti-electron-neutrinos $\ov{\nu}_e$ with leptonic charge $g_\ell$
in the universe. Although the total mass of anti-electron-neutrino dark matter
is negligible in the universe, its enhanced gravitational and leptonic forces
could lead to the observed flat rotation curves due to relativistic
$\ov{\nu}_e$, whose static force involves a factor $E_\nu/m_\nu\approx 10^6$.
We estimate the leptonic charge to be $g_\ell \approx 7 \times 10^{-21}$. The
model predicts that the anti-electron-neutrino dark matter can interact with
cosmic-ray protons to produce positrons, i.e. $\ov{\nu}_e + p^+ \to e^+ +n$,
through weak interaction of the unified electroweak theory. The
anti-electron-neutrino dark matter sheds light on the Alpha Magnetic
Spectrometer (AMS) experiment, which has detected the intriguing excess of
cosmic-ray positrons over what is expected. The HEN model of dark matter
suggests an experimental test of the new Lee-Yang force between electrons by
using modern precision Cavendish experiment.

wholesale electricity markets in recent years. It provides opportunities for
market participants to arbitrage on the difference between the day-ahead market
locational marginal prices and the real-time market locational marginal prices.
Given the fact that convergence bids (CBs) have a significant impact on the
operation of electricity markets, it is important to understand how market
participants strategically select their CBs in real-world. We address this open
problem with focus on the electricity market that is operated by the California
ISO. In this regard, we use the publicly available electricity market data to
learn, characterize, and evaluate different types of convergence bidding
strategies that are currently used by market participants. Our analysis
includes developing a data-driven reverse engineering method that we apply to
three years of real-world data. Our analysis involves feature selection and
density-based data clustering. It results in identifying three main clusters of
CB strategies in the California ISO market. Different characteristics and the
performance of each cluster of strategies are analyzed. Interestingly, we
unmask a common real-world strategy that does not match any of the existing
strategic convergence bidding methods in the literature. Next, we build upon
the lessons learned from the existing real-world strategies to propose a new CB
strategy that can significantly outperform them. Our analysis includes
developing a new strategy for convergence bidding. The new strategy has three
steps: net profit maximization by capturing price spikes, dynamic node
labeling, and strategy selection algorithm. We show through case studies that
the annual net profit for the most lucrative market participants can increase
by over 40% if the proposed convergence bidding strategy is used.

students identifying as members of a racial/ethnic group underrepresented in
physics had higher final exam grades than their peers from the same concepts

found in each of the other three classes. After controlling for demonstrated
incoming understanding of calculus and Newtonian mechanics this demographic gap
in the concepts first class is found to differ from that of the other three

are widely applicable in various domains where data is sensitive, such as
large-scale medical image classification, internet-of-medical-things, and
cross-organization phishing email detection. SFL is developed on the confluence
point of FL and SL. It brings the best of FL and SL by providing parallel
client-side machine learning model updates from the FL paradigm and a higher
level of model privacy (while training) by splitting the model between the
clients and server coming from SL. However, SFL has communication and
computation overhead at the client-side due to the requirement of client-side
model synchronization. For the resource-constrained client-side, removal of
such requirements is required to gain efficiency in the learning. In this
regard, this paper studies SFL without client-side model synchronization. The
resulting architecture is known as Multi-head Split Learning. Our empirical
studies considering the ResNet18 model on MNIST data under IID data
distribution among distributed clients find that Multi-head Split Learning is
feasible. Its performance is comparable to the SFL. Moreover, SFL provides only
1%-2% better accuracy than Multi-head Split Learning on the MNIST test set. To
further strengthen our results, we study the Multi-head Split Learning with
various client-side model portions and its impact on the overall performance.
To this end, our results find a minimal impact on the overall performance of

observations. Adopting a `shift-and-stack' technique to boost the sensitivity
of the data, combined with a linear combination of the $Q$ and $U$ components
to account for their azimuthal dependence, we detect weak linear polarization
of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO line emission at a $\sim 10\sigma$ and $\sim

the two molecules between disk radii of 0.5"" and 1"". The sign of the
polarization was found to flip from the blue-shifted side of the emission to
the red-shifted side, suggesting a complex, asymmetric polarization morphology.
Polarization is not robustly detected for the CS emission; however, a tentative
signal, comparable in morphology to that found for the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO

reconstruct a polarization morphology, consistent with the azimuthally averaged
profiles, under the assumption that this is also azimuthally symmetric, which

technologies of production, and the composition of labor in an economy. The
paper constructs a Simple Closed Model, or an SCM, for short, for closed
economies, in which the consumption and the production parts are clearly
separated and yet coupled. The model is established as a specialization of the
Arrow-Debreu model and its equilibria correspond directly with those of the
general Arrow-Debreu model. The formulation allows us to identify the
combinatorial data which link parameters of the economic system with its
equilibria, in particular, the impact of consumer preferences on wages. The SCM
model also allows the formulation and explicit construction of the consumer
choice game, where expressed utilities of various labor classes serve as
strategies with total or relative wages as the pay-offs. We illustrate, through
examples, the mathematical details of the consumer choice game. We show that
consumer preferences, expressed through modified utility functions, do indeed
percolate through the economy, and influence not only prices but also
production and wages. Thus, consumer choice may serve as an effective tool for
wage redistribution.

with values from two other popular age catalogs which derive the ages using
different methods. Of these $\sim$4 million stars, we select a sample of 1.3
million stars and investigate their radial metallicity gradients (as determined
by orbital radii) as a function of their ages. This analysis is performed on
various subsets of the data split by chemistry and orbital parameters. We find
that commonly used selections for ``thin disk'' stars (such as low-$\alpha$
chemistry or vertically thin orbits) yield radial metallicity gradients which
generally grow shallower for the oldest stars. We interpret this as a hallmark
feature of radial migration (churning). Constraining our sample to very small
orbital Z$_{max}$ (the maximal height of a star's integrated orbit) makes this
trend most pronounced. A chemistry-based ``thin disk'' selection of
$\alpha$-poor stars displays the same trend, but to a lesser extent.
Intruigingly, we find that ``thick disk'' selections in chemistry and Z$_{max}$
reveal a slightly positive radial metallicity gradients which seem similar in
magnitude at all ages. This may imply that the thick disk population is well
mixed in age, but not in radius. This finding could help constrain conditions
during the early epochs of Milky Way formation, and shed light on processes
such as the accretion and reaccretion of gasses of different metallicities.

i.e. $593$ FRBs which mainly consist of the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment FRB catalog, and then derive constraints on the abundance of
PBHs from the null search result of lensing signature. For a monochromatic mass
distribution, the fraction of dark matter made up of PBHs could be constrained
to $\leq87\%$ for $\geq500~M_{\odot}$ at 95\% confidence level by assuming flux
ratio thresholds dependent signal-to-noise ratio for each FRB and that
apparently one-off events are intrinsic single bursts. This result would be
improved by a three times factor when a conventional constant flux ratio
threshold is considered. Moreover, we derive constraints on PBHs with a
log-normal mass function naturally predicted by some popular inflation models
and often investigated with gravitational wave detections. We find that, in
this mass distribution scenario, the constraint from currently public FRB
observations is relatively weaker than the one from gravitational wave
detections. It is foreseen that upcoming complementary multi-messenger
observations will yield considerable constraints on the possibilities of PBHs
in this intriguing mass window.

  Saturn-mass exoplanets with different densities around metal-rich stars",,,"10.1051/0004-6361/202141151",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the discovery of two new transiting extrasolar planet candidates
identified as TOI-1296.01 and TOI-1298.01 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). The planetary nature of these candidates has been secured
with the SOPHIE high-precision spectrograph through the measurement of the
companion's mass with the radial velocity method. Both planets are similar to
Saturn in mass and have similar orbital periods of a few days. They, however,
show discrepant radii and therefore different densities. The radius discrepancy
might be explained by the different levels of irradiation by the host stars.
The subgiant star TOI-1296 hosts a low-density planet with 1.2 RJup while the
less luminous, lower-size star TOI-1298 hosts a much denser planet with a 0.84
RJup radius, resulting in bulk densities of 0.198 and 0.743 g/cm3,
respectively. In addition, both stars are strongly enriched in heavy elements,
having metallicities of 0.44 and 0.49 dex, respectively. The planet masses and
orbital periods are 0.298 (0.039) MJup and 3.9443715 days for TOI-1296b, and
0.356 (0.032) MJup and 4.537164 days for TOI-1298b.

at large time horizon. In particular, we shall compare the shape solutions of a
dynamic shape optimization problem with that of a stationary problem and show
that the solution of the former approaches a neighborhood of that of the
latter. The convergence of domains is based on the $L^\infty$-topology of their
corresponding characteristic functions which is closed under the set of domains
satisfying the cone property. As a consequence, we show that the asymptotic
convergence of shape solutions for parabolic/elliptic problems is a particular
case of our analysis. Lastly, a numerical example is provided to show the
occurrence of the convergence of shape design solutions of time-dependent
problems with different values of the terminal time T to a shape design
solution of the stationary problem.

  20201124A","19 pages, 6 figures",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac4bc7",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The repeating FRB 20201124A was first discovered by CHIME/FRB in November of
2020, after which it was seen to repeat a few times over several months. It
entered a period of high activity in April of 2021, at which time several
observatories recorded tens to hundreds more bursts from the source. These
follow-up observations enabled precise localization and host galaxy
identification. In this paper, we report on the CHIME/FRB-detected bursts from
FRB 20201124A, including their best-fit morphologies, fluences, and arrival
times. The large exposure time of the CHIME/FRB telescope to the location of
this source allows us to constrain its rates of activity. We analyze the
repetition rates over different spans of time, constraining the rate prior to
discovery to $< 3.4$ day$^{-1}$ (at 3$\sigma$), and demonstrate significant
change in the event rate following initial detection. Lastly, we perform a
maximum-likelihood estimation of a power-law luminosity function, finding a
best-fit index $\alpha = -4.6 \pm 1.3 \pm 0.6$, with a break at a fluence
threshold of $F_{\rm min} \sim 16.6$~Jy~ms, consistent with the fluence
completeness limit of the observations. This index is consistent within
uncertainties with those of other repeating FRBs for which it has been
determined.

accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars with accurately measured spin frequencies
and orbital parameters, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The search algorithm uses a hidden Markov
model, where the transition probabilities allow the frequency to wander
according to an unbiased random walk, while the $\mathcal{J}$-statistic
maximum-likelihood matched filter tracks the binary orbital phase. Three narrow
sub-bands are searched for each target, centered on harmonics of the measured
spin frequency. The search yields 16 candidates, consistent with a false alarm
probability of 30% per sub-band and target searched. These candidates, along
with one candidate from an additional target-of-opportunity search done for SAX
J1808.4$-$3658, which was in outburst during one month of the observing run,
cannot be confidently associated with a known noise source. Additional
follow-up does not provide convincing evidence that any are a true
astrophysical signal. When all candidates are assumed non-astrophysical, upper
limits are set on the maximum wave strain detectable at 95% confidence,
$h_0^{95\%}$. The strictest constraint is $h_0^{95\%} = 4.7\times 10^{-26}$
from IGR J17062$-$6143. Constraints on the detectable wave strain from each
target lead to constraints on neutron star ellipticity and $r$-mode amplitude,
the strictest of which are $\epsilon^{95\%} = 3.1\times 10^{-7}$ and
$\alpha^{95\%} = 1.8\times 10^{-5}$ respectively. This analysis is the most
comprehensive and sensitive search of continuous gravitational waves from
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars to date.

and main sequence stars under the effect of tidal dissipation. The explored
range of stellar mass extends from 0.6 to 1.3 $M_{\odot}$. We apply recently
developed prescriptions which allow us to explore the orbital evolution over
the wide parameter space. Three types of tides are considered: equilibrium
tide, inertial waves, and gravity waves. We combine the results of our
simulations with the observed distribution of stellar and planetary parameters
to evaluate the infall rate of hot Jupiters in the Milky Way galaxy. In
particular, we find that, for 11 - 21% of the initial hot Jupiter population,
coalescence occurs before the host star's main sequence termination. If the
planet is massive enough, such an event can potentially be accompanied by a
powerful transient detectable with new facilities. Orbital decay by itself can
be observed through transit-timing variation. However, the obtained coalescence
rate in the Galaxy is too low (340 - 650 events per million years) to make
positive predictions about the observational possibility. Potentially
identifiable decaying systems formed by a star corresponding to a given mass
interval might be too rare to be detected with the modern space telescopes,
like TESS, within a 10-year baseline. At the same time, the forthcoming
missions, like PLATO, look more promising in this regard.

recent years, resulting in innovations like Industry 4.0 and smart environments
that provide improvements to efficiency, management of assets and facilitate
intelligent decision making. However, these benefits are offset by considerable
cybersecurity concerns that arise due to inherent vulnerabilities, which hinder
IoT-based systems' Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Security
vulnerabilities can be detected through the application of penetration testing,
and specifically, a subset of the information-gathering stage, known as
vulnerability identification. Yet, existing penetration testing solutions can
not discover zero-day vulnerabilities from IoT environments, due to the
diversity of generated data, hardware constraints, and environmental
complexity. Thus, it is imperative to develop effective penetration testing
solutions for the detection of vulnerabilities in smart IoT environments. In
this paper, we propose a deep learning-based penetration testing framework,
namely Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network-Enabled Vulnerability
Identification (LSTM-EVI). We utilize this framework through a novel
cybersecurity-oriented testbed, which is a smart airport-based testbed
comprised of both physical and virtual elements. The framework was evaluated
using this testbed and on real-time data sources. Our results revealed that the
proposed framework achieves about 99% detection accuracy for scanning attacks,
outperforming other four peer techniques.

achieve knowledge transfer across related tasks for performance improvement.
The application of Gaussian process (GP) in this scenario yields the
non-parametric yet informative Bayesian multi-task regression paradigm.
Multi-task GP (MTGP) provides not only the prediction mean but also the
associated prediction variance to quantify uncertainty, thus gaining popularity
in various scenarios. The linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is a
well-known MTGP paradigm which exploits the dependency of tasks through linear
combination of several independent and diverse GPs. The LMC however suffers
from high model complexity and limited model capability when handling
complicated multi-task cases. To this end, we develop the neural embedding of
coregionalization that transforms the latent GPs into a high-dimensional latent
space to induce rich yet diverse behaviors. Furthermore, we use advanced
variational inference as well as sparse approximation to devise a tight and
compact evidence lower bound (ELBO) for higher quality of scalable model
inference. Extensive numerical experiments have been conducted to verify the
higher prediction quality and better generalization of our model, named NSVLMC,
on various real-world multi-task datasets and the cross-fluid modeling of
unsteady fluidized bed.

development lifecycle. Effective software testing can provide benefits such as
bug finding, preventing regressions, and documentation. In terms of
documentation, unit tests express a unit's intended functionality, as conceived
by the developer. A test oracle, typically expressed as an condition, documents
the intended behavior of a unit under a given test prefix. Synthesizing a
functional test oracle is a challenging problem, as it must capture the
intended functionality rather than the implemented functionality.
  In this paper, we propose TOGA (a neural method for Test Oracle GenerAtion),
a unified transformer-based neural approach to infer both exceptional and
assertion test oracles based on the context of the focal method. Our approach
can handle units with ambiguous or missing documentation, and even units with a
missing implementation. We evaluate our approach on both oracle inference
accuracy and functional bug-finding. Our technique improves accuracy by 33\%
over existing oracle inference approaches, achieving 96\% overall accuracy on a
held out test dataset. Furthermore, we show that when integrated with a
automated test generation tool (EvoSuite), our approach finds 57 real world
bugs in large-scale Java programs, including 30 bugs that are not found by any
other automated testing method in our evaluation.

functions. While BO has been successfully applied to many scenarios, developing
effective BO algorithms that scale to functions with high-dimensional domains
is still a challenge. Optimizing such functions by vanilla BO is extremely
time-consuming. Alternative strategies for high-dimensional BO that are based
on the idea of embedding the high-dimensional space to the one with low
dimension are sensitive to the choice of the embedding dimension, which needs
to be pre-specified. We develop a new computationally efficient
high-dimensional BO method that exploits variable selection. Our method is able
to automatically learn axis-aligned sub-spaces, i.e. spaces containing selected
variables, without the demand of any pre-specified hyperparameters. We
theoretically analyze the computational complexity of our algorithm and derive
the regret bound. We empirically show the efficacy of our method on several
synthetic and real problems.

morphology was inferred from the polarized dust emission which is also directly
seen from the polarized CS emission across velocity, where the polarization
appears to be parallel to the field. By considering previous findings, the
field retains a pinched shape which can be traced to clump length-scales from
the envelope scales traced by ALMA, suggesting that the field is dynamically
important across multiple length-scales in this region. The CS total intensity
emission is found to be optically thick ($\tau_{\mathrm{CS}} = 32 \pm 12$)
while the C$^{33}$S emission appears to be optically thin
($\tau_{\mathrm{C^{33}S}} = 0.1 \pm 0.01$). This suggests that sources of
anisotropy other than large velocity gradients, i.e. anisotropies in the
radiation field are required to explain the polarized emission from CS seen by
ALMA. By using four variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique and the

studies on uterus segmentation mainly focused on developing semi-automatic
algorithms where require manual initialization to be done by an expert
clinician. Due to limited studies on the automatic 3D uterus segmentation, the
aim of the current study was to overcome the need for manual initialization in
the semi-automatic algorithms using the recent deep learning-based algorithms.
Therefore, we developed 2D UNet-based networks that are trained based on two
scenarios. In the first scenario, we trained 3 different networks on each plane
(i.e., sagittal, coronal, axial) individually. In the second scenario, our
proposed network was trained using all the planes of each 3D volume. Our
proposed schematic can overcome the initial manual selection of previous
semi-automatic algorithm.

the large fan-spine system. The eruption of the small filament was a failed
filament eruption, which did not cause any coronal mass ejection (CME) except
for three flare ribbons and two post-flare-loop systems connecting the three
magnetic polarities. The eruption of the large filament not only caused similar
post-flare-loop systems and flare ribbons as observed in the small filament
eruption, but also a large-scale CME. Based on our analysis results, we
conclude that the two successive filament eruptions were physically connected,

mobile robots. The map is the core component to achieve this. Most map
representations rely on drift-free state estimation and provide a global metric
map to navigate. However, in large-scale real-world applications, it's hard to
prohibit drifts and compose a globally consistent map quickly. In this paper, a
novel representation named, HiTMap, is proposed to enhance the existing map
representations. The central idea is to adopt a submap-based hierarchical
topology rather than a global metric map so that only a local metric map is
maintained for obstacle avoidance which ensures the lightweight of the
representation. To guide the robots navigate into unknown spaces, frontiers are
detected and attached to the map as an attribute. We also develop a path
planning module to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of our map
representation. The system is validated in a simulation environment and a
demonstration in the real world is conducted. In addition, the HiTMap is made

dense keypoint detector using unlabeled multiview images. A key challenge lies
in finding the exact correspondences between the dense keypoints in multiple
views since the inverse of keypoint mapping can be neither analytically derived
nor differentiated. This limits applying existing multiview supervision
approaches on sparse keypoint detection that rely on the exact correspondences.
To address this challenge, we derive a new probabilistic epipolar constraint
that encodes the two desired properties. (1) Soft correspondence: we define a
matchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other
image's corresponding point, thus relaxing the exact correspondences'
requirement. (2) Geometric consistency: every point in the continuous
correspondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. We
formulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of
epipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the
point-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. This
generalization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint
detection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images.
Additionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based
regularization by using a pretrained model. Finally, we design a new neural
network architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the
probabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view
images by building affinity matrices. Our method shows superior performance
compared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in
terms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3D reconstruction
accuracy.

larger than the sample size $n$. Under appropriate assumptions on $X$ and
$\sigma$, a deformed semicircle law emerges as $d_1/n\to\infty$ and
$n\to\infty$. We first prove this limiting law for generalized sample
covariance matrices with some dependency. To specify it for our neural network
model, we provide a nonlinear Hanson-Wright inequality that is suitable for
neural networks with random weights and Lipschitz activation functions. We also
demonstrate non-asymptotic concentrations of the empirical CK and NTK around
their limiting kernels in the spectral norm, along with lower bounds on their
smallest eigenvalues. As an application, we show that random feature regression
induced by the empirical kernel achieves the same asymptotic performance as its
limiting kernel regression under the ultra-wide regime. This allows us to
calculate the asymptotic training and test errors for random feature regression
using the corresponding kernel regression.

Considering the demands of efficient deep learning techniques running on

compact neural networks. Most of these works aim to slim down filters in
different ways, \eg,~investigating small, sparse or quantized filters. In
contrast, we treat filters from an additive perspective. A series of secondary
filters can be derived from a primary filter with the help of binary masks.
These secondary filters all inherit in the primary filter without occupying
more storage, but once been unfolded in computation they could significantly
enhance the capability of the filter by integrating information extracted from
different receptive fields. Besides spatial versatile filters, we additionally
investigate versatile filters from the channel perspective. Binary masks can be
further customized for different primary filters under orthogonal constraints.
We conduct theoretical analysis on network complexity and an efficient
convolution scheme is introduced. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
and neural networks demonstrate that our versatile filters are able to achieve
comparable accuracy as that of original filters, but require less memory and

the evolution of Yukawa coupling between $X$-state order parameter and nodal

fact-checking with online attention signals. The framework consists of: 1)
extracting claims from fact-checking efforts; 2) linking such claims with
knowledge graph entities; and 3) estimating the online attention these entities
receive. We use this framework to conduct a preliminary study of a dataset of
879 COVID-19-related fact-checks done in 2020 by 81 international
organizations. Our findings suggest that there is often a disconnect between
online attention and fact-checking efforts. For example, in around 40% of
countries that fact-checked ten or more claims, half or more than half of the
ten most popular claims were not fact-checked. Our analysis also shows that
claims are first fact-checked after receiving, on average, 35% of the total
online attention they would eventually receive in 2020. Yet, there is a
considerable variation among claims: some were fact-checked before receiving a
surge of misinformation-induced online attention; others are fact-checked much
later. Overall, our work suggests that the incorporation of online attention
signals may help organizations assess their fact-checking efforts and choose
what and when to fact-check claims or stories. Also, in the context of
international collaboration, where claims are fact-checked multiple times
across different countries, online attention could help organizations keep
track of which claims are ""migrating"" between countries.

revealed that each cationic layer composed of three-atom-thick Gd$-$O$-$Gd

interactions between the localized Gd 4$f$ spins through O 2$p$ orbitals.
Furthermore, the interlayer superexchange mediated by the hybridized Gd-5$d$
and interstitial-$s$-like states involves intimate couplings between the spin,
lattice, and charge degrees of freedom, thereby inducing simultaneous magnetic,
structural, and electronic phase transitions. The resulting ground state with
the simple hexagonal lattice hosts massless Dirac fermions protected by
nonsymmorphic magnetic symmetry, as well as massive Dirac fermions. We thus
demonstrate that the anionic excess electrons in Gd$_2$O play a crucial role in
the emergence of magnetic Dirac semimetal states, therefore offering an
intriguing interplay between 2D magnetic electrides and topological physics.

based on distributed estimation over a multi-agent network, where the agents
take partial system measurements susceptible to (possible) biasing attacks. In
particular, we assume that the system is not locally observable via the
measurements in the direct neighborhood of any agent. First, for performance
analysis in the attack-free case, we show that the proposed distributed
estimation is unbiased with bounded mean-square deviation in steady-state.
Then, we propose a residual-based strategy to locally detect possible attacks
at agents. In contrast to the deterministic thresholds in the literature
assuming an upper bound on the noise support, we define the thresholds on the
residuals in a probabilistic sense. After detecting and isolating the attacked
agent, a system-digraph-based mitigation strategy is proposed to replace the
attacked measurement with a new observationally-equivalent one to recover
potential observability loss. We adopt a graph-theoretic method to classify the
agents based on their measurements, to distinguish between the agents
recovering the system rank-deficiency and the ones recovering
output-connectivity of the system digraph. The attack detection/mitigation
strategy is specifically described for each type, which is of polynomial-order
complexity for large-scale applications. Illustrative simulations support our
theoretical results.

something difficult to achieve for solid state emitters at room temperature due
to thermal population of available spin states. Here, we demonstrate that a two
level emitter with a randomly polarized dipole moment can be made to emit
directionally into a circulating cavity if a separate emitter is chirally
coupled to the same cavity, for the case when both emitter-cavity couplings are
strong but in the bad-cavity regime. Our analysis of this system first
considers a transient scenario, which highlights the physical mechanism giving
rise to the directional emission of the two level emitter into the cavity. An
alternative setup involving a weak laser field continuously driving the system

we first introduce a quantization-aware channel estimator based on additive
quantization noise model (AQNM) and linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE)
estimate theory. Afterwards, by leveraging on the estimated channel state
information (CSI), we derive the asymptotic expressions of achievable uplink
spectral efficiency (SE) over spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels for
maximal ratio combining (MRC), quantization-aware multicell minimum
mean-squared error (QA-M-MMSE) combining, and quantization-aware single-cell
MMSE (QA-S-MMSE) combining, respectively. During the derivations, we consider
the effect of quantization errors and resort to random matrix theory to achieve
the asymptotic results. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our
theoretical analyses are correct and that the proposed quantization-aware
estimator and combiners are more beneficial than the quantization-unaware
counterparts. Besides, based on a generic power consumption model, it is shown
that low-resolution ADCs can obtain the best tradeoff between SE and energy

functions, e.g., incorporating the residual term from governing partial

accurate PINN model for many problems in practice. In this paper, we present a
novel perspective of the merits of learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs. By
analyzing behavior at model initialization, we first show that a PINN of
increasing expressiveness induces an initial bias around flat output functions.
Notably, this initial solution can be very close to satisfying many physics
PDEs, i.e., falling into a local minimum of the PINN loss that only minimizes
PDE residuals, while still being far from the true solution that jointly
minimizes PDE residuals and the initial and/or boundary conditions. It is
difficult for gradient descent optimization to escape from such a local minimum
trap, often causing the training to stall. We then prove that the sinusoidal
mapping of inputs, in an architecture we label as sf-PINN, is effective to
increase input gradient variability, thus avoiding being trapped in such
deceptive local minimum. The level of variability can be effectively modulated
to match high-frequency patterns in the problem at hand. A key facet of this
paper is the comprehensive empirical study that demonstrates the efficacy of
learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs for a wide range of forward and
inverse modelling problems spanning multiple physics domains.

the degree of departure from independence, symmetry or asymmetry are often
used. These measures in contingency tables are expressed as functions of the
probability structure of the tables. Hence, the value of a measure is
estimated. Plug-in estimators of measures with sample proportions are used to
estimate the measures, but without sufficient sample size, the bias and mean
squared error (MSE) of the estimators become large. This study proposes an
estimator that can reduce the bias and MSE, even without a sufficient sample
size, using the Bayesian estimators of cell probabilities. We asymptotically
evaluate the MSE of the estimator of the measure plugging in the posterior
means of the cell probabilities when the prior distribution of the cell
probabilities is the Dirichlet distribution. As a result, we can derive the
Dirichlet parameter that asymptotically minimizes the MSE of the estimator.
Numerical experiments show that the proposed estimator has a smaller bias and
MSE than the plug-in estimator with sample proportions, uniform prior, and
Jeffreys prior. Another advantage of our approach is the construction of
credible intervals for measures using Monte Carlo simulations.

relatively bright and moderately young early M dwarf ($J \approx$ 9.5 mag,
$\sim$600-800 Myr) in an equal-mass $\sim$8 arcsecond-wide binary system, using
data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), along with
follow-up transit observations. With an orbital period of 2.49 d, TOI-1201 b is
a warm mini-Neptune with a radius of $R_\mathrm{b} = 2.415\pm0.090 R_\oplus$.
This signal is also present in the precise radial velocity measurements from
CARMENES, confirming the existence of the planet and providing a planetary mass
of $M_\mathrm{b} = 6.28\pm0.88 M_\oplus$ and, thus, an estimated bulk density
of $2.45^{+0.48}_{-0.42}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The spectroscopic observations
additionally show evidence of a signal with a period of 19 d and a long
periodic variation of undetermined origin. In combination with ground-based
photometric monitoring from WASP-South and ASAS-SN, we attribute the 19 d
signal to the stellar rotation period ($P_{rot}=$ 19-23 d), although we cannot
rule out that the variation seen in photometry belongs to the visually close
binary companion. We calculate precise stellar parameters for both TOI-1201 and
its companion. The transiting planet is an excellent target for atmosphere
characterization (the transmission spectroscopy metric is $97^{+21}_{-16}$)
with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. It is also feasible to measure
its spin-orbit alignment via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect using current
state-of-the-art spectrographs with submeter per second radial velocity

encapsulation of self-replicating genetic entities into cellular units and the
aggregation of individual genes into a collectively replicating genome. In this
paper, we formulate a minimal model of the evolution of proto-chromosomes
within protocells. We model a simple protocell composed of two types of genes:
a ""fast gene"" with an advantage for gene-level self-replication and a ""slow
gene"" that replicates more slowly at the gene level, but which confers an
advantage for protocell-level reproduction. Protocell-level replication
capacity depends on cellular composition of fast and slow genes. We use a
partial differential equation to describe how the composition of genes within
protocells evolves over time under within-cell and between-cell competition. We
find that the gene-level advantage of fast replicators casts a long shadow on
the multilevel dynamics of protocell evolution: no level of between-protocell
competition can produce coexistence of the fast and slow replicators when the
two genes are equally needed for protocell-level reproduction. By introducing a
""dimer replicator"" consisting of a linked pair of the slow and fast genes, we
show analytically that coexistence between the two genes can be promoted in
pairwise multilevel competition between fast and dimer replicators, and provide
numerical evidence for coexistence in trimorphic competition between fast,
slow, and dimer replicators. Our results suggest that dimerization, or the
formation of a simple chromosome-like dimer replicator, can help to overcome
the shadow of lower-level selection and work in concert with deterministic
multilevel selection to allow for the coexistence of two genes that are
complementary at the protocell-level but compete at the level of individual
gene-level replication.

computationally intensive steps for incompressible fluid solvers. Lately, Deep
Learning, and especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has been
introduced to solve this equation, leading to significant inference time
reduction at the cost of a lack of guarantee on the accuracy of the solution.
This drawback might lead to inaccuracies and potentially unstable simulations.
It also makes impossible a fair assessment of the CNN speedup, for instance,
when changing the network architecture, since evaluated at different error
levels. To circumvent this issue, a hybrid strategy is developed, which couples
a CNN with a traditional iterative solver to ensure a user-defined accuracy
level. The CNN hybrid method is tested on two flow cases, consisting of a
variable-density plume with and without obstacles, demostrating remarkable
generalization capabilities, ensuring both the accuracy and stability of the
simulations. The error distribution of the predictions using several network
architectures is further investigated. Results show that the threshold of the
hybrid strategy defined as the mean divergence of the velocity field is
ensuring a consistent physical behavior of the CNN-based hybrid computational
strategy. This strategy allows a systematic evaluation of the CNN performance
at the same accuracy level for various network architectures. In particular,
the importance of incorporating multiple scales in the network architecture is
demonstrated, since improving both the accuracy and the inference performance
compared with feedforward CNN architectures, as these networks can provide

similarities between the vertices in an augmented graph by creating additional
vertices and edges as proposed in [1, 2]. The augmented graph is then embedded
in a Euclidean space associated to its Laplacian and we cluster vertices via a
modified K-means algorithm, using a new vector-valued distance in the embedding
space. Main novelty of our method, which can be classified as an early fusion
method, i.e., a method in which additional information on vertices are fused to
the structure information before applying clustering, is the interpretation of
attributes as new realizations of graph vertices, which can be dealt with as
coordinate vectors in a related Euclidean space. This allows us to extend a
scalable generalized spectral clustering procedure which substitutes graph
Laplacian eigenvectors with some vectors, named algebraically smooth vectors,
obtained by a linear-time complexity Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) method. We
discuss the performance of our proposed clustering method by comparison with
recent literature approaches and public available results. Extensive
experiments on different types of synthetic datasets and real-world attributed
graphs show that our new algorithm, embedding attributes information in the
clustering, outperforms structure-only-based methods, when the attributed
network has an ambiguous structure. Furthermore, our new method largely
outperforms the method which originally proposed the graph augmentation,
showing that our embedding strategy and vector-valued distance are very
effective in taking advantages from the augmented-graph representation.

learning tasks, deep learning methods can produce over-confident predictions,
particularly with limited training data. Therefore, quantifying uncertainty is
particularly important in critical applications such as lesion detection and
clinical diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in
determining surgical margins, disease status and appropriate treatment. In this
work, we propose a novel approach that uses quantile regression for quantifying
aleatoric uncertainty in both supervised and unsupervised lesion detection
problems. The resulting confidence intervals can be used for lesion detection
and segmentation. In the unsupervised setting, we combine quantile regression
with the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Here we address the problem of
quantifying uncertainty in the images that are reconstructed by the VAE as the
basis for principled outlier or lesion detection. The VAE models the output as
a conditionally independent Gaussian characterized by its mean and variance.
Unfortunately, joint optimization of both mean and variance in the VAE leads to
the well-known problem of shrinkage or underestimation of variance. Here we
describe an alternative Quantile-Regression VAE (QR-VAE) that avoids this
variance shrinkage problem by directly estimating conditional quantiles for the
input image. Using the estimated quantiles, we compute the conditional mean and
variance for the input image from which we then detect outliers by thresholding
at a false-discovery-rate corrected p-value. In the supervised setting, we
develop binary quantile regression (BQR) for the supervised lesion segmentation
task. We show how BQR can be used to capture uncertainty in lesion boundaries
in a manner that characterizes expert disagreement.

demand for accountability and performance measurement in science has shaped the
research culture in recent decades. Hypercompetition and publication pressure
are part of this neoliberal culture. How do scientists respond to these
pressures? Studies on research integrity and organizational culture suggest
that people who feel treated unfairly by their institution are more likely to
engage in deviant behaviour, such as scientific misconduct. By building up on
reflexive metrics, combined with studies on the influence of organisational
culture on research integrity, this study reflects on the research behaviour of
astronomers: 1) To what extent is research (mis-)behaviour reflexive, i.e.
dependent on perceptions of publication pressure and distributive &
organisational justice? 2) What impact does scientific misconduct have on
research quality? In order to perform this reflection, we conducted a
comprehensive survey of academic and non-academic astronomers worldwide and
received 3,509 responses. We found that publication pressure explains 10% of
the variance in occurrence of misconduct and between 7 and 13% of the variance
of the perception of distributive & organisational justice as well as
overcommitment to work. Our results on the perceived impact of scientific
misconduct on research quality show that the epistemic harm of questionable
research practices should not be underestimated. This suggests there is a need
for a policy change. In particular, lesser attention to metrics (such as
publication rate) in the allocation of grants, telescope time and institutional
rewards would foster better scientific conduct and hence research quality.

considerable semantic control over the (re-)generated images, they can only

Such 3D camera control is required for 3D virtual and mixed reality
applications. In our solution, we use a few images of a face to perform 3D
reconstruction, and we introduce the notion of the GAN camera manifold, the key
element allowing us to precisely define the range of images that the GAN can
reproduce in a stable manner. We train a small face-specific neural implicit
representation network to map a captured face to this manifold and complement
it with a warping scheme to obtain free-viewpoint novel-view synthesis. We show
how our approach - due to its precise camera control - enables the integration
of a pre-trained StyleGAN into standard 3D rendering pipelines, allowing e.g.,
stereo rendering or consistent insertion of faces in synthetic 3D environments.

conventional cell boundaries and serving users potentially by non-dominant

brings about a user-centric framework, with a two-step optimization process as

adjustable bandwidth allocation per beam, and tested against different
techniques for payloads with flexible radio resource allocation. Numerical
results are obtained for various non-uniform traffic distributions to evaluate
the performance of the solutions. The traffic profile across beams is shaped by
the Dirichlet distribution, which can be conveniently parameterized, and makes
simulations easily reproducible. Even with ideal conditions for the power
allocation, both flexible beam-user mapping and adjustable power allocation
similarly enhance the flexible assignment of the bandwidth on average. Results
show that a smart pairing of users and beams provides significant advantages in
highly asymmetric demand scenarios, with improvements up to 10\% and 30\% in
terms of the offered and the minimum user rates, respectively, in hot-spot like
cases with no impact on the user equipment.

visualizing feature maps and filter weights, which are not very intuitive for

FilTag, an approach to effectively explain CNNs even to non-experts. The idea
is that when images of a class frequently activate a convolutional filter, then
that filter is tagged with that class. These tags provide an explanation to a
reference of a class-specific feature detected by the filter. Based on the
tagging, individual image classifications can then be intuitively explained in

machine learning models, self-supervised learning has yet to be studied from a
purely multi-agent perspective. In this work, we propose that aligning internal
subjective representations, which naturally arise in a multi-agent setup where
agents receive partial observations of the same underlying environmental state,
can lead to more data-efficient representations. We propose that multi-agent
environments, where agents do not have access to the observations of others but
can communicate within a limited range, guarantees a common context that can be
leveraged in individual representation learning. The reason is that subjective
observations necessarily refer to the same subset of the underlying
environmental states and that communication about these states can freely offer
a supervised signal. To highlight the importance of communication, we refer to
our setting as \textit{socially supervised representation learning}. We present
a minimal architecture comprised of a population of autoencoders, where we
define loss functions, capturing different aspects of effective communication,
and examine their effect on the learned representations. We show that our
proposed architecture allows the emergence of aligned representations. The
subjectivity introduced by presenting agents with distinct perspectives of the
environment state contributes to learning abstract representations that
outperform those learned by a single autoencoder and a population of
autoencoders, presented with identical perspectives of the environment state.
Altogether, our results demonstrate how communication from subjective
perspectives can lead to the acquisition of more abstract representations in
multi-agent systems, opening promising perspectives for future research at the
intersection of representation learning and emergent communication.

training samples. Although impressive performance could be achieved, they have
difficulties generalizing to the original full-scale images due to the scale
gap, which makes them lack of practicability. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised generative adversarial framework that learns from the full-scale

modality-specific features from the PAN and MS images with a two-stream

the cycle-consistency and adversarial scheme to improve the performance.
Comparison experiments with the state-of-the-art methods are conducted on

and bio-inspiration. TSS hand is in a compact size, exerts larger workspace,
and achieves comparable dexterity compared to human hand. The soft wrist is
capable of agile omnidirectional bending with adjustable stiffness. The
terminal soft gripper is effective for disposable swab pinch and replacement.
The OP sampling force is easy to be maintained in a safe and comfortable range
(throat sampling comfortable region) under a hybrid motion and stiffness
virtual fixture-based controller. A dedicated 3 DOFs RCM platform is used for
TSS hand global positioning. Design, modeling, and control of the TSS hand are
discussed in detail with dedicated experimental validations. A sampling test
based on human tele-operation is processed on the oral cavity model with
excellent success rate. The proposed TOOS robot demonstrates a highly promising

OP swab sampling.

find that the oscillatory shear flows respect the Cox-Merz rule at large

steady shear and higher shear jamming packing fractions. However, unlike the
isotropic cases (i.e., discs and spheres), frictionless ellipses get
dynamically arrested in their initial orientational configuration at small
oscillatory strains. We illustrate this by starting at two different
configurations with different nematic order parameters and the average
orientation of the particles. Surprisingly, the overall orientation in the
frictionless case is uncoupled to the rheological response close to jamming,
and the rheology is only controlled by the average number of contacts and the
oscillatory strain. Having larger oscillatory strains or adding friction does,
however, help the system escape these orientational arrested states, which are
evolving to a disordered state independent of the initial configuration at low
strains and ordered ones at large strains.

different statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach
the problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior

have been developed and applied to images or videos from different
applications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,
that the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as
dynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is
not completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,
i.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural

methods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.
Furthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by
deep learning, e.g.\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground

high quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we

decomposition (POD)-based reduced-order model (ROM) of turbulent flow around a
finite wall-mounted square cylinder. The proposed model is suitable for
turbulent wake control applications because it can predict the dynamics of the
main features of the flow field without computing Navier-Stokes equations. Long
short-term memory neural network (LSTM NN) and bidirectional long short-term
memory neural network (BLSTM NN) are used to predict the temporal evolution of
the POD time coefficients at different planes along the height of the obstacle.
The improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES) is performed to generate
the training datasets. Transfer learning (TL) approach is utilized in the
training process by using the weights of the LSTM/BLSTM NN that are used to
predict the POD time coefficients of the planes at lower elevations to
initialize the weights of the networks at higher elevations along the height of
the obstacle. The use of TL results in a remarkable improvement in the
capability of the LSTM/BLSTM NN prediction compared with the one when the
network is initialized with random weights. BLSTM NN shows better results
compared with LSTM NN in terms of training and prediction error, indicating
that the BLSTM-POD model is more suitable to be used as a ROM for predicting
the turbulent wake. Furthermore, the temporal behavior of the time coefficients
is carefully examined using the phase space plots and Poincar$\acute{e}$
sections. The results of using different lengths of the prediction time window
showed that the prediction error of the POD time coefficients increases as the
prediction time window increases and the error increasing rate decreases with
the ranking of the POD time coefficients.

high-performing face recognition models. The recent state-of-the-art face
recognition solutions proposed to incorporate a fixed penalty margin on
commonly used classification loss function, softmax loss, in the normalized
hypersphere to increase the discriminative power of face recognition models, by
minimizing the intra-class variation and maximizing the inter-class variation.
Marginal penalty softmax losses, such as ArcFace and CosFace, assume that the
geodesic distance between and within the different identities can be equally
learned using a fixed penalty margin. However, such a learning objective is not
realistic for real data with inconsistent inter-and intra-class variation,
which might limit the discriminative and generalizability of the face
recognition model. In this paper, we relax the fixed penalty margin constrain
by proposing elastic penalty margin loss (ElasticFace) that allows flexibility
in the push for class separability. The main idea is to utilize random margin
values drawn from a normal distribution in each training iteration. This aims
at giving the decision boundary chances to extract and retract to allow space
for flexible class separability learning. We demonstrate the superiority of our
ElasticFace loss over ArcFace and CosFace losses, using the same geometric
transformation, on a large set of mainstream benchmarks. From a wider
perspective, our ElasticFace has advanced the state-of-the-art face recognition

trained all our models on a large dataset of clinical CMR studies obtained from
two NHS hospitals (n=4,228) and evaluated them against two external datasets:
ACDC (n=100) and M&Ms (n=321). Using manual segmentations as a reference, CMR
slices were assigned to one of four regions: non-cardiac, base, middle, and

(1) non-uniform batch sampling, which allows us to choose how often images from

explain a prediction, but they are applied after a GNN has already been
trained. Here, we propose a meta-learning framework for improving the level of
explainability of a GNN directly at training time, by steering the optimization
procedure towards what we call `interpretable minima'. Our framework (called
MATE, MetA-Train to Explain) jointly trains a model to solve the original task,
e.g., node classification, and to provide easily processable outputs for
downstream algorithms that explain the model's decisions in a human-friendly
way. In particular, we meta-train the model's parameters to quickly minimize
the error of an instance-level GNNExplainer trained on-the-fly on randomly
sampled nodes. The final internal representation relies upon a set of features
that can be `better' understood by an explanation algorithm, e.g., another
instance of GNNExplainer. Our model-agnostic approach can improve the
explanations produced for different GNN architectures and use any
instance-based explainer to drive this process. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets for node and graph classification show that we can produce
models that are consistently easier to explain by different algorithms.
Furthermore, this increase in explainability comes at no cost for the accuracy
of the model.

excellent approximation power and generalization ability. Recently, Extended
PINNs (XPINNs) based on domain decomposition methods have attracted
considerable attention due to their effectiveness in modeling multiscale and
multiphysics problems and their parallelization. However, theoretical
understanding on their convergence and generalization properties remains
unexplored. In this study, we take an initial step towards understanding how
and when XPINNs outperform PINNs. Specifically, for general multi-layer PINNs
and XPINNs, we first provide a prior generalization bound via the complexity of
the target functions in the PDE problem, and a posterior generalization bound
via the posterior matrix norms of the networks after optimization. Moreover,
based on our bounds, we analyze the conditions under which XPINNs improve
generalization. Concretely, our theory shows that the key building block of
XPINN, namely the domain decomposition, introduces a tradeoff for
generalization. On the one hand, XPINNs decompose the complex PDE solution into
several simple parts, which decreases the complexity needed to learn each part
and boosts generalization. On the other hand, decomposition leads to less
training data being available in each subdomain, and hence such model is
typically prone to overfitting and may become less generalizable. Empirically,
we choose five PDEs to show when XPINNs perform better than, similar to, or
worse than PINNs, hence demonstrating and justifying our new theory.

symmetric mean-force potential, usage of classic free energies and pair
correlation functions, linear mixing rule and so on. In general, a good
agreement with earlier results from the thermonuclear limit to $\Gamma \sim
100$ is found. For a very strongly coupled liquid $100 \lesssim \Gamma \leq
175$, a deviation from currently used parametrisations of the reaction rates is
discovered and approximated by a simple analytic expression. The developed
method of nuclear reaction rate calculations with account of plasma screening
can be extended to ion mixtures and crystallised phases of stellar matter.

safety-critical and high-stake decision-making, where the fairness of
algorithms is of paramount importance. Fairness in ML centers on detecting bias
towards certain demographic populations induced by an ML classifier and
proposes algorithmic solutions to mitigate the bias with respect to different
fairness definitions. To this end, several fairness verifiers have been
proposed that compute the bias in the prediction of an ML
classifier--essentially beyond a finite dataset--given the probability
distribution of input features. In the context of verifying linear classifiers,
existing fairness verifiers are limited by accuracy due to imprecise modeling
of correlations among features and scalability due to restrictive formulations
of the classifiers as SSAT/SMT formulas or by sampling.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient fairness verifier, called FVGM, that
encodes the correlations among features as a Bayesian network. In contrast to
existing verifiers, FVGM proposes a stochastic subset-sum based approach for
verifying linear classifiers. Experimentally, we show that FVGM leads to an
accurate and scalable assessment for more diverse families of
fairness-enhancing algorithms, fairness attacks, and group/causal fairness
metrics than the state-of-the-art fairness verifiers. We also demonstrate that
FVGM facilitates the computation of fairness influence functions as a stepping
stone to detect the source of bias induced by subsets of features.

what -- and an interface to that ledger so that users of your money can
transact. On the Tezos blockchain this implies: a smart contract (distributed
program), storing in its state a ledger to map owner addresses to token
quantities, and standardised entrypoints to transact on accounts.
  A bank does a similar job -- it maps account numbers to account quantities
and permits users to transact -- but in return the bank demands trust, it
incurs expense to maintain a centralised server and staff, it uses a
proprietary interface ... and it may speculate using your money and/or display
rent-seeking behaviour. A blockchain ledger is by design decentralised,
inexpensive, open, and it won't just bet your tokens on risky derivatives
(unless you ask).
  The FA1.2 standard is an open standard for ledger-keeping smart contracts on
the Tezos blockchain. Several FA1.2 implementations already exist.
  Or do they? Is the standard sensible and complete? Are the implementations
correct? And what are they implementations \emph{of}? The FA1.2 standard is
written in English, a specification language favoured by wet human brains but
notorious for its incompleteness and ambiguity when rendered into dry and
unforgiving code.
  In this paper we report on a formalisation of the FA1.2 standard as a Coq
specification, and on a formal verification of three FA1.2-compliant smart
contracts with respect to that specification. Errors were found and ambiguities
were resolved; but also, there now exists a \emph{mathematically precise} and
battle-tested specification of the FA1.2 ledger standard.
  We will describe FA1.2 itself, outline the structure of the Coq theories --
which in itself captures some non-trivial and novel design decisions of the
development -- and review the detailed verification of the implementations.

  Lattice-based algorithms are promising replacements for conventional schemes,
with BLISS being one of the earliest post-quantum signature schemes in this

demonstrated to be a risk for the security of BLISS, since implementing
Gaussian sampling both efficient and secure with respect to physical attacks is
highly challenging.
  This paper presents three related power side-channel attacks on GALACTICS,
the latest constant-time implementation of BLISS. All attacks are based on
leakages we identified in the Gaussian sampling and signing algorithm of
GALACTICS.
  To run the attack, a profiling phase on a device identical to the device
under attack is required to train machine learning classifiers.
  In the attack phase, the leakages of GALACTICS enable the trained classifiers
to predict sensitive internal information with high accuracy, paving the road
for three different key recovery attacks.
  We demonstrate the leakages by running GALACTICS on a Cortex-M4 and provide
proof-of-concept data and implementation for all our attacks.

challenging task than weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Compared
to WSSS, WSIS requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to
extract from image-level labels. To tackle the problem, most WSIS approaches
use off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance
or object level labels, deviating the fundamental definition of the
fully-image-level supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach including two innovative components. First, we propose a semantic
knowledge transfer to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the
knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf
proposals. Second, we propose a self-refinement method to refine the pseudo
instance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for
training in an online manner. Here, we discover an erroneous phenomenon,
semantic drift, that occurred by the missing instances in pseudo instance
labels categorized as background class. This semantic drift occurs confusion
between background and instance in training and consequently degrades the
segmentation performance. We term this problem as semantic drift problem and
show that our proposed self-refinement method eliminates the semantic drift
problem. The extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve a considerable performance

and Land Cover (LULC) classification, chosen as an Earth Observation (EO) use
case, and tested on the EuroSAT dataset used as reference benchmark. The
results of the multiclass classification prove the effectiveness of the
presented approach, by demonstrating that the QCNN performances are higher than
the classical counterparts. Moreover, investigation of various quantum circuits
shows that the ones exploiting quantum entanglement achieve the best
classification scores. This study underlines the potentialities of applying
quantum computing to an EO case study and provides the theoretical and
experimental background for futures investigations.

on amplitude modulation. This is done numerically with a direct numerical
simulation (DNS) of a channel flow at friction Reynolds number $Re_{\tau} =
1000$ in a minimal stream-wise unit (MSU). The amplitude-modulation map of such
DNS is also compared to the one of a regular channel flow in a longer
streamwise domain (LSD), in order to assess its validity for this study. The
cheaper MSU is found to provide a good representation of the modulation
phenomena in the LSD. As for conditional averages, the amplitude-modulation
coefficient is conditioned on the sign of the large-scale fluctuations. Care
must be exerted in defining such a coefficient, as the conditioned large-scale
fluctuation has non-zero average, indeed as a consequence of conditioning. Both
sweeps and ejections (positive and negative large-scale fluctuation events) are
found to have a positive contribution to amplitude modulation in the buffer
layer, and a negative one in the outer layer. The negative-modulation region is
found to shrink in case of ejections, so that the positive-modulation region
extends farther away from the wall. Two more conditional statistics are used to
provide an alternative representation of amplitude modulation and insights into
the characteristics of the large-scale structures.

we improved the current evolutionary clustering algorithm star (ECA*), called

it to multivariate and domain-theory datasets; (iii) using iECA* for real-world

were conducted to examine the performance of iECA* against state-of-the-art

statistical benchmarking, and performance ranking framework). The results
demonstrate three primary findings. First, iECA* was more effective than other
algorithms in grouping the chosen medical disease datasets according to the

plausible values, which might be used as covariates or predictors or in order
to provide individual scores for the Bayesian latent variables. Previous
simulation studies ascertained the validity of the plausible values by the mean
squared difference of the plausible values and the generating factor scores.
However, the generating factor scores are unknown in empirical studies so that
an indicator that is solely based on model parameters is needed in order to
evaluate the validity of factor score estimates in empirical studies. The
coefficient of determinacy is based on model parameters and can be computed
whenever Bayesian factor analysis is performed in empirical settings.
Therefore, the central aim of the present simulation study was to compare the
coefficient of determinacy based on model parameters with the correlation of
mean plausible values with the generating factors. It was found that the
coefficient of determinacy yields an acceptable estimate for the validity of
mean plausible values. As for small sample sizes and a small salient loading
size the coefficient of determinacy overestimates the validity, it is
recommended to report the coefficient of determinacy together with a
bias-correction in order to estimate the validity of mean plausible values in
empirical settings.

the motivation is to implement a hardware-efficient deep network: a

bottleneck block, GhostSA, that converts all multiplications in the block to
cheap operations. The bottleneck uses an appropriate number of bit-shift
filters to process intrinsic feature maps, then applies a series of
transformations that consist of bit-wise shifts with addition operations to
generate more feature maps that fully learn to capture information underlying
intrinsic features. We schedule the number of bit-shift and addition operations
for different hardware platforms. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation
studies with desktop and embedded (Jetson Nano) devices for implementation and
measurements. We demonstrate the proposed GhostSA block can replace bottleneck
blocks in the backbone of state-of-the-art networks architectures and gives
improved performance on image classification benchmarks. Further, our
GhostShiftAddNet can achieve higher classification accuracy with fewer FLOPs

challenges such as a sparse solution space, conflicting objectives, and
computationally expensive PPA estimation impede the application of common
optimization heuristics. We show how the memory system optimization problem can
be solved through computational intelligence. We apply a Pareto-based
Differential Evolution to ensure unbiased optimization of multiple PPA
objectives. To ensure efficient exploration of a sparse solution space, we
repair individuals to yield feasible parameterizations. PPA is estimated
efficiently in large batches by pre-trained regression neural networks. Our

recently computed the surface area of a Schwarzschild black hole's apparent
horizon, perturbed by an orbiting body, to second order in the binary's mass
ratio. In this paper, we take that as the starting point for a comprehensive
study of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole's apparent and event horizon at
second perturbative order, deriving generic formulas for the first- and
second-order corrections to the horizons' radial profiles, surface areas,
Hawking masses, and intrinsic curvatures. We find that the two horizons are
remarkably similar, and that any teleological behavior of the event horizon is
suppressed in several ways. Critically, we establish that at all orders, the
perturbed event horizon in a small-mass-ratio binary is effectively localized
in time. Even more pointedly, the event horizon is identical to the apparent
horizon at linear order regardless of the source of perturbation, implying that
the seemingly teleological ""tidal lead"", previously observed in linearly
perturbed event horizons, is not genuinely teleological in origin. The two
horizons do generically differ at second order, but their Hawking masses remain
identical, implying that the event horizon obeys the same energy-flux balance
law as the apparent horizon. At least in the case of a binary system, the
difference between their surface areas remains extremely small even in the late
stages of inspiral. In the course of our analysis, we also numerically
illustrate puzzling behaviour in the black hole's motion around the binary's
center of mass.

most popular approaches for parametric count regression. In the Bayesian
context, however, there are no sufficient specific computational tools for
efficient sampling from the posterior distribution of parameters, and standard
algorithms, such as random walk Metropolis-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
algorithms, are typically used. Herein, we developed an efficient
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and importance sampler to simulate from the
posterior distribution of the parameters of Poisson log-linear models under
conditional Gaussian priors with superior performance with respect to the
state-of-the-art alternatives. The key for both algorithms is the introduction
of a proposal density based on a Gaussian approximation of the posterior
distribution of parameters. Specifically, our result leverages the negative
binomial approximation of the Poisson likelihood and the successful
P\'olya-gamma data augmentation scheme. Via simulation, we obtained that the
time per independent sample of the proposed samplers is competitive with that
obtained using the successful Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, with the
Metropolis-Hastings showing superior performance in all scenarios considered.

decays of $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda V ~(V=\phi, \rho^0, \omega, K^{*0})$. The
eigenstates of the T-odd operators are obtained along with definite angular
momenta. We obtain the T-odd spin correlations from the complex phases among
the helicity amplitudes. We give the angular distributions of $\Lambda_b \to
\Lambda(\to p \pi^-)V(\to PP')$ and show the corresponding spin correlations,
where $P^{(\prime)}$ are the pseudoscalar mesons. Due to the helicity
conservation of the $s$ quark in $\Lambda$, we deduce that the polarization
asymmetries of $\Lambda$ are close to $-1$. Since the decay of $\Lambda_b \to
\Lambda \phi$ in the standard model~(SM) is dictated by the single weak phase
from the product of CKM elements, $V_{tb}V_{ts}^*$, the true T and CP
asymmetries are suppressed, providing a clean background to test the SM and
search for new physics. In the factorization approach, as the helicity
amplitudes in the SM share the same complex phase, T-violating effects are
absent. Nonetheless, the experimental branching ratio of $Br(\Lambda_b \to
\Lambda \phi) = (5.18\pm 1.29 )\times 10^{-6}$ suggests that the
nonfactorizable effects or some new physics play an important role. By
parametrizing the nonfactorizable contributions with the effective color
number, we calculate the branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries. We also
explore the possible T-violating effects from new physics.

module is to a large degree a manual task. Automating this process could
increase the use of static architecture conformance checking methods, such as
reflexion modeling, in industry. Current techniques rely on user
parameterization and a highly cohesive design. A machine learning approach
would potentially require fewer parameters and better use of the available
information to aid in automatic mapping. Aim: We investigate how a classifier
can be trained to map from source code to architecture modules automatically.
This classifier is trained with semantic and syntactic dependency information
extracted from the source code and from architecture descriptions. The
classifier is implemented using multinomial naive Bayes and evaluated. Method:
We perform experiments and compare the classifier with three state-of-the-art
mapping functions in eight open-source Java systems with known
ground-truth-mappings. Results: We find that the classifier outperforms the
state-of-the-art in all cases and that it provides a useful baseline for
further research in the area of semi-automatic incremental clustering.
Conclusions: We conclude that machine learning is a useful approach that
performs better and with less need for parameterization compared to other
approaches. Future work includes investigating problematic mappings and a more
diverse set of subject systems.

Since the strain couples to the electrons in the system as a pseudo vector
potential, which has opposite signs for the $K$ and $K'$ valleys of graphene,
its effects on the two valleys with opposite Chern numbers do not cancel out,
but adds up. As a result, some components of the piezoelectric tensor in these
systems, which typically have non-trivial topology in their flat bands, are
nearly quantized in terms of the valley Chern numbers. Such a conclusion is
verified by numerical calculations of the in-plane piezoelectric response of
hBN-aligned twisted bilayer graphene, twisted bilayer-monolayer graphene, and
twisted double bilayer graphene systems using both continuum model and
atomistic tight-binding model. We find that by tuning the vertical displacement
field and/or twist angle, which may induce gap closures between the flat bands
and remote bands in these systems, plateau shapes of the piezoelectric response
are obtained, with abrupt jumps across the topological phase transitions. We
propose that such nearly quantized piezoelectric response may serve as a direct
experimental probe for the valley Chern numbers of the flat bands in moir\'e

believe and spread misinformation. This study attempts to answer {\it who}
constitutes the population vulnerable to the online misinformation in the
pandemic, and what are the robust features and short-term behavior signals that
distinguish susceptible users from others. Using a 6-month longitudinal user
panel on Twitter collected from a geopolitically diverse network-stratified
samples in the US, we distinguish different types of users, ranging from social
bots to humans with various level of engagement with COVID-related
misinformation. We then identify users' online features and situational
predictors that correlate with their susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation.
This work brings unique contributions: First, contrary to the prior studies on
bot influence, our analysis shows that social bots' contribution to
misinformation sharing was surprisingly low, and human-like users'
misinformation behaviors exhibit heterogeneity and temporal variability. While
the sharing of misinformation was highly concentrated, the risk of occasionally
sharing misinformation for average users remained alarmingly high. Second, our
findings highlight the political sensitivity activeness and responsiveness to
emotionally-charged content among susceptible users. Third, we demonstrate a
feasible solution to efficiently predict users' transient susceptibility solely
based on their short-term news consumption and exposure from their networks.
Our work has an implication in designing effective intervention mechanism to

an Al$_2$O$_3$ layer, the HZO demonstrates a remanent polarization (2Pr) of

nucleation produces a film with 2Pr of 10.81 $\mu C/cm^2$, but a lower coercive
field over the stack and switching enduring over subsequent cycles. Magnetic
hysteresis measurements taken before and after ALD deposition show strong
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), with only slight deviations in the
magnetic coercive fields due to the HZO deposition process, thus pointing to a
good preservation of the single-layer Gr. X-ray diffraction measurements
further confirm that the high-quality interfaces demonstrated in the stack
remain unperturbed by the ferroelectric deposition and anneal.

identification to estimate the impulse response of a linear system. Adopting
the Bayesian viewpoint, the impulse response is modeled as a zero mean Gaussian
process whose covariance function (kernel) is estimated from the data. The most
popular kernels used in system identification are the tuned-correlated (TC),
the diagonal-correlated (DC) and the stable spline (SS) kernel. TC and DC
kernels admit a closed form factorization of the inverse. The SS kernel induces
more smoothness than TC and DC on the estimated impulse response, however, the
aforementioned property does not hold in this case. In this paper we propose a
second-order extension of the TC and DC kernel which induces more smoothness
than TC and DC, respectively, on the impulse response and a
generalized-correlated kernel which incorporates the TC and DC kernels and
their second order extensions. Moreover, these generalizations admit a closed
form factorization of the inverse and thus they allow to design efficient
algorithms for the search of the optimal kernel hyperparameters. We also show
how to use this idea to develop higher oder extensions. Interestingly, these
new kernels belong to the family of the so called exponentially convex local
stationary kernels: such a property allows to immediately analyze the frequency
properties induced on the estimated impulse response by these kernels.

building assets earlier costs more. These pathways also see a faster ramp-up of

0.5)\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is rescaled to reflect a 3:1 ortho-para
ratio, resulting in a total column density, $N_{\rm tot}$, of $(8.4\pm
0.7)\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We calculate a disk-average rotational
temperature, $T_{\rm{rot}}$ = $40 \pm 5$ K, while a radially resolved analysis
shows that $T_{\rm{rot}}$ remains relatively constant across the radius of the
disk. This high rotation temperature suggests that in a static disk and if
vertical mixing can be neglected,CH$_2$CN is largely formed through gas-phase
reactions in the upper layers of the disk, rather than solid-state reactions on
the surface of grains in the disk midplane. The integrated intensity radial
profiles show a ring structure consistent with molecules such as CN and DCN. We
note that this is also consistent with previous lower-resolution observations
of centrally peaked CH$_3$CN emission towards the TW Hya disks, since the
observed emission gap disappears when convolving our observations with a larger
beam size. We obtain a CH$_2$CN/CH$_3$CN ratio ranging between 4 and 10. This
high CH$_2$CN/CH$_3$CN is reproduced in a representative chemical model of the
TW Hya disk that employs standard static disk chemistry model assumptions, i.e.
without any additional tuning.

is viewed as an individual agent whose phenotypic state is modelled by a
discrete variable. For tumour cells this variable represents a parameterisation
of the antigen expression profiles, while for CTLs it represents a
parameterisation of the target antigens of T-cell receptors (TCRs). We formally
derive the deterministic continuum limit of this individual-based model, which
comprises a non-local partial differential equation for the phenotype
distribution of tumour cells coupled with an integro-differential equation for
the phenotype distribution of CTLs. The biologically relevant homogeneous
steady-state solutions of the continuum model equations are found. The
linear-stability analysis of these steady-state solutions is then carried out
in order to identify possible conditions on the model parameters that may lead
to different outcomes of immune competition and to the emergence of patterns of
phenotypic coevolution between tumour cells and CTLs. We report on
computational results of the individual-based model, and show that there is a
good agreement between them and analytical and numerical results of the
continuum model. These results shed light on the way in which different
parameters affect the coevolutionary dynamics between tumour cells and CTLs.
Moreover, they support the idea that TCR-tumour antigen binding affinity may be
a good intervention target for immunotherapy and offer a theoretical basis for
the development of anti-cancer therapy aiming at engineering TCRs so as to
shape their affinity for cancer targets.

fixed by symmetries and depend on the particular cosmology. For generic biased
tracers, where number/mass and momentum conservation cannot be imposed in
general, this number rises to seven in agreement with other bias expansions
discussed in the literature. A crucial role in our analysis is provided by
extended Galilean invariance, which follows from diffeomorphism invariance in
the non-relativistic limit. We identify a full hierarchy of extended Galilean
invariance constraints, which fix the analytic structure of the perturbation

Our approach is especially relevant for non-standard models that respect the

Update: revised version",,,,"cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Holonomic functions play an essential role in Computer Algebra since they
allow the application of many symbolic algorithms. Among all algorithmic
attempts to find formulas for power series, the holonomic property remains the
most important requirement to be satisfied by the function under consideration.
The targeted functions mainly summarize that of meromorphic functions. However,
expressions like $\tan(z)$, $z/(\exp(z)-1)$, $\sec(z)$, etc., particularly,
reciprocals, quotients and compositions of holonomic functions, are generally
not holonomic. Therefore their power series are inaccessible by the holonomic
framework. From the mathematical dictionaries, one can observe that most of the
known closed-form formulas of non-holonomic power series involve another
sequence whose evaluation depends on some finite summations. In the case of
$\tan(z)$ and $\sec(z)$ the corresponding sequences are the Bernoulli and Euler
numbers, respectively. Thus providing a symbolic approach that yields complete
representations when linear summations for power series coefficients of
non-holonomic functions appear, might be seen as a step forward towards the
representation of non-holonomic power series.
  By adapting the method of ansatz with undetermined coefficients, we build an
algorithm that computes least-order quadratic differential equations with
polynomial coefficients for a large class of non-holonomic functions. A
differential equation resulting from this procedure is converted into a
recurrence equation by applying the Cauchy product formula and rewriting powers
into polynomials and derivatives into shifts. Finally, using enough initial
values we are able to give normal form representations to characterize several
non-holonomic power series and prove non-trivial identities. We discuss this
algorithm and its implementation for Maple 2022.

edge of the gap induced by a planet in a protoplanetary disk, and a ring
structure with a high dust-to-gas ratio can be formed. Such a ring has been
thought to be located right outside of the planet orbit. We examined the
evolution of the dust ring formed by a migrating planet, by performing
two-fluid (gas and dust) hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the initial
dust ring does not follow the migrating planet and remains at the initial
location of the planet in the cases with a low viscosity of $\alpha \sim
10^{-4}$. The initial ring is gradually deformed by viscous diffusion, and a
new ring is formed in the vicinity of the migrating planet, which developes
from the trap of the dust grains leaking from the initial ring. During this
phase, two rings co-exist outside the planet orbit. This phase can continue
over $\sim 1$~Myr for a planet migrating from 100~au. After the initial ring
disappears, only the later ring remains. This change in the ring morphology can
provide clues as to when and where the planet was formed, and is the footprint
of the planet. We also carried out simulations with a mass-growing planet.
These simulations show more complex asymmetric structures in the dust rings.
The observed asymmetric structures in the protoplanetary disks may be related

decay to a lepton and a right-handed neutrino (RHN). If the neutrino masses are
generated through the standard type-I seesaw mechanism, the Yukawa couplings
controlling two-body decays of the RHN become very small. As a result, the RHN
decays to another lepton and a pair of jets via an off-shell $W'$. This is the
basis of the Keung-Senjanovi\'{c} (KS) process, which was originally proposed
as a probe of lepton number violation at the LHC. However, if a different
mechanism like the inverse seesaw generates the neutrino masses, a TeV-scale
RHN can have large Yukawa couplings and hence dominantly decay to a lepton and
a $W$ boson, leading to a kinematically different process from the KS one. We
investigate the prospect of this unexplored process as a probe of the inverse

Intelligence (AI) development: the lack of ethics and interpretability of AI
decisions. Can interpretable AI decisions help to address ethics in AI? Using a
randomized study, we experimentally show that the empirical and liberal turn of
the production of explanations tends to select AI explanations with a low
denunciatory power. Under certain conditions, interpretability tools are
therefore not means but, paradoxically, obstacles to the production of ethical
AI since they can give the illusion of being sensitive to ethical incidents. We
also show that the denunciatory power of AI explanations is highly dependent on
the context in which the explanation takes place, such as the gender or
education level of the person to whom the explication is intended for. AI
ethics tools are therefore sometimes too flexible and self-regulation through
the liberal production of explanations do not seem to be enough to address
ethical issues. We then propose two scenarios for the future development of
ethical AI: more external regulation or more liberalization of AI explanations.
These two opposite paths will play a major role on the future development of
ethical AI.

systems aim to predict user's preferred items from millions of candidates by
analyzing observed user-item relations. As for alleviating the sparsity and
cold start problems encountered by recommender systems, researchers resort to
employing side information or knowledge in recommendation as a strategy for
uncovering hidden (indirect) user-item relations, aiming to enrich observed
information (or data) for recommendation. However, in the face of the high
complexity and large scale of side information and knowledge, this strategy
relies for efficient implementation on the scalability of recommendation
models. Not until after the prevalence of machine learning did graph embedding
techniques be a concentration, which can efficiently utilize complex and
large-scale data. In light of that, equipping recommender systems with graph
embedding techniques has been widely studied these years, appearing to
outperform conventional recommendation implemented directly based on graph
topological analysis. As the focus, this article retrospects graph
embedding-based recommendation from embedding techniques for bipartite graphs,
general graphs and knowledge graphs, and proposes a general design pipeline of
that. In addition, after comparing several representative graph embedding-based
recommendation models with the most common-used conventional recommendation
models on simulations, this article manifests that the conventional models can
overall outperform the graph embedding-based ones in predicting implicit
user-item interactions, revealing the comparative weakness of graph
embedding-based recommendation in these tasks. To foster future research, this
article proposes suggestions on making a trade-off between graph
embedding-based recommendation and conventional recommendation in different
tasks, and puts forward open questions.

discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision process. At each decision epoch,
given current inventory of items, an agent chooses in which patterns to cut
objects in stock in anticipation of the unknown demand. An optimal solution
corresponds to a policy that associates each state with a decision and
minimizes the expected total cost. Since exact algorithms scale exponentially
with the state-space dimension, we develop a heuristic solution approach based
on reinforcement learning. We propose an approximate policy iteration algorithm
in which we apply a linear model to approximate the action-value function of a
policy. Policy evaluation is performed by solving the projected Bellman
equation from a sample of state transitions, decisions and costs obtained by
simulation. Due to the large decision space, policy improvement is performed
via the cross-entropy method. Computational experiments are carried out with
the use of realistic data to illustrate the application of the algorithm.
Heuristic policies obtained with polynomial and Fourier basis functions are
compared with myopic and random policies. Results indicate the possibility of
obtaining policies capable of adequately controlling inventories with an
average cost up to 80% lower than the cost obtained by a myopic policy.

improved the resource utilization and provided a graphical user interface (UI),

carefully crafting a functional permitting to estimate jointly, in a single

This functional also enforces epidemiology-driven regularity properties for the
reproduction number estimates, while preserving convexity, thus permitting the
design of efficient minimization algorithms, based on proximity operators that

However, with the iterative updating of model parameters, the models would tend
to reach a coupled state and eventually lose the ability to exploit unlabeled

model based on parameter decoupling strategy to encourage consistent
predictions from diverse views. Specifically, we first adopt a two-branch

cosine distance to construct different views in latent space. Based on this,
the feature extractor is constrained to encourage the consistency of
probability maps generated by classifiers under diversified features. In the
overall training process, the parameters of feature extractor and classifiers
are updated alternately by consistency regularization operation and decoupling
operation to gradually improve the generalization performance of the model. Our
method has achieved a competitive result over the state-of-the-art

unexpected and possibly dangerous situations, termed corner cases (CC). Since
many modules of automated driving systems are based on machine learning (ML),
CC are an essential part of the data for their development. However, there is
only a limited amount of CC data in large-scale data collections, which makes
them challenging in the context of ML. With a better understanding of CC,
offline applications, e.g., dataset analysis, and online methods, e.g.,
improved performance of automated driving systems, can be improved. While there
are knowledge-based descriptions and taxonomies for CC, there is little
research on machine-interpretable descriptions. In this extended abstract, we
will give a brief overview of the challenges and goals of such a description.

that are small, unclear or have blurry edges. In this work, we attempt to
address this problem on two fronts. First, we propose a Fine Context-aware
Shadow Detection Network (FCSD-Net), where we constraint the receptive field
size and focus on low-level features to learn fine context features better.
Second, we propose a new learning strategy, called Restore to Detect (R2D),
where we show that when a deep neural network is trained for restoration
(shadow removal), it learns meaningful features to delineate the shadow masks
as well. To make use of this complementary nature of shadow detection and
removal tasks, we train an auxiliary network for shadow removal and propose a
complementary feature learning block (CFL) to learn and fuse meaningful
features from shadow removal network to the shadow detection network. We train
the proposed network, FCSD-Net, using the R2D learning strategy across multiple
datasets. Experimental results on three public shadow detection datasets (ISTD,
SBU and UCF) show that our method improves the shadow detection performance

reconstruction problems using bilevel formulations. Image reconstruction
typically involves optimizing a cost function to recover a vector of unknown
variables that agrees with collected measurements and prior assumptions.
State-of-the-art image reconstruction methods learn these prior assumptions
from training data using various machine learning techniques, such as bilevel
methods. One can view the bilevel problem as formalizing hyperparameter
optimization, as bridging machine learning and cost function based optimization
methods, or as a method to learn variables best suited to a specific task. More
formally, bilevel problems attempt to minimize an upper-level loss function,
where variables in the upper-level loss function are themselves minimizers of a
lower-level cost function.
  This review contains a running example problem of learning tuning parameters
and the coefficients for sparsifying filters used in a regularizer. Such
filters generalize the popular total variation regularization method, and
learned filters are closely related to convolutional neural networks approaches
that are rapidly gaining in popularity. Here, the lower-level problem is to
reconstruct an image using a regularizer with learned sparsifying filters; the
corresponding upper-level optimization problem involves a measure of
reconstructed image quality based on training data. This review discusses
multiple perspectives to motivate the use of bilevel methods and to make them
more easily accessible to different audiences. We then turn to ways to optimize
the bilevel problem, providing pros and cons of the variety of proposed
approaches. Finally we overview bilevel applications in image reconstruction.

plotted as a function of the incident 8um flux. A mask of the region with 8um
flux >100 MJy/sr was created and clumps were categorized based on the extent of
overlap with the mask into ""mostly inside"" , ""partly inside'"", & ""outside"". The
surface mass density distribution of each of these populations were plotted.
This was followed by comparing the G305 clumps with the Galactic average taken
from the ATLASGAL and CHIMPS clumps. Finally, the cumulative distribution
functions (CDF) of the clump masses in G305 and their L/M ratios were compared
to that of the Galactic sample. The surface mass densities of clumps showed a
positive correlation with the incident 8um flux. The data did not have
sufficient velocity resolution to discern the effects of feedback on the
linewidths of the clumps. The sub-sample of clumps named ""mostly inside"" had
the highest surface mass densities followed by ""partly inside"" and ""outside""
sub-samples. These differences between the three sub-samples were shown to be
statistically significant using the KS test. The ""mostly inside"" sample also
showed the highest level of fragmentation compared to the other two. These
prove that the clumps inside the G305 region are triggered. The G305 clump
population is also statistically different from the Galactic average population
rejecting redistribution as a likely consequence of feedback. The CDFs of clump
masses and their L/M ratios are both flatter than the Galactic average,
indicating that feedback in G305 has triggered star formation. The collect and
collapse method is the dominant mechanism at play in G305.

Previous lyric-to-melody generation systems usually adopt end-to-end models
that directly generate melodies from lyrics, which suffer from several issues:
1) lack of paired lyric-melody training data; 2) lack of control on generated
melodies. In this paper, we develop TeleMelody, a two-stage lyric-to-melody
generation system with music template (e.g., tonality, chord progression,
rhythm pattern, and cadence) to bridge the gap between lyrics and melodies
(i.e., the system consists of a lyric-to-template module and a
template-to-melody module). TeleMelody has two advantages. First, it is data
efficient. The template-to-melody module is trained in a self-supervised way
(i.e., the source template is extracted from the target melody) that does not
need any lyric-melody paired data. The lyric-to-template module is made up of
some rules and a lyric-to-rhythm model, which is trained with paired
lyric-rhythm data that is easier to obtain than paired lyric-melody data.
Second, it is controllable. The design of template ensures that the generated
melodies can be controlled by adjusting the musical elements in template. Both
subjective and objective experimental evaluations demonstrate that TeleMelody
generates melodies with higher quality, better controllability, and less
requirement on paired lyric-melody data than previous generation systems.

potentially improves the readability of the current chart, but may also
disorient the user. In contrast to static visualizations, where there is
considerable literature to help choose the appropriate y-axis scale, there is a
lack of guidance about how and when rescaling should be used in dynamic
visualizations. Existing visualization systems and libraries adapt a fixed
global y-axis, or rescale every time the data changes. Yet, professional
visualizations, such as in data journalism, do not adopt either strategy. They
instead carefully and manually choose when to rescale based on the analysis
task and data. To this end, we conduct a series of Mechanical Turk experiments
to study the potential of dynamic axis rescaling and the factors that affect
its effectiveness. We find that the appropriate rescaling policy is both task-

investigate two scenarios based on the IR antennas' cooperation ability. First,
we assume that the IR receive and transmit antennas can coordinate with each

received signals of all receive antennas, and we derive an achievable DoF for
this model. In our interference alignment scheme, we divide receivers into two
groups, called clean and dirty receivers. We design our scheme such that a part
of the message of clean receivers can be demultiplexed at the IR. Thus, the IR
can use these message streams for interference cancelation at the clean
receivers. Next, we consider an IR, whose antennas do not have coordination
with each other, where the transmitted signal of each transmit antenna only
depends on the received signal of its corresponding receive antenna, and we
derive an achievable DoF for it. We show that the achievable DoF decreases
considerably compared with the coordinated case. In both of these models, our

However, a precise description of the evolution of charge radii along an
isotopic chain is highly nontrivial, as reinforced by recent experimental
measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which combines a
three-parameter formula and a Bayesian neural network. We find that the novel
approach can describe the charge radii of all $A\ge40$ and $Z\ge20$ nuclei with
a root-mean-square deviation about 0.015 fm. In particular, the charge radii of
the calcium isotopic chain are reproduced very well, including the parabolic
behavior and strong odd-even staggerings. We further test the approach for the
potassium isotopes and show that it can describe well the experimental data
within uncertainties.

high degree, and typically retrieved from 3D point-cloud data. However,
accurate 3D point-cloud data might not be available in all applications. Recent
advancements in machine learning enabled robust object recognition and semantic

sparse LiDAR mainly in a manner of time-consuming iterative post-processing,
our model fuses monocular image features and sparse LiDAR features to predict
initial depth maps. Then, an efficient feed-forward refine network is further
designed to correct the errors in these initial depth maps in pseudo-3D space
with real-time performance. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model
significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, as
well as the sparse-LiDAR-based methods on both self-supervised monocular depth
prediction and completion tasks. With the accurate dense depth prediction, our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art sparse-LiDAR-based method

privacy constraints. This is a rising challenge in modern statistics, as the
achievement of confidentiality guarantees, which typically occurs through
suitable perturbations of the data, may determine a loss in the statistical
utility of the data. In this paper, we consider privacy-protecting tests for
goodness-of-fit in frequency tables, this being arguably the most common form
of releasing data, and present a rigorous analysis of the large sample
behaviour of a private likelihood-ratio (LR) test. Under the framework of
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy for perturbed data, our main
contribution is the power analysis of the private LR test, which characterizes
the trade-off between confidentiality, measured via the differential privacy
parameters $(\varepsilon,\delta)$, and statistical utility, measured via the
power of the test. This is obtained through a Bahadur-Rao large deviation
expansion for the power of the private LR test, bringing out a critical
quantity, as a function of the sample size, the dimension of the table and
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$, that determines a loss in the power of the test. Such a
result is then applied to characterize the impact of the sample size and the
dimension of the table, in connection with the parameters
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$, on the loss of the power of the private LR test. In
particular, we determine the (sample) cost of
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy in the private LR test, namely the
additional sample size that is required to recover the power of the Multinomial
LR test in the absence of perturbation. Our power analysis rely on a
non-standard large deviation analysis for the LR, as well as the development of
a novel (sharp) large deviation principle for sum of i.i.d. random vectors,
which is of independent interest.

method reliant on the resolvent of the master operator of the stochastic

exemplify path-dependent behaviours of the binary decision model. The solution
is computationally fast and is indistinguishable from Monte Carlo simulation.
Well-known metastable effects are observed in regions of the model's parameter
space where agent rationality is above a critical value, and we calculate the
time scale at which equilibrium is reached from first passage time theory to a
much greater approximation than has been previously conducted. In addition to
considering selfish agents, who only care to maximise their own utility, we
consider altruistic agents who make decisions on the basis of maximising global
utility. Curiously, we find that although altruistic agents coalesce more
strongly on a particular decision, thereby increasing their utility in the
short-term, they are also more prone to being subject to non-optimal metastable
regimes as compared to selfish agents. The method used for this solution can be
easily extended to other binary decision models, including Kirman's ant model,
and under reinterpretation also provides a time-dependent solution to the
mean-field Ising model. Finally, we use our time-dependent solution to
construct a likelihood function that can be used on non-equilibrium data for
model calibration. This is a rare finding, since often calibration in economic
agent based models must be done without an explicit likelihood function. From
simulated data, we show that even with a well-defined likelihood function,
model calibration is difficult unless one has access to data representative of
the underlying model.

  welcome Replacement: Added small comments suggested by referee",,"10.1093/mnras/stac147",,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cosmological information from weak lensing surveys is maximised by dividing
source galaxies into tomographic sub-samples for which the redshift
distributions are estimated. Uncertainties on these redshift distributions must
be correctly propagated into the cosmological results. We present hyperrank, a
new method for marginalising over redshift distribution uncertainties in
cosmological analyses, using discrete samples from the space of all possible
redshift distributions. This is demonstrated in contrast to previous highly
simplified parametric models of the redshift distribution uncertainty. In
hyperrank the set of proposed redshift distributions is ranked according to a
small (in this work between one and four) number of summary values, which are
then sampled along with other nuisance parameters and cosmological parameters
in the Monte Carlo chain used for inference. This can be regarded as a general
method for marginalising over discrete realisations of data vector variation
with nuisance parameters, which can consequently be sampled separately to the
main parameters of interest, allowing for increased computational efficiency.
We focus on the case of weak lensing cosmic shear analyses and demonstrate our
method using simulations made for the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We show the
method can correctly and efficiently marginalise over a range of models for the
redshift distribution uncertainty. Finally, we compare hyperrank to the common
mean-shifting method of marginalising over redshift uncertainty, validating
that this simpler model is sufficient for use in the DES Year 3 cosmology
results presented in companion papers.

involves a 2D breast CT simulation, where the simulated breast phantom has
random fibro-glandular structure and high-contrast specks. The phantom allows
for arbitrarily large training sets to be generated with perfectly known truth.
The training set consists of 4000 cases where each case consists of the truth
image, 128-view sinogram data, and the corresponding 128-view filtered
back-projection (FBP) image. The networks are trained to predict the truth
image from either the sinogram or FBP data. Geometry information is not

linear chain of $N$ interacting dipoles. Starting from the ground state, and
considering chains of different numbers of dipoles, we introduce single site
excitations with energy $\Delta K$. The time evolution of the chaoticy of the
system and the energy localization along the chain is analyzed by computing, up
to very long times, the statistical average of the finite time Lyapunov
exponent $\lambda(t)$ and of the participation ratio $\Pi(t)$. For small
$\Delta K$, the evolution of $\lambda(t)$ and $\Pi(t)$ indicates that the
system becomes chaotic at roughly the same time as $\Pi(t)$ reaches a steady
state. For the largest values of $\Delta K$, the system becomes chaotic at an
extremely early stage in comparison with the energy relaxation times. We find
that this fact is due to the presence of chaotic breathers that keep the system
far from equipartition and ergodicity. Finally, we show that the asymptotic
values attained by the participation ratio $\Pi(t)$ fairly corresponds to
thermal equilibrium.

in the modern Universe is discussed. It could appear due to statistical
processing of data on galaxies redshifts and estimated distances based on some
statistical relations with limited accuracy. This causes a number of effects
leading to either underestimation or overestimation of the Hubble parameter
when using any methods of statistical processing, primarily the least squares
method (LSM). The value of the Hubble constant is underestimated when
processing a whole sample; when the sample is constrained by distance,
especially when constrained from above, it is significantly overestimated due
to data selection. The bias significantly exceeds the values of the error the
Hubble constant calculated by the LSM formulae.
  These effects are demonstrated both analytically and using Monte Carlo
simulations, which introduce deviations in both velocities and estimated
distances to the original dataset described by the Hubble law. The
characteristics of the deviations are similar to real observations. Errors in
estimated distances are up to 20%. They lead to the fact that when processing
the same mock sample using LSM, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the
Hubble constant from 96% of the true value when processing the entire sample to
110% when processing the subsample with distances limited from above.
  The impact of these effects can lead to a bias in the Hubble constant
obtained from real data and an overestimation of the accuracy of determining
this value. This may call into question the accuracy of determining the Hubble
constant and significantly reduce the tension between the values obtained from
the observations in the early and modern Universe, which were actively
discussed during the last year.

Firstly, we introduce a semantic cycle-consistency loss in the source domain to
ensure that the translation preserves the semantics. Secondly, we introduce a
pseudo-labelling loss, where we translate target data to source, label them by
a source-domain network, and use the generated pseudo-labels to supervise the
target-domain network. Our results show that this allows us to extract
systematically better representations for the target domain. In particular, we
address the challenge of enhancing performance on VERDICT-MRI, an advanced

X-ray absorption to estimate mass-loss rates for both stars and to constrain
the system morphology. The absorption maximum coincides closely with inferior
conjunction of the WC star and provides evidence of the ion-reflection

magnetic fields probably generated by the Weibel instability. Comparisons with

mechanics with the prospect of significantly relieving the computational costs
of hierarchical computational methods. Traditionally, these surrogates have
been trained using datasets which map strain inputs to stress outputs directly.
Data-driven constitutive models for elastic and inelastic materials have
commonly been developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which
recently enabled the incorporation of physical laws in the construction of
these models. However, ANNs do not offer convergence guarantees and are reliant
on user-specified parameters. In contrast to ANNs, Gaussian process regression
(GPR) is based on nonparametric modeling principles as well as on fundamental
statistical knowledge and hence allows for strict convergence guarantees. GPR
however has the major disadvantage that it scales poorly as datasets get large.
In this work we present a physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling
approach for isostropic and anisotropic materials based on probabilistic
machine learning that can be used in the big data context. The trained GPR
surrogates are able to respect physical principles such as material frame
indifference, material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, stress-free
undeformed configuration, and the local balance of angular momentum.
Furthermore, this paper presents the first sampling approach that directly
generates space-filling points in the invariant space corresponding to bounded
domain of the gradient deformation tensor. Overall, the presented approach is
tested on synthetic data from isotropic and anisotropic constitutive laws and
shows surprising accuracy even far beyond the limits of the training domain,
indicating that the resulting surrogates can efficiently generalize as they
incorporate knowledge about the underlying physics.

migration between them are quite common occurrences. The emergence and
sustenance of cooperation in such a population is a highly researched topic in
the evolutionary game theory. If the individuals in every deme are considered
to be either cooperators or defectors, the migration dilemma can be envisaged:
The cooperators would not want to migrate to a defector-rich deme as they fear
of facing exploitation; but without migration, cooperation can not be
established throughout the network of demes. With a view to studying the
aforementioned scenario, in this paper, we set up a theoretical model
consisting of a coupled map lattice of replicator maps based on
two-player--two-strategy games. The replicator map considered is capable of
showing a variety of evolutionary outcomes, like convergent (fixed point)
outcomes and nonconvergent (periodic and chaotic) outcomes. Furthermore, this
coupled network of the replicator maps undergoes the phenomenon of amplitude
death leading to non-oscillatory stable synchronized states. We specifically
explore the effect of (i) the nature of coupling that models migration between
the maps, (ii) the heterogenous demes (in the sense that not all the demes have
same game being played by the individuals), (iii) the degree of the network,
and (iv) the cost associated with the migration. In the course of
investigation, we are intrigued by the effectiveness of the random migration in
sustaining a uniform cooperator fraction across a population irrespective of
the details of the replicator dynamics and the interaction among the demes.

this paper, we identify a class of CRNs called non-competitive (NC) whose
equilibria are absolutely robust to reaction rates and kinetic rate law,
because their behavior is captured solely by their stoichiometric structure.
Unlike prior work on rate-independent CRNs, checking non-competition and using
it as a design criterion is easy and promises robust output. We also present a
technique to program NC-CRNs using well-founded deep learning methods, showing
a translation procedure from rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks to
NC-CRNs. In the case of binary weight ReLU networks, our translation procedure
is surprisingly tight in the sense that a single bimolecular reaction
corresponds to a single ReLU node and vice versa. This compactness argues that
neural networks may be a fitting paradigm for programming rate-independent
chemical computation. As proof of principle, we demonstrate our scheme with
numerical simulations of CRNs translated from neural networks trained on

which surround a civilisation's sun to collect all the energy it radiates.
Through discussion of the features of such a feat of engineering, the
viability, scale and likely design of a Dyson structure is evaluated, before
details about each stage of its construction and operation are investigated. It
is found that a Dyson Swarm, a large array of individual satellites orbiting
another planetary body, is the ideal design for such a structure over the solid
sun-surrounding structure which is typically associated with the Dyson Sphere.
  In our solar system, such a structure based around Mars would be able to
account for the Earth's 2019 global power consumption of 18.35 TW within fifty
years once its construction has begun, which itself could start by 2040. The
swarm of over 5.5 billion satellites would be constructed on the surface of
Mars before being launched by electromagnetic accelerators into a Martian
orbit. Efficiency of the Dyson Swarm ranges from around 0.74 - 2.77% of the
Sun's $3.85\times10^{26}$ W output, with large potential for growth as both
current technologies improve and future concepts are brought to reality in the
time before and during the swarm's construction. Not only would a Dyson Swarm
provide a near infinite, renewable power source for Earth, it would allow for
significant expansions in human space exploration and for our civilisation as a
whole.

  Follow-up Time",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Causal effect estimation for dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) contributes to
sequential decision making. However, censoring and time-dependent confounding
under DTRs are challenging as the amount of observational data declines over
time due to a reducing sample size but the feature dimension increases over
time. Long-term follow-up compounds these challenges. Another challenge is the
highly complex relationships between confounders, treatments, and outcomes,
which causes the traditional and commonly used linear methods to fail. We
combine outcome regression models with treatment models for high dimensional
features using uncensored subjects that are small in sample size and we fit
deep Bayesian models for outcome regression models to reveal the complex
relationships between confounders, treatments, and outcomes. Also, the
developed deep Bayesian models can model uncertainty and output the prediction
variance which is essential for the safety-aware applications, such as
self-driving cars and medical treatment design. The experimental results on
medical simulations of HIV treatment show the ability of the proposed method to
obtain stable and accurate dynamic causal effect estimation from observational
data, especially with long-term follow-up. Our technique provides practical
guidance for sequential decision making, and policy-making.

actions. However, in some sports, such as the popular esport Counter-Strike,
there exist important team-level decisions. For example, at the beginning of
each round in a Counter-Strike game, teams decide how much of their in-game
dollars to spend on equipment. Because the dollars are a scarce resource,
different strategies have emerged concerning how teams should spend in
particular situations. To assess team purchasing decisions in-game, we
introduce a game-level win probability model to predict a team's chance of
winning a game at the beginning of a given round. We consider features such as
team scores, equipment, money, and spending decisions. Using our win
probability model, we investigate optimal team spending decisions for important
game scenarios. We identify a pattern of sub-optimal decision-making for CSGO
teams. Finally, we introduce a metric, Optimal Spending Error (OSE), to rank
teams by how closely their spending decisions follow our predicted optimal
spending decisions.

nanomaterials in industrial products requires a profound and comprehensive
understanding of their potential toxicity. Among different nanomaterials,
carbon nanomaterials marked its notable superiority toward the development of
state-of-the-art nanotechnology due to the significant contribution of each of
the carbon allotropes with varied dimensionality. The zero-dimensional
fullerene, one-dimensional carbon nanotube, and two-dimensional graphene
possess an exclusive combination of distinctive properties that are utilized in
most of the nanotechnology-based products nowadays. However, potential risk
factors are associated with the production and the use of carbon nanomaterials.
Consequently, the number of studies regarding the assessment of the toxicity of
these nanomaterials has increased rapidly in the past decade. This chapter will
summarize the recent scientific efforts on the toxicity evaluation of different

the onset of a symmetry broken state for some degree of nonlinearity, the full
dynamics maps the system into an effective $\phi^4$ model. In this latter
context, the self-trapping transition is an initial condition dependent
transfer of a classical particle over a barrier set by the nonlinear term. This
transition has been investigated analytically and mathematically it is
expressed through the hyperbolic limit of Jacobian elliptic functions. The aim
of the present work is to recapture this transition through the use of methods
of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Specifically, we used a physics motivated
machine learning model that is shown to be able to capture the original dynamic
self-trapping transition and its dependence on initial conditions. Exploitation
of this result in the case of the non-degenerate nonlinear dimer gives
additional information on the more general dynamics and helps delineate linear
from nonlinear localization. This work shows how AI methods may be embedded in
physics and provide useful tools for discovery.

multi-agent systems. Prior works are constrained mainly by the assumption that
all agents act simultaneously, and asynchronous action coordination between
agents is rarely considered. This paper introduces a bi-level multi-agent
decision hierarchy for coordinated behavior planning. We propose a novel
election mechanism in which we adopt a graph convolutional network to model the
interaction among agents and elect a first-move agent for asynchronous
guidance. We also propose a dynamically weighted mixing network to effectively
reduce the misestimation of the value function during training. This work is
the first to explicitly model the asynchronous multi-agent action coordination,
and this explicitness enables to choose the optimal first-move agent. The
results on Cooperative Navigation and Google Football demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance in cooperative
environments. Our code is available at
