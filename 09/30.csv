only recently been identified as a nova-like cataclysmic variable. We present
time-resolved optical spectroscopy obtained at the Isaac Newton Telescope
together with $\textit{Swift}$ X-ray and ultraviolet observations. We combined
these with $\textit{TESS}$ photometry and find a period of 3.28h and a mass
transfer rate of $4-9 \times 10^{-9} M_{sun}/yr$. Historical photometry shows
at least one low state establishing the system as a VY Scl star. Our
high-cadence spectroscopy also revealed rapidly changing winds emanating from
the accretion disc. We have modelled these using the Monte Carlo PYTHON code
and shown that all the emission lines could emanate from the wind - which would
explain the lack of double-peaked lines in such systems. In passing,we discuss
the effect of variability on the position of cataclysmic variables in the

to include solutal driven natural convection in order to represent the
experimentally observed bubble behaviour even though such effects have commonly
been neglected in modelling efforts so far. We reveal how the convective
patterns depend on current densities and bubble spacings, leading to
distinctively different bubble growth and shrinkage dynamics. Bubbles are seen
to promote the convective instability if their spacing is large ($\geq4$mm for
the present conditions), whereas the onset of convection is delayed if the
inter-bubble distance is smaller. Our approach and our results can help devise

This is particularly true in robotics, where doing experiments on hardware is
much more arduous than in simulation. This has become arguably more so in the

devoted to developing increasingly realistic and higher fidelity simulators.
However, we lack any principled way to evaluate how good a ""proxy domain"" is,
specifically in terms of how useful it is in helping us achieve our end
objective of building an agent that performs well in the target domain. In this
work, we investigate methods to address this need. We begin by clearly
separating two uses of proxy domains that are often conflated: 1) their ability
to be a faithful predictor of agent performance and 2) their ability to be a
useful tool for learning. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the role of
proxy domains and establish new proxy usefulness (PU) metrics to compare the
usefulness of different proxy domains. We propose the relative predictive PU to
assess the predictive ability of a proxy domain and the learning PU to quantify
the usefulness of a proxy as a tool to generate learning data. Furthermore, we
argue that the value of a proxy is conditioned on the task that it is being
used to help solve. We demonstrate how these new metrics can be used to
optimize parameters of the proxy domain for which obtaining ground truth via
system identification is not trivial.

and shows that by exploiting DRAM access timing margins within
manufacturer-recommended DRAM timing specifications, we can significantly
improve system performance, reduce power consumption, and improve device
reliability and security. First, we characterize DRAM timing parameter margins
and find that certain regions of DRAM can be accessed faster than other regions
due to DRAM cell process manufacturing variation. We exploit this by enabling
variable access times depending on the DRAM cells being accessed, which not
only improves overall system performance, but also decreases power consumption.
Second, we find that we can uniquely identify DRAM devices by the locations of
failures that result when we access DRAM with timing parameters reduced below
specification values. Because we induce these failures with DRAM accesses, we
can generate these unique identifiers significantly more quickly than prior
work. Third, we propose a random number generator that is based on our
observation that timing failures in certain DRAM cells are randomly induced and
can thus be repeatedly polled to very quickly generate true random values.
Finally, we characterize the RowHammer security vulnerability on a wide range
of modern DRAM chips while violating the DRAM refresh requirement in order to
directly characterize the underlying DRAM technology without the interference
of refresh commands. We demonstrate with our characterization of real chips,
that existing RowHammer mitigation mechanisms either are not scalable or suffer
from prohibitively large performance overheads in projected future devices and
it is critical to research more effective solutions to RowHammer. Overall, our
studies build a new understanding of modern DRAM devices to improve computing
system performance, reliability and security all at the same time.

networks to collect and analyse data. In many cases, such devices are powered
only by Energy Harvesting(EH) and have limited energy available to analyse
acquired data. When edge infrastructure is available, a device has a choice: to
perform analysis locally or offload the task to other resource-rich devices
such as cloudlet servers. However, such a choice carries a price in terms of
consumed energy and accuracy. On the one hand, transmitting raw data can result
in a higher energy cost in comparison to the required energy to process data
locally. On the other hand, performing data analytics on servers can improve
the task's accuracy. Additionally, due to the correlation between information
sent by multiple devices, accuracy might not be affected if some edge devices
decide to neither process nor send data and preserve energy instead. For such a
scenario, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solution capable
of learning and adapting the policy to the time-varying energy arrival due to
EH patterns. We leverage two datasets, one to model energy an EH device can
collect and the other to model the correlation between cameras. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed solution performance to three baseline policies. Our
results show that we can increase accuracy by 15% in comparison to conventional
approaches while preventing outages.

gauge field that includes both a $SU(5)$ grand unified theory (GUT) and a Higgs
sector as a scalar component of the 5D vector field, solving the hierarchy
problem. By appropriately breaking the gauge symmetry on the boundaries of the
extra dimension the issue of light exotic new states, appearing generically in
such models, is eliminated and the SM fermion spectrum is naturally reproduced.
The Higgs potential is computed at one-loop, finding straightforward solutions
with a realistic $m_h = 125$ GeV. The problem of proton decay is addressed by
showing that baryon number is a hidden symmetry of the model. The presence of a
scalar leptoquark and a scalar singlet is highlighted, which might play a role
in solving further problems of the SM, allowing for example for electroweak
baryogenesis. Finally, the $X$ and $Y$ gauge bosons from $SU(5)$ GUTs are found

investigating and understanding process spatial heterogeneity. The
geographically weighted (GW) framework is increasingly used to accommodate
different types of models and analyses reflecting a wider desire to explore
spatial variation in model parameters or components. However the growth in the
use of GWR and different GW models has only been partially supported by package
development in both R and Python, the major coding environments for spatial
analysis. The result is that refinements have been inconsistently included (if
at all) within GWR and GW functions in any given package. This paper outlines
the structure of a new `gwverse` package, that will over time replace
`GWmodel`, that takes advantage of recent developments in the composition of
complex, integrated packages. It conceptualises `gwverse` as having a modular
structure, that separates core GW functionality and applications such as GWR.
It adopts a function factory approach, in which bespoke functions are created
and returned to the user based on user-defined parameters. The paper introduces
two demonstrator modules that can be used to undertake GWR and identifies a

using past observations, sampled with randomized periods, for both
proprioception and vision. We train the RL policy for end-to-end control in a
physical simulator without any predefined controller or reference motion, and
directly deploy it on the real A1 quadruped robot running in the wild. We

the dependency of the coregionalized variables. The main challenge, once this
relaxation on the LMC is assumed, is to solve appropriately the interpolation
of the different known correlation matrices throughout the domain, in a
reliable and coherent fashion. The present work adopts the non-euclidean
framework to achieve our objective by locally averaging and interpolating the
correlations between the variables, retaining the intrinsic geometry of
correlation matrices. A second application deals with the problem of clustering

columns of neutron star binaries, their X-ray spectra are still commonly
described with phenomenological models, for example, a cutoff power law. While
the behavior of these models is well understood and they allow for a comparison
of different sources and studying source behavior, the extent to which the
underlying physics can be derived from the model parameters is very limited.
During recent years, several physically motivated spectral models have been
developed to overcome these limitations. Their application, however, is
generally computationally much more expensive and they require a high number of
parameters which are difficult to constrain. Previous works have presented an
analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation inside the accretion
column assuming a velocity profile that is linear in the optical depth. An
implementation of this solution that is both fast and accurate enough to be
fitted to observed spectra is available as a model in XSPEC. The main
difficulty of this implementation is that some solutions violate energy
conservation and therefore have to be rejected by the user. We propose a novel
fitting strategy that ensures energy conservation during the
$\chi^2$-minimization which simplifies the application of the model
considerably. We demonstrate this approach as well a study of possible
parameter degeneracies with a comprehensive Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis
of the complete parameter space for a combined NuSTAR and Swift/XRT dataset of
Cen X-3. The derived accretion-flow structure features a small column radius of
$\sim$63 m and a spectrum dominated by bulk-Comptonization of bremsstrahlung
seed photons, in agreement with previous studies.

construct a tree-based hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. In this
paper, we propose a flexible, yet conceptually simple alternative based on
implicit generative neural networks. The key challenge is to ensure marginal
uniformity of the estimated copula distribution. We achieve this by learning a
multivariate latent distribution with unspecified marginals but the desired
dependency structure. By applying the probability integral transform, we can
then obtain samples from the high-dimensional copula distribution without
relying on parametric assumptions or the need to find a suitable tree
structure. Experiments on synthetic and real data from finance, physics, and
image generation demonstrate the performance of this approach.

JPEG image artifacts removal has been attracting considerable attention due to
its convenience for practical usage. However, existing deep blind methods
usually directly reconstruct the image without predicting the quality factor,
thus lacking the flexibility to control the output as the non-blind methods. To
remedy this problem, in this paper, we propose a flexible blind convolutional
neural network, namely FBCNN, that can predict the adjustable quality factor to
control the trade-off between artifacts removal and details preservation.
Specifically, FBCNN decouples the quality factor from the JPEG image via a
decoupler module and then embeds the predicted quality factor into the
subsequent reconstructor module through a quality factor attention block for
flexible control. Besides, we find existing methods are prone to fail on
non-aligned double JPEG images even with only a one-pixel shift, and we thus
propose a double JPEG degradation model to augment the training data. Extensive
experiments on single JPEG images, more general double JPEG images, and
real-world JPEG images demonstrate that our proposed FBCNN achieves favorable
performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative
metrics and visual quality.

Intuitively, the finite-state dimension of a sequence $S \in \Sigma^\infty$
represents the density of finite-state information contained within $S$, while
the finite-state mutual dimension between two sequences $S \in \Sigma^\infty$
and $T \in \Sigma^\infty$ represents the density of finite-state information
shared by $S$ and $T$. Thus ``finite-state mutual dimension'' can be viewed as
a ``finite-state'' version of mutual dimension and as a ``mutual'' version of
finite-state dimension.
  The main results of this investigation are as follows. First, we show that
finite-state mutual dimension, defined using information-lossless finite-state
compressors, has all of the properties expected of a measure of mutual
information. Next, we prove that finite-state mutual dimension may be
characterized in terms of block mutual information rates. Finally, we provide

planetary systems are mostly found in close (wide) binaries with separation
aB<(>)100-300 AU. (2) In binaries, single and multiple-planet systems are
similar in 1-D distributions of mass and period as well as eccentricity (in
contrast to the ""eccentricity dichotomy"" found in single-star systems) but
different in the 2-D period-mass diagram. Specifically, there is a
rectangular-shaped gap in the period-mass diagram of single-planet systems but
not for multiples. This gap also depends on binary separation and is more
prominent in close binaries. (3) There is a rising upper envelope in the
period-mass diagram for planets in wide binaries as well as in single stars but
not in close binaries. More specifically, there is a population of massive
short period planets in close binaries but almost absent in wide binaries or

quantum magnetohydrodynamic system (QMHD) with large data, modeling a charged
quantum fluid interacting with a self-generated electromagnetic field. The
analysis of QMHD relies upon the use of Madelung transformations. The rigorous
derivation requires non-trivial smoothing estimates, which are obtained by
assuming slightly higher regularity for the electromagnetic potential. These
assumptions are motivated by the nonlinear dependence of the hydrodynamic
system in terms of the underlying wave function dynamics, which is
supercritical with respect to the bare energy bounds. Due to quantum effects on
the dispersive properties of QMHD, our approach requires neither smallness nor
high regularity, unlike a large amount of existing literature for
Euler-Maxwell's classical system. For quantum MHD system the irrotationality
and the presence of a highly nonlinear quantum stress tensor induce much
stronger dispersive properties, as a byproduct of a close relationship with the
classical Maxwell-Schr\""odinger system. Therefore the core argument is shifted
to the analysis of the nonlinearities related to the formulation of the
hydrodynamic variables through the Madelung transformations. The analysis
carried out in section 4 shows that it is necessary to go through non-trivial
smoothing estimates and these require us to assume regularity conditions, just
above the energy norms, for the initial data of the Maxwellian electromagnetic
potential. In the same regime of regularity, with the help of suitable local
smoothing estimates, we also prove stability of both the hydrodynamic variables
and the Lorentz force associated with the electromagnetic field. (Abbreviated

allows storage units to communicate their cost to the market using
energy-cycling functions that map prices to cycle depths. The resulting
market-clearing process--implemented via convex programming--yields
corresponding schedules and payments based on traditional energy prices for
power supply and per-cycle prices for storage utilization. We illustrate the
benefits of our solution by comparing the competitive equilibrium of the
resulting mechanism to that of an alternative solution that uses prosumer-based
bids. Our solution shows several advantages over the prosumer-based approach.
It does not require a priori price estimation. It also incentivizes
participants to reveal their truthful cost, thus leading to an efficient,
competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments using New York Independent

discrete time evolution matches the partition function of certain solvable
lattice models. In particular, we examine two classes of lattice models: the
classical six-vertex model and a generalized family of $(2n+4)$-vertex models
for each positive integer $n$. These models depend on a statistic called
charge, and are associated to the quantum group
$U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(1|n))$. Our results show a close and unexpected
connection between Hamiltonian operators and solvability.
  The six-vertex model can be associated with Hamiltonians from classical Fock
space, and we show that such a correspondence exists precisely when the
Boltzmann weights are free fermionic. This allows us to prove that the free
fermionic partition function is always a (skew) supersymmetric Schur function
and then use the Berele-Regev formula to correct a result of Brubaker, Bump,
and Friedberg. In this context, the supersymmetric function involution takes us
between two lattice models that generalize the vicious walker and osculating
walker models. We also observe that the supersymmetric Jacobi-Trudi formula,
through Wick's Theorem, can be seen as a six-vertex analogue of the
Lindstr\""{o}m-Gessel-Viennot Lemma.
  Then, we prove a sharp solvability criterion for the six-vertex model with
charge that provides the proper analogue of the free fermion condition.
Building on results by Brubaker, Bump, Buciumas, and Gustafsson, we show that
this criterion exactly dictates when a charged model has a Hamiltonian operator
acting on a Drinfeld twist of q-Fock space. The resulting partition function is
then always a (skew) supersymmetric LLT polynomial.

interplay between a pair of graphs: the Tanner graph of the set of measured

connections required to implement the circuit. For local-expander quantum
codes, which are promising for low-overhead quantum error correction, we prove
that any syndrome extraction circuit implemented with local Clifford gates in a
2D square patch of $N$ qubits has depth at least $\Omega(n/\sqrt{N})$ where $n$
is the code length. Then, we propose two families of quantum circuits
saturating this bound. First, we construct 2D local syndrome extraction
circuits for quantum LDPC codes with bounded depth using only $O(n^2)$ ancilla
qubits. Second, we design a family of 2D local syndrome extraction circuits for
hypergraph product codes using $O(n)$ ancilla qubits with depth $O(\sqrt{n})$.
Finally, we use circuit noise simulations to compare the performance of a
family of hypergraph product codes using this last family of 2D syndrome
extraction circuits with a syndrome extraction circuit implemented with fully
connected qubits. While there is a threshold of about $10^{-3}$ for a fully
connected implementation, we observe no threshold for the 2D local
implementation despite simulating error rates of as low as $10^{-6}$. This
suggests that quantum LDPC codes are impractical with 2D local quantum
hardware. We believe that our proof technique is of independent interest and
could find other applications. Our bounds on circuit sizes are derived from a
lower bound on the amount of correlations between two subsets of qubits of the

an event-ready scheme enabling the rapid generation of high-fidelity

can yield information on the composition and structure of a planet's
atmosphere. However, transmission spectra may be compromised by inhomogeneities
in the stellar photosphere. The sub-Neptune-sized habitable zone planet K2-18 b
has water absorption detected in its atmosphere using data from the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). Herein, we examine whether the reported planetary
atmospheric signal seen from HST transmission spectroscopy of K2-18 b could
instead be induced by time-varying star spots. We built a time-variable
spectral model of K2-18 that is designed to match the variability amplitude
seen in K2 photometric data, and used this model to simulate 1000 HST data-sets
that follow the K2-18 b observation strategy. More than 1% of these provide a
better fit to the data than the best-fitting exoplanet atmosphere model. After
resampling our simulations to generate synthetic HST observations, we find that
40% of random draws would produce an atmospheric detection at a level at least
as significant as that seen in the actual HST data of K2-18 b. This work
illustrates that the inferred detection of an atmosphere on K2-18 b may
alternatively be explained by stellar spectral contamination due to the
inhomogeneous photosphere of K2-18. We do not rule out a detection of water in
the planet's atmosphere, but provide a plausible alternative that should be
considered, and conclude that more observations are needed to fully rule out
stellar contamination.

assembling PSN-gap BBH mergers. To that end, I explore a grid of 40 new
evolutionary models of a representative YMC of initial mass $M_{\rm

all BH progenitor stars being initially in primordial binaries. All cluster
models are evolved with the direct, relativistic N-body code NBODY7
incorporating up to date remnant formation, BH natal spin, and
general-relativistic (GR) merger recoil schemes. The BBH mergers from these
model cluster computations agree well with the masses and effective spin
parameters of the GW events in the latest GW transient catalogue (GWTC). In
particular, GW190521-like, i.e., $\approx200M_\odot$, low aligned spin events
are produced via dynamical merger among BHs derived from star-star merger
products. GW190403-like, i.e., PSN-gap, highly asymmetric and aligned events
result from mergers involving BHs that are spun up via matter accretion or
binary interaction. The present YMC models yield a present day, intrinsic
merger rate density of $0-3.8\times10^{-2}{{\rm~yr}^{-1}{\rm Gpc}^{-3}}$ for

  kinematics","submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Time-delay strong lensing (TDSL) is a powerful probe of the current expansion
rate of the Universe. However, in light of the discrepancies between early and
late-time cosmological studies, efforts revolve around the characterisation of
systematic uncertainties in the methods. Here, we focus on the mass-sheet
degeneracy (MSD), which is considered a significant source of systematics in
TDSL, and aim to assess the constraining power provided by IFU stellar
kinematics. We approximate the MSD with a cored, two-parameter extension to the
lensing mass profiles (with core radius $r_{\rm c}$ and mass-sheet parameter
$\lambda_{\rm int}$). In addition, we utilise mock IFU stellar kinematics of
time-delay strong lenses, given the prospects of obtaining such data with JWST.
We construct joint strong lensing and stellar dynamical models, where the time
delays, mock imaging and IFU observations are used to constrain the mass
profile of lens galaxies, and yield joint constraints on the time-delay
distance ($D_{\Delta t}$) and angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm d}$) to the
lens. We find that mock JWST-like stellar kinematics constrain the internal
mass sheet and limit its contribution to the uncertainties of $D_{\Delta t}$
and $D_{\rm d}$, each at the < 4% level, without assumptions on the background
cosmological model. These distance constraints would translate to a < 4%
precision measurement on $H_{\rm 0}$ in flat $\Lambda CDM$ for a single lens.
Our study shows that IFU stellar kinematics of time-delay strong lenses will be
key in lifting the MSD on a per lens basis, assuming reasonable core sizes.
However, even in the limit of infinite $r_{\rm c}$, where $D_{\Delta t}$ is
degenerate with $\lambda_{\rm int}$, stellar kinematics of the deflector, time
delays and imaging data will provide powerful constraints on $D_{\rm d}$, which
becomes the dominant source of information in the cosmological inference.

reference results. We find that the photosphere is generically ellipsoidal but
augmented with small-scale structure and produces emission that is about 1.5-3
times stronger towards the pole than the equator. The kilonova typically peaks
after 0.7-1.5days in the near-infrared frequency regime with luminosities

from the self-consistent jet launching by an accreting Kerr black hole (BH) to
the breakout from the star. We identify three types of outflows, depending on
the angular momentum, $ l $, of the collapsing material and the magnetic field,
$ B $, on the BH horizon: (i) Subrelativistic outflow (low $ l $ and high $ B
$), (ii) Stationary accretion shock instability (SASI; high $ l $ and low $ B
$), (iii) Relativistic jets (high $ l $ and high $ B $). In the absence of
jets, free-fall of the stellar envelope provides a good estimate for the BH
accretion rate. Jets can substantially suppress the accretion rate, and their
duration can be limited by the magnetization profile in the star. We find that
progenitors with large (steep) inner density power-law indices ($ \gtrsim 2 $),
face extreme challenges as gamma-ray burst (GRB) progenitors due to excessive
luminosity, global time evolution in the lightcurve throughout the burst and
short breakout times, inconsistent with observations. Our results suggest that
the wide variety of observed explosion appearances
(supernova/supernova+GRB/low-luminosity GRBs) and the characteristics of the
emitting relativistic outflows (luminosity and duration) can be naturally
explained by the differences in the progenitor structure. Our simulations
reveal several important jet features: (i) strong magnetic dissipation inside
the star, resulting in weakly magnetized jets by breakout that may have
significant photospheric emission and (ii) spontaneous emergence of tilted
accretion disk-jet flows, even in the absence of any tilt in the progenitor.

open-source code written in {\tt Python} to determine stellar properties based
on a set of astrophysical observables. BASTA has been specifically designed to
robustly combine large datasets that include asteroseismology, spectroscopy,
photometry, and astrometry. We describe the large number of asteroseismic
observations that can be fit by the code and how these can be combined with
atmospheric properties (as well as parallaxes and apparent magnitudes), making
it the most complete analysis pipeline available for oscillating main-sequence,
subgiant, and red giant stars. BASTA relies on a set of pre-built stellar
isochrones or a custom-designed library of stellar tracks which can be further
refined using our interpolation method (both along and across stellar
tracks/isochrones). We perform recovery tests with simulated data that reveal
levels of accuracy at the few percent level for radii, masses, and ages when
individual oscillation frequencies are considered, and show that asteroseismic
ages with statistical uncertainties below 10% are within reach if our stellar
models are reliable representations of stars. BASTA is extensively documented
and includes a suite of examples to support easy adoption and further
development by new users.

galaxies, switching off their star-formation, contributing to the build-up of
their stellar mass, and influencing the acquisition of their angular momentum.
In this work we make use of the IllustrisTNG simulation, coupled with the
DisPerSE cosmic web extraction algorithm, to test which is the galaxy property
most affected by the cosmic web and, conversely, to assess the differential
impact of the various cosmic web features on a given galaxy property. Our aim
is to use this information to better understand galaxy evolution and to
identify on which galaxy property future efforts should focus to detect the
cosmic web from the galaxy distribution. We provide a comprehensive analysis of
the relation between galaxy properties and cosmic web features. We also perform
extensive tests in which we try to disentangle the effect of local
overdensities of galaxies on their properties from the effect of the large
scale structure environment. Our results show that star-formation is the
quantity that shows the strongest variation with the distances from the cosmic
web features, but it is also the one that shows the strongest relation to the
local environment of galaxies. On the other hand, the direction of the angular
momentum of galaxies is the property that shows the weakest trends with
distance from cosmic web features, while also being more independent from the
local environment of galaxies. We conclude that the direction of the angular
momentum of galaxies and its use to improve our detection of the cosmic web
features could be the focus of futures studies benefiting from larger
statistical samples.

In particular, odd moduli arising from the reduction of 2-forms $(B_2,C_2)$ in
type IIB are largely unexplored despite their relevance for inflationary model
building. This article provides novel insights into the general structure of 4D
$\mathcal{N}=1$ $F$-term scalar potentials at higher orders in the
$\alpha^{\prime}$ and $g_{s}$ expansion for arbitrary Hodge numbers. We
systematically examine superpotential contributions with distinct moduli
dependences which are induced by fluxes or non-perturbative effects. Initially,
we prove the existence of a no-scale structure for odd moduli in the presence
of $(\alpha^\prime)^{3}$ corrections to the K\""ahler potential. By studying a
partially $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-completed form of the K\""ahler potential,
we derive the exact no-scale breaking effects at the closed string $1$-loop and
non-perturbative D-instanton level. These observations allow us to present
rigorous expressions for the $F$-term scalar potential applicable to arbitrary
numbers of moduli in type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications.
Finally, we compute the Hessian for odd moduli and discuss potential
phenomenological implications.

multiple ($d > 2$) spin states interacting with the quantized cavity field
produced by a superconducting resonator. By means of the input-output
formalism, we derive an expression for the output modes in the dispersive

different spin transitions addressable. We find that the measurement of the
cavity transmission allows to uniquely determine the spin state of the qudits.
We discuss, from an effective Hamiltonian perspective, the conditions under
which the qudit read-out is a non-demolition measurement and consider possible
experimental protocols to perform it. Finally, we illustrate our results with
simulations performed for realistic models of existing magnetic molecules.

of Abell 3556. The velocity structure of this galaxy is startling and shows two
reversals in sign along the minor axis, and one along the major axis. We use
triaxial Schwarzschild models to infer the intrinsic shape, central black hole
mass and orbit distribution of this galaxy. The shape determination suggests
that the galaxy is highly triaxial in the centre (almost prolate) but has a low
triaxiality (almost oblate) in the outer parts. The orbit distribution of the
best-fit Schwarzschild model shows that the kinematic reversal along the
projected minor axis is driven by a slight asymmetry in the distribution and
amount of long axis tubes in the inner parts. The kinematic reversals along the
projected major axis are driven by a high fraction of counter-rotating orbits
at intermediate radii in the galaxy. Using chemical tagging of orbits in the
Schwarzschild model, we do not find evidence for any association of these
orbits with specific stellar population parameters. Although the inner part of
the galaxy almost certainty formed through one or more dry mergers producing
the prolate shape, the outer parts are consistent with both accretion and in
situ formation. While axisymmetric models suggests the presence of a
supermassive black hole with mass $\sim 6 \times 10^9$M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim
10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ (with Schwarzschild and Jeans modelling, resp), triaxial
Schwarzschild models provide only an upper limit of $\sim 2 \times

ability to assign more subjects to better-performing treatments based on
interim results. The traditional RAR strategy alters the randomization ratio on
a patient-by-patient basis; this has been heavily criticized for bias due to
time-trends. An alternate approach is blocked RAR, which groups patients
together in blocks and recomputes the randomization ratio in a block-wise
fashion; the final analysis is then stratified by block. However, the typical
blocked RAR design divides patients into equal-sized blocks, which is not
generally optimal.
  This paper presents TrialMDP, an algorithm that designs two-armed blocked RAR
clinical trials. Our method differs from past approaches in that it optimizes
the size and number of blocks as well as their treatment allocations. That is,
the algorithm yields a policy that adaptively chooses the size and composition
of the next block, based on results seen up to that point in the trial.
TrialMDP is related to past works that compute optimal trial designs via
dynamic programming.
  The algorithm maximizes a utility function balancing (i) statistical power,
(ii) patient outcomes, and (iii) the number of blocks. We show that it attains
significant improvements in utility over a suite of baseline designs, and gives
useful control over the tradeoff between statistical power and patient
outcomes. It is well suited for small trials that assign high cost to failures.

linear scaling relations between the mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
and properties of its host galaxy. How these scaling relations evolve with
redshift and whether they extend to lower-mass galaxies however remain open
questions. Recent galaxy formation simulations predict a delayed, or
""two-phase"", growth of SMBHs: slow, highly intermittent BH growth due to
repeated gas ejection by stellar feedback in low-mass galaxies, followed by
more sustained gas accretion that eventually brings BHs onto the local scaling
relations. The predicted two-phase growth implies a steep increase, or ""kink"",
in BH-galaxy scaling relations at a stellar mass $M_{*}\sim5\times10^{10}
M_{\odot}$. We develop a parametric, semi-analytic model to compare different
SMBH growth models against observations of the quasar luminosity function (QLF)
at $z\sim0.5-4$. We compare models in which the relation between SMBH mass and
galaxy mass is purely linear versus two-phase models. The models are anchored
to the observed galaxy stellar mass function, and the BH mass functions at
different redshifts are consistently connected by the accretion rates
contributing to the QLF. The best fits suggest that two-phase evolution is
significantly preferred by the QLF data over a purely linear scaling relation.
Moreover, when the model parameters are left free, the two-phase model fits
imply a transition mass consistent with that predicted by simulations. Our
analysis motivates further observational tests, including measurements of BH
masses and AGN activity at the low-mass end, which could more directly test
two-phase SMBH growth.

optimally fits a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to

high-resolution velocity field. In this work, we study the effectivity of SBI
in predicting wall shear stress (WSS) relative to standard magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) postprocessing techniques using two synthetic numerical
experiments: flow through an idealized, two-dimensional stenotic vessel and a
model of an adult aorta. In particular, we study the sensitivity of these two
approaches with respect to the Reynolds number of the underlying flow, the
resolution of the MRI data, and the noise in the MRI data. We found that the
SBI WSS reconstruction: 1) is insensitive to Reynolds number over the range
considered (Re $\leq$ 1000), 2) improves as the amount of MRI data increases
and provides accurate reconstructions with as little as three MRI voxels per
diameter, and 3) degrades linearly as the noise in the data increases with a
slope determined by the resolution of the MRI data. We also consider the
sensitivity of SBI to the resolution of the CFD mesh and found there is
flexibility in the mesh used for SBI, although the WSS reconstruction becomes
more sensitive to other parameters, particularly the resolution of the MRI
data, for coarser meshes. This indicates a fundamental trade-off between scan
time (i.e., MRI data quality and resolution) and reconstruction time using SBI,
which is inherently different than the trade-off between scan time and
reconstruction quality observed in standard MRI postprocessing techniques.

sterile neutrino among all the previous anomalous results in the neutrino

in multiple neurological domains including cognition, language, sensory and
motor functions. Clinical recovery in these domains is tracked using a wide
range of measures that may be continuous, ordinal, interval or categorical in
nature, which presents challenges for standard multivariate regression
approaches. This has hindered stroke researchers' ability to achieve an
integrated picture of the complex time-evolving interactions amongst symptoms.
Here we use tools from network science and machine learning that are
particularly well-suited to extracting underlying patterns in such data, and
may assist in prediction of recovery patterns. To demonstrate the utility of
this approach, we analyzed data from the NINDS tPA trial using the Trajectory
Profile Clustering (TPC) method to identify distinct stroke recovery patterns
for 11 different neurological domains at 5 discrete time points. Our analysis
identified 3 distinct stroke trajectory profiles that align with clinically
relevant stroke syndromes, characterized both by distinct clusters of symptoms,
as well as differing degrees of symptom severity. We then validated our
approach using graph neural networks to determine how well our model performed
predictively for stratifying patients into these trajectory profiles at early
vs. later time points post-stroke. We demonstrate that trajectory profile
clustering is an effective method for identifying clinically relevant recovery
subtypes in multidimensional longitudinal datasets, and for early prediction of
symptom progression subtypes in individual patients. This paper is the first
work introducing network trajectory approaches for stroke recovery phenotyping,
and is aimed at enhancing the translation of such novel computational
approaches for practical clinical application.

generation of gamma-ray instruments: they allow the data from different
instruments, including legacy data from decommissioned telescopes, to be easily
combined and analysed within the same software framework. In addition,
standardised data accessible to the public, and analysable with open-source

parallax and PM distributions are compact and very similar indicating that they
are open clusters (OCs) and share the same kinematics. The large age
difference, 1.4 Gyr, points to a formation by tidal capture during a close
encounter and the close spatial proximity and similar kinematics suggest an
ongoing merger event. There are some prominent tidal debris that appear to
trace the clusters' orbits during the close encounter and, unexpectedly, some

the evaporation the merging clusters are being broken apart into smaller
structures by the combination of Galactic disk, Perseus arm, and mutual tidal

behind patterns that form as a result of strain upon liquid crystal systems

buckle in response to local, geometric incompatibilities, in order to maintain
the preferred layer spacing. Classic HH systems include cholesteric liquid
crystals under electromagnetic field distortions and smectic liquid crystals
under mechanical strains, where both materials are confined between rigid
substrates. However, richer phenomena are observed when undulation
instabilities occur in the presence of deformable interfaces and variable
boundary conditions. Understanding how the HH instability is affected by
deformable surfaces is imperative for applying the instability to a broader
range of materials. In this review, we re-examine the HH instability and give
special focus to how the boundary conditions influence the mechanical response
of lamellar systems to geometrical frustration. We use lamellar liquid crystals
confined within a spherical shell geometry as our model system. Made possible
by the relatively recent advances in microfluidics within the past 15 years,
liquid crystal shells are composed entirely of fluid interfaces and have
boundary conditions that can be dynamically controlled at will. We examine past
and recent work that exemplifies how topological constraints, molecular
anchoring conditions, and boundary curvature can trigger the HH instability in
liquid crystals with periodic ground states. We then end by identifying similar
phenomena across a wide variety of materials, both biological and synthetic.
With this review, we aim to highlight that the HH instability is a generic and
often overlooked response of periodic materials to geometrical frustration.

to other techniques (e.g., mechanical densification) and moreover it allows to
produce ""pure"" monoliths, i.e., without the need of using binders or templates
that could affect the functional properties of the MOF. Understanding the
mechanical properties of these monoliths is crucial for their transit to
practical applications. We studied the mechanical behavior of two zeolitic
imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8 and ZIF-71) by means of instrumented
nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Tip Force Microscopy (TFM),
an extension of AFM, was used to reveal the surface nanostructure of the
monoliths. We employed finite-element (FE) simulations alongside the
experiments, to establish a suitable constitutive model and determine an
improved estimate of the yield stress of ZIF monoliths. NanoFTIR was
subsequently used to pinpoint local structural alteration of the framework in
the contact area. The combination of TFM, FE simulations, and nanoFTIR enabled
us to identify the mechanical deformation mechanisms in monolithic ZIF
materials: grain boundaries sliding is dominating at low stresses, then
breakage of chemical bonds and a partial failure of the framework occurs,
eventually leading to a densification of porous framework at the contact zone.
Finally, we measured the fracture toughness using a cube corner indenter to
study the resistance of monoliths against cracking failure.

focused on the setting where the concept set is assumed to be fixed, while many
real-world applications require introducing new concepts into the set to meet
new demands. One common need is to refine the original coarse concepts and
split them into finer-grained ones, where the refinement process typically
begins with limited labeled data for the finer-grained concepts. To address the
need, we formalize the problem into a special weakly supervised MLL problem to
not only learn the fine-grained concepts efficiently but also allow interactive
queries to strategically collect more informative annotations to further
improve the classifier. The key idea within our approach is to learn to assign
pseudo-labels to the unlabeled entries, and in turn leverage the pseudo-labels
to train the underlying classifier and to inform a better query strategy.
Experimental results demonstrate that our pseudo-label approach is able to
accurately recover the missing ground truth, boosting the prediction
performance significantly over the baseline methods and facilitating a

Local power spectra corresponding to terminal nodes within trees are estimated
nonparametrically using Bayesian penalized linear splines. The trees are
considered to be random and fit using a Bayesian backfitting Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that sequentially considers tree modifications via
reversible-jump MCMC techniques. For high-dimensional covariates, a
sparsity-inducing Dirichlet hyperprior on tree splitting proportions is
considered, which provides sparse estimation of covariate effects and efficient
variable selection. By averaging over the posterior distribution of trees, the
proposed method can recover both smooth and abrupt changes in the power
spectrum across multiple covariates. Empirical performance is evaluated via
simulations to demonstrate the proposed method's ability to accurately recover
complex relationships and interactions. The proposed methodology is used to
study gait maturation in young children by evaluating age-related changes in

comprising alkali or alkaline earth metals intercalated into transition metal
slabs. The intricate honeycomb architecture and layered framework endows this
family of oxides with a tessellation of features such as exquisite
electrochemistry, unique topology and fascinating electromagnetic phenomena.
Despite having innumerable functionalities, these materials remain highly
underutilized as their underlying atomistic mechanisms are vastly unexplored.
Therefore, in a bid to provide a more in-depth perspective, we propose an
idealised diffusion model of the charged alkali cations (such as lithium,
sodium or potassium) in the two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb layers within the
three-dimensional (3D) crystal of honeycomb layered oxide frameworks. This
model not only explains the correlation between the excitation of cationic
vacancies (by applied electromagnetic fields) and the Gaussian curvature
deformation of the 2D surface, but also takes into consideration, the quantum
properties of the cations and their inter-layer mixing through quantum
tunnelling. Through this work, we offer a novel theoretical framework for the
study of 3D layered materials with 2D cationic diffusion currents, as well as
providing pedagogical insights into the role of topological phase transitions
in these materials in relation to Brownian motion and quantum geometry.

make full use of the multicast opportunities in content delivery, to alleviate
file transfer load in massive content delivery scenarios. Most existing work
considers deterministic environments. An important practical topic is to
characterize the impact of the uncertainty from user inactivity on coded
caching. We consider a one server cache-enabled network under homogeneous file
and network settings in presence of user inactivity. Unlike random or
probabilistic caching studied in the literature, deterministic coded caching is
considered, with the objective to minimize the worst-case backhaul load by
optimizing the file subpacketization and the caching strategy. First, a coded
caching method is used, where each file is split into the same type of
fragments labeled using sets with fixed cardinality, and the optimality of the
selected cardinality is proved. Optimal file subpacketization by splitting the
file into multiple types of fragments labeled with multiple cardinalities is
then discussed. We show that the closed-form optimum turns out to be given by a
fixed cardinality -- optimizing for user inactivity only affects file delivery,
cache placement is not affected. A decentralized version is also discussed and
analyzed, where each user fills its storage independently at random without
centralized coordination, and user inactivity is taken into account in file
delivery. Simulation results show that the optimization based centralized coded
caching scheme provides performance comparable to the ideal scenario assuming
full knowledge of user inactivity in the placement phase, while decentralized
caching performs slightly worse against user inactivity.

High spectral resolution X-ray observations (with RGS gratings onboard
XMM-Newton) of a few ULXs with the best datasets indeed found complex line
spectra and confirmed such extreme (0.1-0.3c) winds. However, a search for
plasma signatures in a large ULX sample with a rigorous technique has never
been performed, thereby preventing us from understanding their statistical
properties such as the rate of occurrence, to constrain the outflow geometry

X-ray spectra and applied it to the full RGS ULX archive, rigorously
quantifying the statistical significance of any candidate lines. Collecting the
135 most significant features detected in 89 observations of 19 objects, we
created the first catalogue of spectral lines detected in soft X-ray ULX

known rest-frame elemental transitions and thus originate from low-velocity

were imprinted by blueshifted outflows. Such winds therefore appear common
among the ULX population. Additionally, we found that spectrally hard ULXs show
fewer line detections than soft ULXs, indicating some difference in their
accretion geometry and orientation, possibly causing over-ionisation of plasma

by relapsing inflammation of the large intestine. The severity of UC is often
represented by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) which quantifies mucosal
disease activity from endoscopy videos. In clinical trials, an endoscopy video
is assigned an MES based upon the most severe disease activity observed in the
video. For this reason, severe inflammation spread throughout the colon will
receive the same MES as an otherwise healthy colon with severe inflammation
restricted to a small, localized segment. Therefore, the extent of disease
activity throughout the large intestine, and overall response to treatment, may
not be completely captured by the MES. In this work, we aim to automatically
estimate UC severity for each frame in an endoscopy video to provide a higher
resolution assessment of disease activity throughout the colon. Because
annotating severity at the frame-level is expensive, labor-intensive, and
highly subjective, we propose a novel weakly supervised, ordinal classification
method to estimate frame severity from video MES labels alone. Using clinical
trial data, we first achieved 0.92 and 0.90 AUC for predicting mucosal healing

demonstrate that our models achieve substantial Cohen's Kappa agreement with

this objective, we 1) present a novel construction of the discriminator in the
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), 2) theoretically relate the error

the RKHS space, 3) present a scalable way to control the complexity (RKHS norm)
of the discriminator for a reliable estimation of KL divergence, and 4) prove
the consistency of the proposed estimator. In three different applications of

measurements due to high frequency oscillator phase noise. Traditional methods
for beam alignment require exhaustive sweeps of all possible beam directions,
thus scale communications overhead linearly with antenna array size. For better
scaling with the large arrays required at high mmW bands, compressive sensing
methods have been proposed as their overhead scales logarithmically with the
array size. However, algorithms utilizing machine learning have shown more
efficient and more accurate alignment when using real hardware due to array
impairments. Additionally, few existing phase-less beam alignment algorithms
have been tested over varied secondary path strength in multipath channels. In

line wings with terminal velocity $>3000~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ originate from the
super star cluster (SSC) Knot A, and propagate to large radii. The object's
observed ionization parameter and stellar surface density are close to their
theoretical maxima, and radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure.
Together with a lack of evidence for supernova feedback, these imply a
radiation-dominated environment. We demonstrate that a clumpy, radiation-driven
superwind from Knot A is a viable model for generating the extreme velocities,
and in particular, that Lyman continuum and/or Ly$\alpha$ opacity must be
responsible. We find that the Mrk 71 broad wings are best fitted with power
laws, as are those of a representative extreme GP and a luminous blue variable
star, albeit with different slopes. This suggests that they may share a common

solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with convection-dominated
solutions: model reduction with implicit feature tracking. Traditional model
reduction techniques use an affine subspace to reduce the dimensionality of the
solution manifold and, as a result, yield limited reduction and require
extensive training due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of
convection-dominated problems. The proposed approach circumvents the slowly
decaying $n$-width limitation by using a nonlinear approximation manifold
systematically defined by composing a low-dimensional affine space with a space
of bijections of the underlying domain. Central to the implicit feature
tracking approach is a residual minimization problem over the reduced nonlinear
manifold that simultaneously determines the reduced coordinates in the affine
space and the domain mapping that minimize the residual of the unreduced PDE
discretization. The nonlinear trial manifold is constructed by using the
proposed residual minimization formulation to determine domain mappings that
cause parametrized features to align in a reference domain for a set of
training parameters. Because the feature is stationary in the reference domain,
i.e., the convective nature of solution removed, the snapshots are effectively
compressed to define an affine subspace. The space of domain mappings,
originally constructed using high-order finite elements, are also compressed in
a way that ensures the boundaries of the original domain are maintained.
Several numerical experiments are provided, including transonic and supersonic,
inviscid, compressible flows, to demonstrate the potential of the method to
yield accurate approximations to convection-dominated problems with limited
training.

Among MAPF planners, search-based methods, such as CBS and M*, effectively
bypass the curse of dimensionality by employing a dynamically-coupled strategy:
agents are planned in a fully decoupled manner at first, where potential
conflicts between agents are ignored; and then agents either follow their
individual plans or are coupled together for planning to resolve the conflicts
between them. In general, the number of conflicts to be resolved decides the
run time of these planners and most of the existing work focuses on how to
efficiently resolve these conflicts. In this work, we take a different view and
aim to reduce the number of conflicts (and thus improve the overall search
efficiency) by improving each agent's individual plan. By leveraging a Visual
Transformer, we develop a learning-based single-agent planner, which plans for
a single agent while paying attention to both the structure of the map and
other agents with whom conflicts may happen. We then develop a novel
multi-agent planner called LM* by integrating this learning-based single-agent
planner with M*. Our results show that for both ""seen"" and ""unseen"" maps, in

$\mathcal{D}_p$ preserves several useful metric properties, such as
completeness and separability, for $p \in [1,\infty)$, and geodesicity and

reducing their conservatism while maintaining robustness to variations in human

game-theoretic models of human behavior when assessing the safety of a
human-robot interaction. By treating the influence between the human and robot
as well as the human's rationality as unobserved latent states, we succinctly
infer the degree to which a human is following the game-theoretic interaction
model. We leverage this model to restrict the set of feasible human controls
during safety verification, enabling the robot to confidently modulate the
conservatism of its safety monitor online. Evaluations in simulated human-robot
scenarios and ablation studies demonstrate that imbuing safety monitors with
confidence-aware game-theoretic models enables both safe and efficient
human-robot interaction. Moreover, evaluations with real traffic data show that
our safety monitor is less conservative than traditional safety methods in real

than quadrupolar (tensor transverse, TT) correlations. Specifically, we find ST
correlations with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.8 that are preferred over TT
correlations (Hellings and Downs correlations) with Bayesian odds of about
20:1. However, the significance of ST correlations is reduced dramatically when
we include modeling of the Solar System ephemeris systematics and/or remove
pulsar J0030$+$0451 entirely from consideration. Even taking the nominal
signal-to-noise ratios at face value, analyses of simulated data sets show that
such values are not extremely unlikely to be observed in cases where only the
usual TT modes are present in the GWB. In the absence of a detection of any

spectral index of $\gamma = 5$ and a reference frequency of $f_\text{yr} = 1

is a member of the $R_5MX_3$ ($R$ = rare earth, $M$ = transition metal or main
group element, $X$ = Pb, Sn, Sb, In, Bi) family of chain-like compounds.
Measurements of the electrical resistivity, specific heat and magnetic
susceptibility are compared to the results of density functional calculations,
finding that La$_{5}$AgPb$_{3}$ is a non-magnetic metal with moderate
correlations. The analysis of the electrical resistivity and specific heat
measurements highlight the importance of lattice vibrations in the material,
while the calculated electron density suggests the presence of localized La and
well-hybridized Ag atoms that extend along the c-axis in the La$_{5}$AgPb$_{3}$
structure. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility is
consistent with a possible one-dimensional character of La$_{5}$AgPb$_{3}$,
where the strength of correlations is much weaker than in one-dimensional
conductors that have been previously reported.

system that supports an organization s various business processes. A conceptual
data model represents a technology-independent specification of structure of
data to be stored within a database. The model aims at providing richer
expressiveness and incorporating a set of semantics to (a) support the design,
control, and integrity parts of the data stored in data management structures
and (b) coordinate viewing of connections and ideas on a database. The
described structure of the data is often represented in an entity-relationship
(ER) model, which was one of the first data-modeling techniques and is likely
to continue to be a popular way of characterizing entity classes, attributes
and relationships. This paper is an attempt to examine the basic ER modeling
notions to analyze the concepts to which they refer as well as ways to
represent them. In such a mission, we apply a new modeling methodology
(thinging machine; TM) to ER in terms of its fundamental building constructs,
representation entities, relationships and attributes. The goal of this venture
is to further the understanding of data models and enrich their semantics.
Three specific contributions to modeling in this context are incorporated: (a)
using the TM model s five generic actions to inject processing in the ER
structure; (b) relating the single ontological element of TM modeling (i.e., a
thing/machine or thimac) to ER entities and relationships; and (c) proposing a
high-level integrated, extended ER model that includes structural and
time-oriented notions (e.g., events or behavior).

that describes which action is demonstrated in each video. We use our framework
to train predicate classifiers to identify symbolic relationships between
objects when prompted with object bounding boxes, and demonstrate that such
predicate classifiers can match the performance of those trained with full
supervision at a fraction of the labeling cost. We also apply our framework to
an existing large-scale human activity dataset, and demonstrate the ability of
these predicate classifiers trained on human data to enable closed-loop task

to its stochastic nature, which may hinder interpretability and give rise to
misleading results. We propose an interpretable neural network model,
stabilized using ensembling, with controlled variable selection for genetic
studies. The merit of the proposed method includes: (1) flexible modelling of
the non-linear effect of genetic variants to improve statistical power; (2)
multiple knockoffs in the input layer to rigorously control false discovery
rate; (3) hierarchical layers to substantially reduce the number of weight
parameters and activations to improve computational efficiency; (4)
de-randomized feature selection to stabilize identified signals. We evaluated
the proposed method in extensive simulation studies and applied it to the
analysis of Alzheimer disease genetics. We showed that the proposed method,

world knowledge, they can still produce inconsistent answers to questions when
probed, even after specialized training. As a result, it can be hard to
identify what the model actually ""believes"" about the world, making it
susceptible to inconsistent behavior and simple errors. Our goal is to reduce
these problems. Our approach is to embed a PTLM in a broader system that also
includes an evolving, symbolic memory of beliefs -- a BeliefBank -- that
records but then may modify the raw PTLM answers. We describe two mechanisms to
improve belief consistency in the overall system. First, a reasoning component
-- a weighted MaxSAT solver -- revises beliefs that significantly clash with
others. Second, a feedback component issues future queries to the PTLM using
known beliefs as context. We show that, in a controlled experimental setting,
these two mechanisms result in more consistent beliefs in the overall system,
improving both the accuracy and consistency of its answers over time. This is
significant as it is a first step towards PTLM-based architectures with a
systematic notion of belief, enabling them to construct a more coherent picture
of the world, and improve over time without model retraining.

states that are visited by the current policy, which leads to insufficient
planning in the off-policy states, and thus to convergence to suboptimal
policies. We tackle this planning issue by extending the policy gradient theory
to policy updates with respect to any state density. Under these generalized
policy updates, we show convergence to optimality under a necessary and
sufficient condition on the updates' state densities, and thereby solve the
aforementioned planning issue. We also prove asymptotic convergence rates that
significantly improve those in the policy gradient literature.
  To implement the principles prescribed by our theory, we propose an agent, Dr
Jekyll & Mr Hyde (JH), with a double personality: Dr Jekyll purely exploits
while Mr Hyde purely explores. JH's independent policies allow to record two
separate replay buffers: one on-policy (Dr Jekyll's) and one off-policy (Mr
Hyde's), and therefore to update JH's models with a mixture of on-policy and
off-policy updates. More than an algorithm, JH defines principles for
actor-critic algorithms to satisfy the requirements we identify in our
analysis. We extensively test on finite MDPs where JH demonstrates a superior
ability to recover from converging to a suboptimal policy without impairing its
speed of convergence. We also implement a deep version of the algorithm and
test it on a simple problem where it shows promising results.

ConvNet, however, may generate artifacts on out-of-distribution testing

manifestation of heating and/or energy transport events. We present statistical
characteristics of brightenings from a new detection method applied to 1330,
1400, and 2796 \AA\ IRIS slitjaw image time series. 2377 events are recorded
which coexist in all three channels, giving high confidence that they are real.
$\approx$1800 of these are spatially coherent, equating to event densities of
$\sim9.7\times10^{-5}$arcsec$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ within a
$90\arcsec\times100\arcsec$ FOV over 34.5 minutes. Power Law indices estimates
are determined for total brightness ($2.78<\alpha<3.71$), maximum brightness
($3.84<\alpha<4.70$), and average area ($4.31<\alpha<5.70$) distributions.
Duration and speed distributions do not obey a power law. A correlation is
found between the events' spatial fragmentation, area, and duration, and a weak
relationship with total brightness, showing that larger/longer-lasting events
are more likely to fragment during their lifetime. Speed distributions show
that all events are in motion, with an average speed of $\sim7$\kms. The
events' spatial trajectories suggest that cooler 2796 \AA\ events tend to
appear slightly later, and occupy a different position/trajectory to the hotter
channel results. This suggests that either many of these are impulsive events
caused by reconnection, with subsequent rapid cooling, or that the triggering
event occurs near the TR, with a subsequent propagating disturbance to cooler
atmospheric layers. The spatial distribution of events is not uniform, with
broad regions devoid of events. A comparison of spatial distribution with
properties of other atmospheric layers shows a tentative connection between
high magnetic field strength, the corona's multithermality, and high IRIS
brightening activity.

This paper is the first to explore a circuit-theoretic approach for an

nearly a quarter of the United States war veterans who return from war zones.
Treatment for PTSD typically consists of a combination of in-session therapy

symptoms outside of therapy sessions. Mobile health applications may address
this gap, but their effectiveness is limited by the current gap in continuous
monitoring and detection capabilities enabling timely intervention. The goal of
this article is to develop a novel method to detect hyperarousal events using
physiological and activity-based machine learning algorithms. Physiological
data including heart rate and body acceleration as well as self-reported
hyperarousal events were collected using a tool developed for commercial
off-the-shelf wearable devices from 99 United States veterans diagnosed with
PTSD over several days. The data were used to develop four machine learning
algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and
XGBoost. The XGBoost model had the best performance in detecting onset of PTSD
symptoms with over 83% accuracy and an AUC of 0.70. Post-hoc SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) additive explanation analysis showed that algorithm
predictions were correlated with average heart rate, minimum heart rate and
average body acceleration. Findings show promise in detecting onset of PTSD
symptoms which could be the basis for developing remote and continuous
monitoring systems for PTSD. Such systems may address a vital gap in
just-in-time interventions for PTSD self-management outside of scheduled

theoretical development that clustered mammalian cells respond differently to

EGF gradients promoted tumor cell detachment from the spheroid core, and the
position of the tumor spheroid core showed a mild chemotactic response towards
the EGF gradients. For those tumor cells detached from the spheroids, they
showed an enhanced chemokinesis response in contrast to previous experimental
results using single cells embedded within an ECM. No discernible chemotactic

measure is inspired by MPdist which has been previously proposed for such

constructed using non-linear kernel distances. Also, kdiff accounts for both
self and cross similarities across the instances and is defined using a lower
quantile of the distance distribution. Comparing the cross similarity to self
similarity allows for measures of similarity that are more robust to noise and
partial occlusions of the relevant signals. Our proposed measure kdiff is a
more general form of the well known kernel-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
distance estimated over the embeddings. Some theoretical results are provided
for separability conditions using kdiff as a distance measure for clustering

histopathology image segmentation, given the relatively low number of digitized

remains a key challenge for properly validating models. Here, tooling and
datasets to benchmark model performance across histopathological domains are
lacking. To address this limitation, we introduce MetaHistoSeg - a Python
framework that implements unique scenarios in both meta learning and instance
based transfer learning. Designed for easy extension to customized datasets and
task sampling schemes, the framework empowers researchers with the ability of
rapid model design and experimentation. We also curate a histopathology meta
dataset - a benchmark dataset for training and validating models on
out-of-distribution performance across a range of cancer types. In experiments
we showcase the usage of MetaHistoSeg with the meta dataset and find that both
meta-learning and instance based transfer learning deliver comparable results
on average, but in some cases tasks can greatly benefit from one over the

optimization problems, where the gradients are computed with the aid of an
auxiliary variable under samples generated by time-varying Markov random
processes parameterized by the underlying optimization variable. These
time-varying samples make gradient directions in our update biased and
dependent, which can potentially lead to the divergence of the iterates. In our
two-time-scale approach, one scale is to estimate the true gradient from these
samples, which is then used to update the estimate of the optimal solution.
While these two iterates are implemented simultaneously, the former is updated
""faster"" (using bigger step sizes) than the latter (using smaller step sizes).
Our first contribution is to characterize the finite-time complexity of the
proposed two-time-scale stochastic gradient method. In particular, we provide
explicit formulas for the convergence rates of this method under different
structural assumptions, namely, strong convexity, convexity, the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, and general non-convexity.
  We apply our framework to two problems in control and reinforcement learning.
First, we look at the standard online actor-critic algorithm over finite state
and action spaces and derive a convergence rate of O(k^(-2/5)), which recovers
the best known rate derived specifically for this problem. Second, we study an
online actor-critic algorithm for the linear-quadratic regulator and show that
a convergence rate of O(k^(-2/3)) is achieved. This is the first time such a
result is known in the literature. Finally, we support our theoretical analysis
with numerical simulations where the convergence rates are visualized.

electric field $E_r$ in a tokamak edge plasma. In particular, this effect is
emphasized in diverted tokamaks with a magnetic X point. In neoclassical
equilibria, Coulomb collisions can scatter ions onto loss orbits and generate a
radially outward current, which in steady state is balanced by the radially
inward current from viscosity. To quantitatively measure this loss-orbit
current in an edge pedestal, an ion-orbit-flux diagnostic has been implemented
in the axisymmetric version of the gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC. As
the first application of this diagnostic, a neoclassical DIII-D H-mode plasma
is studied using gyrokinetic ions and adiabatic electrons. The validity of the
diagnostic is demonstrated by studying the collisional relaxation of $E_r$ in
the core. After this demonstration, the loss-orbit current is numerically
measured in the edge pedestal in quasisteady state. In this plasma, it is found
that the radial electric force on ions from $E_r$ approximately balances the
ion radial pressure gradient in the edge pedestal, with the radial force from
the plasma flow term being a minor component. The effect of orbit loss on $E_r$
is found to be only mild. How ion orbit loss will affect $E_r$ in the
full-current ITER plasma pedestal is left as a subsequent study topic.

machine learning performance in data-rich (target) domains where ground truth
labels are inaccessible but can be found in related (source) domains. In cases
where meta-domain information such as label distributions is available, weak
supervision can further boost performance. We propose a novel framework, CALDA,
to tackle these two problems. CALDA synergistically combines the principles of
contrastive learning and adversarial learning to robustly support multi-source
UDA (MS-UDA) for time series data. Similar to prior methods, CALDA utilizes
adversarial learning to align source and target feature representations. Unlike
prior approaches, CALDA additionally leverages cross-source label information
across domains. CALDA pulls examples with the same label close to each other,
while pushing apart examples with different labels, reshaping the space through
contrastive learning. Unlike prior contrastive adaptation methods, CALDA
requires neither data augmentation nor pseudo labeling, which may be more
challenging for time series. We empirically validate our proposed approach.
Based on results from human activity recognition, electromyography, and
synthetic datasets, we find utilizing cross-source information improves
performance over prior time series and contrastive methods. Weak supervision
further improves performance, even in the presence of noise, allowing CALDA to
offer generalizable strategies for MS-UDA. Code is available at:

between its transparent host (i.e., the incidence medium) and an amplifying (or
gainy) second medium, the incident beam splits into a reflected wave and a
transmitted wave. In general, there is a sign ambiguity in connection with the
k-vector of the transmitted beam, which requires at the outset that one decide
whether the transmitted beam should grow or decay as it recedes from the
interface. The question has been posed and addressed most prominently in the
context of incidence at large angles from a dielectric medium of high
refractive index onto a gain medium of lower refractive index. Here, the
relevant sign of the transmitted k-vector determines whether the
evanescent-like waves within the gain medium exponentially grow or decay away
from the interface. We examine this and related problems in a more general
setting, where the incident beam is taken to be a finite-duration wavepacket
whose footprint in the interfacial plane has a finite width. Cases of
reflection from and transmission through a gainy slab of finite-thickness as
well as those associated with a semi-infinite gain medium will be considered.
The broadness of the spatiotemporal spectrum of our incident wavepacket demands
that we develop a general strategy for deciding the signs of all the k-vectors
that enter the gain medium. Such a strategy emerges from a consideration of the
causality constraint that is naturally imposed on both the reflected and
transmitted wavepackets.

achieved at a measure which is a point mass, meaning sample configurations are
asymptotically orthogonal up to a magnetic field correction. At low
temperatures, though, a very different behavior emerges known as replica
symmetry breaking (RSB). The deep wells in the energy landscape create more
rigid structure, and the optimal overlap measure is no longer a point mass. The
exact size of its support remains in many cases an open problem.
  Here we consider these themes for multi-species spherical spin glasses.
Following a companion work in which we establish the Parisi variational

Namely, if RSB occurs for one species, does it necessarily occur for other
species as well? We provide sufficient conditions for the answer to be yes. For
instance, we show that if two species share any quadratic interaction, then RSB

Thus the HQSP is driven through the Kondo effect from light quarks coupling
with the magnetic field in quark matter. For demonstration, we employ the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type model under a magnetic field, and investigate the HQSP
within the linear response theory with vertex corrections required by the

extract sparse landmarks to represent the target organ anatomical topology and
discard the redundant information that is unnecessary for motion estimation.
For this purpose, we introduce an unsupervised 3D landmark detection network to

displacement from the extracted sparse landmarks of two images of different

quality in light-weight yet effective iterative optimization. We evaluate our
method on two dynamic medical imaging tasks to model cardiac motion and lung

the equations of motion. In this study, we compute tori corresponding to
exterior Jupiter-Europa and interior Jupiter-Ganymede PCRTBP resonant periodic
orbits in a concentric circular restricted 4-body problem (CCR4BP). Motivated
by the 2:1 Laplace resonance between Europa and Ganymede's orbits, we then
attempt the continuation of a Jupiter-Europa 3:4 resonant orbit from the CCR4BP
into the Jupiter-Ganymede PCRTBP. We strongly believe that the resulting
dynamical object is a KAM torus lying near but not on the 3:2 Jupiter-Ganymede
resonance.

the news so that they can take corresponding protective measures. However, the
fake news is flooding and is a serious issue especially under the global

individuals and the society. COVID-19 fake news detection has become a novel
and important task in the NLP field. However, fake news always contain the
correct portion and the incorrect portion. This fact increases the difficulty
of the classification task. In this paper, we fine tune the pre-trained
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as our
base model. We add BiLSTM layers and CNN layers on the top of the finetuned
BERT model with frozen parameters or not frozen parameters methods
respectively. The model performance evaluation results showcase that our best

state-of-the-art results towards COVID-19 fake news detection task. We also
explore keywords evaluation methods using our best model and evaluate the model

to NUV/optical magnitudes assuming a blackbody spectrum and support this

valuable to compare with pre-explosion imaging for future supernovae, though we
emphasize the observational difficulty of detecting extremely blue companions.
The pre-explosion source detected in association with SN 2012Z has been
interpreted as a helium star binary containing an initially ultra-massive WD in
a multi-day orbit. However, extending our binary models to initial CO WD masses
of up to $1.2\,M_{\odot}$, we find that these systems undergo off-center carbon
ignitions and thus are not expected to produce thermonuclear supernovae. This
tension suggests that, if SN 2012Z is associated with a helium star - WD
binary, then the pre-explosion optical light from the system must be
significantly modified by the binary environment and/or the WD does not have a

First, each RGB-D pair is consistently segmented into 2D semantic maps based on
a camera tracking backbone that propagates objects' labels with high
probabilities from full scans to corresponding ones of partial views. Then a
dense 3D mesh model of an unknown environment is incrementally generated from
the input RGB-D sequence. Benefiting from 2D consistent semantic segments and
the 3D model, a novel semantic projection block (SP-Block) is proposed to
extract deep feature volumes from 2D segments of different views. Moreover, the

the coupled Stokes-Darcy problem on simplicial meshes. The proposed formulation
is locally conservative. A mixed-type DG method in conjunction with the
stress-velocity formulation is employed for the Stokes equations, where the
symmetry of stress is strongly imposed. The staggered DG method is exploited to
discretize the Darcy equations. As such, the discrete formulation can be easily
adapted to account for the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman interface conditions without
introducing additional variables. Importantly, the continuity of normal
velocity is satisfied exactly at the discrete level. A rigorous convergence
analysis is performed for all the variables. Then we devise and analyze a
domain decomposition method via the use of Robin-type interface boundary
conditions, which allows us to solve the Stokes subproblem and the Darcy
subproblem sequentially with low computational costs. The convergence of the
proposed iterative method is analyzed rigorously. In particular, the proposed
iterative method also works for very small viscosity coefficient. Finally,
several numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the capabilities
and accuracy of the novel mixed-type scheme, and the convergence of the domain
decomposition method.

concise synopsis of the original video based on the user query, which is

compressed bitstream is decoded into a series of parameters that instantiate a

produce diverse reconstructions, among which some have higher signal fidelity

data sharing is increasingly locking horns with data-privacy concerns.
Differential privacy has emerged as a rigorous framework for protecting
individual privacy in a statistical database, while releasing useful
statistical information about the database. The standard way to implement
differential privacy is to inject a sufficient amount of noise into the data.
However, in addition to other limitations of differential privacy, this process
of adding noise will affect data accuracy and utility. Another approach to
enable privacy in data sharing is based on the concept of synthetic data. The
goal of synthetic data is to create an as-realistic-as-possible dataset, one
that not only maintains the nuances of the original data, but does so without
risk of exposing sensitive information. The combination of differential privacy
with synthetic data has been suggested as a best-of-both-worlds solutions. In
this work, we propose the first noisefree method to construct differentially
private synthetic data; we do this through a mechanism called ""private
sampling"". Using the Boolean cube as benchmark data model, we derive explicit
bounds on accuracy and privacy of the constructed synthetic data. The key
mathematical tools are hypercontractivity, duality, and empirical processes. A
core ingredient of our private sampling mechanism is a rigorous ""marginal
correction"" method, which has the remarkable property that importance
reweighting can be utilized to exactly match the marginals of the sample to the
marginals of the population.

  For general dimension $d$, we identify, with proof, the asymptotic

shorten the response time by a third compared to a widely used linear policy,

contribute to addressing these concerns by developing bounds and heuristics
based on auxiliary multinomial logit (MNL) models. More precisely, we first
provide easily computable upper and lower bounds for the unconstrained
assortment optimization problem (TAOP) for every regular choice model and then
extend the bounds to important versions of the constrained problem. We next
provide an upper bound on the expected revenue of a clairvoyant firm that
offers to each consumer the most profitable product that she is willing to buy.
We then use the upper bound to assess the maximum benefits of personalization
relative to a firm that does not personalize assortments. The standard prophet
inequality is then used to show that the ratio is at most 2 for discrete choice
models with {\em independent} value gaps. For random utility models with
dependent value gaps the ratio can be as large as the number of products. We
find sufficient conditions to show that the prophet inequality holds for the
$\alpha$-shaken multinomial logit ($\alpha$-MNL), a generalization of the MNL
introduced here, that has the MNL and the generalized attraction model (GAM) as
special cases. The prophet inequality also holds for the some versions of the
Nested Logit model. For the latent-class MNL, the ratio is at most 1.5 when the
coefficient of variation of the utilities goes to infinity. We show that
consumers do not necessarily suffer under a clairvoyant firm and in fact their
surplus may improve. On the other hand, when the clairvoyant firm has pricing
power it can extract all of the consumers' surplus. We show that for the MNL
model the clairvoyant can make up to $e$ times more than its non-clairvoyant
counterpart.

face new attack traffic known as zero-day attacks, that are not used in the
training of the learning models due to their non-existence at the time. In this
paper, a zero-shot learning methodology has been proposed to evaluate the ML
model performance in the detection of zero-day attack scenarios. In the
attribute learning stage, the ML models map the network data features to
distinguish semantic attributes from known attack (seen) classes. In the
inference stage, the models are evaluated in the detection of zero-day attack
(unseen) classes by constructing the relationships between known attacks and
zero-day attacks. A new metric is defined as Zero-day Detection Rate, which
measures the effectiveness of the learning model in the inference stage. The
results demonstrate that while the majority of the attack classes do not
represent significant risks to organisations adopting an ML-based NIDS in a
zero-day attack scenario. However, for certain attack groups identified in this
paper, such systems are not effective in applying the learnt attributes of
attack behaviour to detect them as malicious. Further Analysis was conducted
using the Wasserstein Distance technique to measure how different such attacks

usually causes interfacial mixing of the constituent atoms, possibly leading to
the formation of binary alloys at the interfaces. Magnetron sputtered c-Ni/a-Zr
multilayers deposited at room temperature were vacuum annealed isochronally at
200degC and 400degC to observe thermal stability of the interfaces constituting
the crystalline/amorphous multilayers. Control over the interfacial behaviour
can aid the formation of materials with novel properties. The resultant changes
in structural and magnetic properties of the multilayers were investigated in
detail through X-ray Reflectivity, Polarized Neutron Reflectivity, SIMS and
SQUID-based magnetization measurement techniques. The compositional variations
in the amorphous mixed layers formed at the Ni-on-Zr and Zr-on-Ni interfaces
due to atomic transport, were carefully observed as a function of annealing.
Interface widths proceeded to increase with annealing at the expense of the Ni
and Zr layers. The Ni-on-Zr interface was seen to be unstable at both
temperatures; but the overall response of the interfaces to atomic diffusion
was more pronounced when the multilayers were annealed at 400degC. Under
conditions of supersaturation of atoms within restricted spaces of the
interfacial layers and the limited availability of components within the

of communication and interaction. On these platforms, discussions in the form
of trending topics provide a glimpse of events happening around the world in
real-time. Also, these trends are used for political campaigns, public
awareness, and brand promotions. Consequently, these trends are sensitive to
manipulation by malicious users who aim to mislead the mass audience. In this
article, we identify and study the characteristics of users involved in the
manipulation of Twitter trends in Pakistan. We propose 'Manipify', a framework
for automatic detection and analysis of malicious users for Twitter trends. Our
framework consists of three distinct modules: i) user classifier, ii) hashtag
classifier, and ii) trend analyzer. The user classifier introduces a novel
approach to automatically detect manipulators using tweet content and user
behaviour features. Also, the module classifies human and bot users. Next, the
hashtag classifier categorizes trending hashtags into six categories assisting
in examining manipulators behaviour across different categories. Finally, the
trend analyzer module examines users, hashtags, and tweets for hashtag reach,
linguistic features and user behaviour. Our user classifier module achieves
0.91 accuracy in classifying the manipulators. We further test Manipify on the
dataset comprising of 665 trending hashtags with 5.4 million tweets and 1.9
million users. The analysis of trends reveals that the trending panel is mostly
dominated by political hashtags. In addition, our results show a higher
contribution of human accounts in trend manipulation as compared to bots.
Furthermore, we present two case studies of hashtag-wars and anti-state
propaganda to implicate the real-world application of our research.

existing methods based on Electrical Network-on-Chip (ENoC) cannot fit in ONoC

Simulation results show that the average prediction error for the optimal

challenged by the highly stochastic, bursty nature of gene expression revealed
at single-cell level. In previous work, we described a promising strategy in
which network inference is seen as a calibration procedure for a mechanistic

input allows one to recover an $O(\Delta^2)$ coloring via a deterministic

drawings. In this paper we consider good drawings, i.e., we require that any
two edges have at most one common point which can be a common vertex or a
crossing. Our main result is that there is a polynomial time algorithm to
compute an 8-approximation of the bundled crossing number of a good drawing (up
to adding a term depending on the facial structure of the drawing). In the
special case of circular drawings the approximation factor is 8 (no extra

crossings in embedded graphs, Proc. Latin'16). Our approach also works with the

a fairly weak condition, the Stackelberg equilibrium is explicitly obtained by
first solving a forward stochastic LQ optimal control problem (SLQ problem, for

optical systems as inexpensive and effective inverse design approaches. Optical
properties (e.g., band-gap properties) of photonic crystals (PCs) are closely
associated with characteristics of their light reflection spectra. Finding
optimal PC constructions (within a pre-specified parameter space) that generate
reflection spectra closest to a targeted spectrum is thus an interesting and
meaningful inverse design problem, although relevant studies are still limited.
Here we report a generally effective machine learning-based inverse design
approach for one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs), focusing on visible
light spectra which are of high practical relevance. For a given class of 1DPC
system, a deep neural network (DNN) in a unified structure is first trained
over data from sizeable forward calculations (from layer thicknesses to
spectrum). An iterative optimization scheme is then developed based on a
coherent integration of DNN backward predictions (from spectrum to layer
thicknesses), forward calculations, and Monte Carlo moves. We employ this new
approach to four representative 1DPC systems including periodic structures with
two-, three-, and four-layer repeating units and a heterostructure. The
approach successfully converges to solutions of optimal 1DPC constructions for
various targeted spectra regardless of their exact achievability. As two
demonstrating examples, inverse designs toward a specially constructed
""rectangle-shaped"" green-light or red-light reflection spectrum are presented

efficiently find out optimal layer thicknesses even when they are far outside

Particularly, synchrotron radiation induced effects in a magnetic dispersive
beamline element can lead to collective beam instabilities and emittance
growth. A novel beam dynamic code is developed based on a Lagrangian method for
the calculation of the particles' radiation near-fields using wavefront/wavelet
meshes via the Green's function of the Maxwell equations. These fields are then
interpolated onto a moving mesh for dynamic update of the beam. This method
allows radiation co-propagation and self-consistent interaction with the beam
in the simulation at greatly reduced numerical errors. Multiple levels of
parallelisms are inherent in this method and implemented in our code CoSyR to
enable at-scale simulations of nonlinear beam dynamics on modern computing
platforms using MPI, multi-threading, and GPUs. CoSyR has been used to evaluate
the transverse and longitudinal coherent radiation effects on the beam and to
investigate beam optics designs proposed for mitigation of beam brightness
degradation in a magnetic bunch compressor. In this paper, the design of CoSyR,
as well as the benchmark with other coherent synchrotron radiation models, are

Employing the regularity compensation oscillation (RCO) technique which

the learning between the multiple RIS subarrays, which speeds up the learning
convergence and highly reduces the computational complexity for large RIS

learning and statistics to quantify the distance between two distributions in
the $p$-dimensional Euclidean space. The asymptotic property of the sample MMD
has been well studied when the dimension $p$ is fixed using the theory of
U-statistic. As motivated by the frequent use of MMD test for data of
moderate/high dimension, we propose to investigate the behavior of the sample
MMD in a high-dimensional environment and develop a new studentized test
statistic. Specifically, we obtain the central limit theorems for the
studentized sample MMD as both the dimension $p$ and sample sizes $n,m$ diverge
to infinity. Our results hold for a wide range of kernels, including popular
Gaussian and Laplacian kernels, and also cover energy distance as a special

and our results suggest that the accuracy of normal approximation can improve
with dimensionality. Additionally, we provide a general theory on the power
analysis under the alternative hypothesis and show that our proposed test can
detect difference between two distributions in the moderately high dimensional

two-dimensional systems, in this work, we take the initial step toward the
systematic understanding of hinge and corner charges in three-dimensional
insulators. We consider five crystal shapes of vertex-transitive polyhedra with
the cubic symmetry such as a cube, an octahedron and a cuboctahedron. We derive
real-space formulas for the hinge and corner charges in terms of the electric
charges associated with bulk Wyckoff positions. We find that both the hinge and
corner charges can be predicted from the bulk perspective only modulo certain
fractions depending on the crystal shape, because the relaxation near
boundaries of the crystal may affect the fractional parts. In particular, we
show that a fractionally quantized charge $1/24$ mod $1/12$ in the unit of
elementary charge can appear in a crystal with a shape of a truncated cube or a
truncated octahedron. We also investigate momentum-space formulas for the hinge

bands at high-symmetry momenta are not sufficient to determine the corner
charge. We introduce an additional Wilson-loop invariant to resolve this issue.

THz ISAC meets stringent challenges on waveform and receiver design to fully

sensing integrated discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (SI-DFT-s-OFDM) system is proposed for THz ISAC, which
can provide lower peak-to-average power ratio than OFDM and is adaptive to
flexible delay spread of the THz channel. Without compromising communication
capabilities, the proposed SI-DFT-s-OFDM realizes millimeter-level range

addition, the bit error rate (BER) performance is improved by 5 dB gain at the
$10^{-3}$ BER level compared with OFDM. At the receiver, a deep learning based
ISAC receiver with two neural networks is developed to recover transmitted data

flipped to ferromagnetic (FM) coupling either Ising-type along c-axis or
XY-type within ab-plane. Theoretical calculations reveal that the energy
bandgap narrows from 0.39 eV to 0.11 eV, accompanying a transition from

respectively. Thus, gigantic negative MR ratio of -90% is obtained at 10 K.
More importantly, the decrement of R along H//c is far quicker than that of
H//ab because the MAE of Ising-FM state is 1017 {\mu}eV/Cr3+ lower than that of
XY-FM. The distinct trends result in the AMR ratio of 732% at 10 K, which is

functions relevant for lattice calculations of the nucleon electromagnetic form
factors are studied in chiral perturbation theory. To leading order the results
depend on a few experimentally known low-energy constants only, and the
nucleon-pion-state contribution to the form factors can be estimated. The
nucleon-pion-state contribution to the electric form factor $G_{\rm E}(Q^2)$ is
at the +5 percent level for a source-sink separation of 2 fm, and it increases
with increasing momentum transfer $Q^2$. For the magnetic form factor the
nucleon-pion-state contribution leads to an underestimation of $G_{\rm M}(Q^2)$
by about $-5$ percent that decreases with increasing $Q^2$. For smaller
source-sink separations that are accessible in present-day lattice simulations
the impact is larger. Although the ChPT results may not be applicable for these
time separations a comparison with recent lattice data works reasonably well.

  Optimization",,,,,"math.OC econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nash equilibria and Pareto optimality are two distinct concepts when dealing
with multiple criteria. It is well known that the two concepts do not coincide.
However, in this work we show that it is possible to characterize the set of
all Nash equilibria for any non-cooperative game as the Pareto optimal
solutions of a certain vector optimization problem. To accomplish this task, we
increase the dimensionality of the objective function and formulate a
non-convex ordering cone under which Nash equilibria are Pareto efficient. We
demonstrate these results, first, for shared constraint games in which a joint
constraint is applied to all players in a non-cooperative game. In doing so, we
directly relate our proposed Pareto optimal solutions to the best response
functions of each player. These results are then extended to generalized Nash
games, where, in addition to providing an extension of the above
characterization, we deduce two vector optimization problems providing
necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for generalized Nash
equilibria. Finally, we show that all prior results hold for vector-valued
games as well. Multiple numerical examples are given and demonstrate that our
proposed vector optimization formulation readily finds the set of all Nash
equilibria.

during interphase, share essential features with a knot-free condensed polymer
known as the fractal globule (FG). The FG-like chromosome likely affects
macromolecular transport, yet its characteristics remain poorly understood.
Using computer simulations and scaling analysis, we show that the 3D folding
and macromolecular size of the chromosomes determine their transport
characteristics. Large-scale subdiffusion occurs at a critical particle size
where the network of accessible volumes is critically connected. Condensed
chromosomes have connectivity networks akin to simple Bernoulli bond
percolation clusters, regardless of the polymer models. However, even if the
network structures are similar, the tracer's walk dimension varies. It turns
out that the walk dimension depends on the network topology of the accessible
volume and dynamic heterogeneity of the tracer's hopping rate. We find that the
FG structure has a smaller walk dimension than other random geometries,
suggesting that the FG-like chromosome structure accelerates macromolecular
diffusion and target-search.

also supported by molecular dynamics calculations. At $T=600$ K, the estimated
self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ ($D_{Li}$) in the $ab$ plane

that along the $c$ axis [$D^{c}_{Li}=(4.4\pm0.3)\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^2$/s],
suggesting quasi-isotropic diffusion, that is, the three-dimensional diffusion
of Li$^+$ ions. The decrease in $D_{Li}$ with decreasing $T$ was reasonably
explained by a thermal activation process with the activation energy determined
from ionic-conductivity measurements. Furthermore, the estimated values of the
self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ ions are comparable to those in the
sulfide-based Li$^+$ ion conductor, Li$_{7}$P$_{3}$S$_{11}$, although its ionic

Combined with ON, these cognitive features allow devices to act as proxies in
the cyber-world of their users and exchange knowledge to deliver awareness of

We consider the extent to which this knowledge becomes available to

assessed taking into account a wide range of cognitive parameters. Outcomes are
important because this functionality could support a new type of recommendation

one qubit is excited and the other in the ground state, but it is undefined
which is the excited qubit. Then, after some time, if a photon is detected, we
know that it must have experienced an emission by one atom and then an
absorption and re-emission by the other one, but the ordering of the emission
events by both qubits is undefined. While it is tempting to refer to this
scenario as one with indefinite causality or a superposition of causal orders,
we show that there is still a precise notion of causality: the probability of
excitation of each atom is totally independent of the other one when the times
are short enough to prevent photon exchange.

  Workflow and Skill Analysis with the HeiChole Benchmark",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  PURPOSE: Surgical workflow and skill analysis are key technologies for the
next generation of cognitive surgical assistance systems. These systems could
increase the safety of the operation through context-sensitive warnings and
semi-autonomous robotic assistance or improve training of surgeons via
data-driven feedback. In surgical workflow analysis up to 91% average precision
has been reported for phase recognition on an open data single-center dataset.
In this work we investigated the generalizability of phase recognition
algorithms in a multi-center setting including more difficult recognition tasks
such as surgical action and surgical skill. METHODS: To achieve this goal, a
dataset with 33 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos from three surgical centers
with a total operation time of 22 hours was created. Labels included annotation
of seven surgical phases with 250 phase transitions, 5514 occurences of four
surgical actions, 6980 occurences of 21 surgical instruments from seven
instrument categories and 495 skill classifications in five skill dimensions.
The dataset was used in the 2019 Endoscopic Vision challenge, sub-challenge for
surgical workflow and skill analysis. Here, 12 teams submitted their machine
learning algorithms for recognition of phase, action, instrument and/or skill
assessment. RESULTS: F1-scores were achieved for phase recognition between
23.9% and 67.7% (n=9 teams), for instrument presence detection between 38.5%
and 63.8% (n=8 teams), but for action recognition only between 21.8% and 23.3%
(n=5 teams). The average absolute error for skill assessment was 0.78 (n=1
team). CONCLUSION: Surgical workflow and skill analysis are promising
technologies to support the surgical team, but are not solved yet, as shown by
our comparison of algorithms. This novel benchmark can be used for comparable
evaluation and validation of future work.

propose an augmented reality navigation system for visual prosthesis that
incorporates a software of reactive navigation and path planning which guides
the subject through convenient, obstacle-free route. It consists on four steps:
locating the subject on a map, planning the subject trajectory, showing it to
the subject and re-planning without obstacles. We have also designed a
simulated prosthetic vision environment which allows us to systematically study
navigation performance. Twelve subjects participated in the experiment.
Subjects were guided by the augmented reality navigation system and their
instruction was to navigate through different environments until they reached
two goals, cross the door and find an object (bin), as fast and accurately as
possible. Results show how our augmented navigation system help navigation
performance by reducing the time and distance to reach the goals, even
significantly reducing the number of obstacles collisions, compared to other
baseline methods.

the growth of data generated by localized interactions between users mobile
devices, and between them and nearby devices such as IoT nodes. In ONs, the
spontaneous collaboration among mobile devices is exploited to disseminate data
toward interested users. However, the limited resources and knowledge available
at each node, and the vast amount of data available, make it difficult to
devise efficient schemes to accomplish this task. Recent solutions propose to
equip each device with data filtering methods derived from human data
processing schemes, known as Cognitive Heuristics, i.e. very effective methods
used by the brain to quickly drop useless information, while keeping the most
relevant one. These solutions can become less effective when facing dynamic
scenarios or situations where nodes cannot fully collaborate. One of the
reasons is that the solutions proposed so far do not take take into account the
social structure of the environment where the nodes move in. To be more
effective, the selection of information performed by each node should take into
consideration this dimension of the environment. In this paper we propose a
social-based data dissemination scheme, based on the cognitive Social Circle
Heuristic. This evaluation method exploits the structure of the social
environment to make inferences about the relevance of discovered information.
We show how the Social Circle Heuristic, coupled with a cognitive-based
community detection scheme, can be exploited to design an effective data
dissemination algorithm for ONs. We provide a detailed analysis of the
performance of the proposed solution via simulation.

problem on shape space. Shape space is the relational configuration space of
the system obtained by quotienting ordinary configuration space with respect to
the similarity group of total translations, rotations, and scalings. For the
zero-energy gravitating N-body system, the dynamics on shape space can be
constructed explicitly and the points of total collision, which are the points
of central configuration and zero shape momenta, can be analyzed in detail. It
turns out that, even on shape space where scale is not part of the description,
the equations of motion diverge at (and only at) the points of total collision.
We construct and study the stratified total-collision manifold and show that,
at the points of total collision on shape space, the singularity is essential.
There is, thus, no way to evolve the solutions through these points. This
mirrors closely the big bang singularity of general relativity, where the
homogeneous-but-not-isotropic cosmological model of Bianchi IX shows an
essential singularity at the big bang. A simple modification of the
general-relativistic model (the addition of a stiff matter field) changes the
system into one whose shape-dynamical description allows for a deterministic
evolution through the singularity. We suspect that, similarly, some
modification of the dynamics would be required in order to regularize the total
collision singularity of the N-body model.

Therefore, how to improve the system capacity with limited RIS elements is
essential. Unlike the classical regular RIS whose elements are arranged on a

formulate a joint topology and precoding optimization problem to maximize the

optimization algorithm with low complexity is proposed to alternately optimize
the RIS topology and the precoding design. Particularly, a tabu search-based
method is used to design the irregular RIS topology, and a neighbor
extraction-based cross-entropy method is introduced to optimize the precoding
design. Simulation results demonstrate that, subject to the constraint of

bio-inspired sensors that mimic the working of the human eye. Unlike
conventional frame-based cameras, these sensors capture a stream of
asynchronous 'events' that pose multiple advantages over the former, like high
dynamic range, low latency, low power consumption, and reduced motion blur.
However, these advantages come at a high cost, as the event camera data
typically contains more noise and has low resolution. Moreover, as event-based
cameras can only capture the relative changes in brightness of a scene, event
data do not contain usual visual information (like texture and color) as
available in video data from normal cameras. So, moving object detection in
event-based cameras becomes an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we
present an unsupervised Graph Spectral Clustering technique for Moving Object
Detection in Event-based data (GSCEventMOD). We additionally show how the
optimum number of moving objects can be automatically determined. Experimental
comparisons on publicly available datasets show that the proposed GSCEventMOD

is a real and ultimately connected to (classical) gravity has been debated for
decades, with main contributions by Di\'osi and Penrose. In particular, Di\'osi
proposed a noise-based dynamical reduction model, which captures the same
orders of magnitude for the collapse time suggested by Penrose based on
heuristic arguments. This is known in literature as the DP model
(Di\'osi-Penrose). A peculiarity of the DP model is the prediction of
spontaneous heating of matter, which can be tested without the need for massive
quantum superpositions. Notably, a very similar effect is predicted by recent
theoretical approaches to gravity as a classical-only information channel.
Here, we reconsider the current constraints on the DP model from spontaneous
heating, by analyzing experimental situations not properly considered before.
We argue that the the parameter-free version of the DP model is close to be
ruled out by standard heat leak measurements at ultralow temperature, with a
conclusive exclusion likely within reach with existing technology. This result
would strengthen a recent claim of exclusion inferred by spontaneous x-ray
emission experiments, which relies on the somewhat stronger assumption that the
DP noise field is white up to x-ray frequencies.

technique to investigate the distribution of hydrogen in metals. However, the
presence of hydrogen in the analysis of almost all specimens from nearly all
material systems has caused numerous debates as to its origins and impact on
the quantitativeness of the measurement. It is often perceived that most H
arises from residual gas ionization, therefore affecting primarily materials
with a relatively low evaporation field. In this work, we perform systematic
investigations to identify the origin of H residuals in APT experiments by
combining density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and APT measurements on
an alkali and a noble metal, namely Na and Pt, respectively. We report that no
H residual is found in Na metal samples, but in Pt, which has a higher
evaporation field, a relatively high signal of H is detected. These results
contradict the hypothesis of the H signal being due to direct ionization of
residual H$_2$ without much interaction with the specimen's surface. Based on
DFT, we demonstrate that alkali metals are thermodynamically less likely to be
subject to H contamination under APT-operating conditions compared to
transition or noble metals. These insights indicate that the detected H-signal
is not only from ionization of residual gaseous H$_2$ alone, but is strongly
influenced by material-specific physical properties. The origin of H residuals
is elucidated by considering different conditions encountered during APT
experiments, specifically, specimen-preparation, transportation, and
APT-operating conditions by taking thermodynamic and kinetic aspects into
account.

irrespective to their components, behave as if they are molecules composed of
some kind of atoms, instead of being an amorphous mixture of quantum particles.
In the case of the muonic and the positronic molecules computational studies
reveal that the AIM structures of these systems are well-captured by the EBC.
Beyond identifying atomic basins, both QTAIM and MC-QTAIM attribute properties
to AIM, which is their share from the molecular expectation values of quantum
observables. It is demonstrated that not only the share from the average value
of an observable may be attributed to an atomic basin, but also the fluctuation
of each basin property is also quantifiable.

potential risks to numerous applications, e.g., self-driving car. Among attacks
regularized by $\ell_p$ norm, $\ell_0$-attack aims to modify as few pixels as
possible. Nevertheless, the problem is nontrivial since it generally requires
to optimize the shape along with the texture simultaneously, which is an
NP-hard problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of
Adversarial Semantic Contour (ASC) guided by object contour as prior. With this
prior, we reduce the searching space to accelerate the $\ell_0$ optimization,
and also introduce more semantic information which should affect the detectors
more. Based on the contour, we optimize the selection of modified pixels via
sampling and their colors with gradient descent alternately. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed ASC outperforms the most commonly
manually designed patterns (e.g., square patches and grids) on task of

and consider the setting where any agent is allowed to introduce diversity
constraints on the items they are allocated. We motivate this via settings
where the items themselves correspond to user ad slots or task workers with
attributes such as race and gender on which the principal seeks to achieve
demographic parity. We consider the following question: When an agent expresses
diversity constraints into an allocation rule, is the allocation of other
agents hurt significantly? If this happens, the cost of introducing such
constraints is disproportionately borne by agents who do not benefit from
diversity. We codify this via two desiderata capturing robustness. These are no
negative externality -- other agents are not hurt -- and monotonicity -- the
agent enforcing the constraint does not see a large increase in value. We show
in a formal sense that the Nash Welfare rule that maximizes product of agent
values is uniquely positioned to be robust when diversity constraints are
introduced, while almost all other natural allocation rules fail this
criterion. We also show that the guarantees achieved by Nash Welfare are nearly
optimal within a widely studied class of allocation rules. We finally perform
an empirical simulation on real-world data that models ad allocations to show
that this gap between Nash Welfare and other rules persists in the wild.

released a set of specifications for 5G NR, one of the main innovations being
the support for communications in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. However,
how to implement lower complexity, energy efficient, mid-market Internet of

also operate at mmWaves to improve the network performance, hardware/software
simplifications are needed to support balanced and mixed requirements compared

threefold. First, we present some NR-Light use cases for which the support of

a means of generating magnetohy- drodynamic turbulence and encouraging wave
energy dissipation in the solar corona, particularly within transversely
oscillating loops. Aims. Our goal is to determine whether the KHI encourages
magnetic reconnection in oscillating flux tubes in the solar corona. This will
establish whether the instability enhances the dissipation rate of energy
stored in the magnetic field. Methods. We conducted a series of
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the KHI excited by an
oscillating velocity shear. We investigated the effects of numerical
resolution, field line length, and background currents on the growth rate of
the KHI and on the subsequent rate of magnetic reconnection. Results. The KHI
is able to trigger magnetic reconnection in all cases, with the highest rates
occurring during the initial growth phase. Reconnection is found to occur
preferentially along the boundaries of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, where the
shear in the velocity and magnetic fields is greatest. The estimated rate of
reconnection is found to be lowest in simulations where the KHI growth rate is
reduced. For example, this is the case for shorter field lines or due to shear
in the background field. Conclusions. In non-ideal regimes, the onset of the
instability causes the local reconnection of magnetic field lines and enhances
the rate of coronal wave heating. However, we found that if the equilibrium
magnetic field is sheared across the Kelvin-Helmholtz mixing layer, the
instability does not significantly enhance the rate of reconnection of the
background field, despite the free energy associated with the non-potential
field.

warp the source mesh according to the dense correspondence and obtain a coarse
warped mesh. The warped mesh will be better refined with our proposed Elastic
Instance Normalization, which is a conditional normalization layer and can help
to generate high-quality meshes. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed architecture can effectively transfer the poses from source to target
meshes and produce better results with satisfied visual performance than

advantage when prey is rare so that holding on to the same catch is the better
option, while the species with the shorter handling time has the advantage when
prey is common and easy to catch. In this paper we address the question whether
a predator species with a handling time that is not fixed but decreases with
prey density could be selective superior regardless of whether the prey is rare
or common, as such predator would be able to occupy both temporal niches all by
itself.
  To that end we study the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model with a modified Holling
type II functional response with a density dependent handling time and a
handling time dependent conversion factor. We find that the population dynamics
tend to be richer than that of the standard model with fixed handling times
because of the possibility of multiple positive equilibria and positive
attractors. Increasing the strength of the density dependence eventually
stabilises the population.
  Using the framework of adaptive dynamics, we study the evolution of the
strength of the density dependence. We find that a predator with even a weakly
density dependent handling time can invade both monomorphic and dimorphic
populations of predators with fixed handling times. Eventually the strength of
the density dependence of the handling time evolves to a level where population
cycles are lost, with that the possibility of predator coexistence as well.

  Netherlands",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pumping airborne wind energy (AWE) systems employ a kite to convert wind
energy into electricity, through a cyclic reeling motion of the tether. The
problem of computing the optimal reeling speed for the sake of maximizing the
average cycle power is considered. The difficulty stems from two aspects: 1)
the uncertain, time- (and space-) varying nature of wind speed, which can not
be measured accurately, and 2) the need to consider, in the same optimization
problem, the different operational phases of the power cycle. A new,
model-based approach that solves this problem is proposed. In the design phase,
a model of the AWE system is employed to collect data pertaining to the cycle
power obtained with various reel-in/reel-out speed pairs, assuming known wind
speed. Then, a nonlinear map, identified from these data, is used as cost
function in an optimization program that computes the best reel-in and -out
speed pairs for each wind speed. Finally, the optimization results are
exploited to infer the link between optimal reeling speed and tether force,
which are both measured with high accuracy. Such a link is used to design a
feedback controller that computes the reeling speed based on the measured
tether force, in order to converge on the optimal force-speed manifold.
Simulation results with a realistic model illustrate the effectiveness of the
approach.

to a group and of distributing a common key among them. Unlike the standard
authentication schemes where one central authority authenticates users one by
one, group authentication can handle the authentication process at once for all
members of the group. The recently presented group authentication algorithms
mainly exploit Lagrange's polynomial interpolation along with elliptic curve
groups over finite fields. As a fresh approach, this work suggests use of
linear spaces for group authentication and key establishment for a group of any
size. The approach with linear spaces introduces a reduced computation and
communication load to establish a common shared key among the group members.
The advantages of using vector spaces make the proposed method applicable to
energy and resource constrained devices. In addition to providing lightweight
authentication and key agreement, this proposal allows any user in a group to
make a non-member to be a member, which is expected to be useful for autonomous
systems in the future. The scheme is designed in a way that the sponsors of
such members can easily be recognized by anyone in the group. Unlike the other
group authentication schemes based on Lagrange's polynomial interpolation, the
proposed scheme doesn't provide a tool for adversaries to compromise the whole
group secrets by using only a few members' shares as well as it allows to
recognize a non-member easily, which prevents service interruption attacks.

few iterations to obtain an accurate estimate. The asymptotic variance of one
iteration is derived for the proposed noise covariance estimator. Second, a
forward-only rooting-based DOA estimator as well as its forward-backward

advantage of using second-order statistics of signal subspace perturbation in

only a few iterations are sufficient to reach accurate results. The asymptotic

data characterized by intricate spatio-temporal complexities, the modeling of
which often requires specialized approaches. Generative models of these data
are of particular interest, as they enable a range of impactful downstream
applications like simulation or creating synthetic training data. Recent work
has highlighted the potential of generative adversarial nets (GANs) for
generating spatio-temporal data. A new GAN algorithm COT-GAN, inspired by the
theory of causal optimal transport (COT), was proposed in an attempt to better
tackle this challenge. However, the task of learning more complex
spatio-temporal patterns requires additional knowledge of their specific data
structures. In this study, we propose a novel loss objective combined with
COT-GAN based on an autoregressive embedding to reinforce the learning of
spatio-temporal dynamics. We devise SPATE (spatio-temporal association), a new
metric measuring spatio-temporal autocorrelation by using the deviance of
observations from their expected values. We compute SPATE for real and
synthetic data samples and use it to compute an embedding loss that considers
space-time interactions, nudging the GAN to learn outputs that are faithful to
the observed dynamics. We test this new objective on a diverse set of complex
spatio-temporal patterns: turbulent flows, log-Gaussian Cox processes and
global weather data. We show that our novel embedding loss improves performance
without any changes to the architecture of the COT-GAN backbone, highlighting
our model's increased capacity for capturing autoregressive structures. We also
contextualize our work with respect to recent advances in physics-informed deep

using feature domain context as condition. This enables us to leverage the high
dimension context to carry rich information to both the encoder and the

new families of metric thickenings, the $p$-Vietoris-Rips and $p$-\v{C}ech
metric thickenings for all $1\le p\le \infty$, which include all measures on
$X$ whose $p$-diameter or $p$-radius is bounded from above, equipped with an
optimal transport metric. The $p$-diameter (resp. $p$-radius) of a measure is a
certain $\ell_p$ relaxation of the usual notion of diameter (resp. radius) of a
subset of a metric space. These families recover the previously studied
Vietoris-Rips and \v{C}ech metric thickenings when $p=\infty$. As our main
contribution, we prove a stability theorem for the persistent homology of
$p$-Vietoris-Rips and $p$-\v{C}ech metric thickenings, which is novel even in
the case $p=\infty$. In the specific case $p=2$, we prove a Hausmann-type
theorem for thickenings of manifolds, and we derive the complete list of
homotopy types of the $2$-Vietoris-Rips thickenings of the $n$-sphere as the
scale increases.

Artificial data augmentation can help to prevent overfitting and improve the
detection of rare events as well as overall performance. However, most
augmentation techniques use purely spatial transformations, which are not
sufficient for video data with temporal correlations. In this paper, we present
a novel methodology for workflow augmentation and demonstrate its benefit for
event recognition in cataract surgery. The proposed approach increases the
frequency of event alternation by creating artificial videos. The original
video is split into event segments and a workflow graph is extracted from the
original annotations. Finally, the segments are assembled into new videos based
on the workflow graph. Compared to the original videos, the frequency of event
alternation in the augmented cataract surgery videos increased by 26%. Further,
a 3% higher classification accuracy and a 7.8% higher precision was achieved
compared to a state-of-the-art approach. Our approach is particularly helpful
to increase the occurrence of rare but important events and can be applied to a
large variety of use cases.

that though irregularly shaped objects widely exist in daily life and

we propose iShape, an irregular shape dataset for instance segmentation. iShape
contains six sub-datasets with one real and five synthetics, each represents a
scene of a typical irregular shape. Unlike most existing instance segmentation
datasets of regular objects, iShape has many characteristics that challenge
existing instance segmentation algorithms, such as large overlaps between
bounding boxes of instances, extreme aspect ratios, and large numbers of
connected components per instance. We benchmark popular instance segmentation
methods on iShape and find their performance drop dramatically. Hence, we
propose an affinity-based instance segmentation algorithm, called ASIS, as a
stronger baseline. ASIS explicitly combines perception and reasoning to solve
Arbitrary Shape Instance Segmentation including irregular objects. Experimental

Then, we will show that these corrections may be obtained from the
six-dimensional superconformal index.
  The second section covers consistent truncations on the Lunin-Maldacena

determining the reduction ansatz which includes the graviton and a gauge field
of 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity. We also discuss our previously
unpublished attempt to construct a truncation which includes a scalar field
corresponding to the $\beta$-deformation parameter of the dual field theory. We
show that if such a solution exists, it must differ drastically from the LM

  Finally, we discuss higher-derivative corrections to black hole solutions and
the weak gravity conjecture in a few settings. First we compute
higher-derivative corrections to the extremality bounds for black holes which
are charged under an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ gauge fields, and determine the
constraints implied by the WGC. Next we consider the higher-derivative
corrections to thermodynamic quantities for charged black holes in Anti-de
Sitter space. We confirm and clarify a previously noted relationship between
the shift to the extremality bound and the shift to the Wald entropy. We also
show that if the shift in the Wald entropy is assumed to be positive, then the
coefficient of the $R_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} R^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}$ term in

generalise infinitesimal gauge transformations of Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge

of connections on $W$ in the definition of the infinitesimal gauge
transformation, not just canonical flat ones as in the classical formulation.
As usual, these derivations are parametrised and their parameters have to be
generalised to functionals, especially the parameters themselves can have a
non-trivial gauge transformation. We then discuss under which conditions this
algebra of derivations gives a closed algebra, also by providing a natural Lie
bracket on the space of parameters, and we are going to see that closure is

based on synthetic exposure images created from the sum of successive frames
acquired with a 1 ms exposure time. Both methods have been applied to evaluate
controlled flows in micro-channels. The contribution of noises to the speckle
contrast have been quantified and compared. Dark, readout and shot noise
contributions to the total contrast remains constant for modulated exposure,
while all these contributions decrease with increasing exposure time for
synthetic exposure. The relative contribution of noises to speckle contrast
depends on the level of illumination, the exposure time and the flows that are
imaged. Guidelines for accurate flow measurements in the synthetic exposure
acquisition scheme are provided. The synthetic exposure method is simple to
implement and should facilitate the translation of multiple exposure speckle
imaging to clinical setups .

The results are compared with previous DFT+U calculations reported in the

Internet of Things, smart cities, 5G, and edge computing, traditional Internet
Protocol-based (IP-based) networks have been exposed as having many problems.
Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Named Data Networking (NDN), and
Content-Centric Networking (CCN) are therefore proposed as an alternative for
future networks. However, unlike IP-based networks, CCN routing is
nondeterministic and difficult to optimize due to frequent in-network caching
replacement. This paper presents a novel probe-based routing algorithm that
explores real-time in-network caching to ensure the routing table storing the
optimal paths to the nearest content provider is up-to-date. Effective
probe-selections, Pending Interest Table (PIT) probe, and Forwarding
Information Base (FIB) probe are discussed and analyzed by simulation with
different performance measurements. Compared with the basic CCN, in terms of
qualitative analysis, the additional computational overhead of our approach is
O(*) and O(*) on processing interest packets and data packets, respectively.
However, in terms of quantitative analysis, our approach reduces the number of
timeout interests by 6% and the average response time by 0.6 s. Furthermore,
although basic CCN and our approach belong to the same Quality of Service
category, our approach outperforms basic CCN in terms of real values.
Additionally, our probe-based approach performs better than * and *. Owing to
speedup FIB updating by probes, our approach provides more reliable interest
packet routing when accounting for router failures. In summary, the results
demonstrate that compared to basic CCN, our probe-based routing approach raises
FIB accuracy and reduces network congestion and response time, resulting in
efficient routing.

a contrastive hinge based loss whose error involves simple local computations

mechanisms that self-optimize in a demand-aware manner. At the heart of our

classic data structure, there are dependencies, and some items must be in front
of the others; for example, to correctly classify packets by rules arranged in
a linked list, each rule must be in front of lower priority rules that overlap
with it. After each access we can rearrange the list, similarly to
Move-To-Front, but dependencies need to be respected.
  We present a 4-competitive online rearrangement algorithm, whose cost is at
most four times worse than the optimal offline algorithm; no deterministic
algorithm can be better than 3-competitive. The algorithm is simple and
attractive, especially for memory-limited systems, as it does not require any
additional memory (e.g., neither timestamps nor frequency statistics). Our
approach can simply be deployed as a drop-in replacement for a static
datastructure, potentially benefitting many existing networks.
  We evaluate our self-adjusting list packet classifier on realistic ruleset
and traffic instances. We find that our classifier performs similarly to a
static list for low-locality traffic, but significantly outperforms Efficuts
(by a factor 7x), CutSplit (3.6x), and the static list (14x) for high locality
and small rulesets. Memory consumption is 10x lower on average compared to
Efficuts and CutSplit.

demanding high model interpretability for their transparent inner structures
and good model expressivity. However, rule-based models are hard to optimize,
especially on large data sets, due to their discrete parameters and structures.
Ensemble methods and fuzzy/soft rules are commonly used to improve performance,
but they sacrifice the model interpretability. To obtain both good scalability
and interpretability, we propose a new classifier, named Rule-based
Representation Learner (RRL), that automatically learns interpretable non-fuzzy
rules for data representation and classification. To train the
non-differentiable RRL effectively, we project it to a continuous space and
propose a novel training method, called Gradient Grafting, that can directly
optimize the discrete model using gradient descent. An improved design of
logical activation functions is also devised to increase the scalability of RRL
and enable it to discretize the continuous features end-to-end. Exhaustive
experiments on nine small and four large data sets show that RRL outperforms
the competitive interpretable approaches and can be easily adjusted to obtain a
trade-off between classification accuracy and model complexity for different
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/12wang3/rrl.

on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions only. We reduce the memory
consumption as well as the computational costs significantly by employing
efficient decompositions to construct low rank tensor-train representations,
thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. In order to compute also higher
quantum states, we introduce an approach which directly incorporates the
Wielandt deflation technique into the alternating linear scheme for the
solution of eigenproblems. Besides systems with coupled excitons and phonons,
we also investigate uncoupled problems for which (semi-)analytical results
exist. There, we find that in case of homogeneous systems the tensor-train
ranks of state vectors only marginally depend on the chain length which results
in a linear growth of the storage consumption. However, the CPU time increases
slightly faster with the chain length than the storage consumption because the
alternating linear scheme adopted in our work requires more iterations to
achieve convergence for longer chains and a given rank. Finally, we demonstrate
that the tensor-train approach to the quantum treatment of coupled excitons and
phonons makes it possible to directly tackle the phenomenon of mutual
self-trapping. We are able to confirm the main results of the Davydov theory,
i.e., the dependence of the wavepacket width and the corresponding

note that field equations are different in these two studies. Following [Phys.
Rev. D 103, 124001 (2021)], we systematically study the field equations for
wormhole solutions and found the violation of null energy conditions in the
throat neighborhood. More specifically, considering specific choices for the
$f(Q)$ form and for constant redshift with different shape functions, we
present a class of solutions for static and spherically symmetric wormholes.
Our survey indicates that wormhole solutions could not exist for specific form
function $f(Q)= Q+ \alpha Q^2$. To summarize, exact wormhole models can be
constructed with violation of the null energy condition throughout the
spacetime while being $\rho \geq 0$ and vice versa.

typical signatures of magnetic reconnection and the associated impulsive
heating of the solar atmospheric plasma. To gain new insights into the process,
high-cadence observations are required to capture the rapid response of plasma
to magnetic reconnection as well as the highly dynamic evolution of jets. Here,
we report the first 2 s cadence extreme-UV observations recorded by the 174
{\AA} High Resolution Imager of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the
Solar Orbiter mission. These observations, covering a quiet-Sun coronal region,
reveal the onset signatures of magnetic reconnection as localized heating
events. These localized sources then exhibit repeated plasma eruptions or jet
activity. Our observations show that this spatial morphological change from
localized sources to jet activity could occur rapidly on timescales of about 20
s. The jets themselves are intermittent and are produced from the source region
on timescales of about 20 s. In the initial phases of these events, plasma jets
are observed to exhibit speeds, as inferred from propagating intensity
disturbances, in the range of 100 km s$^{-1}$ to 150 km s$^{-1}$. These jets
then propagate to lengths of about 5 Mm. We discuss examples of bidirectional
and unidirectional jet activity observed to have been initiated from the
initially localized bursts in the corona. The transient nature of coronal
bursts and the associated plasma flows or jets along with their dynamics could
provide a benchmark for magnetic reconnection models of coronal bursts and
jets.

from the bid-ask spread for every buy and sell transaction, against the risk of
adverse selection, uncertain execution and inventory risk. We design realistic
simulations of limit order markets and develop a high-frequency market making
strategy in which agents process order book information to post the optimal
price, order type and execution time. By introducing the Deep Hawkes process to
the high-frequency market making strategy, we allow a feedback loop to be
created between order arrival and the state of the limit order book, together
with self- and cross-excitation effects. Our high-frequency market making
strategy accounts for the cancellation of orders that influence order queue
position, profitability, bid-ask spread and the value of the order. The
experimental results show that our trading agent outperforms the baseline

We investigate the effect of cancellations on market quality and the agent's

supernodes (subsets of vertices of $G$), and a weighted superedge connects two
supernodes. The proposed method constructs a summary graph on $k$ supernodes
that minimize the reconstruction error (difference between the original graph

respect to attributes. We construct the summary by iteratively merging a pair
of nodes. We derive a closed-form expression to efficiently compute the
reconstruction error after merging a pair and approximate this score in
constant time. To reduce the search space for selecting the best pair for
merging, we assign a weight to each supernode that closely quantifies the
contribution of the node in the score of the pairs containing it. We choose the
best pair for merging from a random sample of supernodes selected with

comparable summary based on various quality measures with weighted sampling. We

plasmoid-unstable current sheet forms in a transient, non-axisymmetric,

flux bundles escape from the event horizon through reconnection at the
universal plasmoid-mediated rate in this current sheet. The reconnection feeds
on the highly-magnetized plasma in the jets and heats the plasma that ends up
trapped in flux bundles to temperatures proportional to the jet's
magnetization. The escaped flux bundles can complete a full orbit as
low-density hot spots, consistent with Sgr A$^{*}$ observations by the GRAVITY
interferometer. Reconnection near the horizon produces sufficiently energetic
plasma to explain flares from accreting black holes, such as the TeV emission
observed from M87. The drop in mass accretion rate during the flare, and the
resulting low-density magnetosphere make it easier for very high energy photons
produced by reconnection-accelerated particles to escape. The extreme
resolution results in a converged plasmoid-mediated reconnection rate that
directly determines the timescales and properties of the flare.

method for strategic and motion planning for automated vehicles. By taking into
account the intent of every agent, the ego agent can incorporate future
interactions with human-driven vehicles into its planning. The problem is often
formulated as a multi-agent game and solved using iterative algorithms
operating on a discretized action or state space. Even if converging to a Nash
equilibrium, the result will often be only sub-optimal. In this paper, we
define a linear differential game for a set of interacting agents and solve it
to optimality using mixed-integer programming. A disjunctive formulation of the
orientation allows us to formulate linear constraints to prevent agent-to-agent
collision while preserving the non-holonomic motion properties of the vehicle
model. Soft constraints account for prediction errors. We then define a joint
cost function, where a cooperation factor can adapt between altruistic,
cooperative, and egoistic behavior. We study the influence of the cooperation
factor to solve scenarios, where interaction between the agents is necessary to
solve them successfully. The approach is then evaluated in a racing scenario,
where we show the applicability of the formulation in a closed-loop receding

sharing, team awareness, and collaboration.
  Problem. In practice, code reviews can experience significant delays to be
completed due to various socio-technical factors which can affect the project
quality and cost. For a successful review process, peer reviewers should
perform their review tasks in a timely manner while providing relevant feedback
about the code change being reviewed. However, there is a lack of tool support

to accepting or declining a review request.
  Objective. Our objective is to build and validate an effective approach to
predict the code review completion time in the context of MCR and help
developers better manage and prioritize their code review tasks.
  Method. We formulate the prediction of the code review completion time as a

models to (i) effectively estimate the code review completion time, and (ii)
understand the main factors influencing code review completion time.

dot-product attention. In this work, we investigate the problem of
approximating the two central components of the Transformer -- multi-head

a temporal evolution scheme, TransEvolve, to bypass costly dot-product

TransEvolve on well-known encoder-decoder as well as encoder-only tasks. We
observe that the degree of approximation (or inversely, the degree of parameter

While in the encoder-decoder regime, TransEvolve delivers performances
comparable to the original Transformer, in encoder-only tasks it consistently
outperforms Transformer along with several subsequent variants.

representational power of deep neural networks (DNNs) such as autoencoder. The
key idea is that representation learning and clustering can reinforce each
other: Good representations lead to good clustering while good clustering
provides good supervisory signals to representation learning. Critical
questions include: 1) How to optimize representation learning and clustering?
2) Should the reconstruction loss of autoencoder be considered always? In this
paper, we propose DEKM (for Deep Embedded K-Means) to answer these two
questions. Since the embedding space generated by autoencoder may have no
obvious cluster structures, we propose to further transform the embedding space
to a new space that reveals the cluster-structure information. This is achieved
by an orthonormal transformation matrix, which contains the eigenvectors of the
within-class scatter matrix of K-means. The eigenvalues indicate the importance
of the eigenvectors' contributions to the cluster-structure information in the
new space. Our goal is to increase the cluster-structure information. To this
end, we discard the decoder and propose a greedy method to optimize the
representation. Representation learning and clustering are alternately
optimized by DEKM. Experimental results on the real-world datasets demonstrate
that DEKM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

probability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of ""latent
confounders"", i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the
underlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For
example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application
for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is
unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield
""missing not at random"" (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference
procedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model
for matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide
novel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest.
We design a procedure, which we call ""synthetic nearest neighbors"" (SNN), to
estimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and
asymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new
theoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we
establish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic
normality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this
also provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data. Across

Casimir-Lifshitz force plays an important role in surface physics,

source of the fluctuational electromagnetic fields and forces. The second
approach is based on finding the eigenmodes of the field, while the material
bodies are assumed to be passive and non-fluctuating. In spite of the fact that
both approaches have a long history, there are still some misconceptions in the
literature. In particular, there are claims that (hypothetical) materials with
a strictly real dielectric function $\varepsilon(\omega)$ can give rise to
fluctuational Casimir-Lifshitz forces. We review and compare the two

retardation. We point out that also in the second (the ""field-oriented"")

(DNN), use the output to reconstruct gradients, and then optimize the
adversarial inputs iteratively. In this paper, we study the method of adding
white noise to the DNN output to mitigate such attacks, with a unique focus on
the trade-off analysis of noise level and query cost. The attacker's query
count (QC) is derived mathematically as a function of noise standard deviation.
With this result, the defender can conveniently find the noise level needed to
mitigate attacks for the desired security level specified by QC and limited DNN
performance loss. Our analysis shows that the added noise is drastically
magnified by the small variation of DNN outputs, which makes the reconstructed
gradient have an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Adding slight white
noise with a standard deviation less than 0.01 is enough to increase QC by many
orders of magnitude without introducing any noticeable classification accuracy
reduction. Our experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively
mitigate both soft-label and hard-label black-box attacks under realistic QC
constraints. We also show that this method outperforms many other defense
methods and is robust to the attacker's countermeasures.

note that under the SQM hypothesis, less massive objects such as strange quark

transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Typically, to
guarantee desirable knowledge transfer, a common (latent) space is adopted for
associating the visual and semantic domains in ZSL. However, existing common
space learning methods align the semantic and visual domains by merely
mitigating distribution disagreement through one-step adaptation. This strategy
is usually ineffective due to the heterogeneous nature of the feature
representations in the two domains, which intrinsically contain both
distribution and structure variations. To address this and advance ZSL, we
propose a novel hierarchical semantic-visual adaptation (HSVA) framework.
Specifically, HSVA aligns the semantic and visual domains by adopting a
hierarchical two-step adaptation, i.e., structure adaptation and distribution
adaptation. In the structure adaptation step, we take two task-specific
encoders to encode the source data (visual domain) and the target data
(semantic domain) into a structure-aligned common space. To this end, a
supervised adversarial discrepancy (SAD) module is proposed to adversarially
minimize the discrepancy between the predictions of two task-specific
classifiers, thus making the visual and semantic feature manifolds more closely
aligned. In the distribution adaptation step, we directly minimize the
Wasserstein distance between the latent multivariate Gaussian distributions to
align the visual and semantic distributions using a common encoder. Finally,
the structure and distribution adaptation are derived in a unified framework
under two partially-aligned variational autoencoders. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSVA achieves superior performance on
both conventional and generalized ZSL. The code is available at

Glow-TTS can synthesize high-quality speech from the given text in parallel.
After analyzing two kinds of generative NAR-TTS models (VAE and normalizing
flow), we find that: VAE is good at capturing the long-range semantics features
(e.g., prosody) even with small model size but suffers from blurry and
unnatural results; and normalizing flow is good at reconstructing the frequency
bin-wise details but performs poorly when the number of model parameters is
limited. Inspired by these observations, to generate diverse speech with
natural details and rich prosody using a lightweight architecture, we propose
PortaSpeech, a portable and high-quality generative text-to-speech model.
Specifically, 1) to model both the prosody and mel-spectrogram details
accurately, we adopt a lightweight VAE with an enhanced prior followed by a
flow-based post-net with strong conditional inputs as the main architecture. 2)
To further compress the model size and memory footprint, we introduce the
grouped parameter sharing mechanism to the affine coupling layers in the
post-net. 3) To improve the expressiveness of synthesized speech and reduce the
dependency on accurate fine-grained alignment between text and speech, we
propose a linguistic encoder with mixture alignment combining hard inter-word
alignment and soft intra-word alignment, which explicitly extracts word-level
semantic information. Experimental results show that PortaSpeech outperforms
other TTS models in both voice quality and prosody modeling in terms of
subjective and objective evaluation metrics, and shows only a slight
performance degradation when reducing the model parameters to 6.7M (about 4x
model size and 3x runtime memory compression ratio compared with FastSpeech 2).
Our extensive ablation studies demonstrate that each design in PortaSpeech is
effective.

mainstream clustering-based methods, our framework exploits a transformer-based
feature reconstruction scheme to detect event boundary by reconstruction
errors. This is consistent with the fact that humans spot new events by
leveraging the deviation between their prediction and what is actually
perceived. Thanks to their heterogeneity in semantics, the frames at boundaries
are difficult to be reconstructed (generally with large reconstruction errors),
which is favorable for event boundary detection. Additionally, since the
reconstruction occurs on the semantic feature level instead of pixel level, we
develop a temporal contrastive feature embedding module to learn the semantic
visual representation for frame feature reconstruction. This procedure is like
humans building up experiences with ""long-term memory"". The goal of our work is
to segment generic events rather than localize some specific ones. We focus on
achieving accurate event boundaries. As a result, we adopt F1 score

estimating higher-order derivatives and the full state can be challenging).
Fast vision-based navigation requires high performance flight despite possibly

This includes touching on the merits and difficulties of the method and several

  Object Detectors",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Blind spots or outright deceit can bedevil and deceive machine learning
models. Unidentified objects such as digital ""stickers,"" also known as
adversarial patches, can fool facial recognition systems, surveillance systems
and self-driving cars. Fortunately, most existing adversarial patches can be
outwitted, disabled and rejected by a simple classification network called an
adversarial patch detector, which distinguishes adversarial patches from
original images. An object detector classifies and predicts the types of
objects within an image, such as by distinguishing a motorcyclist from the
motorcycle, while also localizing each object's placement within the image by
""drawing"" so-called bounding boxes around each object, once again separating
the motorcyclist from the motorcycle. To train detectors even better, however,
we need to keep subjecting them to confusing or deceitful adversarial patches
as we probe for the models' blind spots. For such probes, we came up with a
novel approach, a Low-Detectable Adversarial Patch, which attacks an object
detector with small and texture-consistent adversarial patches, making these
adversaries less likely to be recognized. Concretely, we use several geometric
primitives to model the shapes and positions of the patches. To enhance our
attack performance, we also assign different weights to the bounding boxes in
terms of loss function. Our experiments on the common detection dataset COCO as
well as the driving-video dataset D2-City show that LDAP is an effective attack
method, and can resist the adversarial patch detector.

The multi-view account representation model forms three different views for a

  Incentivized Social Advertising",,,,,"cs.DS cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The idea of social advertising (or social promotion) is to select a group of
influential individuals (a.k.a \emph{seeds}) to help promote some products or
ideas through an online social networks. There are two major players in the
social advertising ecosystem: advertiser and platform. The platform sells viral
engagements such as ""like""s to advertisers by inserting their ads into the feed
of seeds. These seeds receive monetary incentives from the platform in exchange
for their participation in the social advertising campaign. Once an ad is
engaged by a follower of some seed, the platform receives a fixed amount of
payment, called cost per engagement, from the advertiser. The ad could
potentially attract more engagements from followers' followers and trigger a
viral contagion. At the beginning of a campaign, the advertiser submits a
budget to the platform and this budget can be used for two purposes: recruiting
seeds and paying for the viral engagements generated by the seeds. Note that
the first part of payment goes to the seeds and the latter one is the actual
revenue collected by the platform. In this setting, the problem for the
platform is to recruit a group of seeds such that she can collect the largest
possible amount of revenue subject to the budget constraint. We formulate this
problem as a seed selection problem whose objective function is non-monotone
and it might take on negative values, making existing results on submodular
optimization and influence maximization not applicable to our setting. We study
this problem under both non-adaptive and adaptive settings. Although we focus
on social advertising in this paper, our results apply to any optimization
problems whose objective function is the expectation of the minimum of a
stochastic submodular function and a linear function.

undergo global collapse. Our high resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve
the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different
velocities inside it. We find that the ""blue profile"" (an indicator of gas
infall) of HCO+ lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by
gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great
caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g., infall) from line profiles toward
distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are
identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of
the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the ""L"" type filament (""NW-SE"" and ""NE-SW""
filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes,
indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We
argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion
of nearby giant HII regions. The ""NW-SE"" and ""NE-SW"" filaments seem to be in
collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction

We explore the suppression of micromotion-induced heating effects through
optimization of trap parameters for various radio-frequency (rf) traps and rf
driving schemes including linear and octupole traps, digital Paul traps,
rotating traps and hybrid optical/rf traps. We find that very similar ion
energies can be reached in all of them even when considering experimental

quantum description of the system and show that quantum mechanics cannot save
the ion from micromotion-induced heating in an atom-ion collision. The results
suggest that buffer gas cooling can be used to reach close to the ion's
groundstate of motion and is even competitive when compared to some sub-Doppler

viable alternative for ions that are not amenable to laser cooling, a result

is a challenge because the pressure drop causes rapid flash boiling of the
liquid. The resulting jet usually demonstrates a wide range of structures,
including ligaments and droplets, due to both mechanical and thermodynamic
effects. As the simulation comprises increasingly numerous phenomena, the
computational cost begins to increase. One way to moderate the additional cost
is to use machine learning surrogacy for specific elements of the calculations.
The present study presents a machine learning-assisted computational fluid
dynamics approach for simulating the atomisation of flashing liquids accounting
for distinct stages, from primary atomisation to secondary break-up to small
droplets using the ${\Sigma}$-Y model coupled with the homogeneous relaxation
model. Notably, the model for the thermodynamic non-equilibrium (HRM) and
${\Sigma}$-Y are coupled, for the first time, with a deep neural network that
simulates the turbulence quantities, which are then used in the prediction of
superheated liquid jet atomisation. The data-driven component of the method is
used for turbulence modelling, avoiding the solution of the two-equation
turbulence model typically used for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations
for these problems. Both the accuracy and speed of the hybrid approach are
evaluated, demonstrating adequate accuracy and at least 25% faster
computational fluid dynamics simulations than the traditional approach. This
acceleration suggests that perhaps additional components of the calculation
could be replaced for even further benefit.

definition of the basis and an alternative derivation of analytical
transformation properties of the band representation. It identifies explicitly
what occurs at high symmetry point on the surface of Brillouin zone and allows
decomposition of band representation into irreducible representations of the
space group anywhere in the representation domain of the Brillouin zone. Two
different Fourier transform conventions in defining the band representation
induced from the same localised Wannier functions are discussed and identified
as related by a simple gauge transformation. The tight binding band
representation are used as basis in deriving the tight binding Hamiltonian
using group theoretical technique. With the analytical tools afforded by the
representation matrices of the band representations, a clear methodology is
developed to obtain band connectivity in the representation domain and
establish which does not have an atomic limit. Elementary band representations
is shown to be fully connected in the atomic limit. In particular, the band
representation induced from spin-ful ${\rm p}_z$ orbital on Wyckoff position 2c
of honeycomb lattice has a connectivity with atomic limit and the topological
nature of the band in graphene can arises from such connection and spin orbit
interaction induced gap at K point. Combined with symmetry compliant tight
binding Hamiltonian, one can examine the homeomorphic transformation of bands
induced by changes in the parameters in the model and establish if band

by two robotic manipulators where overhand grasps are not allowed. If other
movable obstacles occlude the target, more than one object should be relocated
to clear the path to reach the target object. With two robots, the relocation
could be done efficiently by simultaneously performing relocation tasks.
However, the precedence constraint between the tasks (e.g, some objects at the
front should be removed to manipulate the objects in the back) makes the
simultaneous task execution difficult.
  We propose a coordination method that determines which robot relocates which
object so as to perform tasks simultaneously. Given a set of objects to be
relocated, the objective is to maximize the number of turn-takings of the
robots in performing relocation tasks. Thus, one robot can pick an object in
the clutter while the other robot places an object in hand to the outside of
the clutter. However, the object to be relocated may not be accessible to all
robots, so taking turns could not always be achieved. Our method is based on
the optimal uniform-cost search so the number of turn-takings is proven to be
maximized. We also propose a greedy variant whose computation time is shorter.
From experiments, we show that our method reduces the completion time of the
mission by at least 22.9% (at most 27.3%) compared to the methods with no
consideration of turn-taking.

changing both the period of the array and the dimensions of the nanorods, the

the excitation wavelength. We experimentally demonstrate that NBE emission can
be increased up to a factor of 3 compared to bare ZnO. The underlying PL
enhancement mechanisms are experimentally investigated and compared with

calculate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative corrections to the
radiative decay $\Upsilon\to \eta_c(\chi_{cJ})+\gamma$. Both the helicity
amplitudes and the helicity decay widths are obtained. It is the first
computation for the processes involving both bottomonium and charmonium at
two-loop accuracy. By employing the Cheng-Wu theorem, we are able to convert
most of complex-valued master integrals (MIs) into real-valued MIs, which makes
the numerical integration much efficient. Our results indicate the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ corrections are moderate for $\eta_c$ and $\chi_{c2}$
production, and are quite marginal for $\chi_{c0}$ and $\chi_{c1}$ production.
It is impressive to note the NLO corrections considerably reduce the
renormalization scale dependence in both the decay widths and the branching
fractions for $\chi_{cJ}$, and slightly improve that for $\eta_c$. With the
NRQCD matrix elements evaluated via the Buchm\""uller-Tye potential model, we
find the decay width for $\eta_c$ production is one-order-of-magnitude larger
than $\chi_{cJ}$ production, which may provide a good opportunity to search for
$\Upsilon\to \eta_c+\gamma$ in experiment. In addition, the decay width for
$\chi_{c1}$ production is several times larger than those for $\chi_{c0,2}$.
Finally, we find the NLO NRQCD prediction for the branching fraction of
$\Upsilon\to \chi_{c1}+\gamma$ is only half of the lower bound of the
experimental data measured recently by {\tt Belle}. Moreover, there exists
serious contradiction between theory and experiment for $\Upsilon\to

small interaction dipole moments are found in dimers bonded by $\pi$-stacking

multi-particle dynamics and collective phenomena in the presence of a dominant
Coulomb interaction, in a complex hierarchical scheme, whereas the integer
effect is a simpler single-particle scenario. The experimental situation, in
contrast, shows that both the effects appear seamlessly, intermingling, as
either the magnetic field or the carrier density is varied. I prove that a
crucial physics input that is missing in the current theories is the
relativistic gravity of the matter-energy in the Universe. The dynamically
induced relativistic gravitational potential play a startling role to modify
the quantum degeneracy, by coupling to the mass of electrons. The key point is
that the quantum degeneracy of Landau levels is modified by the relativistic
cosmic gravitomagnetic field, thereby making the degeneracy dependent on the
number density of the electrons. I successfully derive the main characteristics
and the full sequence of both IQHE and FHQE in a seamless unified
single-particle scenario, without any quasiparticles, particle-flux composites,

filling factors of the QHE for the $\nu\geq1/3$, this new unified theory has
the natural explanation for the absence of the QHE at even fractions for
$\nu<1$. Further, there is a consistent description of the edge state charge

mimickers. The concept of a black hole mimicker is introduced, and various
mimicker spacetime models are examined within the framework of classical
general relativity. The mimickers examined fall into the classes of regular
black holes and traversable wormholes under spherical symmetry. The regular
black holes examined can be further categorised as static spacetimes, however
the traversable wormhole is allowed to have a dynamic (non-static) throat.
Astrophysical observables are calculated for a recently proposed regular black
hole model containing an exponential suppression of the Misner-Sharp
quasi-local mass. This same regular black hole model is then used to construct
a wormhole via the ''cut- and-paste'' technique. The resulting wormhole is then
analysed within the Darmois-Israel thin-shell formalism, and a linearised
stability analysis of the (dynamic) wormhole throat is undertaken. Yet another
regular black hole model spacetime is proposed, extending a previous work which
attempted to construct a regular black hole through a quantum ''deformation''
of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The resulting spacetime is again analysed

  Most previous work on automatic evaluation of oratory skills uses
hand-crafted expert annotations for both the quality of the talk and for the
identification of predefined actions. Unlike prior art, we measure the quality
to be equivalent to the view count of the talk as counted by TED, and allow the

a humungous quantity of Mulberry leaves which in turn produces the raw silk.
Since the climatic conditions in India is favourable, Mulberry is grown
throughout the year. Majority of the farmers hardly pay attention to the nature
of soil and abiotic factors due to which leaves become malnutritious and thus
when they are consumed by the silkworm, desired quality end-product, raw silk,
will not be produced. It is beneficial for the farmers to know the amount of
yield that their land can produce so that they can plan in advance. In this
paper, different Machine Learning techniques are used in predicting the yield
of the Mulberry crops based on the soil parameters. Three advanced
machine-learning models are selected and compared, namely, Multiple linear
regression, Ridge regression and Random Forest Regression (RF). The
experimental results show that Random Forest Regression outperforms other

context-aware network for mobility prediction. Specifically, we explore the
influence of four types of context in the mobility prediction: temporal,
semantic, social and geographical contexts. We first design a base mobility
feature extractor using the Transformer architecture, which takes both the
history POI sequence and the semantic information as input. It handles both the
temporal and semantic contexts. Based on the base extractor and the social
connections of a user, we employ a self-attention module to model the influence
of the social context. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, we introduce a
location prediction branch in MobTCast as an auxiliary task to model the
geographical context and predict the next location. Intuitively, the
geographical distance between the location of the predicted POI and the
predicted location from the auxiliary branch should be as close as possible. To
reflect this relation, we design a consistency loss to further improve the POI
prediction performance. In our experimental results, MobTCast outperforms other
state-of-the-art next POI prediction methods. Our approach illustrates the
value of including different types of context in next POI prediction.

application of unsupervised machine learning to support the pragmatic designs

number of factors, mixed-level designs, and may be subject to constraints that
eliminate some unfeasible trials for various reasons. Having such attributes,
it is very challenging to design pragmatic experiments that are economically,
operationally, and timely sound. It means a significant decrease in the number
of required trials from a full factorial design, while still attempting to
achieve the defined objectives. A beta variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) has
been applied to represent trials of the initial full factorial design after
filtering out unfeasible trials on the low dimensional latent space. Regarding
visualization and interpretability, the paper is limited to 2D representations.
Beta-VAE supports (1) orthogonality of the latent space dimensions, (2)
isotropic multivariate standard normal distribution of the representation on
the latent space, (3) disentanglement of the latent space representation by
levels of factors, (4) propagation of the applied constraints of the initial

of the channel is unknown at this stage, a coherent combining scheme would be
very difficult to implement.

the whole process of preamble detection by a NN. Instead, we propose to use NN
only for \textit{blind} coherent combining of the signals in the detector to
compensate for the channel effect, thus maximize the signal to noise ratio. We
have further reduced the problem's complexity using Kronecker approximation

are responsible for detecting concepts in the input and conditioning text

accelerating the vaccination process. Counterintuitively, if the individual's
attitude towards vaccination is more reliant on his neighbors' vaccination
behavior, more individuals will get vaccinated, and the vaccination process
will speed up. Besides, individuals are more willing to get vaccinated if they
have more neighbors.

  Supercomputers with Shared Burst Buffers (arXiv:2109.00082); Source code:
  https://github.com/jankopanski/Burst-Buffer-Scheduling",,,,"cs.PF cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The ever-increasing gap between compute and I/O performance in HPC platforms,
together with the development of novel NVMe storage devices (NVRAM), led to the
emergence of the burst buffer concept - an intermediate persistent storage
layer logically positioned between random-access main memory and a parallel
file system. Since the appearance of this technology, numerous supercomputers
have been equipped with burst buffers exploring various architectures. Despite
the development of real-world architectures as well as research concepts,
Resource and Job Management Systems, such as Slurm, provide only marginal
support for scheduling jobs with burst buffer requirements. This research is
primarily motivated by the alerting observation that burst buffers are omitted
from reservations in the procedure of backfilling in existing job schedulers.
In this dissertation, we forge a detailed supercomputer simulator based on
Batsim and SimGrid, which is capable of simulating I/O contention and I/O
congestion effects. Due to the lack of publicly available workloads with burst
buffer requests, we create a burst buffer request distribution model derived
from Parallel Workload Archive logs. We investigate the impact of burst buffer
reservations on the overall efficiency of online job scheduling for canonical
algorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
EASY-backfilling. Our results indicate that the lack of burst buffer
reservations in backfilling may significantly deteriorate the performance of
scheduling. [...] Furthermore, this lack of reservations may cause the
starvation of medium-size and wide jobs. Finally, we propose a
burst-buffer-aware plan-based scheduling algorithm with simulated annealing
optimisation, which improves the mean waiting time by over 20% and mean bounded
slowdown by 27% compared to the SJF EASY-backfilling.
