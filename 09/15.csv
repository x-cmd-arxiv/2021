abortion. This work proposes a deep learning object detection approach to
accurately mask fetal gender in US images in order to increase the
accessibility of the technology. We demonstrate how the YOLOv5L architecture
exhibits superior performance relative to other object detection models on this
task. Our model achieves 45.8% AP[0.5:0.95], 92% F1-score and 0.006 False

box delay rule based on frame-to-frame structural similarity to reduce the
false negative rate by 85%, further improving masking reliability.

star-forming regions, but its properties and significance in the immediate
surroundings of low-mass protostars are still poorly understood. Aims: We aim
to extend the use of the CN/HCN ratio, already established for high-mass
protostars, to the low-mass regime to trace and characterize the UV field
around low-mass protostars on $\sim 0.6\times0.6$ pc scales. Methods: We
present $5'\times5'$ maps of the Serpens Main Cloud encompassing 10 protostars
observed with the EMIR receiver at the IRAM 30 m telescope in CN 1-0, HCN 1-0,
CS 3-2, and some of their isotopologues. The radiative-transfer code RADEX and
the chemical model Nahoon are used to determine column densities of molecules,
gas temperature and density, and the UV field strength, $G_\mathrm{0}$.
Results: The spatial distribution of HCN and CS are well-correlated with CO 6-5
emission that traces outflows. The CN emission is extended from the central
protostars to their immediate surroundings also tracing outflows, likely as a
product of HCN photodissociation. The ratio of CN to HCN total column densities
ranges from $\sim$1 to 12 corresponding to G$_0$ $\approx$ $10^{1}-10^{3}$ for
gas densities and temperatures typical for outflows of low-mass protostars.
Conclusions: UV radiation associated with protostars and their outflows is
indirectly identified in a significant part of the Serpens Main low-mass
star-forming region. Its strength is consistent with the values obtained from
the OH and H$_2$O ratios observed with Herschel and compared with models of
UV-illuminated shocks. From a chemical viewpoint, the CN to HCN ratio is an
excellent tracer of UV fields around low- and intermediate-mass star-forming
regions.

user studies and technical experts underline how trust is a key element to
facilitate users' acceptance, consequently increasing the chances to pursue the

is rooted in anthropomorphism, and it is a natural characteristic of every

social robots, this paper argues that what should be investigated is to what
extent and for which purpose it is suitable to trust robots. Such an endeavour
requires an interdisciplinary approach taking into account (i) technical needs

wheel based rovers to navigate through these areas. In order to address these
limitations and advance the exploration capability in a Martian terrain, this
article presents the design and control of a novel coaxial quadrotor Micro
Aerial Vehicle (MAV). As it will be presented, the key contributions on the
design and control architecture of the proposed Mars coaxial quadrotor, are
introducing an alternative and more enhanced, from a control point of view
concept, when compared in terms of autonomy to Ingenuity. Based on the
presented design, the article will introduce the mathematical modelling and
automatic control framework of the vehicle that will consist of a linearised
model of a co-axial quadrotor and a corresponding Model Predictive Controller
(MPC) for the trajectory tracking. Among the many models, proposed for the
aerial flight on Mars, a reliable control architecture lacks in the related
state of the art. The MPC based closed loop responses of the proposed MAV will
be verified in different conditions during the flight with additional
disturbances, induced to replicate a real flight scenario. In order to further
validate the proposed control architecture and prove the efficacy of the
suggested design, the introduced Mars coaxial quadrotor and the MPC scheme will
be compared to a PID-type controller, similar to the Ingenuity helicopter's
control architecture for the position and the heading.

necessary to compromise on resilience, resource efficiency, or throughput
performance, because existing approaches either tolerate only crashes, require
additional replicas, or rely on a global leader for consensus. In this paper,
we eliminate the need for such tradeoffs by presenting Isos, a leaderless
replication protocol that tolerates up to $f$ Byzantine faults with a minimum
of $3f+1$ replicas. To reduce latency in wide-area environments, Isos relies on
an efficient consensus algorithm that allows all participating replicas to
propose new requests and thereby enables clients to avoid delays by submitting
requests to their nearest replica. In addition, Isos minimizes overhead by
limiting message ordering to requests that conflict with each other (e.g., due
to accessing the same state parts) and by already committing them after three
communication steps if at least $f+1$ replicas report each conflict. Our
experimental evaluation with a geo-replicated key-value store shows that these
properties allow Isos to provide lower end-to-end latency than existing
protocols, especially for use-case scenarios in which the clients of a system
are distributed across multiple locations.

Knife (GK) radiosurgery to determine a large number of plan parameters via
solving an optimization problem, which typically consists of multiple
objectives. The priorities among these objectives need to be repetitively
adjusted to achieve a clinically good plan for each patient. This study aimed
to achieve automatic and intelligent priority-tuning, by developing a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) based method to model the tuning behaviors of
human planners. Methods: We built a priority-tuning policy network using deep
convolutional neural networks. Its input was a vector composed of the plan
metrics that were used in our institution for GK plan evaluation. The network
can determine which tuning action to take, based on the observed quality of the
intermediate plan. We trained the network using an end-to-end DRL framework to
approximate the optimal action-value function. A scoring function was designed
to measure the plan quality. Results: Vestibular schwannoma was chosen as the
test bed in this study. The number of training, validation and testing cases
were 5, 5, and 16, respectively. For these three datasets, the average plan
scores with initial priorities were 3.63 $\pm$ 1.34, 3.83 $\pm$ 0.86 and 4.20
$\pm$ 0.78, respectively, while can be improved to 5.28 $\pm$ 0.23, 4.97 $\pm$

planners. Our network achieved competitive results with 5.42 $\pm$ 0.11, 5.10
$\pm$ 0. 42, 5.28 $\pm$ 0.20, respectively. Conclusions: Our network can
generate GK plans of comparable or slightly higher quality comparing with the
plans generated by human planners via manual priority tuning. The network can
potentially be incorporated into the clinical workflow to improve GK planning

  Nuclear recoils and alpha events preferentially excite the liquid argon (LAr)

which is typically applied to the inside of the active detector volume to make
the LAr scintillation photons visible, has a short re-emission time that
preserves the LAr scintillation timing. We developed a wavelength-shifting
polymeric film - pyrene-doped polystyrene - for the DEAP-3600 detector and
describe the production method and characterization. At liquid argon
temperature, the film's re-emission timing is dominated by a modified
exponential decay with time constant of 279(14) ns and has a
wavelength-shifting efficiency of 46.4(2.9) % relative to TPB, measured at room

where the scintillation light collection efficiency is low) with this film, the
visible energy and the scintillation pulse shape of alpha events in the neck

interesting to ask how they behave given that some observable takes some
prescribed value. This conditioning problem is well understood within the
linear operator formalism based on rate matrices or Fokker-Planck operators,
which describes the dynamics of many independent random walkers. Relying on
certain spectral properties of the biased linear operators, guaranteed by the
Perron-Frobenius theorem, an effective process can be found such that its path
probability is equivalent to the conditional path probability. In this paper,
we extend those results for nonlinear Markov processes that appear when the
many random walkers are no longer independent, and which can be described
naturally through a Lagrangian-Hamiltonian formalism within the theory of large
deviations at large volume. We identify the appropriate spectral problem as
being a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a biased Hamiltonian, for which we
conjecture that two special global solutions exist, replacing the
Perron-Frobenius theorem concerning the positivity of the dominant eigenvector.
We then devise a rectification procedure based on a canonical gauge
transformation of the biased Hamiltonian, yielding an effective dynamics in
agreement with the original conditioning. Along the way, we present simple
examples in support of our conjecture, we examine its consequences on important
physical objects such as the fluctuation symmetries of the biased and rectified
processes as well as the dual dynamics obtained through time-reversal. We apply
all those results to simple independent and interacting models, including a
stochastic chemical reaction network and a population process called the
Brownian Donkey.

with limited sensing, communication, and localization constraints in non-GPS
environments is a challenging problem. To take the localization constraints
into account, in this paper, we consider a heterogeneous robotic system
consisting of two types of agents: anchor agents with accurate localization
capability and auxiliary agents with low localization accuracy. To localize
itself, the auxiliary agents must be within the communication range of an
{anchor}, directly or indirectly. The robotic team's objective is to minimize
environmental uncertainty through persistent monitoring. We propose a
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based architecture with graph
convolution called Graph Localized Proximal Policy Optimization (GALOPP), which
incorporates the limited sensor field-of-view, communication, and localization
constraints of the agents along with persistent monitoring objectives to
determine motion policies for each agent. We evaluate the performance of GALOPP
on open maps with obstacles having a different number of anchor and auxiliary
agents. We further study (i) the effect of communication range, obstacle
density, and sensing range on the performance and (ii) compare the performance
of GALOPP with non-RL baselines, namely, greedy search, random search, and
random search with communication constraint. For its generalization capability,
we also evaluated GALOPP in two different environments -- 2-room and 4-room.
The results show that GALOPP learns the policies and monitors the area well. As
a proof-of-concept, we perform hardware experiments to demonstrate the
performance of GALOPP.

high-velocity impacts against a fixed and rigid substrate. We considered single
and multi-shell CNO (up to six shells) and at different impact velocities (from

collapsed CNO (inelastic collisions, between 3.0 and 5.0 Km/s) forming a
diamondoid-like core, and fragmented CNO yielding linear atomic carbon chains
(above 5.0 Km/s). We also discussed the dynamical reconfiguration of
carbon-carbon bonds during the collision process. The impact of CNO against the
substrate yielded $sp^3$-like bond types for all the used initial velocities.
At intermediate velocities (between 3.0 and 5.0 Km/s), the inelastic collision
forms diamondoid-like cores by converting a substantial quantity of $sp^2$
bonds into $sp^3$ ones. In the high velocities regime, the total number of
$sp^1$, $sp^2$, and $sp^3$ bonds tend to be similar.

this coupling yields superior generalization capabilities for object

an object geometry estimate in a single forward pass. Both of these outputs can
be used in a wide range of robotic manipulation applications. With rigorous
experimental validation, both in simulation and on a real setup, we show that

This implies
the reliance on third parties called oracles when extrinsic data is needed for
smart contracts. However, reintroducing trust and single point of failure,
oracles implementation is still controversial and debated. The blindness to the
real world makes blockchains also unable to communicate with each other
preventing any form of interoperability. An early approach to the
interoperability issue is constituted by wrapped tokens, representing
blockchain native tokens issued on a non-native blockchain. Similar to how
oracles reintroduce trust, and single point of failure, the issuance of wrapped
tokens involves third parties whose characteristics need to be considered when
evaluating the advantages of crossing-chains. This paper provides an overview
of the wrapped tokens and the main technologies implemented in their issuance.
Advantages, as well as limitations, are also listed and discussed.

specifically: for functional data sets drawn from a functional manifold which
is defined by the data's modes of variation in amplitude and phase. Based on
this manifold, we develop a conceptualization of functional outlier detection
that is more widely applicable and realistic than previously proposed. Our
theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate several important advantages
of this perspective: It considerably improves theoretical understanding and
allows to describe and analyse complex functional outlier scenarios
consistently and in full generality, by differentiating between structurally
anomalous outlier data that are off-manifold and distributionally outlying data
that are on-manifold but at its margins. This improves practical feasibility of
functional outlier detection: We show that simple manifold learning methods can
be used to reliably infer and visualize the geometric structure of functional
data sets. We also show that standard outlier detection methods requiring
tabular data inputs can be applied to functional data very successfully by
simply using their vector-valued representations learned from manifold learning
methods as input features. Our experiments on synthetic and real data sets
demonstrate that this approach leads to outlier detection performances at least
on par with existing functional data-specific methods in a large variety of
settings, without the highly specialized, complex methodology and narrow domain
of application these methods often entail.

sine-Gordon model. In our protocol, the system is prepared in an inhomogeneous
initial state in finite volume by coupling the topological charge density
operator to a Gaussian external field. After switching off the external field,
the subsequent time evolution is governed by the homogeneous sine-Gordon
Hamiltonian. Varying either the interaction strength of the sine-Gordon model
or the amplitude of the external source field, an interesting transition is
observed in the expectation value of the soliton density. This affects both the
initial profile of the density and its time evolution and can be summarised as
a steep transition between behaviours reminiscent of the Klein-Gordon, and the
free massive Dirac fermion theory with initial external fields of high enough
magnitude. The transition in the initial state is also displayed by the
classical sine-Gordon theory and hence can be understood by semi-classical
considerations in terms of the presence of small amplitude field configurations
and the appearance of soliton excitations, which are naturally associated with
bosonic and fermionic excitations on the quantum level, respectively. Features
of the quantum dynamics are also consistent with this correspondence and
comparing them to the classical evolution of the density profile reveals that
quantum effects become markedly pronounced during the time evolution. These
results suggest a crossover between the dominance of bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom whose precise identification in terms of the fundamental
particle excitations can be rather non-trivial. Nevertheless, their interplay
is expected to influence the sine-Gordon dynamics in arbitrary inhomogeneous
settings.

  welcome",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ac2f48",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has reported 50 black hole-black hole (BH-BH)
mergers and 8 candidates recovered from digging deeper into the detectors
noise. The majority of these mergers have low effective spins pointing toward
low BH spins and efficient angular momentum transport in massive stars as
proposed by several models (e.g., the Tayler-Spruit dynamo). However, out of
these 58 mergers, 7 are consistent with having high effective spin parameter
(chi_eff>0.3). Additionally, 2 events seem to have high effective spins sourced
from the spin of the primary (more massive) BH. These particular observations
could be used to discriminate between the isolated binary and dynamical
formation channels. It might seem that high BH spins point to a dynamical
origin if angular momentum transport in stars is efficient and forms
low-spinning BHs. In such a case dynamical formation is required to produce
second and third generations of BH-BH mergers with typically high-spinning BHs.
Here we show, however, that isolated binary BH-BH formation also naturally
reproduces such highly spinning BHs. Our models start with efficient angular
momentum transport in massive stars that is needed to reproduce the majority of
BH-BH mergers with low effective spins. Later, some of the binaries are subject
to a tidal spin-up allowing the formation of a moderate fraction (~10%) of
BH-BH mergers with high effective spins (chi_eff>=0.4-0.5). In addition,
isolated binary evolution can produce a small fraction of BH-BH mergers with
almost maximally spinning primary BHs. Therefore, the formation scenario of
these atypical BH-BH mergers remains to be found.

in its thermodynamical properties and chemical content over a large mass range,
$M_*\sim10^{10-11.5}M_\odot$. Along the minor axis directions, gas density is
diluted, whereas temperature and metallicity are enhanced. These

extend out to the halo virial radius, and peak at Milky Way-like masses,

infer the stars' fundamental properties by modeling their FUV through
near-infrared spectral energy distributions and identify stars in the SMC with
similar properties to each of our targets. Comparing to the FUV spectra of the

(2) the most metal-poor star in Leo P is driving a much weaker stellar wind
than its SMC counterparts. We measure projected rotation speeds and find that
the two most metal-poor stars have high $v

Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA) systems suggest $\gtrsim{}85$ per cent. In all three
simulations, hot, low-density gas is also a major contributor to the cosmic
metal budget, even at high redshift. By considering the evolution in cosmic SFR
density ($\rho_{\rm SFR}$), neutral gas density ($\rho_{\rm HI}$), and mean
gas-phase metallicity ($[\langle{}{\rm M/H}\rangle{}]_{\rm neu}$), we determine
two possible ways in which the $\rho_{\rm met,neu}$ observed in DLAs at high
redshift can be matched by simulations: (a) the $\rho_{\rm SFR}$ at
$z\gtrsim{}3$ is greater than inferred from current FUV observations, or (b)
current high-redshift DLA metallicity samples have a higher mean host mass than
the overall galaxy population. If the first is correct, TNG100 would match the
ensemble data best, however there would be an outstanding tension between the
currently observed $\rho_{\rm SFR}$ and $\rho_{\rm met,neu}$. If the second is
correct, L-GALAXIES 2020 would match the ensemble data best, but would require
an increase in neutral gas mass inside subhaloes above $z\sim{}2.5$. If neither
is correct, EAGLE would match the ensemble data best, although at the expense
of over-estimating $[\langle{}{\rm M/H}\rangle{}]_{\rm neu}$. Modulo details
related to numerical resolution and HI mass modelling in simulations, these
incompatibilities highlight current tensions between key observed cosmic
properties at high redshift.

transfer simulations to model the effect of inhomogeneous reionisation on the
1D power spectrum of the \Lya forest transmitted flux at redshifts $4.2\leq z
\leq 5$. Relative to models that assume a homogeneous UV background,
reionisation suppresses the power spectrum at small scales, $k \sim
0.1\rm\,km^{-1}\,s$ by $\sim 10$ per cent because of spatial variations in the
thermal broadening kernel and the divergent peculiar velocity field associated
with over-pressurised intergalactic gas. On larger scales,
$k<0.03\rm\,km^{-1}\,s$, the power spectrum is instead enhanced by $10$--$50$
per cent by large scale spatial variations in the neutral hydrogen fraction.
The effect of inhomogeneous reionisation must therefore be accounted for in
analyses of forthcoming high precision measurements. We provide a correction
for the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum at $4.1\leq z \leq 5.4$ that can be
easily applied within other parameter inference frameworks using similar
reionisation models. We perform a Bayesian analysis of mock data to assess the
extent of systematic biases that may arise in measurements of the intergalactic
medium if ignoring this correction. At the scales probed by current high
resolution Ly$\alpha$ forest data at $z>4$, $0.006 \rm \,km^{-1}\,s\leq k \leq
0.2 \rm\, km^{-1}\,s$, we find inhomogeneous reionisation does not introduce
any significant bias in thermal parameter recovery for the current measurement
uncertainties of $\sim 10$ per cent. However, for $5$ per cent uncertainties,
$\sim 1\sigma$ shifts between the estimated and true parameters occur.

using redundant function sets known as frames. We develop a particular frame
constructed from the union of all occupancy-based cluster expansion basis sets.
We illustrate how using this highly redundant frame yields sparse expansions of
the configuration energy of complex oxide materials that are competitive and
often surpass the prediction accuracy and sparsity of models obtained from
standard cluster expansions.

high granularity and temporal precision without disrupting the emotion

responses are sparsely sampled and the missing data are recovered using a
computational technique known as collaborative filtering (CF). This approach
leverages structured covariation across individual experiences and is available
in Neighbors, an open-source Python toolbox. We validate our approach across
three different experimental contexts by recovering dense individual ratings
using only a small subset of the original data. In dataset 1, participants
(n=316) separately rated 112 emotional images on 6 different discrete emotions.
In dataset 2, participants (n=203) watched 8 short emotionally engaging
autobiographical stories while simultaneously providing moment-by-moment
ratings of the intensity of their affective experience. In dataset 3,
participants (n=60) with distinct social preferences made 76 decisions about
how much money to return in a hidden multiplier trust game. Across all
experimental contexts, CF was able to accurately recover missing data and
importantly outperformed mean imputation, particularly in contexts with greater
individual variability. This approach will enable new avenues for affective
science research by allowing researchers to acquire high dimensional ratings
from emotional experiences with minimal disruption to the emotion-generation

Segmentation quality control is an important step to ensure the accuracy of

Usually, the segmentation quality control happens after the data acquisition.
At the data acquisition time, the operator could not know the quality of the
segmentation results. On-the-fly segmentation quality control could help the
operator to adjust the ultrasound probe or retake data if the quality is
unsatisfied, which can greatly reduce the effort of time-consuming manual

such formulation. Informally, any data-driven formulation can be seen to
balance a measure of proximity of the estimated cost to the actual cost while
guaranteeing a level of out-of-sample performance. Given an acceptable level of
out-of-sample performance, we construct explicitly a data-driven formulation

the same out-of-sample performance. We show the existence of three distinct
out-of-sample performance regimes (a superexponential regime, an exponential

data-driven formulation experiences a phase transition. The optimal data-driven
formulations can be interpreted as a classically robust formulation in the

decade of observations of night light. The daily frequency of sampling, without
the temporal averaging of annual composites, requires the distinction between
apparent changes of imaged night light related to the imaging process and
actual changes in the underlying sources of the light being imaged. This study
characterizes night light variability over a range of spatial and temporal
scales to provide a context for interpretation of changes on both subannual and
interannual time scales. This analysis uses a combination of temporal moments,
spatial correlation and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. A key
result is the pervasive heteroskedasticity of VIIRS monthly mean night light.
Specifically, the monotonic decrease of temporal variability with increasing
mean brightness. Anthropogenic night light is remarkably stable on subannual
time scales. Overall variance partition derived from the eigenvalues of the
spatiotemporal covariance matrix are 88%, 2% and 2% for spatial, seasonal and
interannual variance in the most diverse geographic region on Earth (Eurasia).
Heteroskedasticity is present in all areas for all months, suggesting that
much, if not most, of observed month-to-month variability may result from
luminance of otherwise stable sources subjected to multiple aspects of the
imaging process varying in time. Given the skewed distribution of all night
light arising from radial peripheral dimming of bright sources, even aggregate
metrics using thresholds must be interpreted in light of the fact that much
larger numbers of more variable low luminance pixels may statistically
overwhelm smaller numbers of stable higher luminance pixels and cause apparent
changes related to the imaging process to be interpreted as actual changes in
the light sources.

presents multiple Seyfert type transitions from type 2 to intermediate-type,
losing and regaining its H$\alpha$ BEL recurrently. In X-rays, the source shows
intrinsic variability with the absorption corrected luminosity varying by a
factor of $\sim$ 40. We rule out tidal disruption events or variable
obscuration as causes of the type transitions and show that the presence and
the flux of the broad H$\alpha$ emission line are directly correlated with the
2-10 keV X-ray luminosity (L$_{2-10}$): the component disappears at L$_{2-10}
\leq 2.6\times10^{42}$\ergcms, this value translates into an Eddington ratio
($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) of $\sim$ 1\%. The $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in which the BEL
transitions occur is the same as the critical value at which there should be a
state transition between a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a
thin accretion disk, such similarity suggests that the AGN is operating at the
threshold mass accretion rate between the two accretion modes. We find a
correlation between the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ flux and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, and
an anti-correlation between full-width at half maximum of H$\alpha$ BEL and
$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Two possible
scenarios for type transitions are compatible with our results: either the
dimming of the AGN continuum, which reduces the supply of ionising photons
available to excite the gas in the Broad Line Region (BLR), or the fading of
the BLR structure itself occurs as the low accretion rate is not able to
sustain the required cloud flow rate in a disk-wind BLR model.

to a variety of areas including statistical physics, graphical models,
phylogenetic reconstruction, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and community detection

achieves Bayes-optimal performance for the reconstruction problem of predicting
the value of the Markov process at the root of the tree from its values at the
leaves.
  Recently, the analysis of low-degree polynomials has emerged as a valuable
tool for predicting computational-to-statistical gaps. In this work, we
investigate the performance of low-degree polynomials for the reconstruction
problem on trees. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that there are simple tree
models with $N$ leaves and bounded arity where (1) nontrivial reconstruction of
the root value is possible with a simple polynomial time algorithm and with
robustness to noise, but not with any polynomial of degree $N^{c}$ for $c > 0$
a constant depending only on the arity, and (2) when the tree is unknown and
given multiple samples with correlated root assignments, nontrivial
reconstruction of the root value is possible with a simple Statistical Query
algorithm but not with any polynomial of degree $N^c$. These results clarify
some of the limitations of low-degree polynomials vs. polynomial time
algorithms for Bayesian estimation problems. They also complement recent work
of Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon who studied the circuit complexity of Belief
Propagation. As a consequence of our main result, we show that for some $c' >
0$ depending only on the arity, $\exp(N^{c'})$ many samples are needed for RBF
kernel regression to obtain nontrivial correlation with the true regression
function (BP). We pose related open questions about low-degree polynomials and
the Kesten-Stigum threshold.

We find that atmospheric filtering and core segmentation treatments have
distance-dependent impacts on the resulting core properties for d < 300pc and
500pc, respectively, which dominate over evolutionary differences.
Concentrating on synthetic observations at further distances (650-1000pc), we
find a growing separation between the inferred sizes and masses of cores with

of the Mon R2 cloud at 860pc. We find that the synthetic cores cluster in
smaller groups, and their mass densities are correlated with gas column density
over a much narrower range, than the Mon R2 observations. Such differences
limit applicability of the evolutionary predictions we report here and motivate
future efforts to adapt our synthetic observation and analysis framework to

competing forces that can drive or restrict phase separation in interconverting

with tunable chiral interconversion and interaction properties to elucidate the
physics underlying the stabilization and tunability of phase separation in
fluids with interconverting states. We show that introducing an imbalance in
the intermolecular forces between two enantiomers results in nonequilibrium,
arrested phase separation into microdomains. We also find that in the
equilibrium case, when all interaction forces are conservative, the growth of

phase amplification, in which one of the two alternative phases grows at the

performance in image classification tasks. However, current ConvNets cannot
guarantee the capabilities of the mammalian visual systems such as invariance
to contrast and illumination changes. Some ideas to overcome the illumination
and contrast variations usually have to be tuned manually and tend to fail when
tested with other types of data degradation. In this context, we present a new
bio-inspired {entry} layer, M6, which detects low-level geometric features
(lines, edges, and orientations) which are similar to patterns detected by the
V1 visual cortex. This new trainable layer is capable of coping with image
classification even with large contrast variations. The explanation for this
behavior is the monogenic signal geometry, which represents each pixel value in
a 3D space using quaternions, a fact that confers a degree of explainability to
the networks. We compare M6 with a conventional convolutional layer (C) and a
deterministic quaternion local phase layer (Q9). The experimental setup {is
designed to evaluate the robustness} of our M6 enriched ConvNet model and
includes three architectures, four datasets, three types of contrast
degradation (including non-uniform haze degradations). The numerical results
reveal that the models with M6 are the most robust in front of any kind of
contrast variations. This amounts to a significant enhancement of the C models,
which usually have reasonably good performance only when the same training and
test degradation are used, except for the case of maximum degradation.
Moreover, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is used to analyze and
explain the robustness effect of the M6 feature maps under any kind of contrast
degradations.

shaped, narrow channels and present a theoretical framework for calculating the
relationship between the flow rate $q$ and pressure drop $\Delta p$. We utilize
the Oldroyd-B model and first identify the characteristic scales and
dimensionless parameters governing the flow in the lubrication limit. Employing
a perturbation expansion in powers of the Deborah number ($De$), we provide
analytical expressions for the velocity, stress, and the $q-\Delta p$ relation
in the weakly viscoelastic limit up to $O(De^2)$. Furthermore, we exploit the
reciprocal theorem derived by Boyko $\&$ Stone (Phys. Rev. Fluids, vol. 6,
2021, pp. L081301) to obtain the $q-\Delta p$ relation at the next order,
$O(De^3)$, using only the velocity and stress fields at the previous orders. We
validate our analytical results with two-dimensional numerical simulations of
the Oldroyd-B fluid in a hyperbolic, symmetric contracting channel and find
excellent agreement. For the flow-rate-controlled situation, both our theory
and simulations reveal weak dependence of the velocity field on the Deborah
number, so that the velocity can be approximated as Newtonian. In contrast to
the velocity, the pressure drop strongly depends on the viscoelastic effects
and decreases with $De$. Elucidating the relative importance of different terms
in the momentum equation contributing to the pressure drop, we identify that a
pressure drop reduction for narrow contracting geometries is primarily due to
gradients in the viscoelastic shear stresses, while viscoelastic axial stresses
have a minor effect on the pressure drop along the symmetry line.

spanning tree polynomial, a classic polynomial in algebraic complexity and
beyond.
  First, we show that the spanning tree polynomials having $n$ variables and
defined over constant-degree expander graphs, have monotone arithmetic
complexity $2^{\Omega(n)}$. This yields the first strongly exponential lower
bound on the monotone arithmetic circuit complexity for a polynomial in VP.
Before this result, strongly exponential size monotone lower bounds were known
only for explicit polynomials in VNP (Gashkov-Sergeev'12, Raz-Yehudayoff'11,
Srinivasan'20, Cavalar-Kumar-Rossman'20, Hrubes-Yehudayoff'21).
  Recently, Hrubes'20 initiated a program to prove lower bounds against general
arithmetic circuits by proving $\epsilon$-sensitive lower bounds for monotone
arithmetic circuits for a specific range of values for $\epsilon \in (0,1)$. We
consider the spanning tree polynomial $ST_{n}$ defined over the complete graph
on $n$ vertices and show that the polynomials $F_{n-1,n} - \epsilon \cdot
ST_{n}$ and $F_{n-1,n} + \epsilon \cdot ST_{n}$ defined over $n^2$ variables,
have monotone circuit complexity $2^{\Omega(n)}$ if $\epsilon \geq
2^{-\Omega(n)}$ and $F_{n-1,n} = \prod_{i=2}^n (x_{i,1} +\cdots + x_{i,n})$ is
the complete set-multilinear polynomial. This provides the first
$\epsilon$-sensitive exponential lower bound for a family of polynomials inside
VP. En-route, we consider a problem in 2-party, best partition communication
complexity of deciding whether two sets of oriented edges distributed among
Alice and Bob form a spanning tree or not. We prove that there exists a fixed
distribution, under which the problem has low discrepancy with respect to every
nearly-balanced partition. This result could be of interest beyond algebraic
complexity.

distributions in the rotation rates of their stellar populations, with a
dominant peak of rapidly rotating stars and a secondary peak of slow rotators.
The origin of this bimodal rotational distribution is currently debated and two
main theories have been put forward in the literature. The first is that
all/most stars are born as rapid rotators and that interacting binaries brake a
fraction of the stars, resulting in two populations. The second is that the
rotational distribution is a reflection of the early evolution of pre-main
sequence stars, in particular, whether they are able to retain or lose their
protoplanetary discs during the first few Myr. Here, we test the binary channel
by exploiting multi-epoch VLT/MUSE observations of NGC 1850, a 100Myr massive
cluster in the LMC, to search for differences in the binary fractions of the
slow and fast rotating populations. If binarity is the cause of the rotational
bimodality, we would expect that the slowly rotating population should have a
much larger binary fraction than the rapid rotators. However, in our data we
detect similar fractions of binary stars in the slow and rapidly rotating
populations (5.9+/-1.1% and 4.5+/-0.6%, respectively).Hence, we conclude that
binarity is not a dominant mechanism in the formation of the observed bimodal
rotational distributions.

interested in the prediction of a particular region of predictor variables. A
standard approach is to find the globally best modeling method from a set of
candidate methods. However, it is perhaps rare in reality that one candidate

scenario is to apply a weighted $L_2$ loss in performance assessment to reflect
the region-specific interest. We propose a targeted cross-validation (TCV) to
select models or procedures based on a general weighted $L_2$ loss. We show
that the TCV is consistent in selecting the best performing candidate under the

TCV and its potential advantage over the global CV or the approach of using
only local data for modeling a local region.
  Previous investigations on CV have relied on the condition that when the
sample size is large enough, the ranking of two candidates stays the same.
However, in many applications with the setup of changing data-generating
processes or highly adaptive modeling methods, the relative performance of the
methods is not static as the sample size varies. Even with a fixed
data-generating process, it is possible that the ranking of two methods
switches infinitely many times. In this work, we broaden the concept of the
selection consistency by allowing the best candidate to switch as the sample
size varies, and then establish the consistency of the TCV. This flexible
framework can be applied to high-dimensional and complex machine learning

transfer information directly (i.e. in a single/one hop) from the complex model

propose a meta-approach where we transfer information from the complex model to

intermediate models of decreasing complexity that are less intricate than the
original complex model. Our approach can transfer information between
consecutive models in the sequence using any of the previously mentioned

coulo-metric readouts on the same material, with no additional reagents
required. Utilizing the light-induced charge storage function of K-PHI, we
demonstrate analyte sensing via charge accumulation and present various methods
to write/erase this information from the material. Additionally, fully wireless
colorimetric and fluorometric detection of the charged state of K-PHI is
demonstrated and could facilitate its use as particle-based in-situ sensing
probe. The various readout options of the K PHI's response enable us to adapt
the sensitivities and dynamic ranges without modifying the sensor. We
demonstrate these features using glucose as an example analyte over a wide
range of concentrations (50 $\mu$M to 50 mM). Moreover, due to the strong
oxidative power of K-PHI, this sensing platform is able to detect a large
variety of organic or biologically relevant analytes. Since PHI is easily
synthesized, based on earth abundant precursors, biocompatible, chemically
robust and responsive to visible light, we anticipate that the sensing platform
presented herein opens up novel memristive and neuromorphic functions.

(NO3-) in water, as a possible nitrogen fertilizer for recreational turf such
as ryegrass and bentgrass. Experiments were carried out to study the effects of
nitrate concentration on growth, the further effects of adding phosphorous (P)
and potassium (K) to the plasma nitrated solution to make an N-P-K complete
fertilizer, and to compare the efficacy of plasma-fixated nitrogen to sodium
nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3). The results indicate that the
growth and biomass of the plants were strongly dependent on the concentration
of the plasma-fixated nitrogen. Adding P-K to the plasma-fixated nitrogen
improved grass growth. Grass that was supplied plasma-fixated nitrogen had
improved growth compared to those supplied with equal amounts of NaNO3and KNO3.

For instance, a probabilistic parser may marginalize over exponentially many
trees to make predictions. Algorithms for such problems often employ dynamic

runtime can be unintuitive, time-consuming, and error-prone. Our work aims to
automate this laborious process. Given an initial correct declarative program,
we search for a sequence of semantics-preserving transformations to improve its
running time as much as possible. To this end, we describe a set of program
transformations, a simple metric for assessing the efficiency of a transformed
program, and a heuristic search procedure to improve this metric. We show that
in practice, automated search -- like the mental search performed by human

Empirically, we show that many common speed-ups described in the NLP literature

result, many of the existing popular control strategies, i.e., droop control,

unified into a multivariable feedback control transfer matrix working on
several linear and nonlinear error signals. Meanwhile, unlike the traditional
assumptions of decoupling between AC and DC control, active power and reactive
power control, the proposed configuration simultaneously takes all of them into

the control parameters. At last, simulation and experimental results show

that the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconductor LaNiGa$_2$ is
enabled by its previously unknown topological electronic band structure. Our
single crystal diffraction experiments indicate a nonsymmorphic crystal
structure, in contrast to the previously reported symmorphic structure. The
nonsymmorphic symmetries transform the $k_z=\pi/c$ plane of the Brillouin zone
boundary into a node-surface. Band-structure calculations reveal that distinct
Fermi surfaces become degenerate on the node-surface and form Dirac lines and a
Dirac loop at the Fermi level. Two symmetry related Dirac points remain
degenerate under spin-orbit coupling. ARPES measurements confirm the
calculations and provide evidence for the Fermi surface degeneracies on the
node-surface. These unique topological features enable an unconventional
superconducting gap in which time-reversal symmetry can be broken in the
absence of other typical ingredients. LaNiGa$_2$ is therefore a topological
crystalline superconductor that breaks time-reversal symmetry without any
overlapping magnetic ordering or fluctuations. Our findings will enable future

precision probes of strong-field gravity. There is thus now a standard set of
null tests of general relativity (GR) applied to LIGO-Virgo detections and many
more such tests proposed. However, the relation between all these tests is not
yet well understood. We start to investigate this by applying a set of standard
tests to simulated observations of binary black holes in GR and with
phenomenological deviations from GR. We consider four types of tests:
residuals, inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency, parameterized phasing (two
varieties), and modified dispersion relation. We also check the consistency of
the unmodeled reconstruction of the waveforms with the waveform recovered using
GR templates. These tests are applied to simulated observations similar to
GW150914 with both large and small deviations from GR and similar to GW170608
just with small deviations from GR. We find that while very large deviations
from GR are picked up with high significance by almost all tests, more moderate
deviations are picked up by only a few tests, and some deviations are not
recognized as GR violations by any test at the moderate signal-to-noise ratios
we consider. Moreover, the tests that identify various deviations with high
significance are not necessarily the expected ones. In particular, the
parameterized tests recover PN test parameters much closer to zero than their
true values in some cases. Additionally, we find that of the GR deviations we
consider, the residuals test is only able to detect extreme deviations from GR
that no longer look like binary black hole coalescences in GR. The
reconstruction comparison shows more promise for detecting relatively small GR
deviations in an unmodeled framework, at least for high-mass systems.

sound explanation methods. Instance-based explanation methods are a popular
type that return selective instances from the training set to explain the
predictions for a test sample. One way to connect these explanations with
prediction is to ask the following counterfactual question - how does the loss
and prediction for a test sample change when explanations are removed from the
training set? Our paper answers this question for k-NNs which are natural
contenders for an instance-based explanation method. We first demonstrate
empirically that the representation space induced by last layer of a neural
network is the best to perform k-NN in. Using this layer, we conduct our
experiments and compare them to influence functions (IFs)
~\cite{koh2017understanding} which try to answer a similar question. Our
evaluations do indicate change in loss and predictions when explanations are
removed but we do not find a trend between $k$ and loss or prediction change.
We find significant stability in the predictions and loss of MNIST vs.
CIFAR-10. Surprisingly, we do not observe much difference in the behavior of
k-NNs vs. IFs on this question. We attribute this to training set subsampling
for IFs.

phenomena such as featureless energy spectra that have been observed
empirically for earthquakes, avalanches, and solar flares. If this
interpretation proves correct, it implies that the solar coronal magnetic field
maintains itself in a critical state via a delicate balance between the
dynamo-driven injection of magnetic energy and the release of that energy via
flaring events. All-sky high-cadence surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) provide the necessary data to compare the energy
distribution of flaring events in stars of different spectral types to that
observed in the Sun. We identified $\sim 10^6$ flaring events on $\sim 10^5$
stars observed by TESS at 2-minute cadence. By fitting the flare frequency
distribution for different mass bins, we find that all main sequence stars
exhibit distributions of flaring events similar to that observed in the Sun,
independent of their mass or age. This may suggest that stars universally
maintain a critical state in their coronal topologies via magnetic reconnection

this end, we extend the Brutus N-body code to include Post-Newtonian pairwise
terms up to 2.5 order, and the first order Taylor expansion to the
Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equations of motion. The degree to which our system is
relativistic depends on the scaling of the total mass (the unit size was 1
parsec). Using the Brutus method of convergence, we test for time-reversibility
in the conservative regime, and demonstrate that we are able to obtain
definitive solutions to the relativistic three-body problem. It is also
confirmed that the minimal required numerical accuracy for a successful
time-reversibility test correlates with the amplification factor of an initial
perturbation. When we take into account dissipative effects through
gravitational wave emission, we find that the duration of the resonance, and
the amount of exponential growth of small perturbations depend on the mass
scaling. For a unit mass <= 10 MSun, the system behavior is indistinguishable
from the Newtonian case, and the resonance always ends in a binary and one
escaping body. For a mass scaling up to 1e7 MSun, relativity gradually becomes
more prominent, but the majority of the systems still dissolve. The first
mergers start to appear for a mass of ~1e5 MSun, and between 1e7 MSun and 1e9
MSun all systems end prematurely in a merger. These mergers are preceded by a
gravitational wave driven in-spiral. For a mass scaling >= 1e9 MSun, all
systems result in a gravitational wave merger upon the first close encounter.
Relativistic three-body encounters thus provide an efficient pathway for
resolving the final parsec problem. The onset of mergers at the characteristic
mass scale of 1e7 MSun potentially leaves an imprint in the mass function of
supermassive black holes.

design-variable-coded multi-layer perceptron (DV-MLP), design-variable
hypernetworks (DV-Hnet), and non-linear independent dual system (NIDS). Each
method utilizes a main network which consumes pointwise spatial information to
provide a continuous representation, allowing predictions at any location in
the domain. Input features include a minimum-distance function evaluation to
implicitly encode the problem geometry. The geometric design variables, which
define and distinguish problem instances, are used differently by each method,
appearing as additional main-network input features (DV-MLP), or as
hypernetwork inputs (DV-Hnet and NIDS). The methods are applied to predict
solutions around complex, parametrically-defined geometries on
non-parametrically-defined meshes with model predictions obtained many orders
of magnitude faster than the full order models. Test cases include a
vehicle-aerodynamics problem with complex geometry and limited training data,
with a design-variable hypernetwork performing best, with a competitive

models trained on CAD show lower in-domain performance, they generalize better
out-of-domain. We unpack this apparent discrepancy using machine explanations

solve this challenge by making a linear transformation of Maxwell's equations
which maps perturbations of the surrounding medium onto effective perturbations
within the system where the resonant states are complete. By treating such
perturbations with the rigorous resonant state expansion, we find the modified
modes of the system for arbitrary perturbations of the medium with any required
accuracy. Numerically efficient single and few mode approximations are shown to
be precise in practically important cases of, respectively, plasmonic
nanoparticles and dielectric micro resonators.

non-maneuvering target in the presence of safety constraints and bounded
disturbances. The presence of disturbances prevents convergence to a unique
docking state, so in our formulation, docking is defined as occurring within a
set constructed using prescribed tolerances. Safety is ensured via application
of Robust Control Barrier Functions to render a designated safe set forward
invariant for any allowable disturbance. However, this safety strategy
necessarily presumes a worst-case disturbance, and thus restricts trajectories
to a subset of the safe set when a worst-case disturbance is not present. The
presented controller accounts for this restriction, and guarantees that the
spacecraft both remains safe and achieves docking in finite time for any
allowable disturbance. The controller is then validated in simulation for a
spacecraft landing on an asteroid, and two spacecraft docking in low Earth
orbit.

Improving Transferability of Authorship Obfuscation","Submitted to PETS 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stylometric approaches have been shown to be quite effective for real-world
authorship attribution. To mitigate the privacy threat posed by authorship
attribution, researchers have proposed automated authorship obfuscation
approaches that aim to conceal the stylometric artefacts that give away the
identity of an anonymous document's author. Recent work has focused on
authorship obfuscation approaches that rely on black-box access to an
attribution classifier to evade attribution while preserving semantics.
However, to be useful under a realistic threat model, it is important that
these obfuscation approaches work well even when the adversary's attribution
classifier is different from the one used internally by the obfuscator.
Unfortunately, existing authorship obfuscation approaches do not transfer well
to unseen attribution classifiers. In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based
approach for transferable authorship obfuscation. Our experiments show that if
an obfuscator can evade an ensemble attribution classifier, which is based on
multiple base attribution classifiers, it is more likely to transfer to
different attribution classifiers. Our analysis shows that ensemble-based
authorship obfuscation achieves better transferability because it combines the
knowledge from each of the base attribution classifiers by essentially
averaging their decision boundaries.

However, numerous competing methods for a given task in the deep learning

competing deep learning methods applicable to PE diagnosis using CTPA at the
both image and exam levels. At the image level, we compare convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) with vision transformers, and contrast self-supervised learning
(SSL) with supervised learning, followed by an evaluation of transfer learning
compared with training from scratch. At the exam level, we focus on comparing
conventional classification (CC) with multiple instance learning (MIL). Our
extensive experiments consistently show: (1) transfer learning consistently
boosts performance despite differences between natural images and CT scans, (2)
transfer learning with SSL surpasses its supervised counterparts; (3) CNNs
outperform vision transformers, which otherwise show satisfactory performance;
and (4) CC is, surprisingly, superior to MIL. Compared with the state of the

time-varying treatment is that one has measured sufficient covariates to ensure
that within covariate strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed

SRA is often criticized as it requires one to accurately measure all
confounders. Realistically, measured covariates can rarely capture all
confounders with certainty. Often covariate measurements are at best proxies of
confounders, thus invalidating inferences under SRA. In this paper, we extend
the proximal causal inference (PCI) framework of Miao et al. (2018) to the
longitudinal setting under a semiparametric marginal structural mean model

settings where SRA based on measured time-varying covariates fails, by formally
accounting for the covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of underlying
confounding mechanisms. We establish nonparametric identification with a pair
of time-varying proxies and provide a corresponding characterization of regular

directly translates the image feature map into the object detection result.
Though effective, translating the full feature map can be costly due to
redundant computation on some area like the background. In this work, we
encapsulate the idea of reducing spatial redundancy into a novel poll and pool
(PnP) sampling module, with which we build an end-to-end PnP-DETR architecture
that adaptively allocates its computation spatially to be more efficient.
Concretely, the PnP module abstracts the image feature map into fine foreground
object feature vectors and a small number of coarse background contextual
feature vectors. The transformer models information interaction within the
fine-coarse feature space and translates the features into the detection
result. Moreover, the PnP-augmented model can instantly achieve various desired
trade-offs between performance and computation with a single model by varying
the sampled feature length, without requiring to train multiple models as
existing methods. Thus it offers greater flexibility for deployment in diverse
scenarios with varying computation constraint. We further validate the
generalizability of the PnP module on panoptic segmentation and the recent
transformer-based image recognition model ViT and show consistent efficiency
gain. We believe our method makes a step for efficient visual analysis with

central from fundamental and application oriented perspectives. In this paper
we show how the interplay of electron-electron interactions and a magnetic

can be detected in ARPES-type experiments and optical measurements. We study
this by using matrix product states (MPS) to compute the time evolution of
single-particle spectral functions and of the optical conductivity following an
electron-hole excitation in a class of one-dimensional correlated
band-insulators, simulated by Hubbard models with on-site interactions and
alternating local magnetic fields. An excitation in only one specific spin
direction leads to an additional band in the gap region of the spectral
function only in the spin direction unaffected by the excitation and to an
additional peak in the optical conductivity. As both is formed only after the
excitation, this is interpreted as a dark exciton, which shows only in one spin
direction. Recombination of the excitation happens on much longer time scales
than the ones amenable to MPS. We discuss implications for experimental studies

(AD) into pulsed optical fields thus producing so-called 'tilted pulse fronts'.
Naturally, it is always assumed that the functional form of the
wavelength-dependent propagation angle associated with AD is differentiable
with respect to wavelength. Recent developments in the study of space-time wave
packets -- pulsed beams in which the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom
are inextricably intertwined -- have pointed to the existence of
non-differentiable AD: field configurations in which the propagation angle does
not possess a derivative at some wavelength. Here we investigate the
consequences of introducing non-differentiable AD into a pulsed field and show
that it is the crucial ingredient required to realize group velocities that
deviate from $c$ (the speed of light in vacuum) along the propagation axis in
free space. In contrast, the on-axis phase and group velocities are always
equal in conventional scenarios. Furthermore, we show that non-differentiable
AD is needed for realizing anomalous or normal group-velocity dispersion along
the propagation axis, while simultaneously suppressing all higher-order
dispersion terms. These and several other consequences of non-differentiable AD
are verified experimentally using a pulsed-beam shaper capable of introducing
AD with arbitrary spectral profile. Rather than being an exotic phenomenon,
non-differentiable AD is an accessible, robust, and versatile resource for
sculpting pulsed optical fields.

However, because of the high speed, as well as the problem of penetration loss,

regularization with caching), where perturbations are generated and cached once
every several epochs. As caching all the perturbations imposes memory usage
concerns, we adopt a K-nearest neighbors-based strategy to tackle this issue.
The strategy only requires caching a small amount of perturbations, without
introducing additional training time. We evaluate our proposed method on a set
of neural machine translation and natural language understanding tasks. We
observe that ARCH significantly eases the computational burden (saves up to 70%
of computational time in comparison with conventional approaches). More
surprisingly, by reducing the variance of stochastic gradients, ARCH produces a
notably better (in most of the tasks) or comparable model generalization. Our

teacher-student framework, where the teacher generates pseudo-labels, and the
student makes predictions. The two models are updated alternatingly. However,
such a straightforward alternating update rule leads to training instability.
This is because a small change in the teacher may result in a significant
change in the student. To address this issue, we propose DRIFT, short for
differentiable self-training, that treats teacher-student as a Stackelberg
game. In this game, a leader is always in a more advantageous position than a
follower. In self-training, the student contributes to the prediction
performance, and the teacher controls the training process by generating
pseudo-labels. Therefore, we treat the student as the leader and the teacher as
the follower. The leader procures its advantage by acknowledging the follower's
strategy, which involves differentiable pseudo-labels and differentiable sample
weights. Consequently, the leader-follower interaction can be effectively
captured via Stackelberg gradient, obtained by differentiating the follower's
strategy. Experimental results on semi- and weakly-supervised classification
and named entity recognition tasks show that our model outperforms existing
approaches by large margins.

contain rich sets of information for reported issues and their corresponding
solutions, which can be quite useful for knowledge sharing and future reuse if
extracted and restored in time. However, it remains challenging to accurately
mine such knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chat
data. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of issue-solution pair
extraction from developer live chat data, and propose an automated approach,
named ISPY, based on natural language processing and deep learning techniques
with customized enhancements, to address the problem. Specifically, ISPY
automates three tasks: 1) Disentangle live chat logs, employing a feedforward
neural network to disentangle a conversation history into separate dialogs
automatically; 2) Detect dialogs discussing issues, using a novel convolutional
neural network (CNN), which consists of a BERT-based utterance embedding layer,
a context-aware dialog embedding layer, and an output layer; 3) Extract
appropriate utterances and combine them as corresponding solutions, based on
the same CNN structure but with different feeding inputs. To evaluate ISPY, we
compare it with six baselines, utilizing a dataset with 750 dialogs including
171 issue-solution pairs and evaluate ISPY from eight open source communities.
The results show that, for issue-detection, our approach achieves the F1 of
76%, and outperforms all baselines by 30%. Our approach achieves the F1 of 63%

parameters that govern the underlying dynamics from the data. We show existence
and uniqueness of the analytical solutions of the population delay random

concurrent regression model and also for a second scenario where one has a
delay continuum or distributed delay. The latter involves a functional linear
regression model with history index. The derivative of the process of interest
is modeled using the process itself as predictor and also other functional
predictors with predictor-specific delayed impacts. This dynamics learning
approach is shown to be well suited to model the growth rate of COVID-19 for

KMT-2017-BLG-2509Lb, OGLE-2017-BLG-1099Lb, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0299Lb. The
lensing light curves of the events have a common characteristic that the
planetary signals were produced by the crossings of faint source stars over the
resonant caustics formed by giant planets located near the Einstein rings of
host stars. For all planetary events, the lensing solutions are uniquely
determined without any degeneracy. It is estimated that the host masses are in
the range of $0.45\lesssim M/M_\odot \lesssim 0.59$, which corresponds to early
M to late K dwarfs, and thus the host stars are less massive than the sun. On
the other hand, the planets, with masses in the range of $2.1\lesssim M/M_{\rm
J}\lesssim 6.2$, are heavier than the heaviest planet of the solar system, that
is, Jupiter. The planets in all systems lie beyond the snow lines of the hosts,
and thus the discovered planetary systems, together with many other
microlensing planetary systems, support that massive gas-giant planets are
commonplace around low-mass stars. We discuss the role of late-time
high-resolution imaging in clarifying resonant-image lenses with very faint
sources.

  Upscaling","23pages, WACV 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods have recently gained much attention
for weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) tasks. They allow for CNN
visualization and interpretation without training on fully annotated image
datasets. CAM methods are typically integrated within off-the-shelf CNN
backbones, such as ResNet50. Due to convolution and pooling operations, these
backbones yield low resolution CAMs with a down-scaling factor of up to 32,
contributing to inaccurate localizations. Interpolation is required to restore
full size CAMs, yet it does not consider the statistical properties of objects,
such as color and texture, leading to activations with inconsistent boundaries,
and inaccurate localizations. As an alternative, we introduce a generic method
for parametric upscaling of CAMs that allows constructing accurate full
resolution CAMs (F-CAMs). In particular, we propose a trainable decoding
architecture that can be connected to any CNN classifier to produce highly
accurate CAM localizations. Given an original low resolution CAM, foreground
and background pixels are randomly sampled to fine-tune the decoder. Additional
priors such as image statistics and size constraints are also considered to
expand and refine object boundaries. Extensive experiments, over three CNN
backbones and six WSOL baselines on the CUB-200-2011 and OpenImages datasets,
indicate that our F-CAM method yields a significant improvement in CAM
localization accuracy. F-CAM performance is competitive with state-of-art WSOL
methods, yet it requires fewer computations during inference.

$30\%$ of the area of each map. We quantify the reliability of our results
using two summary statistics: 1) the distance between the probability density
functions (pdf), estimated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, and 2) the
2D power spectrum. We find an excellent agreement between the model prediction
and the unmasked maps when using the power spectrum: better than $1\%$ for
$k<20 h/$Mpc for any irregular mask. For regular masks, we observe a systematic
offset of $\sim5\%$ when covering $15\%$ of the maps while the results become
unreliable when $30\%$ of the data is missing. The observed KS-test p-values
favor the null hypothesis that the reconstructed and the ground-truth maps are
drawn from the same underlying distribution when irregular masks are used. For
regular-shaped masks on the other hand, we find a strong evidence that the two
distributions do not match each other. Finally, we use the model, trained on
gas temperature maps, to perform inpainting on maps from completely different

temperature maps from simulations run with other codes. We find that visually,
our model is able to reconstruct the missing pixels from the maps of those

solutions to the semilinear fractional elliptic equations $$(E) \qquad\qquad
(-\Delta)^s u = u^{\frac{N}{N-2s}}\quad {\rm in}\ \ \Omega\setminus\{0\},\qquad
u\geq 0\quad{\rm in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega,\qquad\qquad\quad $$ where
$s\in(0,1)$, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain containing the origin in
$\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N>2s$ and $\frac{N}{N-2s}$ is the Serrin's critical
exponent. We use an initial asymptotic at infinity to transform the critical
case into a subcritical case where the underlying equation involves the
fractional Hardy operator. The construction of singular solutions is based on
the fact that some special functions are subsolutions of the original problem
near the origin.
  We also classify the non-removable singularities of the solutions of $(E)$
and show the existence of a sequence of isolated singular solutions
parameterizing the coefficients of the second order blow up term. To the best
of our knowledge, this idea has also been first used in this work.

attracted extensive attentions recently. In most existing literature, the
growth tensor is assumed to be homogeneous or piecewise homogeneous. In this
paper, we aim at clarifying the influence of a growth gradient on pattern
formation and pattern evolution in bilayered tubular tissues under plane-strain
deformation. In the framework of finite elasticity, a bifurcation condition is
derived for a general material model and a generic growth function. Then we
suppose that both layers are composed of neo-Hookean materials. In particular,
the growth function is assumed to decay linearly either from the inner surface
or from the outer surface. It is found that a gradient in the growth has a weak
effect on the critical state, compared to the homogeneous growth type where
both layers share the same growth factor. Furthermore, a finite element model
is built to validate the theoretical model and to investigate the post-buckling
behaviors. It is found that the associated pattern transition is not controlled
by the growth gradient but by the ratio of the shear modulus between two
layers. Different morphologies can occur when the modulus ratio is varied. The
current analysis could provide useful insight into the influence of a growth
gradient on surface instabilities and suggests that a homogeneous growth field
may provide a good approximation on interpreting complicated morphological
formations in multiple systems.

dehazing framework (limited in interpretability) and the convolution layers

information). In this paper, firstly, we propose a new complementary feature
enhanced framework, in which the complementary features are learned by several
complementary subtasks and then together serve to boost the performance of the
primary task. One of the prominent advantages of the new framework is that the
purposively chosen complementary tasks can focus on learning weakly dependent
complementary features, avoiding repetitive and ineffective learning of the
networks. We design a new dehazing network based on such a framework.
Specifically, we select the intrinsic image decomposition as the complementary
tasks, where the reflectance and shading prediction subtasks are used to
extract the color-wise and texture-wise complementary features. To effectively
aggregate these complementary features, we propose a complementary features
selection module (CFSM) to select the more useful features for image dehazing.
Furthermore, we introduce a new version of vision transformer block, named
Hybrid Local-Global Vision Transformer (HyLoG-ViT), and incorporate it within
our dehazing networks. The HyLoG-ViT block consists of the local and the global
vision transformer paths used to capture local and global dependencies. As a
result, the HyLoG-ViT introduces locality in the networks and captures the
global and long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on homogeneous,

consider these delays individually, but none unifies them all in the context of
autonomous driving. Moreover, recent works inappropriately consider computation
time as a constant or a large upper bound, which makes the control either less

minimizing conservativeness. On onehand, our approach can serve as a standalone
controller; on theother hand, our approach provides a safety guard for a

tests: supervised classification tasks to predict the grammatical properties of
a span (whether it has a particular part of speech) using only the token

fine-tune these LM encoders for specific tasks. Here, we ask: if an LM is
fine-tuned, does the encoding of linguistic information in it change, as
measured by EP tests? Specifically, we focus on the task of Question Answering

do not change significantly when the fine-tuned model performs well or in
adversarial situations where the model is forced to learn wrong correlations.
From a similar finding, some recent papers conclude that fine-tuning does not
change linguistic knowledge in encoders but they do not provide an explanation.

an improvement in the EP test results as expected.

out-of-plane polarization such as monolayer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ offers a new
avenue for ultrathin high-density ferroelectric-based nanoelectronics such as
ferroelectric field effect transistors and memristors. The functionality of
ferroelectrics depends critically on the dynamics of polarization switching in
response to an external electric/stress field. Unlike the switching dynamics in
bulk ferroelectrics that have been extensively studied, the mechanisms and
dynamics of polarization switching in 2D remain largely unexplored. Molecular
dynamics (MD) using classical force fields is a reliable and efficient method
for large-scale simulations of dynamical processes with atomic resolution. Here
we developed a deep neural network-based force field of monolayer In$_2$Se$_3$
using a concurrent learning procedure that efficiently updates the
first-principles-based training database. The model potential has accuracy
comparable with density functional theory (DFT), capable of predicting a range
of thermodynamic properties of In$_2$Se$_3$ polymorphs and lattice dynamics of
ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$. Pertinent to the switching dynamics, the model
potential also reproduces the DFT kinetic pathways of polarization reversal and
180$^\circ$ domain wall motions. Moreover, isobaric-isothermal ensemble MD
simulations predict a temperature-driven $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ phase
transition at the single-layer limit, as revealed by both local atomic
displacement and Steinhardt's bond orientational order parameter $Q_4$. Our
work paves the way for further research on the dynamics of ferroelectric
$\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ and related systems.

object detection. In previous transformer-based detectors, the object queries
are a set of learned embeddings. However, each learned embedding does not have
an explicit physical meaning and we cannot explain where it will focus on. It
is difficult to optimize as the prediction slot of each object query does not
have a specific mode. In other words, each object query will not focus on a
specific region. To solved these problems, in our query design, object queries
are based on anchor points, which are widely used in CNN-based detectors. So
each object query focuses on the objects near the anchor point. Moreover, our
query design can predict multiple objects at one position to solve the
difficulty: ""one region, multiple objects"". In addition, we design an attention
variant, which can reduce the memory cost while achieving similar or better
performance than the standard attention in DETR. Thanks to the query design and
the attention variant, the proposed detector that we called Anchor DETR, can
achieve better performance and run faster than the DETR with 10$\times$ fewer
training epochs. For example, it achieves 44.2 AP with 19 FPS on the MSCOCO
dataset when using the ResNet50-DC5 feature for training 50 epochs. Extensive
experiments on the MSCOCO benchmark prove the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. Code is available at

(DDT) in a one-dimensional shock tube are numerically investigated using a
skeletal chemistry including 10 species and 10 reactions. Different combustion
modes are investigated through considering various premixed gas equivalence
ratios (0.2 to 2.0) and incident shock wave Mach numbers (1.8 to 3.2). Four
ignition and DDT modes are observed from the studied cases, i.e., no ignition,
deflagration combustion, detonation after reflected shock and deflagration
behind the incident shock. For detonation development behind the reflected
shock, three autoignition hot spots are formed. The first one occurs at the
wall surface after the re-compression of the reflected shock and contact
surface, which further develops to a reaction shock because of the explosion in
the explosion regime. The other two are off the wall, respectively caused by
the reflected shock rarefaction wave interaction and reaction induction in the
compressed mixture. The last hot spot develops to a reaction wave and couples
with the reflected shock after a DDT process, which eventually leads to
detonation combustion. For deflagration development behind the reflected shock,
the wave interactions, wall surface autoignition hot spot as well as its
induction of reaction shock are qualitatively similar to the mode of detonation
after incident shock reflection, before the reflected shock rarefaction wave
collision point. However, only one hot spot is induced after the collision,
which also develops to a reaction wave but cannot catch up with the reflected
shock. For deflagration behind the incident shock, deflagration combustion is
induced by the incident shock compression whereas detonation occurs after the
shock reflection.

oscillators, the collective dynamics of the agents' density is described by a
mean-field model in the form of a nonlocal PDE, where the nonlocality arises
from the synchronization mechanism. In this mean-field setting, we introduce
two space-time dependent control inputs to affect the density of the
oscillators: an angular velocity field that corresponds to a state feedback law
for individual agents, and a control parameter that modulates the strength of
agent interactions over space and time, i.e., a multiplicative control with
respect to the integral nonlocal term. We frame the density tracking problem as
a PDE-constrained optimization problem. The controlled synchronization and
phase-locking are measured with classical polar order metrics. After
establishing the mass conservation property of the mean-field model and bounds
on its nonlocal term, a system of first-order necessary conditions for
optimality is recovered using a Lagrangian method. The optimality system,
comprising a nonlocal PDE for the state dynamics equation, the respective
nonlocal adjoint dynamics, and the Euler equation, is solved iteratively
following a standard Optimize-then-Discretize approach and an efficient
numerical solver based on spectral methods. We demonstrate our approach for

meta-RL algorithm as a baseline to train a policy using transition samples
generated by MPC when the robot detects certain events that can be effectively
handled by MPC, with its explicit use of robot dynamics. The key idea of our
method is to switch between the meta-learned policy and the MPC controller in a
randomized and event-triggered fashion to make up for suboptimal MPC actions
caused by the limited prediction horizon. During meta-testing, the MPC module
is deactivated to significantly reduce computation time in motion control. We
further propose an online adaptation scheme that enables the robot to infer and
adapt to a new task within a single trajectory. The performance of our method
has been demonstrated through simulations using a nonlinear car-like vehicle
model with (i) synthetic movements of obstacles, and (ii) real-world pedestrian

scenarios, we often have side information about the robot's expected motion
(e.g., limits on how much a robot can move in a one-time step) that could be
useful for further specifying the reachability analysis. In this work, we show
that if we can model this side information using a signal temporal logic (STL)
fragment, we can constrain the data-driven reachability analysis and safely
limit the conservatism of the computed reachable sets. Moreover, we provide
formal guarantees that, even after incorporating side information, the computed
reachable sets still properly over-approximate the robot's future states.
Lastly, we empirically validate the practicality of the over-approximation by

failure of critical industrial equipment. In general, different adversarial
perturbations are computed for each instance of the input data. This is,
however, difficult for the attacker to achieve in real time due to higher
computational requirement and lack of uninterrupted access to the input data.
Hence, we present the concept of universal adversarial perturbation, a special
imperceptible noise to fool regression based RUL prediction models. Attackers
can easily utilize universal adversarial perturbations for real-time attack
since continuous access to input data and repetitive computation of adversarial
perturbations are not a prerequisite for the same. We evaluate the effect of
universal adversarial attacks using NASA turbofan engine dataset. We show that
addition of universal adversarial perturbation to any instance of the input

perturbation on time series regression models. We further demonstrate the
effect of varying the strength of perturbations on RUL prediction models and

generalize well to unseen domains. Second, convolutional neural networks
provide fast inference and generalize but either require large amounts of

advantages of both of these approaches by using Hermite spline kernels in order
to continuously interpolate a grid-based state representation that can be

intrinsic properties of spin current and texture because they are realized in

current on a magnetic domain wall in spinful superfluids. An exact wall
solution is obtained in the ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 Bose--Einstein
condensate with easy-axis anisotropy at zero temperature. The
bosonic-quasiparticle mechanics analytically show that the spin current along
the wall becomes unstable if the velocity exceeds the critical spin-current

between transverse magnons and ripplons. Our direct numerical simulation
reveals that this system has a mechanism to generate an eccentric fractional

similar to that of a meron. This mechanism is in contrast to the generation of
conventional skyrmions in easy-axis magnets. The theoretical findings can be

terms of the universality of spontaneous symmetry breaking, unexplored similar

of art, literature and film often show that long-term change in the features of
artistic works happens gradually. These findings suggest that conservative
forces that shape creative domains might be underestimated. To this end, we
provide the first large-scale formal evidence of the persistent association
between poetic meter and semantics in 18-19th European literatures, using
Czech, German and Russian collections with additional data from English poetry
and early modern Dutch songs. Our study traces this association through a
series of clustering experiments using the abstracted semantic features of
150,000 poems. With the aid of topic modeling we infer semantic features for
individual poems. Texts were also lexically simplified across collections to
increase generalizability and decrease the sparseness of word frequency
distributions. Topics alone enable recognition of the meters in each observed
language, as may be seen from highly robust clustering of same-meter samples
(median Adjusted Rand Index between 0.48 and 1). In addition, this study shows
that the strength of the association between form and meaning tends to decrease
over time. This may reflect a shift in aesthetic conventions between the 18th
and 19th centuries as individual innovation was increasingly favored in
literature. Despite this decline, it remains possible to recognize semantics of
the meters from past or future, which suggests the continuity of semantic
traditions while also revealing the historical variability of conditions across
languages. This paper argues that distinct metrical forms, which are often
copied in a language over centuries, also maintain long-term semantic inertia
in poetry. Our findings, thus, highlight the role of the formal features of
cultural items in influencing the pace and shape of cultural evolution.

artificial occlusion to the incomplete elevation maps constructed on a real

relation, have been surveyed in this work within the context of a modified
dynamical model. These scaling relations are derived by employing the virial
theorem and applying equilibrium and stability conditions. The scaling rules
are also obtained by dimensional analysis of an integral relation between
surface density and circular velocity of disk galaxies. To check the validity
of the scaling relations based on observational data, we have defined, based on
the properties of the model, the proper equilibrium size $R_{eq}$ and
equilibrium velocity $V_{eq}$ of systems. By employing these measures of length
and velocity, SPARC data ( Lelli et al. 2016a ) is used to analyze the results.
The viability of the scaling relations is tested and it is shown that, compared
to some other measures of length and velocity, $R_{eq}$ and $V_{eq}$ provide
the closest fits to the theoretical predictions. We have compared our results
with prior works and have concluded that the set of baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation plus mass-size relation ( or mass-velocity ) provides an appropriate
description of the general characteristics of the systems. Lastly, it is shown
that these scaling relations predict a certain evolution of galactic properties
with redshift. This behavior provides a chance to examine the cosmic evolution
of the present modified dynamical model in future works.

(ECoG) measures electric potential directly on the surface of the brain and can
be used to inform treatment planning for epilepsy surgery. Combined with
numerical modeling they can further improve accuracy of epilepsy surgery
planning. Accurate solution of the iEEG or ECoG forward problem, which is a
crucial prerequisite for solving the inverse problem in epilepsy seizure onset
zone localization, requires accurate representation of the patient's brain
geometry and tissue electrical conductivity after implantation of electrodes.
However, implantation of subdural grid electrodes causes the brain to deform,
which invalidates preoperatively acquired image data. Moreover, postoperative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is incompatible with implanted electrodes and
computed tomography (CT) has insufficient range of soft tissue contrast, which
precludes both MRI and CT from being used to obtain the deformed postoperative
geometry. In this paper, we present a biomechanics-based image warping
procedure using preoperative MRI for tissue classification and postoperative CT
for locating implanted electrodes to perform non-rigid registration of the
preoperative image data to the postoperative configuration. We solve the iEEG
forward problem on the predicted postoperative geometry using the finite
element method (FEM) which accounts for patient-specific inhomogeneity and
anisotropy of tissue conductivity. Results for the simulation of a current
source in the brain show large differences in electric potential predicted by
the models based on the original images and the deformed images corresponding
to the brain geometry deformed by placement of invasive electrodes. Computation
of the lead field matrix (useful for solution of the iEEG inverse problem) also
showed significant differences between the different models.

of computer vision and robotics. Most of the recently proposed methods are
based on deep learning, which require very large amounts of data compared to
traditional methods. The performance of the deep learning methods are largely
dependent on the data distribution they were trained on, and it is important to
use data from the robot's actual operating domain during training. Therefore,
it is not possible to rely on pre-built, generic datasets when deploying robots
in real environments, creating a need for efficient data collection and
annotation in the specific operating conditions the robots will operate in. The
challenge is then: how do we reduce the cost of obtaining such datasets to a
point where we can easily deploy our robots in new conditions, environments and
to support new sensors? As an answer to this question, we propose a data
annotation pipeline based on SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and 3D-to-2D geometry.
The pipeline allows creating 3D and 2D bounding boxes, along with per-pixel
annotations of arbitrary objects without needing accurate 3D models of the
objects prior to data collection and annotation. Our results showcase almost
90% Intersection-over-Union (IoU) agreement on both semantic segmentation and
2D bounding box detection across a variety of objects and scenes, while
speeding up the annotation process by several orders of magnitude compared to
traditional manual annotation.

drawing inspiration from adversarial examples used in supervised learning, the

Through training a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples

which degrades the effects of regularization. Noticeably, this issue is getting
more serious when the resource is extremely limited. To address these issues,
we propose the Adversarial Mixing Policy (AMP), organized in a min-max-rand
formulation, to relax the Locally Linear Constraints in Mixup. Specifically,
AMP adds a small adversarial perturbation to the mixing coefficients rather
than the examples. Thus, slight non-linearity is injected in-between the
synthetic examples and synthetic labels. By training on these data, the deep
networks are further regularized, and thus achieve a lower predictive error
rate. Experiments on five text classification benchmarks and five backbone
models have empirically shown that our methods reduce the error rate over Mixup

semimetal-like conductivity. At zero temperature, composite fermion spectral
functions obtained from holography are known to exhibit multiple Fermi
surfaces. Similarly, for the holographic NLSM we observe multiple nodal lines
instead of just one. We show, however, that as the temperature is raised these
nodal lines broaden and disappear into the continuum one by one, so there is a
finite range of temperatures for which there is only a single nodal line
visible in the spectrum. We compute several transport coefficients in the
holographic NLSM as a function of temperature, namely the charge and thermal
conductivities, and the shear viscosities. By adding a new non-linear coupling
to the model we are able to control the low frequency limit of the electrical
conductivity in the direction orthogonal to the plane of the nodal line,
allowing us to better match the conductivity of real NLSMs. The boundary
quantum field theory is anisotropic and therefore has explicitly broken Lorentz
invariance, which leads to a stress tensor that is not symmetric. This has
important consequences for the energy and momentum transport: the thermal
conductivity at vanishing charge density is not simply fixed by a Ward
identity, and there are a much larger number of independent shear viscosities
than in a Lorentz-invariant system.

significantly limit reconstruction quality. Many attempts to address this issue
rely on embedding pupil recovery into the reconstruction algorithm. In this
paper we demonstrate the limitations of a purely algorithmic approach and
evaluate the merits of implementing a simple, dedicated calibration procedure.
In simulations, we find that for a target sample reconstruction error, we can
image without any aberration corrections up to a maximum aberration magnitude
of $\lambda$/40. When we use algorithmic self-calibration, we can increase the
aberration magnitude up to $\lambda$/10, and with our in situ speckle
calibration technique, this working range is extended further to a maximum
aberration magnitude of $\lambda$/3. Hence, one can trade-off complexity for
accuracy by using a separate calibration process, which is particularly useful

different amyloidogenic variants of GSN have been identified over the years,
but only the most common D187N/Y mutants, in G2, have been thoroughly
characterized, and the underlying functional mechanistic link between mutation,
altered protein structure, susceptibility to aberrant furin cleavage and
aggregative potential resolved. Little is known about the recently identified
mutations A551P, E553K and M517R hosted at the interface between G4 and G5,
whose aggregation process likely follows an alternative pathway. We demonstrate
that these three substitutions impair temperature and pressure stability of GSN
but do not increase its susceptibility to furin cleavage, the first event of
the canonical aggregation pathway. The variants are also characterized by a
higher tendency to aggregate in the unproteolysed forms and show a higher
proteotoxicity in a C. elegans-based assay. Structural studies point to a
destabilization of the interface between G4 and G5 due to three different
structural determinants: beta-strand breaking, steric hindrance and/or charge

evidence suggests that the rearrangement of the protein global architecture
triggers a furin-independent aggregation of the protein, supporting the

describes a train of dark signals. When the walk-off between the pump and probe

physical scenarios for multi-view, long-distance and partially occluded
objects. To bridge the gap between digital attacks and physical attacks, we
exploit the full 3D vehicle surface to propose a robust Full-coverage

the nonplanar camouflage texture over the full vehicle surface. To mimic the
real-world environment conditions, we then introduce a transformation function
to transfer the rendered camouflaged vehicle into a photo realistic scenario.
Finally, we design an efficient loss function to optimize the camouflage
texture. Experiments show that the full-coverage camouflage attack can not only
outperform state-of-the-art methods under various test cases but also
generalize to different environments, vehicles, and object detectors. The code

and deep reinforcement learning. These developments, however, have been tied to
specific tasks, and progress in out-of-distribution generalization has been
limited. While it is assumed that these limitations can be overcome by
incorporating suitable inductive biases, the notion of inductive biases itself
is often left vague and does not provide meaningful guidance. In the paper, I
articulate a different learning approach where representations do not emerge
from biases in a neural architecture but are learned over a given target
language with a known semantics. The basic ideas are implicit in mainstream AI
where representations have been encoded in languages ranging from fragments of
first-order logic to probabilistic structural causal models. The challenge is
to learn from data the representations that have traditionally been crafted by
hand. Generalization is then a result of the semantics of the language. The
goals of this paper are to make these ideas explicit, to place them in a
broader context where the design of the target language is crucial, and to
illustrate them in the context of learning to act and plan. For this, after a
general discussion, I consider learning representations of actions, general
policies, and subgoals (""intrinsic rewards""). In these cases, learning is
formulated as a combinatorial problem but nothing prevents the use of deep
learning techniques instead. Indeed, learning representations over languages
with a known semantics provides an account of what is to be learned, while
learning representations with neural nets provides a complementary account of
how representations can be learned. The challenge and the opportunity is to
bring the two together.

preferable space of the robot offline and formulate it as a polyhedron in the
joint space at the acceleration level. Then, the WBC employs the polyhedron as
a soft constraint. As a result, the robot possesses high-speed and
high-acceleration capabilities by satisfying this constraint. The offline
preprocessing relieves the online computation burden and helps the WBC achieve
a 1kHz servo rate. Finally, we validate the performance and robustness of the
proposed method via simulations and experiments on a parallel-legged bipedal

isolated or coupled to tight-binding leads. In both cases, we observe a decay
of charge-density-wave (CDW) states at a sufficiently strong potential
strength. Local basis optimization selects the most important linear
combinations of local oscillator states to span the local phonon space. These
states are referred to as optimal modes. We show that many of these local
optimal modes are needed to capture the dynamics of the decay, that the most
significant optimal mode on the initially occupied sites remains well described
by a coherent-state typical for small polarons, and that those on the initially
empty sites deviate from the coherent-state form. Additionally, we compute the
current through the structure in the metallic regime as a function of voltage.
For small voltages, we reproduce results for the Luttinger parameters. As the
voltage is increased, the effect of larger electron-phonon coupling strengths
becomes prominent. Further, the most significant optimal mode remains almost

ensure the human physical safety in human-robot interaction. The human
psychological state and expectation towards the robot, however, are typically
neglected. Even if the robot behaviour is regarded as biomechanically safe,
humans may still react with rapid involuntary motion (IM) caused by startle or
surprise. Obviously, such sudden, uncontrolled motions can jeopardize safety
and should be prevented by any means. In this paper, we propose the Expectable
Motion Unit (EMU) concept which ensures that a certain probability of IM
occurrence is not exceeded in a typical HRI setting. Based on a model of IM
occurrence that we generate through an experiment with 29 participants, the
mapping between robot velocity, robot-human distance, and the relative
frequency of IM occurrence is established. This mapping is processed towards a
real-time capable robot motion generator, which limits the robot velocity
during task execution if necessary. The EMU is combined with the
well-established Safe Motion Unit in order to integrate both physical and
psychological safety knowledge and data into a holistic safety framework. In a
validation experiment, it was shown that the EMU successfully avoids human IM
in five out of six cases.

graphics, which provides an efficient solution to the copyright protection for
3D meshes. Traditionally, researchers need manually design watermarking
algorithms to achieve sufficient robustness for the actual application
scenarios. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning-based 3D mesh
watermarking framework, which can solve this problem once for all. In detail,
we propose an end-to-end network, consisting of a watermark embedding
sub-network, a watermark extracting sub-network and attack layers. We adopt the
topology-agnostic graph convolutional network (GCN) as the basic convolution
operation for 3D meshes, so our network is not limited by registered meshes
(which share a fixed topology). For the specific application scenario, we can
integrate the corresponding attack layers to guarantee adaptive robustness
against possible attacks. To ensure the visual quality of watermarked 3D
meshes, we design a curvature-based loss function to constrain the local
geometry smoothness of watermarked meshes. Experimental results show that the
proposed method can achieve more universal robustness and faster watermark
embedding than baseline methods while guaranteeing comparable visual quality.

This study focuses on detecting sentiment in poems written in Misurata Arabic

the dataset are Sklearn as well as Mazajak sentiment tool 1. Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
classifiers are used with Sklearn, while the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
is implemented with Mazajak. The results show that the traditional classifiers
score a higher level of accuracy as compared to Mazajak which is built on an

analyze Arabic sub-dialect poetry in order to investigate the aspects that
contribute to sentiments in these multi-line texts; for example, the use of

on edge-computing devices is critically important for the next generation of
optical communication systems. However, this is still a highly challenging
problem, mainly due to the computational complexity of the artificial neural
networks (NNs) required for the efficient equalization of nonlinear optical
channels with large dispersion-induced memory. To implement the NN-based
optical channel equalizer in hardware, a substantial complexity reduction is
needed, while we have to keep an acceptable performance level of the simplified
NN model. In this work, we address the complexity reduction problem by applying
pruning and quantization techniques to an NN-based optical channel equalizer.
We use an exemplary NN architecture, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to
mitigate the impairments for 30GBd 1000km transmission over a standard
single-mode fiber, and demonstrate that it is feasible to reduce the
equalizer's memory by up to 87.12%, and its complexity by up to 78.34%, without
noticeable performance degradation. In addition to this, we accurately define
the computational complexity of a compressed NN-based equalizer in the digital
signal processing (DSP) sense. Further, we examine the impact of using
different CPU and GPU settings on the power consumption and latency for the
compressed equalizer. We also verify the developed technique experimentally, by
implementing the reduced NN equalizer on two standard edge-computing hardware
units: Raspberry Pi 4 and Nvidia Jetson Nano, which are used to process the
data generated via simulating the signal's propagation down the optical-fiber
system.

become one of the important methods of open relation extraction (OpenRE).
However, high-dimensional vectors can encode complex linguistic information
which leads to the problem that the derived clusters cannot explicitly align
with the relational semantic classes. In this work, we propose a
relation-oriented clustering model and use it to identify the novel relations
in the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enable the model to learn to cluster
relational data, our method leverages the readily available labeled data of
pre-defined relations to learn a relation-oriented representation. We minimize
distance between the instance with same relation by gathering the instances
towards their corresponding relation centroids to form a cluster structure, so
that the learned representation is cluster-friendly. To reduce the clustering
bias on predefined classes, we optimize the model by minimizing a joint
objective on both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results show that
our method reduces the error rate by 29.2% and 15.7%, on two datasets
respectively, compared with current SOTA methods.

for autonomous vehicles that can self-evolve and self-adapt with multi-task
knowledge. Firstly, the proposed method can learn a model-free control policy
for path tracking directly from the historical driving experience, where the
property of vehicle dynamics and corresponding control strategy can be learned
simultaneously. Secondly, by utilizing the life-long learning method, the
proposed method can learn the policy with task-incremental knowledge without
encountering catastrophic forgetting. Thus, with continual multi-task knowledge
learned, the policy can iteratively adapt to new tasks and improve its
performance with knowledge from new tasks. Thirdly, a memory evaluation and
updating method is applied to optimize memory structure for life-long learning
which enables the policy to learn toward selected directions. Experiments are
conducted using a high-fidelity vehicle dynamic model in a complex curvy road
to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the

adapt to the new environment, where the performance of the proposed method can

this paper proposes an energy sharing mechanism based on virtual federated
prosumers (VFPs) with budget allocation for joint electricity and carbon market
to incentivize distributed energy resources to participate in the hierarchical
market and reduce carbon emissions. At the transmission level, the regional
transmission operator coordinates transactions between two markets, the
inter-VFP energy sharing market and the wholesale market, intending to minimize
the overall cost of VFPs. The energy sharing market clearing problem is
formulated as a generalized Nash game, for which we develop a first-order
response algorithm to obtain the equilibrium. At the distribution level, the
VFPs play the role of selfless auctioneer that leverage discriminatory weights
and benchmark prices to allocate the electricity-carbon budget among entities
in the VFP to maximize social welfare. The Nash game is exploited to
characterize the budget allocation problem, for which a distributed feedback
allocation algorithm is proposed. The entire hierarchical electricity and
carbon trading is modeled as an equilibrium problem and is solved iteratively.
Case studies based on a practical regional grid verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm and show that the mechanism is effective in improving energy
efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.

Hall conductivity. We find that the critical value of the phase transition
decreases when we increase the momentum relaxation strength up to a special

phase shrinks and finally disappears as the momentum relaxation strength is
increased, which is consistent with the weakly coupled field theory
predictions. We also study the behavior of transverse/longitudinal

Anuj Dawar, Erich Gr\""adel, and Wied Pakusa, published at ICALP 2019 and by
Moritz Lichter, published at LICS 2021. In both papers, the main technical
results rely on the combinatorial and algebraic analysis of the invertible-map
equivalences $\equiv^\text{IM}_{k,Q}$ on certain variants of
Cai-F\""urer-Immerman (CFI) structures. These
$\equiv^\text{IM}_{k,Q}$-equivalences, for a number $k$ and a set of
primes~$Q$, refine the well-known Weisfeiler-Leman equivalences used in
algorithms for graph isomorphism. The intuition is that two graphs
$G\equiv^\text{IM}_{k,Q}H$ cannot be distinguished by iterative refinements of
equivalences on $k$-tuples defined via linear operators on vector spaces over
fields of characteristic $p \in Q$. In the first paper it has been shown, using
considerable algebraic machinery, that for a prime $q \notin Q$, the
$\equiv^\text{IM}_{k,Q}$ equivalences do not distinguish between non-isomorphic
CFI-structures over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$. In the second paper, a similar
but not identical construction for CFI-structures over the rings
$\mathbb{Z}_{2^i}$ has, again by rather involved combinatorial and algebraic
arguments, been shown to be indistinguishable with respect to
$\equiv^\text{IM}_{k,\{2\}}$. Together with earlier work, this second result
separates rank logic from polynomial time. We unify the two approaches and
prove that CFI-structures over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{2^i}$ are
indistinguishable with respect to $\equiv^\text{IM}_{k,\mathbb{P}}$, for the
set $\mathbb{P}$ of all primes. This implies the following two results.
  1. There is no fixed $k$ such that the invertible-map equivalence
$\equiv^\text{IM}_{k,\mathbb{P}}$ coincides with isomorphism on all finite
graphs.
  2. No extension of fixed-point logic by linear-algebraic operators over
fields can capture polynomial time.

tasks. Nevertheless, due to their bulky size and slow inference speed, it is
hard to deploy them on edge devices. In this paper, we have a critical insight
that improving the feed-forward network (FFN) in BERT has a higher gain than
improving the multi-head attention (MHA) since the computational cost of FFN is
2$\sim$3 times larger than MHA. Hence, to compact BERT, we are devoted to
designing efficient FFN as opposed to previous works that pay attention to MHA.
Since FFN comprises a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that is essential in BERT
optimization, we further design a thorough search space towards an advanced MLP
and perform a coarse-to-fine mechanism to search for an efficient BERT
architecture. Moreover, to accelerate searching and enhance model
transferability, we employ a novel warm-up knowledge distillation strategy at
each search stage. Extensive experiments show our searched EfficientBERT is
6.9$\times$ smaller and 4.4$\times$ faster than BERT$\rm_{BASE}$, and has
competitive performances on GLUE and SQuAD Benchmarks. Concretely,
EfficientBERT attains a 77.7 average score on GLUE \emph{test}, 0.7 higher than
MobileBERT$\rm_{TINY}$, and achieves an 85.3/74.5 F1 score on SQuAD v1.1/v2.0

approaches in modeling the deck of a suspension bridge: in the first approach
we look at the deck as a rectangular plate and in the second one we look at the
deck as a beam for vertical deflections and as a rod for torsional
deformations. Throughout this paper we will refer to the model corresponding to
the second approach as the \textit{beam-rod model}. In our discussion, we
observe that the beam-rod model has more \textit{degrees of freedom} if
compared with the isotropic plate model. For this reason the beam-rod model is
supposed to be more appropiate to describe the behavior of the deck of a real
suspension bridge. A possible strategy to make the plate model more efficient
could be to relax the isotropy condition with a more general condition of
orthotropy, which is expected to increase the degrees of freedom in view of the
larger number of elastic parameters. In this new setting, a comparison between
the two approaches becomes now possible.
  Basic results are proved for the suggested problem, from existence and
uniqueness of solutions to spectral properties. We suggest realistic values for
the elastic parameters thus obtaining with both approaches similar responses in
the static and dynamic behavior of the deck. This can be considered as a
preliminary article since many work has still to be done with the perspective
of formulating models for a complete suspension bridge which take into account
not only the deck but also the action on it of cables and hangers. With this
perspective, a section is devoted to possible future developments.

at the top LHC energy for collisions of identical nuclei. We study the
longitudinal asymmetry and its effect on charged particle rapidity distribution

calculation. The rapidity shift is found to be more pronounced for peripheral
collisions, smaller systems and also for lower beam energies due to
longitudinal asymmetry. A detailed study has been done by associating the
average rapidity shift to a polynomial relation where the coefficients of this

The tuning strategy originates from the modulation of resonant conditions by
changes in the refractive index of GST. With a thorough examination of tuning
performances for different nanoantenna radii, a maximum modulation depth as

intelligence to probe the propagation of cosmic $\gamma$-ray photons in the
extragalactic Universe. The journey of $\gamma$-rays emitted from a distant
source like blazar to the observer at the Earth is impeded by the absorption
through the interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL), leading
to an electron-positron pair production. This process dominates for gamma ray
photons with energy above 10 GeV propagating over the cosmological distances.
The effect of $\gamma$-ray attenuation is characterized by a physical quantity
called \emph{optical depth}, which strongly depends on the $\gamma$-ray photon
energy, redshift of the source, and density of the EBL photons. We estimate the
optical depth values for $\gamma$-ray energies above 10 GeV emitted from the
sources at redshifts in the range 0.01 to 1 using three different and most
promising EBL models. These optical depth estimates are randomly divided into
two data sets for training and testing of the ANN using energy, redshift as
inputs and optical depth as output. The optimization of ANN-performance for
each EBL model employs standard back-propagation (BP) and radial-basis function
(RBF) algorithms. The performance of the ANN model using the RBF is found to be
superior to the BP method. In particular, the RBF-ANN with 40 neurons in the
hidden layer corresponding to the EBL model proposed by Finke et al. (2010)
shows the best performance for the propagation of $\gamma$-rays in the

propose to segment egocentric images directly in terms of how a robot can

affordance consisting of 3 driveability levels which can broadly apply to both

we incorporate inter-class distances during learning which improves
segmentation compared to standard ""hard"" one-hot labelling. In addition, we
propose a navigation-oriented pixel-wise loss weighting method which assigns
higher importance to safety-critical areas. We evaluate our approach on
large-scale public image segmentation datasets ranging from sunny city streets

that our affordance learning scheme can be applied across a diverse mix of

large scale of unusual physical properties starting from an insulator via a

These properties result from the dramatic change of the QW band structure with
the HgTe film thickness. Although being a key property, these energy dispersion
relations cannot be reflected in experiments due to the lack of appropriate
tools. Here we report an experimental and theoretical study of two HgTe quantum
wells with inverted energy spectrum in which two-dimensional semimetallic
states are realized. Using magneto-optical spectroscopy at sub-THz frequencies
we were able to obtain information about electron and hole cyclotron masses at
all relevant Fermi level positions and different charge densities. The outcome
is also supported by a Shubnikov-de Haas analysis of capacitance measurements,
which allows obtaining information about the degeneracy of the active modes.
From these data, it is possible to reconstruct electron and hole dispersion
relations. Detailed comparative analysis of the energy dispersion relations
with theoretical calculations demonstrates a good agreement, reflecting even
several subtle features like band splitting, the second conduction band, and
the overlaps between the first conduction and first valence band. Our study
demonstrates that the cyclotron resonance experiments can be efficiently used

heterogeneous molecular learning to address these challenges. Federated
learning allows end-users to build a global model collaboratively while keeping

improving the performance for uncertain samples. Comprehensive experiments

partial observation of the true states of the world is critical for

source of uncertainty or puts the focus on obtaining optimal policies using
complex models of the world that would impose an unrealistically high cognitive
demand on real agents. In this work we aim to efficiently describe the emergent
behavior of biologically plausible and parsimonious learning agents faced with
partially observable worlds. Therefore we derive and present deterministic
reinforcement learning dynamics where the agents observe the true state of the
environment only partially. We showcase the broad applicability of our dynamics
across different classes of partially observable agent-environment systems. We
find that partial observability creates unintuitive benefits in a number of
specific contexts, pointing the way to further research on a general
understanding of such effects. For instance, partially observant agents can
learn better outcomes faster, in a more stable way and even overcome social
dilemmas. Furthermore, our method allows the application of dynamical systems
theory to partially observable multiagent leaning. In this regard we find the
emergence of catastrophic limit cycles, a critical slowing down of the learning
processes between reward regimes and the separation of the learning dynamics
into fast and slow directions, all caused by partial observability. Therefore,
the presented dynamics have the potential to become a formal, yet practical,
lightweight and robust tool for researchers in biology, social science and

follow during the conversation. Our task exposes novel technical challenges for
neural TOD, such as grounding an utterance to the flowchart without explicit
annotation, referring to additional manual pages when user asks a clarification
question, and ability to follow unseen flowcharts at test time. We release a
dataset (FloDial) consisting of 2,738 dialogs grounded on 12 different

thus guarantee privacy properties before transmitting it to the server (a.k.a.
the aggregator). One primary objective of LDP is frequency (or histogram)
estimation, in which the aggregator estimates the number of users for each
possible value. In practice, when a study with rich content on a population is
desired, the interest is in the multiple attributes of the population, that is
to say, in multidimensional data ($d \geq 2$). However, contrary to the problem
of frequency estimation of a single attribute (the majority of the works), the
multidimensional aspect imposes to pay particular attention to the privacy
budget. This one can indeed grow extremely quickly due to the composition
theorem. To the authors' knowledge, two solutions seem to stand out for this
task: 1) splitting the privacy budget for each attribute, i.e., send each value
with $\frac{\epsilon}{d}$-LDP (Spl), and 2) random sampling a single attribute
and spend all the privacy budget to send it with $\epsilon$-LDP (Smp). Although
Smp adds additional sampling error, it has proven to provide higher data
utility than the former Spl solution. However, we argue that aggregators (who
are also seen as attackers) are aware of the sampled attribute and its LDP
value, which is protected by a ""less strict"" $e^{\epsilon}$ probability bound
(rather than $e^{\epsilon/d}$). This way, we propose a solution named Random
Sampling plus Fake Data (RS+FD), which allows creating uncertainty over the
sampled attribute by generating fake data for each non-sampled attribute; RS+FD
further benefits from amplification by sampling. We theoretically and
experimentally validate our proposed solution on both synthetic and real-world
datasets to show that RS+FD achieves nearly the same or better utility than the
state-of-the-art Smp solution.

simultaneously attend to multiple facial areas and build attention maps on

within the density functional theory. We calculate the spin accumulation
including multiple contributions, especially skew-scattering (scattering-in

isotropic and anisotropic relaxation time approximation. For heavy metals, with
strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, we find that almost all the effects are
captured within the anisotropic relaxation time approximation. On the other
hand, in light metals the contributions from the vertex corrections
(scattering-in term) are comparable to the induced effect in anisotropic
relaxation time approximation. We put a particular focus on the influence of
the atomic character of the substitutional impurities on the spin accumulation
as well as the dependence on the impurity position. As impurities will break
space inversion symmetry of the thin film, this will give rise to both
symmetric and antisymmetric contributions to the spin accumulation. In general,
we find the impurities at the surface generate the largest efficiency of
charge-to-spin conversion in case of the spin accumulation. Comparing our
results to existing experimental findings for Pt we find a good agreement.

for NN input. Low-resolution target diffusion data are derived based on
diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar-imaging (SE-EPI) scans, i.e., mean,
axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, RD), fractional anisotropy (FA) as well
as the spherical coordinates (azimuth ${\Phi}$ and inclination ${\Theta}$) of
the principal diffusion eigenvector. A feedforward NN is trained with
incorporated probabilistic uncertainty estimation.
  The NN predictions yielded highly reliable results in white matter (WM) and
gray matter (GM) structures for MD. The quantification of FA, AD, and RD was
overall in good agreement with the reference but the dependence of these
parameters on WM anisotropy was somewhat biased, e.g., in corpus callosum. The
inclination ${\Theta}$ was well predicted for anisotropic WM structures while
the azimuth ${\Phi}$ was overall poorly predicted. The findings were highly
consistent across both field strengths. Application of the optimized NN to
high-resolution input data provided whole-brain maps with rich structural
details. In conclusion, the proposed NN-driven approach showed potential to
provide distortion-free high-resolution whole-brain maps of multiple diffusion
metrics at high to ultra-high field strengths in clinically relevant scan

applying regularization methods (e.g. dropout, L2-regularization) or by

architectures are known to struggle when generating very long sequences. For
example, in machine translation, the neural-based systems perform worse on very

  We present results which suggest that the issue might also be in the mismatch
between the length distributions of the training and validation data combined
with the aforementioned tendency of the neural networks to overfit to the
training data. We demonstrate on a simple string editing task and a machine
translation task that the Transformer model performance drops significantly
when facing sequences of length diverging from the length distribution in the

due to the hypothesis length corresponding to the lengths seen by the model

aperiodic trend, using the method of variable projection. It is a major
extension to the IEEE-standard 1057 by permitting the background to be time
varying; additionally, any number of harmonics of the periodic portion can be
modelled. This paper focuses on using B-Splines to implement a piecewise
polynomial model for the aperiodic portion of the signal. A thorough algebraic
derivation of the method is presented, as well as a comparison to using global
polynomial approximation. It is proven that B-Splines work better for modelling
a more complicated aperiodic portion when compared to higher order polynomials.
Furthermore, the piecewise polynomial model is capable of modelling the local
signal variations produced by the interaction of a control system with a
process in industrial applications. The method of variable projection reduces
the problem to a one-dimensional nonlinear optimization, combined with a linear
least-squares computation. An added benefit of using the method of variable
projection is the possibility to calculate the covariances of the linear
coefficients of the model, enabling the calculation of confidence and
prediction intervals. The method is tested on both real measurement data
acquired in industrial processes, as well as synthetic data. The method shows
promising results for the precise characterization of periodic signals embedded

the $\it{\Xi}_{c}^{+} \pi^{-} \pi^{+}$ invariant-mass spectrum, where the
$\it{\Xi}_{c}^{+}$ baryon is reconstructed in the $p K^{-} \pi^{+}$ final
state. The study uses proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCb
detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13$\mathrm{\,Te\kern -0.1em V}$,
corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 5.4$\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. No
significant signal is observed in the invariant-mass range of
3.4$-$3.8$\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V}/c^2$. Upper limits are set on the ratio
of branching fractions multiplied by the production cross-section with respect
to the $\it{\Xi}_{cc}^{++} \rightarrow (\it{\Xi}_{c}^{+} \rightarrow p K^{-}

hypotheses in the rapidity range from 2.0 to 4.5 and the transverse momentum
range from 2.5 to 25$\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V}/c$. The results from this
search are combined with a previously published search for the

yielding a maximum local significance of 4.0 standard deviations around the
mass of 3620$\mathrm{\,Me\kern -0.1em V}/c^2$, including systematic
uncertainties. Taking into account the look-elsewhere effect in the
3.5$-$3.7$\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V}/c^2$ mass window, the combined global
significance is 2.9 standard deviations including systematic uncertainties.

  https://github.com/xnliang98/uke_ccrank",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Embedding based methods are widely used for unsupervised keyphrase extraction
(UKE) tasks. Generally, these methods simply calculate similarities between
phrase embeddings and document embedding, which is insufficient to capture
different context for a more effective UKE model. In this paper, we propose a
novel method for UKE, where local and global contexts are jointly modeled. From
a global view, we calculate the similarity between a certain phrase and the
whole document in the vector space as transitional embedding based models do.
In terms of the local view, we first build a graph structure based on the
document where phrases are regarded as vertices and the edges are similarities
between vertices. Then, we proposed a new centrality computation method to
capture local salient information based on the graph structure. Finally, we
further combine the modeling of global and local context for ranking. We
evaluate our models on three public benchmarks (Inspec, DUC 2001, SemEval 2010)
and compare with existing state-of-the-art models. The results show that our
model outperforms most models while generalizing better on input documents with
different domains and length. Additional ablation study shows that both the
local and global information is crucial for unsupervised keyphrase extraction
tasks.

microseconds, and beatings in this emission involve only directly excited
energy sublevels. In contrast, the superfluorescent emissions burst on a
much-reduced timescale and their beatings involve both directly and indirectly
excited energy sublevels. In this work, picosecond and femtosecond
superfluorescent beatings are observed from a dense cesium atomic vapor. Cesium
atoms are excited by 60-femtosecond long, 800 nm laser pulses via two-photon
processes into their coherent superpositions of the ground 6S and excited 8S
states. As a part of the transient four wave mixing process, the yoked
superfluorescent blue light at lower transitions of 6S - 7P are recorded and
studied. Delayed buildup time of this blue light is measured as a function of
the input laser beam power using a high-resolution 2 ps streak camera. The
power dependent buildup delay time is consistently doubled as the vapor
temperature is lowered to cut the number of atoms by half. At low power and
density, a beating with a period of 100 picoseconds representing the ground
state splitting is observed. The autocorrelation measurements of the generated
blue light exhibit a beating with a quasi-period of 230 fs corresponding to the
splitting of the 7P level primarily at lower input laser power. Understanding
and, eventually, controlling the intriguing nature of superfluorescent beatings
may permit a rapid quantum operation free from the rather slow spontaneous
emission processes from atoms and molecules.

with different distributions from the expected normal instances. In this paper,
the Generative Adversarial Network based on the Encoder-Decoder-Encoder scheme
(EDE-GAN) achieves state-of-the-art performance. The two factors bellow serve
the above purpose: 1) The EDE-GAN calculates the distance between two latent
vectors as the anomaly score, which is unlike the previous methods by utilizing
the reconstruction error between images. 2) The model obtains best results when
the batch size is set to 1. To illustrate their superiority, we design a new
GAN architecture, and compare performances according to different batch sizes.
Moreover, with experimentation leads to discovery, our result implies there is
also evidence of just how beneficial constraint on the latent space are when
engaging in model training. In an attempt to learn compact and fast models, we
present a new technology, Progressive Knowledge Distillation with GANs
(P-KDGAN), which connects two standard GANs through the designed distillation
loss. Two-step progressive learning continuously augments the performance of
student GANs with improved results over single-step approach. Our experimental
results on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMNIST datasets illustrate that P-KDGAN
improves the performance of the student GAN by 2.44%, 1.77%, and 1.73% when
compressing the computationat ratios of 24.45:1, 311.11:1, and 700:1,

unprecedented fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium lead

high vacuum followed by CH3NH3I deposition at normal angle. Our approach offers
a direct route for the fabrication of perovskite nanostructures virtually on
any substrate, including on photovoltaic devices. The unparalleled alignment
degree of the perovskite nanowalls provides the samples with strong anisotropic
optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence, the latter
with a maximum polarization ratio of P=0.43. Furthermore, the implementation of
the MAPI nanowalls in photovoltaic devices provides them with a
polarization-sensitive response, with a maximum photocurrent difference of 2.1
% when illuminating with the near-infrared range of the solar spectrum (>700

wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented around the
world to curb transmission. However, the economic and social costs of some of
these measures, especially lockdowns, has been high. An alternative and widely
discussed public health strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic would have been to
'shield' those most vulnerable to COVID-19 (minimising their contacts with
others), while allowing infection to spread among lower risk individuals with
the aim of reaching herd immunity. Here we retrospectively explore the
effectiveness of this strategy using a stochastic SEIR framework, showing that
even under the unrealistic assumption of perfect shielding, hospitals would
have been rapidly overwhelmed with many avoidable deaths among lower risk
individuals. Crucially, even a small (20%) reduction in the effectiveness of
shielding would have likely led to a large increase (>150%) in the number of
deaths compared to perfect shielding. Our findings demonstrate that shielding
the vulnerable while allowing infections to spread among the wider population
would not have been a viable public health strategy for COVID-19 and is
unlikely to be effective for future pandemics.

square degrees of the sky that will be rich for clustering and weak lensing
statistics. The accuracy of the cosmological constraints derived from these
measurements will depend on the knowledge of the underlying redshift
distributions based on photometric redshift calibrations. A new approach is
proposed to use the stacked spectra from Euclid slitless spectroscopy to
augment broad-band photometric information to constrain the redshift
distribution with spectral energy distribution fitting. The high spectral
resolution available in the stacked spectra complements the photometry and
helps to break the colour-redshift degeneracy and constrain the redshift
distribution of galaxy samples. We modelled the stacked spectra as a linear
mixture of spectral templates. The mixture may be inverted to infer the
underlying redshift distribution using constrained regression algorithms. We
demonstrate the method on simulated Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid mock
survey data sets based on the Euclid Flagship mock galaxy catalogue. We assess
the accuracy of the reconstruction by considering the inference of the baryon
acoustic scale from angular two-point correlation function measurements. We
selected mock photometric galaxy samples at redshift z>1 using the
self-organising map algorithm. Considering the idealised case without dust
attenuation, we find that the redshift distributions of these samples can be
recovered with 0.5% accuracy on the baryon acoustic scale. The estimates are
not significantly degraded by the spectroscopic measurement noise due to the
large sample size. However, the error degrades to 2% when the dust attenuation
model is left free. We find that the colour degeneracies introduced by
attenuation limit the accuracy considering the wavelength coverage of Euclid
near-infrared spectroscopy.

the linearization of the dynamical equations of the robot, the stabilizer
controller which is a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cannot stabilize the

By comparing the ratios of $E2$ transition strengths for mirror transitions, we
find that a wide range of ab initio calculations give robust and consistent
predictions for this ratio. To experimentally test the validity of these ab
initio predictions, we performed a Coulomb excitation experiment to measure the
$B(E2; 3/2^- \rightarrow 1/2^-)$ transition strength in $^7$Be for the first

This result is used with the experimentally known $^7$Li $B(E2; 3/2^-

ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials with a net spin polarization. Here we
show that, counterintuitively, {\it non-magnetic} systems can also have a
non-zero magnetic Compton profile, provided that space-inversion symmetry is
broken. The magnetic Compton profile is antisymmetric in momentum and, if the
inversion symmetry is broken by an electric-field switchable ferroelectric
distortion, can be reversed using an electric field. We show that the
underlying physics of the magnetic Compton profile and its electrical control
are conveniently described in terms of $k$-space magnetoelectric multipoles,
which are reciprocal to the real-space charge dipoles associated with the
broken inversion symmetry. Using the prototypical ferroelectric lead titanate,
PbTiO$_3$, as an example, we show that the ferroelectric polarization
introduces a spin asymmetry in momentum space that corresponds to a pure
$k$-space magnetoelectric toroidal moment. This in turn manifests in an
antisymmetric magnetic Compton profile which can be reversed using an electric
field. Our work suggests an experimental route to directly measuring and tuning
hidden $k$-space magnetoelectric multipoles via their magnetic Compton profile.

  resolution","14 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.NI cs.CR cs.DC stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Decentralized control, low-complexity, flexible and efficient communications
are the requirements of an architecture that aims to scale blockchains beyond
the current state. Such properties are attainable by reducing ledger size and
providing parallel operations in the blockchain. Sharding is one of the
approaches that lower the burden of the nodes and enhance performance. However,
the current solutions lack the features for resolving concurrency during
cross-shard communications. With multiple participants belonging to different
shards, handling concurrent operations is essential for optimal sharding. This
issue becomes prominent due to the lack of architectural support and requires
additional consensus for cross-shard communications. Inspired by hybrid
Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS), like Ethereum, hybrid consensus and
2-hop blockchain, we propose Reinshard, a new blockchain that inherits the
properties of hybrid consensus for optimal sharding. Reinshard uses PoW and PoS
chain-pairs with PoS sub-chains for all the valid chain-pairs where the hybrid
consensus is attained through Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). Our architecture
provides a secure method of arranging nodes in shards and resolves concurrency
conflicts using the delay factor of VDF. The applicability of Reinshard is
demonstrated through security and experimental evaluations. A practical
concurrency problem is considered to show the efficacy of Reinshard in
providing optimal sharding.

investigated in the fields of databases, AI, Semantic Web and data mining for
many years, the main challenge remains the ability to generate quality matches
among data concepts (e.g., database attributes). In this work, we examine a
novel angle on the behavior of humans as matchers, studying match creation as a
process. We analyze the dynamics of common evaluation measures (precision,
recall, and f-measure), with respect to this angle and highlight the need for
unbiased matching to support this analysis. Unbiased matching, a newly defined
concept that describes the common assumption that human decisions represent
reliable assessments of schemata correspondences, is, however, not an inherent
property of human matchers. In what follows, we design PoWareMatch that makes
use of a deep learning mechanism to calibrate and filter human matching
decisions adhering the quality of a match, which are then combined with
algorithmic matching to generate better match results. We provide an empirical
evidence, established based on an experiment with more than 200 human matchers
over common benchmarks, that PoWareMatch predicts well the benefit of extending
the match with an additional correspondence and generates high quality matches.
In addition, PoWareMatch outperforms state-of-the-art matching algorithms.

of this research work. They were manually labelled into five classes and
curated with a subject matter expert assistance. The images were later cropped

paper presents experimental results classifying five fungi types using two
different deep learning approaches and three different convolutional neural

benchmarks the classification performance for the models trained from scratch,
while the second approach benchmarks the classification performance using
pre-trained models based on the ImageNet dataset. Using k-fold cross-validation
testing on the 5-class dataset, the best performing model trained from scratch
was Inception V3, reporting 73.2% accuracy. Also, the best performing model
using transfer learning was VGG16 reporting 85.04%. The statistics provided by
the two approaches create an initial point of reference to encourage future

set up a spatial transform module after PointManifoldCut operation to align the
new instances in the embedded space. The effects of different hidden layers and
methods of replacing points are also discussed in this paper. The experiments
show that our proposed approach can enhance the performance of point cloud
classification as well as segmentation networks, and brings them additional

We combine accurate light curve parameters from TESS with parallax and color
information from the Gaia mission to create a comprehensive classification
scheme. We build a clean sample, preserving RR Lyrae stars with unusual light
curve shapes, while separating other types of pulsating stars. We find that a
large fraction of RR Lyrae stars exhibit various low-amplitude modes, but the
distribution of those modes is markedly different from those of the bulge
stars. This suggests that differences in physical parameters have an observable
effect on the excitation of extra modes, potentially offering a way to uncover
the origins of these signals. However, mode identification is hindered by
uncertainties when identifying the true pulsation frequencies of the extra
modes. We compare mode amplitude ratios in classical double-mode stars to stars
with extra modes at low amplitudes and find that they separate into two
distinct groups. Finally, we find a high percentage of modulated stars among
the fundamental-mode pulsators, but also find that at least 28% of them do not
exhibit modulation, confirming that a significant fraction of stars lack the

expansion rate at later times may relax the Hubble tension (we obtain
$H_0=(71.4\pm 0.5)$ km/s/Mpc), while the processes $ \nu\bar \nu

the model consistent with large scale structure observations. Its lifetime and
the fact that it decays into neutrinos instead of photons lets this axion-like
majoron avoid the strong bounds that affect other axion-like particles of

sequential interactions with customers. At each time period, a customer who is
interested in purchasing a product comes to the platform. The customer's
valuation for the product is a linear function of contexts, including product
and customer features, plus some random market noise. The seller does not
observe the customer's true valuation, but instead needs to learn the valuation
by leveraging contextual information and historical binary purchase feedbacks.
Existing models typically assume full or partial knowledge of the random noise
distribution. In this paper, we consider contextual dynamic pricing with
unknown random noise in the valuation model. Our distribution-free pricing
policy learns both the contextual function and the market noise simultaneously.
A key ingredient of our method is a novel perturbed linear bandit framework,
where a modified linear upper confidence bound algorithm is proposed to balance
the exploration of market noise and the exploitation of the current knowledge
for better pricing. We establish the regret upper bound and a matching lower
bound of our policy in the perturbed linear bandit framework and prove a
sub-linear regret bound in the considered pricing problem. Finally, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our policy on simulations and a

portion of this noise, particularly in land datasets, presents itself as random
noise. In recent years, neural networks have been successfully used to denoise
seismic data in a supervised fashion. However, supervised learning always comes
with the often unachievable requirement of having noisy-clean data pairs for
training. Using blind-spot networks, we redefine the denoising task as a
self-supervised procedure where the network uses the surrounding noisy samples
to estimate the noise-free value of a central sample. Based on the assumption
that noise is statistically independent between samples, the network struggles
to predict the noise component of the sample due to its randomnicity, whilst
the signal component is accurately predicted due to its spatio-temporal
coherency. Illustrated on synthetic examples, the blind-spot network is shown
to be an efficient denoiser of seismic data contaminated by random noise with
minimal damage to the signal; therefore, providing improvements in both the
image domain and down-the-line tasks, such as inversion. To conclude the study,
the suggested approach is applied to field data and the results are compared
with two commonly used random denoising techniques: FX-deconvolution and
Curvelet transform. By demonstrating that blind-spot networks are an efficient
suppressor of random noise, we believe this is just the beginning of utilising
self-supervised learning in seismic applications.

Shear-wave speed as a surrogate of stiffness was quantified between 5 Hz and
3000 Hz frequency-range by shear rheometry, ultrasound-based time-harmonic
elastography, clinical MR elastography (MRE), and tabletop MRE. Imaging
parameters for ultrasound were close to those of liver in vivo.
Reproducibility, aging behavior and temperature dependency were assessed and
fulfilled requirements for quantitative elastography. In addition, the phantom
was used to characterize the frequency bandwidth of shear-wave speed of several
clinical elastography methods. The liquid-liver phantom has favorable
properties for standardization and development of liver elastography: first, it
can be used across clinical and experimental elastography devices in ultrasound

$R_{\text{in}}$=$R_{\text{ISCO}}$, we find the spin of AT2019wey to be
$a_{*}\sim$ $0.97$, which is close to the extreme and an inner disk inclination
angle of ~$i\sim$ $22 ^{\circ}$. Additionally, according to our adopted models,
AT2019wey tends to have a relatively high iron abundance of
$A_{\mathrm{Fe}}\sim$ 5 $A_{\mathrm{Fe}, \odot}$ and a high disk ionization
state of $\log \xi\sim$ 3.4.

Slater-determinant wavefunction, which is termed ""determinantal point process""
in statistical analysis. For its inherently-embedded Pauli exclusion principle,
its application reaches beyond simulating fermionic quantum many-body physics
to constructing machine learning models for diversified datasets. Here we
propose a fermion sampling algorithm, which has a polynomial time-complexity --
quadratic in the fermion number and linear in the system size. This algorithm
is about 100% more efficient in computation time than the best known
algorithms. In sampling the corresponding marginal distribution, our algorithm
has a more drastic improvement, achieving a scaling advantage. We demonstrate
its power on several test applications, including sampling fermions in a
many-body system and a machine learning task of text summarization, and confirm
its improved computation efficiency over other methods by counting
floating-point operations.

equations for centuries. Neural Ordinary Differen-tial Equations (NODEs) are a
new machine learning architecture which allows these differential equations to
be learned from a dataset. These have been applied to classical dynamics
simulations in the form of Lagrangian Neural Net-works (LNNs) and Second Order
Neural Differential Equations (SONODEs). However, they either cannot represent
the most general equations of motion or lack interpretability. In this paper,
we propose Modular Neural ODEs, where each force component is learned with
separate modules. We show how physical priors can be easily incorporated into
these models. Through a number of experiments, we demonstrate these result in
better performance, are more interpretable, and add flexibility due to their
modularity.

the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=8$ and 13 TeV,
corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.0 and 5.4 fb$^{-1}$,
respectively. The two mesons are reconstructed in the $J/\psi\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$
final state. The ratios of the prompt and nonprompt $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ to
$\psi(2S)$ production cross-sections are measured as a function of transverse
momentum, $p_{\rm T}$, and rapidity, $y$, in the kinematic range $4 < p_{\rm T}
< 20$ GeV/$c$ and $2.0 < y < 4.5$. The prompt ratio is found to increase with
$p_{\rm T}$ independently of $y$. The double-differential cross-section ratio
of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ relative to $\psi(2S)$ mesons between 13 and 8 TeV is also
measured for the prompt component and observed to be consistent with unity,

  fluids",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel computational modeling framework to numerically
investigate fluid-structure interaction in viscous fluids using the phase field
embedding method. Each rigid body or elastic structure immersed in the
incompressible viscous fluid matrix, grossly referred to as the particle in
this paper, is identified by a volume preserving phase field. The motion of the
particle is driven by the fluid velocity in the matrix for passive particles or
combined with its self-propelling velocity for active particles. The excluded
volume effect between a pair of particles or between a particle and the
boundary is modeled by a repulsive potential force. The drag exerted to the
fluid by a particle is assumed proportional to its velocity. When the particle
is rigid, its state is described by a zero velocity gradient tensor within the
nonzero phase field that defines its profile and a constraining stress exists
therein. While the particle is elastic, a linear constitutive equation for the
elastic stress is provided within the particle domain. A hybrid,
thermodynamically consistent hydrodynamic model valid in the entire
computational domain is then derived for the fluid-particle ensemble using the
generalized Onsager principle accounting for both rigid and elastic particles.
Structure-preserving numerical algorithms are subsequently developed for the
thermodynamically consistent model. Numerical tests in 2D and 3D space are
carried out to verify the rate of convergence and numerical examples are given
to demonstrate the usefulness of the computational framework for simulating
fluid-structure interactions for passive as well as self-propelling active
particles in a viscous fluid matrix.

array detectors with an MPPC array and evaluated the spectral performance by
reading out the signals from the MPPC with a low-power integrated circuit
(ASIC) manufactured by IDEAS in Norway. One of the two types of scintillators
is a GAGG(Ce) (Ce-doped $ \rm{Gd_3Al_2Ga_3O_{12}}$) scintillator, and the other
is an LFS scintillator. The scintillator array is 2.5 cm $\times$ 2.5 cm in
size and is coated with $ \rm{BaSO_4}$-based white paint for GAGG(Ce) and an
enhanced specular reflector (ESR) for LFS except for the side optically coupled
to the MPPC. The spectra derived from the array are affected by the MPPC photon
saturations and light leakage from the adjacent pixels, and we carefully
corrected for both effects in our data analysis. The energy resolution of 662
keV at 20 $^\circ$C is 6.10$\pm$0.04\% for the GAGG(Ce) scintillator array and
8.57$\pm$0.15\% for the LFS scintillator array, this is equivalent to the
typical energy resolution found in the references. The energy resolution
depends on the temperature: the energy resolution improves as the temperature
decreases. We found that the contribution of thermal noise from the MPPCs to
the energy resolution is negligible within the range of --20 to 40 $^\circ$C,
and the energy resolution is mainly determined by the light yield of the
crystals.

incrementally via restart-incrementality by repeatedly feeding, to an unchanged

this approach is computationally costly and does not scale efficiently for long
sequences. In parallel, we witness efforts to make Transformers more efficient,
e.g. the Linear Transformer (LT) with a recurrence mechanism. In this work, we
examine the feasibility of LT for incremental NLU in English. Our results show
that the recurrent LT model has better incremental performance and faster
inference speed compared to the standard Transformer and LT with
restart-incrementality, at the cost of part of the non-incremental (full
sequence) quality. We show that the performance drop can be mitigated by
training the model to wait for right context before committing to an output and
that training with input prefixes is beneficial for delivering correct partial
outputs.

models beyond the WIMP paradigm have proliferated in order to elude ever
improving observational constraints, among them that of sub-GeV dark matter
mediated by a massive vector portal (a dark photon) associated with a new dark
$U(1)$ gauge symmetry. It has been previously noted that for a significant
range of the parameter space of this class of models, the annihilation of dark
matter particles into a pair of dark photons can dominate the freeze-out
process even when this process is kinematically forbidden for dark matter at
rest -- this is known as the ""forbidden dark matter"" (FDM) regime. Prior
studies of this regime, however, assume that any ""dark Higgs"" associated with
breaking the dark $U(1)$ and imparting mass to the dark photon is decoupled
from the dark matter and as such plays no role in the freeze-out process. In
this paper, we explore the effects of a dark Higgs on sub-GeV dark matter
phenomenology in this FDM regime by considering the simplest possible
construction in which there exist non-trivial dark matter-dark Higgs couplings:
a model with a single complex scalar DM candidate coupled directly to the dark
Higgs field. We find that for a wide range of parameter space, the dark Higgs
can alter the resulting relic abundance by many orders of magnitude, and that
this effect can remain significant even for a small dark matter-dark Higgs
coupling constant. Considering measurements from direct detection and
measurements of the CMB, we further find that points in this model's parameter
space which recreate the appropriate dark matter relic abundance suffer only
mild constraints from other sources at present, but may become accessible in
near-future direct detection experiments.

input face at any age. Facial age translation has received considerable
research attention in the last decade due to its practical value in cross-age
face recognition and various entertainment applications. However, most existing
methods model age changes between holistic images, regardless of the human face
structure and the age-changing patterns of individual facial components.
Consequently, the lack of semantic supervision will cause infidelity of
generated faces in detail. To this end, we propose a unified framework for
biphasic facial age translation with noisy-semantic guided generative
adversarial networks. Structurally, we project the class-aware noisy semantic
layouts to soft latent maps for the following injection operation on the
individual facial parts. In particular, we introduce two sub-networks,
ProjectionNet and ConstraintNet. ProjectionNet introduces the low-level
structural semantic information with noise map and produces soft latent maps.
ConstraintNet disentangles the high-level spatial features to constrain the
soft latent maps, which endows more age-related context into the soft latent
maps. Specifically, attention mechanism is employed in ConstraintNet for
feature disentanglement. Meanwhile, in order to mine the strongest mapping
ability of the network, we embed two types of learning strategies in the
training procedure, supervised self-driven generation and unsupervised
condition-driven cycle-consistent generation. As a result, extensive
experiments conducted on MORPH and CACD datasets demonstrate the prominent
ability of our proposed method which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

students learn by running either offline RL or by using teacher data in

individual and collective mobility patterns. On one hand, a highly influential
stream of literature on human mobility driven by analyses of massive empirical
datasets finds that human movements show no evidence of characteristic spatial
scales. There, human mobility is described as scale-free. On the other hand, in
geography, the concept of scale, referring to meaningful levels of description
from individual buildings through neighborhoods, cities, regions, and
countries, is central for the description of various aspects of human behavior
such as socio-economic interactions, or political and cultural dynamics. Here,
we resolve this apparent paradox by showing that day-to-day human mobility does
indeed contain meaningful scales, corresponding to spatial containers
restricting mobility behavior. The scale-free results arise from aggregating
displacements across containers. We present a simple model, which given a
person's trajectory, infers their neighborhoods, cities, and so on, as well as
the sizes of these geographical containers. We find that the containers
characterizing the trajectories of more than 700,000 individuals do indeed have
typical sizes. We show that our model generates highly realistic trajectories
without overfitting and provides a new lens through which to understand the
differences in mobility behaviour across countries, gender groups, and
urban-rural areas.

the multivariate Gaussian likelihood, when the mean is known -- while the
normal-Wishart can be used when the mean is also unknown. It is however not so
obvious how to assign values to the hyperparameters of these distributions. In
particular, when forming non-informative limits of these distributions, the
shape (or degrees of freedom) parameter of the Wishart must be handled with
care. The intuitive solution of directly interpreting the shape as a
pseudocount and letting it go to zero, as proposed by some authors, violates
the restrictions on the shape parameter. We show how to use the scaled
KL-divergence between multivariate Gaussians as an energy function to construct
Wishart and normal-Wishart conjugate priors. When used as informative priors,
the salient feature of these distributions is the mode, while the KL scaling
factor serves as the pseudocount. The scale factor can be taken down to the
limit at zero, to form non-informative priors that do not violate the
restrictions on the Wishart shape parameter. This limit is non-informative in
the sense that the posterior mode is identical to the maximum likelihood
estimate of the parameters of the Gaussian.

When the magnetrons are intended to feed Room Temperature (RT) cavities, the

frequency stability of the accelerating field. However, when the magnetron RF
sources are intended to feed high Q-factor SRF cavities, the sources must be

of magnetron and the injection-locking signal one can choose regime most

  Theory",,,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac2363",,"physics.plasm-ph astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR physics.space-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Over the past two decades scientists have achieved a significant improvement
of our understanding of the transport of energetic particles across a mean
magnetic field. Due to test-particle simulations as well as powerful non-linear
analytical tools our understanding of this type of transport is almost
complete. However, previously developed non-linear analytical theories do not
always agree perfectly with simulations. Therefore, a correction factor $a^2$
was incorporated into such theories with the aim to balance out inaccuracies.
In this paper a new analytical theory for perpendicular transport is presented.
This theory contains the previously developed unified non-linear transport
theory, the most advanced theory to date, in the limit of small Kubo number
turbulence. For two-dimensional turbulence new results are obtained. In this
case the new theory describes perpendicular diffusion as a process which is
sub-diffusive while particles follow magnetic field lines. Diffusion is
restored as soon as the turbulence transverse complexity becomes important. For
long parallel mean free paths one finds that the perpendicular diffusion
coefficient is a reduced field line random walk limit. For short parallel mean
free paths, on the other hand, one gets a hybrid diffusion coefficient which is
a mixture of collisionless Rechester & Rosenbluth and fluid limits. Overall the
new analytical theory developed in the current paper is in agreement with
heuristic arguments. Furthermore, the new theory agrees almost perfectly with
previously performed test-particle simulations without the need of the
aforementioned correction factor $a^2$ or any other free parameter.

integrates transistor and interconnect modeling, parasitic extraction, standard

timing analysis to evaluate system-level performance of new CMOS technologies.
As the impact of parasitic resistances and capacitances continues to increase
with dimensional downscaling, component-level optimization alone becomes
insufficient, calling for a holistic assessment and optimization methodology
across the boundaries between devices, interconnects, circuits, and systems.
The physical implementation flow in DISPEL enables realistic analysis of
complex wires and vias in VLSI systems and their impact on the chip power,
speed, and area, which simple circuit simulations cannot capture. To
demonstrate the use of DISPEL, a 32-bit commercial processor core is
implemented using theoretical n-type MoS2 and p-type Black Phosphorous (BP)
planar FETs at a projected 5-nm node, and the performance is benchmarked
against Si FinFETs. While the superior gate control of the MoS2/BP FETs can
theoretically provide 51% reduction in the iso-frequency energy consumption,
the actual performance can be greatly limited by the source/drain contact
resistances. With the large amount of data generated by DISPEL, a
neural-network is trained to predict the key performance metrics of the 32-bit
processor core using the characteristics of transistors and interconnects as
the input features without the need to go through the time-consuming physical
implementation flow. The machine learning algorithms show great potentials as a
means for evaluation and optimization of new CMOS technologies and identifying

networks (GANs) to generate unseen evasion samples. The purpose is to annex the
generated data with the original train set for adversarial training to improve
the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality of
generated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples.
However, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity,
the anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN
design called Evasion Generative Adversarial Network (EVAGAN) that is more
suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection
improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples,
but its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have
considered Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the
performance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017 and CIC2018) botnet
and computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms
ACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training
stability and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate
the low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast
to ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially
trained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental
analysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data
regimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets. Code will

the network architectures and its weights. Albeit its novelty, it was applied

In this technical paper, we aim to evaluate its ability to tackle a challenging
operational task: semantic segmentation of objects of interest in satellite
imagery. Designing a NAS framework is not trivial and has strong dependencies
to hardware constraints. We therefore motivate our NAS approach selection and
provide corresponding implementation details. We also present novel ideas to

interest, also thanks to the introduction of deep neural agents built in a
hierarchical fashion and trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on

extrinsic reward that requires the complete a priori knowledge of the layout of
the training environment to learn an effective exploration policy. However,
such information is expensive to gather in terms of time and resources. In this
work, we propose to train the model with a purely intrinsic reward signal to
guide exploration, which is based on the impact of the robot's actions on its
internal representation of the environment. So far, impact-based rewards have
been employed for simple tasks and in procedurally generated synthetic
environments with countable states. Since the number of states observable by
the agent in realistic indoor environments is non-countable, we include a
neural-based density model and replace the traditional count-based
regularization with an estimated pseudo-count of previously visited states. The
proposed exploration approach outperforms DRL-based competitors relying on
intrinsic rewards and surpasses the agents trained with a dense extrinsic
reward computed with the environment layouts. We also show that a robot
equipped with the proposed approach seamlessly adapts to point-goal navigation
and real-world deployment.

f of T is an injective function f from V into {0, 1, ..., |E|} such that if
edge uv is assigned the label g(uv)=|f(u)-f(v)| then the function g from E into
{1, ..., |E|} is also injective (that is all edge labels are distinct). A
rooted symmetric tree is a tree in which all vertices at the same level from
root vertex have the same degree. It has been known since 1979 that rooted
symmetric trees are graceful. However, the proofs that have been presented for
this fact are either indirect inductive proofs or algorithmic descriptive
proofs showing the many separate steps involved in labelling the vertices.
Given a rooted symmetric tree, we find a graceful labelling f of T in the form
of a direct algebraic function that algebraically maps each vertex of T to a
unique label. Interestingly, f turns out to be a generalisation of the way a
path is canonically gracefully labelled as algorithmically described by A. Rosa
who is a pioneer in this field of research. The algebraic function that defines
the graceful labelling is used to show that a class of rooted symmetric trees
that contains the class of binomial trees has weakly {\alpha}-labelling and it
can provide a concise practical, computational way of producing graceful
labelling of large rooted symmetric trees in, relatively, minimal time.

selectively confine excitons or trions of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides
at the nanoscale, facilitated by the drift-dominant exciton funnelling into the
strain-induced local spot. We investigate the spatio-spectral characteristics
of the funnelled excitons in a WSe2 monolayer (ML) and converted trions in a
MoS2 ML using hyperspectral tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) imaging with
<15 nm spatial resolution. In addition, we dynamically control the exciton
funnelling and trion conversion rate by the GPa scale tip pressure engineering.
Through a drift-diffusion model, we confirm an exciton funnelling efficiency of
~25 % with a significantly low strain threshold (~0.1 %) which sufficiently
exceeds the efficiency of ~3 % in previous studies. This work provides a new
strategy to facilitate efficient exciton transport and trion conversion of 2D
semiconductor devices.

  Detector CT-Volumes",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose
  3D acquisitions are often acquired to assess the result in orthopedic trauma
surgery. With a mobile C-Arm system, these acquisitions can be performed
intra-operatively. That reduces the number of required revision surgeries.
However, due to the operation room setup, the acquisitions typically cannot be
performed such that the acquired volumes are aligned to the anatomical regions.
Thus, the multiplanar reconstructed (MPR) planes need to be adjusted manually
during the review of the volume. In this paper, we present a detailed study of
multi-task learning (MTL) regression networks to estimate the parameters of the
MPR planes.
  Approach
  First, various mathematical descriptions for rotation, including Euler angle,
quaternion, and matrix representation, are revised. Then, three different MTL
network architectures based on the PoseNet are compared with a single task
learning network.
  Results
  Using a matrix description rather than the Euler angle description, the
accuracy of the regressed normals improves from $7.7^{\circ}$ to $7.3^{\circ}$
in the mean value for single anatomies. The multi-head approach improves the
regression of the plane position from $7.4mm$ to $6.1mm$, while the orientation
does not benefit from this approach.
  Conclusions
  The results show that a multi-head approach can lead to slightly better
results than the individual tasks networks. The most important benefit of the
MTL approach is that it is a single network for standard plane regression for
all body regions with a reduced number of stored parameters.

pandemic, experts need to know the impact of the vaccine efficacy rate's
threshold and how long this pandemic may extent with vaccines that have
different efficacy rates. In this article, a mathematical model study has been
done on the importance of vaccination and vaccine efficiency rate during an
ongoing pandemic. We simulated a five compartment mathematical model to analyze
the pandemic scenario in both California, and whole U.S. We considered four
vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson and Johnson, which are
being used rigorously to control the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition with two
special cases: a vaccine with 100% efficacy rate and no vaccine under use. Both
the infection and death rates are very high in California. Our model suggests
that the pandemic situation in California will be under control in the last
quartile of the year 2023 if frequent vaccination is continued with the Pfizer
vaccine. During this time, six waves will happen from the beginning of the
immunization where the case fatality and recovery rates will be 1.697% and
98.30%, respectively. However, according to the considered model, this period
might be extended to the mid of 2024 when vaccines with lower efficacy rates
are used. The more effective a vaccine, the less people suffer from this malign
infection. Although specific groups of people get prioritized initially, mass
vaccination is needed to control the spread of the disease.

uncertainty around the number of daily cases made it difficult for
decision-makers to control the outbreak. Deep Learning models have proved that
they can come in handy in many real-world problems such as healthcare ones.
However, they require a lot of data to learn the features properly and output
an acceptable solution. Since COVID-19 has been a lately emerged disease, there
was not much data available, especially in the first stage of the pandemic, and
this shortage of data makes it challenging to design an optimized model. To
overcome these problems, we first introduce a new dataset with augmented
features and then forecast COVID-19 cases with a new approach, using an
evolutionary neural architecture search with Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA) to
generate an optimized deep recurrent network. Finally, to show our approach's
effectiveness, we conducted a comparative study on Iran's COVID-19 daily cases.
The results prove our approach's capability to generate an accurate deep

advances in recurrent neural networks. However, recurrent architectures face
the challenge of exploding/vanishing gradients during training, and require
significant computational resources to execute back-propagation through time.
Moreover, large models are typically needed for executing complex sequential
tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neuron model that has
cosine activation with a time varying component for sequential processing. The
proposed neuron provides an efficient building block for projecting sequential
inputs into spectral domain, which helps to retain long-term dependencies with
minimal extra model parameters and computation. A new type of recurrent network
architecture, named Oscillatory Fourier Neural Network, based on the proposed
neuron is presented and applied to various types of sequential tasks. We
demonstrate that recurrent neural network with the proposed neuron model is
mathematically equivalent to a simplified form of discrete Fourier transform
applied onto periodical activation. In particular, the computationally
intensive back-propagation through time in training is eliminated, leading to
faster training while achieving the state of the art inference accuracy in a
diverse group of sequential tasks. For instance, applying the proposed model to
sentiment analysis on IMDB review dataset reaches 89.4% test accuracy within 5
epochs, accompanied by over 35x reduction in the model size compared to LSTM.
The proposed novel RNN architecture is well poised for intelligent sequential

often feel insecure to respond when someone knocks on the door or rings the
doorbell. In this paper, we present an intelligent system called ""SafeAccess+""
to build safer and ADA compliant premises (e.g. smart homes, offices). The key
functionalities of the SafeAccess+ are: 1) Monitoring the inside/outside of
premises and identifying incoming people; 2) Providing users relevant
information to assess incoming threats (e.g., burglary, robbery) and ongoing
crimes 3) Allowing users to grant safe access to homes for friends/family
members. We have addressed several technical and research challenges: -
developing models to detect and recognize person/activity, generating image
descriptions, designing ADA compliant end-end system. In addition, we have
designed a prototype smart door showcasing the proof-of-concept. The premises
are expected to be equipped with cameras placed in strategic locations that
facilitate monitoring the premise 24/7 to identify incoming persons and to
generate image descriptions. The system generates a pre-structured message from
the image description to assess incoming threats and immediately notify the
users. The completeness and generalization of models have been ensured through
a rigorous quantitative evaluation. The users' satisfaction and reliability of
the system has been measured using PYTHEIA scale and was rated excellent
