ferrolens for the observation and qualitative analysis of non-homogeneous
magnetic fields. Latest developments over the last few years of the ferrolens
increased multifold the sensitivity of this device allowing it to display
magnetic fields as low as 10mT in strength and therefore it is possible now to
observe also the homogeneous (i.e. straight parallel magnetic flux lines of
uniform density in space) magnetic field existing inside air solenoids and
between N-S poles of two attracting separated permanent magnets. We present and
analyze herein these novel observations of homogeneous magnetic fields with the
ferrolens and as a potential new application of this device. The ferrolens can
now display the projected magnetic field on air from a distance without needing
to be in physical contact with the field source. Experiments were carried out
to demonstrate these new capabilities of the ferrolens as a nanomagnetic flux
viewer, real-time physical device and scientific qualitative tool. We compare
the geometry of magnetic fields of condensed matter ferromagnets with that of
magnetic fields inside electrical air solenoids. Specifically, the homogeneous
field between two N-S attracting magnets at a distance as well as inside air
solenoids and Helmholtz coils and also the non-homogeneous total field of
single dipole permanent magnets were observed using a latest generation very
sensitive ferrolens. The unique feature of this magneto optic fluid thin film
physical device is that it can display discrete magnetic flux lines of the
macroscopic field. Also we show how the ferrolens can be used to detect
qualitatively the symmetry center of a non ideal homogeneous magnetic field.

(ii) a transition model that indicates the evolution of the state; and (iii) an
action model, the Active Intent Recognition Model (AIRM), that enables the

The topology of an
undirected graph G can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn
can be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which
visual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization depends on the ordering
of its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then
automatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems;
however, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice.
  Often, graphs exist as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of
vertices. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that
works well for all matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves
this problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing
heuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in
those parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware
approach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular
heuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.
  The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering
capture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use
Moran's I, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of
established patterns. The popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a
similar measure which supports the use of Moran's I in this context.
  We evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets
using Moran's I as the quality metric. Our results show that our
collection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union
approach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection.
Specifically, our Moran's I-based collection-aware leaf order implementation
consistently outperforms other implementations.

new applications in disaster relief, surveillance, rescue, and exploration.
However, if the task difficulty increases, the performance of the human
operator decreases, thereby decreasing the overall efficacy of the human-swarm
team. Thus, it is critical to identify the task difficulty and adaptively
allocate the task to the human operator to maintain optimal performance. In
this direction, we study the classification of task difficulty in a human-swarm
interaction experiment performing a target search mission. The human may
control platoons of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground
vehicles (UGVs) to search a partially observable environment during the target
search mission. The mission complexity is increased by introducing adversarial
teams that humans may only see when the environment is explored. While the
human is completing the mission, their brain activity is recorded using an
electroencephalogram (EEG), which is used to classify the task difficulty. We
have used two different approaches for classification: A feature-based approach
using coherence values as input and a deep learning-based approach using raw
EEG as input. Both approaches can classify the task difficulty well above the
chance. The results showed the importance of the occipital lobe (O1 and O2)
coherence feature with the other brain regions. Moreover, we also study
individual differences (expert vs. novice) in the classification results. The
analysis revealed that the temporal lobe in experts (T4 and T3) is predominant

the vulnerabilities of standard federated learning to poisoning and inference,
thus raising concerns about potential risks for sensitive data. To address this
issue, we present SGDE, a generative data exchange protocol that improves user
security and machine learning performance in a cross-silo federation. The core
of SGDE is to share data generators with strong differential privacy guarantees
trained on private data instead of communicating explicit gradient information.
These generators synthesize an arbitrarily large amount of data that retain the
distinctive features of private samples but differ substantially. In this work,
SGDE is tested in a cross-silo federated network on images and tabular

  with Multimodal Adversarial Deep Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an emergency room (ER) setting, stroke triage or screening is a common
challenge. A quick CT is usually done instead of MRI due to MRI's slow
throughput and high cost. Clinical tests are commonly referred to during the
process, but the misdiagnosis rate remains high. We propose a novel multimodal
deep learning framework, DeepStroke, to achieve computer-aided stroke presence
assessment by recognizing patterns of minor facial muscles incoordination and
speech inability for patients with suspicion of stroke in an acute setting. Our
proposed DeepStroke takes one-minute facial video data and audio data readily
available during stroke triage for local facial paralysis detection and global
speech disorder analysis. Transfer learning was adopted to reduce
face-attribute biases and improve generalizability. We leverage a multi-modal
lateral fusion to combine the low- and high-level features and provide mutual
regularization for joint training. Novel adversarial training is introduced to
obtain identity-free and stroke-discriminative features. Experiments on our
video-audio dataset with actual ER patients show that DeepStroke outperforms
state-of-the-art models and achieves better performance than both a triage team
and ER doctors, attaining a 10.94% higher sensitivity and maintaining 7.37%
higher accuracy than traditional stroke triage when specificity is aligned.
Meanwhile, each assessment can be completed in less than six minutes,
demonstrating the framework's great potential for clinical translation.

large-scale image-text pair collections enables zero-shot transfer on various

detection, which involves the non-semantic task of localization as well as
semantic task of classification. To solve this problem, we introduce a
vision-language embedding alignment method that transfers the generalization
capabilities of a pretrained model such as CLIP to an object detector like
YOLOv5. We formulate a loss function that allows us to align the image and text
embeddings from the pretrained model CLIP with the modified semantic prediction
head from the detector. With this method, we are able to train an object
detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO, ILSVRC, and
Visual Genome zero-shot detection benchmarks. During inference, our model can
be adapted to detect any number of object classes without additional training.
We also find that standard object detection scaling can transfer well to our
method and find consistent improvements across various scales of YOLOv5 models
and the YOLOv3 model. Lastly, we develop a self-labeling method that provides a
significant score improvement without needing extra images nor labels.

systems and with a finite number of input states. We show that this requirement
is satisfied in every theory equipped with universal extensions, that is,
correlated states from which all other correlations can be generated locally

exist in two cases: (1) theories permitting conclusive state teleportation, and
(2) theories satisfying three properties of Causality, Pure Product States, and
Purification. In case (2), the existence of universal extensions follows from a
symmetry property of Purification, whereby all pure bipartite states with the
same marginal on one system are locally interconvertible. Crucially, our
results hold even in theories that do not satisfy Local Tomography, the
property that the state of any composite system can be identified from the
correlations of local measurements. Summarizing, the existence of universal

undecided voters for the 2021 German federal election. Due to a cooperation
with the polling institute Civey, we are in the fortunate position to obtain
data in which undecided voters can state all the options they are still
pondering between. In contrast to conventional polls, forcing the undecided to
either state a single party or to drop out, this design allows the undecided to
provide their current position in an accurate and precise way. The resulting
set-valued information can be used to examine structural properties of groups
undecided between specific parties as well as to improve election forecasting.
For forecasting, this partial information provides valuable additional
knowledge, and the uncertainty induced by the participants' ambiguity can be
conveyed within interval-valued results. Turning to coalitions of parties,
which is in the core of the current public discussion in Germany, some of this
uncertainty can be dissolved as the undecided provide precise information on
corresponding coalitions. We show structural differences between the decided
and undecided with discrete choice models as well as elaborate the discrepancy
between the conventional approach and our new ones including the undecided. Our
cautious analysis further demonstrates that in most cases the undecideds'
eventual decisions are pivotal which coalitions could hold a majority of seats.
Overall, accounting for the populations' ambiguity leads to more credible
results and paints a more holistic picture of the political landscape, pathing
the way for a possible paradigmatic shift concerning the adequate inclusion of

  Matrix Computation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The overall execution time of distributed matrix computations is often
dominated by slow worker nodes (stragglers) within the clusters. Recently,
different coding techniques have been utilized to mitigate the effect of
stragglers where worker nodes are assigned the job of processing encoded
submatrices of the original matrices. In many machine learning or optimization
problems the relevant matrices are often sparse. Several prior coded
computation methods operate with dense linear combinations of the original
submatrices; this can significantly increase the worker node computation times
and consequently the overall job execution time. Moreover, several existing
techniques treat the stragglers as failures (erasures) and discard their
computations. In this work, we present a coding approach which operates with
limited encoding of the original submatrices and utilizes the partial
computations done by the slower workers. While our scheme can continue to have
the optimal threshold of prior work, it also allows us to trade off the
straggler resilience with the worker computation speed for sparse input
matrices. Extensive numerical experiments done in AWS (Amazon Web Services)

for this is a measure of a task's generalization difficulty, or how dissimilar
it is from the system's prior knowledge and experience. If the skill of an
intelligence system in a particular domain is defined as it's ability to

a wide variety of real-world domains and computing platforms. Using programs

performance and calculate the generalization difficulty of any given set of

700 galaxies in groups up to redshift 0.35 from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly
(GAMA) survey. To identify the main drivers, our sample was analyzed as a
function of group-centric distance, projected galaxy number density, and
stellar mass. By using control samples of more than 16000 star-forming field
galaxies and volume limited samples, we find that the highest enhancement in
SFR (0.3 dex) occurs in galaxies with the lowest local density. In contrast to
previous work, our data show small enhancements of $\sim$0.1 dex in SFR for
galaxies at the highest local densities or group-centric distances. Our data
indicates quenching in SFR only for massive galaxies, suggesting that stellar
mass might be the main driver of quenching processes for star forming galaxies.
We can discard a morphological driven quenching, since the S\'ersic index
distribution for group and control galaxies are similar. The gas metallicity
does not vary drastically. It increases $\sim$0.08 dex for galaxies at the
highest local densities, and decreases for galaxies at the highest
group-centric distances, in agreement with previous work. Altogether, the local
density, rather than group-centric distance, shows the stronger impact in
enhancing both, the SFR and gas metallicity. We applied the same methodology to
galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations, and although we were able to
reproduce the general observational trends, the differences between group and

overcome these limitations, we design a novel semantic graph-based deep

semantic graph of each code snippet based on intermediate representation to
represent the code semantic more precisely compared to the representations
based on lexical and syntactic analysis. To accommodate the characteristics of
Type-4 clones, a semantic graph is constructed focusing on the operators and
API calls instead of all tokens. Then, SEED generates the feature vectors by
using the graph match network and performs clone detection based on the
similarity among the vectors. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly outperforms two baseline approaches over two public datasets and

an average of 25.2% in the form of F1-Score. Our experiments demonstrate that

fluid at local thermal equilibrium (LTE) in different pseudogauges (PGs), i.e.,
with different choices for the decomposition of orbital and spin angular
momentum, is obtained. The spin polarization obtained in the canonical PG
differs from the one obtained in the Belinfante PG. It is found that this
difference can not be written by replacing the thermal vorticity with the spin
potential in the usual polarization formula. Other PG choices affect the
contribution of thermal shear to the spin polarization. Therefore, the choice
of a PG affects the predictions for the polarization measured in heavy-ion
collisions. In general, it is shown that the Wigner function of a
noninteracting Dirac field at LTE is affected by the PG transformations.
Explicit expressions of the mean axial current are also calculated and it is
found that even the axial vortical effect conductivity depends on the PG.

ingredient of the `concordance' $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. In this
mini-review presentation, we assess the possibility that $\Lambda$ can be a
dynamical quantity, more specifically a `running quantity' in quantum field
theory in curved spacetime. A great deal of phenomenological works have shown
in the last few years that this option (sometimes accompanied with a running
gravitational coupling) may cure some of the tensions afflicting the
$\Lambda$CDM. The `running vacuum models' (RVM's) are characterized by the
vacuum energy density, $\rho_{\rm vac}$, being a series of (even) powers of the
Hubble rate and its time derivatives. Here we describe the technical quantum
field theoretical origin of the RVM structure in FLRW spacetime, which goes
well-beyond the original semi-qualitative renormalization group arguments. In
particular, we compute the renormalized energy-momentum tensor using the
adiabatic regularization procedure and show that it leads to the RVM form. In
other words, we find that the renormalized vacuum energy density,
$\rho_{vac}(H)$ evolves as a (constant) additive term plus a leading dynamical
components ${\cal O}(H^2)$. There are also ${\cal O}(H^4)$ contributions, which
can be relevant for the early universe. Remarkably enough, the renormalized
$\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ does not exhibit dangerous terms proportional to the
quartic power of the masses ($\sim m^4$) of the fields. It is well-known that
these terms have been the main source of trouble since they are responsible for
the extreme fine tuning and ultimately for the cosmological constant problem.
In this context, the current $\rho_{vac}(H)$ is dominated by a constant term,
as it should be, but it acquires a mild dynamical component $\sim \nu H^2$
($|\nu|\ll1$) which makes the RVM to mimic quintessence.

explicitly teach the model to capture relevant contexts and entity types by

extracts relations of better quality due to more effective supervision, but
also retrieves the corresponding supporting evidence more accurately so as to
enhance interpretability. By assessing model uncertainty, SAIS further boosts
the performance via evidence-based data augmentation and ensemble inference
while reducing the computational cost. Eventually, SAIS delivers

the ability to forecast the spread of the disease is more important than any
previous epidemic. The conventional methods of disease-spread modeling,
compartmental models, are based on the assumption of spatiotemporal homogeneity
of the spread of the virus, which may cause forecasting to underperform,
especially at high spatial resolutions. In this paper we approach the
forecasting task with an alternative technique - spatiotemporal machine
learning. We present COVID-LSTM, a data-driven model based on a Long Short-term
Memory deep learning architecture for forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the
county-level in the US. We use the weekly number of new positive cases as
temporal input, and hand-engineered spatial features from Facebook movement and
connectedness datasets to capture the spread of the disease in time and space.
COVID-LSTM outperforms the COVID-19 Forecast Hub's Ensemble model
(COVIDhub-ensemble) on our 17-week evaluation period, making it the first model
to be more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble over one or more forecast
periods. Over the 4-week forecast horizon, our model is on average 50 cases per
county more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble. We highlight that the
underutilization of data-driven forecasting of disease spread prior to COVID-19
is likely due to the lack of sufficient data available for previous diseases,
in addition to the recent advances in machine learning methods for
spatiotemporal forecasting. We discuss the impediments to the wider uptake of
data-driven forecasting, and whether it is likely that more deep learning-based
models will be used in the future.

parallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic

this approach is producing a manipulation behavior that ensures the safety of

reward function that penalizes unsafe actions (e.g. obstacle collision, joint
limit extension), but that approach is not always effective and does not result
in behaviors that can be reused in slightly different environments. We show how
to combine Riemannian Motion Policies, a class of policies that dynamically

features improved photometry and astrometry over that published in the previous
DR2 file, and includes a substantially larger number of sources, of the order
of 2,000 million, making it a paradigm of Big data Astronomy.
  Aims. We demonstrate how Gaia data mining can effectively help to solve the
issue of central star misidentification, a problem that has plagued the field
since its origin. As we did for DR2, our objective is to present a catalogue of
CSPNe with astrometric and photometric information in EDR3.
  Methods. Gaia G(BP)-G(RP) colours allow us to select the sources with
sufficient temperatures to ionize the nebula. In order to estimate the real
colour of a source, it is important to take into account interstellar
extinction and, in the case of compact nebulae, nebular extinction when
available. In addition, distances derived from EDR3 parallaxes (combined with
consistent literature values) can be used to obtain nebular intrinsic
properties from those observed. With this information, CSPNe can be plotted in
an HR diagram.
  Results. We present a catalogue of 2035 PNe with their corresponding CS
identification from among Gaia EDR3 sources. We obtain the distances for those
with known parallaxes in EDR3 (1725 PNe). In addition, for a subsample (405
PNe) with the most accurate distances, we obtain different nebular properties
such as their Galactic distribution, radius, kinematic age and morphology.
Furthermore, for a set of 74 CSPNe, we present the evolutionary state (mass and
age) derived from their luminosities and effective temperatures from
evolutionary models. Finally, we highlight the detection of several wide binary
CSPNe through an analysis of the EDR3 astrometric parameters, and we contribute
to shedding some light on the relevance of close binarity in CSPNe.

  Aim: The goal was to use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to measure the
radiographic alveolar bone level to aid periodontal diagnosis.
  Material and methods: A Deep Learning (DL) model was developed by integrating
three segmentation networks (bone area, tooth, cementoenamel junction) and
image analysis to measure the radiographic bone level and assign radiographic
bone loss (RBL) stages. The percentage of RBL was calculated to determine the
stage of RBL for each tooth. A provisional periodontal diagnosis was assigned
using the 2018 periodontitis classification. RBL percentage, staging, and
presumptive diagnosis were compared to the measurements and diagnoses made by
the independent examiners.
  Results: The average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for segmentation was
over 0.91. There was no significant difference in RBL percentage measurements
determined by DL and examiners (p=0.65). The Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristics Curve of RBL stage assignment for stage I, II and III was 0.89,
0.90 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the case diagnosis was 0.85.
  Conclusion: The proposed DL model provides reliable RBL measurements and
image-based periodontal diagnosis using periapical radiographic images.
However, this model has to be further optimized and validated by a larger
number of images to facilitate its application.

Theoretical models of BBH formation in different environments can provide a key
to interpreting the population of observed mergers, but they require the
simultaneous treatment of stellar evolution and dynamics, galaxy evolution, and
general relativity. We present \texttt{B-POP}, a population synthesis tool to
model BBH mergers formed in the field or via dynamical interactions in young,
globular, and nuclear clusters. Using \texttt{B-POP}, we explore how BH
formation channels, star cluster evolution, hierarchical mergers, and natal BH
properties affect the population of BBH mergers. We find that the primary mass
distribution of BBH mergers extends beyond $M_1 \simeq 200\,{}$ M$_\odot$, and
the effective spin parameter distribution hints at different natal spins for
single and binary BHs. Observed BBHs can be interpreted as members of a mixed
population comprised of $\sim 34\% \,{}(66\%)$ isolated (dynamical) BBHs, with
the latter likely dominating at redshift $z>1$. Hierarchical mergers constitute
the $4.6-7.9\%$ of all mergers in the reference model, dominating the primary
mass distribution beyond $M_1 > 65\,{}$ M$_\odot$. The inclusion of cluster
mass-loss and expansion causes an abrupt decrease in the probability for
mergers beyond the third generation to occur. Considering observational biases,
we find that $2.7-7.5\%$ of mock mergers involve intermediate-mass black hole
(IMBH) seeds formed via stellar collisions. Comparing this percentage to
observed values will possibly help us to constrain IMBH formation mechanisms.

a fixed abundance of subhalos expected to host dwarf galaxies

a similar mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo $V_{\mathrm{peak}}$

regions of the MW are preferentially disrupted by both self-interactions and
the disk, while suppression in WDM is radially independent. The relative
abundance of LMC-associated subhalos is not strongly affected by disk
disruption or WDM, but is significantly suppressed in SIDM due to
self-interactions with the LMC at early times and with the MW during LMC infall
at late times, erasing spatial anisotropy in the MW subhalo population. These
results provide avenues to distinguish dark matter and baryonic physics by
combining properties of the MW and LMC subhalo populations probed by upcoming

soon be resolvable unambiguously, without modeling directly the underlying

instead deliver the projected 2D brightness distribution as a result of
radiative transfer through a 3D distribution of dusty matter around the AGN. We
employ such physically motivated 3D dust distributions in tori around AGNs to
compute 2D images of the emergent thermal emission using CLUMPY, a dust
radiative transfer code for clumpy media. We demonstrate that CLUMPY models can
exhibit morphologies with significant polar elongation in the mid-infrared
(i.e. the emission extends perpendicular to the dust distribution) on scales of
several parsecs, in line with observations in several nearby AGNs. We
characterize the emission and cloud distribution morphologies. The observed
emission from near- to mid-infrared wavelengths generally does not trace the
bulk of the cloud distribution. The elongation of the emission is sensitive to
the torus opening angle or scale height. For cloud distributions with a flat
radial profile, polar extended emission is realized only at wavelengths shorter
than ~18 micron, and shorter than ~5 micron for steep profiles. We make the
full results available through HYPERCAT, a large hypercube of resolved AGN

identified by Borgniet et al. (2019). HD 91312 B's spectrum is consistent with
that of an early-to-mid M dwarf. Hipparcos and Gaia absolute astrometry,
radial-velocity data, and SCExAO/CHARIS astrometry constrain its dynamical mass
to be $0.337^{+0.042}_{-0.044}$M$_\odot$, consistent with - but far more
precise than - masses derived from spectroscopy, and favors a nearly edge-on
orbit with a semi-major axis of $\sim$9.7 au. This work is an example of
precisely characterizing properties of low-mass companions at solar system-like
scales from a combination of direct imaging, astrometry, and radial-velocity
methods.

correlations and has led to a deeper understanding of correlations in quantum
networks. Existing frameworks for quantum causality tend to focus on acyclic
causal structures that are not fine-tuned i.e., where causal connections
between variables necessarily create correlations between them. However,
fine-tuned causal models (which permit causation without correlation) play a
crucial role in cryptography, and cyclic causal models can be used to model
physical processes involving feedback and may also be relevant in exotic
solutions of general relativity. Here we develop a causal modelling framework
capable of dealing with these general scenarios. The key feature of our
framework is that it allows operational and relativistic notions of causality
to be independently defined and for connections between them to be established
in a theory-independent manner. The framework first gives an operational way to
study causation that allows for cyclic, fine-tuned and non-classical causal
influences. We then consider how a causal model can be embedded in a space-time
structure (modelled as a partial order) and propose a compatibility condition
for ensuring that the embedded causal model does not allow signalling outside
the space-time future. We identify several distinct classes of causal loops
that can arise in our framework, showing that compatibility with a space-time
can rule out only some of them. We discuss conditions for preventing
superluminal signalling within arbitrary (and possibly cyclic) causal
structures and consider models of causation in post-quantum theories admitting
so-called jamming correlations. Finally, this work introduces the concept of a
""higher-order affects relation"", which is useful for causal discovery in
fined-tuned causal models.

Supermassive black hole ($10^7$~M$_{\odot}$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$) binary
formation, coalescence and merger within massive galaxies is well-studied.
However, low-to-intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) are hosted by low-mass
and dwarf galaxies; it is not trivial to extrapolate black hole merger
timescales to this IMBH binary regime, due to the starkly different host galaxy
structure, kinematics, and morphology compared to massive galaxy hosts. We
perform ultra-high resolution $N$-body simulations to study IMBH dynamics in
nucleated dwarf galaxies whose structural parameters are obtained from
observations of nearby dwarf galaxies. Starting from 50 parsecs, an IMBH
quickly forms a binary. Thereafter, the binary orbit shrinks rapidly due to the
high central stellar densities furnished by nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We
find high eccentricities ($e \sim 0.4-0.99$) in our suite of IMBH binaries, and
residual eccentricity may persist to the LISA regime. IMBH merger times are
typically a few hundred million years, with a few exceptionally short merger
times for high eccentricities. We find that IMBH-stellar encounters originate
predominantly from NSCs, if the NSC-to-IMBH binary mass ratio is greater than
10; otherwise, bulge stars contribute significantly. As the IMBH binary ejects
stars, however, the NSCs is disrupted. We conclude that comparable-mass IMBHs
merge very efficiently in nucleated dwarf galaxies, making them promising LISA
sources, as well as a channel for IMBH growth.

of $10^{10.3\pm 0.3} M_\odot$, is located on the star-forming main sequence,

dynamically complex system with velocity gradients ranging from 0 to 60
$\mathrm{km}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The two regions studied are: a dust-reddened
center (Central region), and a blue arc at 7 kpc from the center (Arc region).
We measure the \ion{Fe}{2} and \ion{Mg}{2} absorption line profiles from deep
Keck/DEIMOS spectra. Blueshifted wings up to 450 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ are found
for both regions. The \ion{Fe}{2} column densities of winds are $10^{14.7\pm

are most likely launched from both regions. The winds may be driven by the
spatially extended star formation, the surface density of which is around 0.2

outflow rates are estimated to be $4\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and
$3\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for the Central and Arc regions, with
uncertainties of one order-of-magnitude or more. Findings of this work and a
few previous studies suggest that the cool galactic winds at $z\gtrsim 1$ might

to SN 2020tlf and persisted at relatively constant flux until first light. Soon
after discovery, ""flash"" spectroscopy of SN 2020tlf revealed prominent narrow
symmetric emission lines ($v_w < 300$ km s$^{-1}$) that resulted from the
photo-ionization of unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) shedded in
progenitor mass loss episodes in the final weeks to months before explosion.
Surprisingly, this novel display of pre-SN emission and associated mass loss
occurred in a RSG progenitor with ZAMS mass of only 10-12 M$_{\odot}$, as
inferred from nebular spectra. Modeling of the light curve and multi-epoch
spectra with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN and
radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) code HERACLES suggests a dense CSM limited to $r
\approx 10^{15}$ cm, and mass loss rate of $10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The
subsequent luminous light-curve plateau and persistent blue excess indicates an
extended progenitor, compatible with a RSG model with $R_{\star} = 1100$
R$_{\odot}$. Inferences from the limits on the shock-powered X-ray and radio
luminosity are consistent with these conclusions and suggest a CSM density of
$\rho < 2 \times 10^{-16}$ g cm$^{-3}$ for distances of $r \approx 5 \times
10^{15}$ cm, as well as a mass loss rate of $\dot M<1.3 \times

for the observed precursor emission is the ejection of stellar material

combustion.

shock wave interacts with the material's microstructure is known to dictate the
initiation of chemical reactions and detonation. Recent results have shown
that, following the shock-induced collapse of pores with circular
cross-sections, more energy is localized as internal potential energy (PE) than
can be inferred from the kinetic energy (KE) distribution. This leads to a
complex thermo-mechanical state that is typically overlooked. The mechanisms
associated with pore collapse and hotspot formation and the resulting energy
localization are known to be highly dependent on material properties,
especially its ability to deform plastically and alleviate strain energy, as
well as the size and shape of the pore. Therefore, we use molecular dynamics
simulations to characterize shock-induced pore collapse and the subsequent
formation of hotspots in TATB, a highly anisotropic molecular crystal, for
various defect shapes, shock strengths and crystallographic orientations. We
find that the the localization of energy as PE is consistently higher and its
extent larger than as localized as KE. A detailed analysis of the MD
trajectories reveal the underlying molecular process that govern the effect of
orientation and pore shape on the resulting hotspots. We find that the regions
of highest PE for a given KE relate to not the impact front of the collapse,
but the areas of maximum plastic deformation, while KE is maximized at the
point of impact. A comparison with previous results in HMX reveal less energy
localization in TATB which could be a contributing factor to its insensitivity.

northern portion of the HI. The peak surface brightness of the optical source
is only $\mu_{g}$ = 26.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, well below the typical cutoff that
defines the isophotal edge of a galaxy, and its estimated stellar mass is only
$10^{7.32\pm0.33}$ solar masses, yielding an overall neutral gas-to-stellar

In August 2019, we began collecting and analyzing data from the campus WIFI
network. A goal of the research was to answer question like what passive
sensing of the IHE WIFI might tell us about the dynamics of the WIFI weather in
the IHE ecosystem and what does anonymized data tell us about the IHE
ecosystem. The analogy with weather prediction seemed appropriate and a viable
approach. Starting Fall 2019, data were collected in the observational phase.
In the analysis phase, we applied Singular Spectrum Analysis decomposition, to
deconstruct WIFI data from dorms, the central campus dining cafeteria, the
recreation center, and other buildings on campus. That analysis led to the
identification of clusters of buildings that behaved similarly. Just as in the
case of models of the weather, a final component of this research was
forecasting. We found that weekly forecast of WIFI behavior in the Fall 2019,
were straight forward using SSA and seemed to present behavior of a low
dimensional dynamical system. However, in Spring 2020, and the COVID

campus changed very quickly. We found that as the campus moved to conduct
remote learning, teaching, the closure of research labs, and the edict to work
remotely, SSA forecasting techniques not trained on the Spring 2020, data after
the shock, performed poorly. While SSA forecasting trained on a portion of the

analysis, aiming to recover/interpolate signals for unsampled/unobserved
locations based on observed signals. The principle challenge for spatiotemporal
kriging is how to effectively model and leverage the spatiotemporal
dependencies within the data. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown
great promise for spatiotemporal kriging tasks. However, standard GNNs often
require a carefully designed adjacency matrix and specific aggregation
functions, which are inflexible for general applications/problems. To address
this issue, we present SATCN -- Spatial Aggregation and Temporal Convolution
Networks -- a universal and flexible framework to perform spatiotemporal
kriging for various spatiotemporal datasets without the need for model
specification. Specifically, we propose a novel spatial aggregation network
(SAN) inspired by Principal Neighborhood Aggregation, which uses multiple
aggregation functions to help one node gather diverse information from its
neighbors. To exclude information from unsampled nodes, a masking strategy that
prevents the unsampled sensors from sending messages to their neighborhood is
introduced to SAN. We capture temporal dependencies by the temporal
convolutional networks, which allows our model to cope with data of diverse
sizes. To make SATCN generalizable to unseen nodes and even unseen graph
structures, we employ an inductive strategy to train SATCN. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets, including
traffic speed and climate recordings. Our results demonstrate the superiority
of SATCN over traditional and GNN-based kriging models.

displaced Fock state, as a test case, using a set of measures like entanglement

additional subsystems such as a flight control system, or predict complex

can either be obtained experimentally through wind tunnel testing or, depending
upon the accuracy requirements, by numerically simulating the underlying
fundamental equations of fluid dynamics. In this paper, the feasibility of
applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate the aerodynamic

permeable boundary. In the basic flow, the velocity has nonzero azimuthal and
radial components, and the direction of the radial flow can be from the inner
cylinder to the outer one or vice versa. In most earlier studies, all
components of the velocity were assumed to be given on the entire boundary of
the flow domain. Our aim is to study the effect of different boundary
conditions on the stability of such flows. We focus on the following boundary
conditions: at the inflow part if the boundary (which may be either inner or
outer cylinder) all components of the velocity are known; at the outflow part
of the boundary (the other cylinder), the normal stress and either the
tangential velocity or the tangential stress are prescribed. Both types of
boundary conditions are relevant to certain real flows: the first one - to
porous cylinders, the second - to flows, where the fluid leaves the flow domain
to an ambient fluid which is at rest. It turns out that both sets of boundary
conditions make the corresponding steady flows more unstable (compared with
earlier works where all components of the velocity are prescribed on the entire
boundary). In particular, it is demonstrated that even the classical (purely
azimuthal) Couette-Taylor flow becomes unstable to two-dimensional
perturbations if one of the cylinders is porous and the normal stress (rather
than normal velocity) is prescribed on that cylinder.

and low precision for stability. Generally speaking, RKC methods are low-order
explicit schemes with a stability domain growing quadratically with the number

accuracy (1 or 2 for first- and second-order methods respectively) in high

soaring interests of introducing autonomous vehicles into the real world in
recent years. The safety of these vehicles while they complete their objectives
is of paramount importance. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising
tool for guaranteeing safety for low-dimensional systems. However, due to its
exponential complexity in computation time, no reachability-based methods have
been able to guarantee safety for more than three vehicles successfully in
unstructured scenarios. For systems with four or more vehicles,we can only
empirically validate their safety performance.While reachability-based safety
methods enjoy a flexible least-restrictive control strategy, it is challenging
to reason about long-horizon trajectories online because safety at any given
state is determined by looking up its safety value in a pre-computed table that
does not exhibit favorable properties that continuous functions have. This
motivates the problem of improving the safety performance of unstructured

interest in the big-data era. In terms of going beyond point prediction to
develop prediction intervals, two main threads of development are conformal
prediction and Model-free prediction. Recently, Chernozhukov et al.(2021)
proposed a new conformal prediction approach exploiting the same uniformization
procedure as in the Model-free Bootstrap of Politis (2015). Hence, it is of
interest to compare and further investigate the performance of the two methods.
In the paper at hand, we contrast the two approaches via theoretical analysis
and numerical experiments with a focus on conditional coverage of prediction
intervals. We discuss suitable scenarios for applying each algorithm,
underscore the importance of conditional vs. unconditional coverage, and show
that, under mild conditions, the Model-free bootstrap yields prediction
intervals with guaranteed better conditional coverage compared to quantile
estimation. We also extend the concept of `pertinence' of prediction intervals
in Politis (2015) to the nonparametric regression setting, and give concrete
examples where its importance emerges under finite sample scenarios. Finally,
we define the new notion of `conjecture testing' that is the analog of

invariant convex Lyapunov function (Barabanov norm), which provides a very
refined analysis of trajectories. Until recently that notion remained rather
theoretical apart from special cases. In 2015 N.Guglielmi and M.Zennaro showed
that many systems possess at least one simple Barabanov norm, which moreover,
can be efficiently computed. In this paper we classify all possible Barabanov
norms for discrete-time systems. We prove that, under mild assumptions, such
norms are unique and are either piecewise-linear or piecewise quadratic. Those
assumptions can be verified algorithmically and the numerical experiments show
that a vast majority of systems satisfy them. For some narrow classes of
systems, there are more complicated Barabanov norms but they can still be
classified and constructed. Using those results we find all trajectories of the
fastest growth. They turn out to be eventually periodic with special periods.
Examples and numerical results are presented.

which requires large-scale training data that is representative of the natural

datasets composed of millions of images due to constraints of subjective
testing. While a number of efforts have focused on design innovations to
enhance the performance of DNN based BIQA, attempts to address the scarcity of
labeled IQA data remain surprisingly missing. To address this data challenge,
we construct so far the largest IQA database, namely Waterloo Exploration-II,
which contains 3,570 pristine reference and around 3.45 million singly and
multiply distorted images. Since subjective testing for such a large dataset is
nearly impossible, we develop a novel mechanism that synthetically assigns
perceptual quality labels to the distorted images. We construct a DNN-based
BIQA model called EONSS, train it on Waterloo Exploration-II, and test it on
nine subject-rated IQA datasets, without any retraining or fine-tuning. The
results show that with a straightforward DNN architecture, EONSS is able to
outperform the very state-of-the-art in BIQA, both in terms of quality
prediction performance and execution speed. This study strongly supports the
view that the quantity and quality of meaningfully annotated training data,
rather than a sophisticated network architecture or training strategy, is the
dominating factor that determines the performance of DNN-based BIQA models.

an extension of classical distributed computing. In this paper, we trace the
evolution of two interrelated notions: failure and fault-tolerance. In
classical distributed computing, a failure to complete a multi-party protocol
is typically attributed to hardware malfunctions. A fault-tolerant protocol is
one that responds to such failures by rolling the system back to an earlier
consistent state. In the presence of Byzantine failures, a failure may be the
result of an attack, and a fault-tolerant protocol is one that ensures that
attackers will be punished and victims compensated. In modern decentralized
finance however, failure to complete a protocol can be considered a legitimate
option, not a transgression. A fault-tolerant protocol is one that ensures that
the party offering the option cannot renege, and the party purchasing the
option provides fair compensation (in the form of a fee) to the offering party.
We sketch the evolution of such protocols, starting with two-phase commit, and
finishing with timed hashlocked smart contracts.

any labels in the target domain. We first applied a generator to achieve
image-to-image translation. Next, we ensemble outputs from an ensemble of
different models to obtain final segmentations. To cope with MRIs from
different sites/scanners, we applied various 'online' augmentations during
training to better capture the geometric variability and the variability in
image appearance and quality. Our method is easy to build and produces
promising segmentations, with a mean Dice score of 0.7930 and 0.7432 for VS and

  Image Modeling",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) improves model performance for
downstream tasks that require image and text inputs. Current VLP approaches
differ on (i) model architecture (especially image embedders), (ii) loss
functions, and (iii) masking policies. Image embedders are either deep models
like ResNet or linear projections that directly feed image-pixels into the
transformer. Typically, in addition to the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss,
alignment-based objectives are used for cross-modality interaction, and RoI
feature regression and classification tasks for Masked Image-Region Modeling
(MIRM). Both alignment and MIRM objectives mostly do not have ground truth.
Alignment-based objectives require pairings of image and text and heuristic
objective functions. MIRM relies on object detectors. Masking policies either
do not take advantage of multi-modality or are strictly coupled with alignments
generated by other models. In this paper, we present Masked Language and Image
Modeling (MLIM) for VLP. MLIM uses two loss functions: Masked Language Modeling
(MLM) loss and image reconstruction (RECON) loss. We propose Modality Aware
Masking (MAM) to boost cross-modality interaction and take advantage of MLM and
RECON losses that separately capture text and image reconstruction quality.
Using MLM + RECON tasks coupled with MAM, we present a simplified VLP
methodology and show that it has better downstream task performance on a
proprietary e-commerce multi-modal dataset.

qualitative and conditional preference statements under the ceteris paribus
interpretation. The constrained CP-net is an extension of the CP-net, to a set
of constraints. The existing algorithms for solving the constrained CP-net
require the expensive dominance testing operation. We propose three approaches
to tackle this challenge. In our first solution, we alter the constrained
CP-net by eliciting additional relative importance statements between
variables, in order to have a total order over the outcomes. We call this new
model, the constrained Relative Importance Network (constrained CPR-net).
Consequently, We show that the Constrained CPR-net has one single optimal
outcome (assuming the constrained CPR-net is consistent) that we can obtain
without dominance testing. In our second solution, we extend the Lexicographic
Preference Tree (LP-tree) to a set of constraints. Then, we propose a recursive
backtrack search algorithm, that we call Search-LP, to find the most preferable
outcome. We prove that the first feasible outcome returned by Search-LP
(without dominance testing) is also preferable to any other feasible outcome.
Finally, in our third solution, we preserve the semantics of the CP-net and
propose a divide and conquer algorithm that compares outcomes according to
dominance testing.

individuals come into contact with susceptible ones. Such effects, however,
have remained largely unexplored in the study of epidemic outbreaks. In
particular, it remains unclear how the timing of contacts interacts with the
latent and infectious stages of the disease. Here, we use real-world physical
proximity data to study this interaction and find that the temporal statistics
of actual human contact patterns i) destabilize epidemic outbreaks and ii)
modulate the basic reproduction number. We explain both observations by
distinct aspects of the observed contact patterns. On the one hand, we find the
destabilization of outbreaks to be caused by temporal clustering of contacts
leading to over-dispersed offspring distributions and increased probabilities
of otherwise rare events (zero- and super-spreading). Notably, our analysis
enables us to disentangle previously elusive sources of over-dispersion in
empirical offspring distributions. On the other hand, we find the modulation of
R0 to be caused by a periodically varying contact rate. Both mechanisms are a
direct consequence of the memory in contact behavior, and we showcase a
generative process that reproduces these non-Markovian statistics. Our results
point to the importance of including non-Markovian contact timings into studies
of epidemic outbreaks.

as frost heave, ice lenses, and meters of debris-rich ice under glaciers.
Understanding the dynamics of frozen fringe development is important as frost
heave is responsible for damaging infrastructure at high latitudes and frozen
sediments at the base of glaciers can modulate glacier flow, influencing the
rate of global sea level rise. Here we study the fluid physics of interstitial
freezing water in sediments and focus on the conditions relevant for subglacial
environments. We describe the thermomechanics of liquid water flow through and
freezing in ice-saturated frozen sediments. The force balance that governs the
frozen fringe thickness depends on the weight of the overlying material, the
thermomolecular force between ice and sediments across premelted films of
liquid, and the water pressure within liquid films that is required by flow
according to Darcy's law. We combine this mechanical model with an enthalpy
method which conserves energy across phase change interfaces on a fixed
computational grid. The force balance and enthalpy model together determine the
evolution of the frozen fringe thickness and our simulations predict frost
heave rates and ice lens spacing. Our model accounts for premelting at
ice-sediment contacts, partial ice saturation of the pore space, water flow
through the fringe, the thermodynamics of the ice-water-sediment interface, and
vertical force balance. We explicitly account for the formation of ice lenses,
regions of pure ice that cleave the fringe at the depth where the interparticle
force vanishes. Our model results allow us to predict the thickness of a frozen
fringe and the spacing of ice lenses at the base of glaciers.

data from the Virgo detector and we allow for more unequal mass systems, with
mass ratio $q \geq 0.1$. We do not report any gravitational-wave candidates.
The most significant trigger has a false alarm rate of 0.14 $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.
This implies an upper limit on the merger rate of subsolar binaries in the
range $[220-24200] \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, depending on the chirp
mass of the binary. We use this upper limit to derive astrophysical constraints
on two phenomenological models that could produce subsolar-mass compact
objects. One is an isotropic distribution of equal-mass primordial black holes.
Using this model, we find that the fraction of dark matter in primordial black
holes is $f_\mathrm{PBH} \equiv \Omega_\mathrm{PBH} / \Omega_\mathrm{DM}
\lesssim 6\%$. The other is a dissipative dark matter model, in which fermionic
dark matter can collapse and form black holes. The upper limit on the fraction
of dark matter black holes depends on the minimum mass of the black holes that
can be formed: the most constraining result is obtained at $M_\mathrm{min}=1
M_\odot$, where $f_\mathrm{DBH} \equiv \Omega_\mathrm{PBH} / \Omega_\mathrm{DM}
\lesssim 0.003\%$. These are the tightest limits on spinning subsolar-mass

are likely to be common, large, and underestimate the magnitude of stress
change caused by injection. Recent advances in borehole-based strain

have now enabled monitoring of the deformation of the storage system throughout
its operational lifespan. This data can enable validation and refinement of the
knowledge of the geomechanical properties and state of the system, but brings
with it a challenge to transform the raw data into actionable knowledge. We
demonstrate a method to perform a gradient-based deterministic inversion of

and selection of updated model parameters. The approach presented is very
flexible as to what type of geomechanical constitutive response can be used.
The approach is easily adaptable to nonlinear physics-based constitutive models
to account for common rock behaviors such as creep and plasticity. The approach
also enables training of machine learning-based constitutive models by allowing
back propagation of errors through the finite element calculations. This
enables strongly enforcing known physics, such as conservation of momentum and
continuity, while allowing data-driven models to learn the truly unknown

States in January 2020. To curb the spread of the disease in mid-March,
different states issued mandatory stay-at-home (SAH) orders. These
nonpharmaceutical interventions were mandated based on prior experiences, such
as the 1918 influenza epidemic. Hence, we decided to study the impact of
restrictions on mobility on reducing COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We
designed an ecological time series study with our exposure variable as Mobility
patterns in the state of Maryland for March- December 2020 and our outcome
variable as the COVID-19 hospitalizations for the same period. We built an
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble machine learning model and
regressed the lagged COVID-19 hospitalizations with Mobility volume for
different regions of Maryland. Results: We found an 18% increase in COVID-19
hospitalizations when mobility was increased by a factor of five, similarly a
43% increase when mobility was further increased by a factor of ten.
Conclusion: The findings of our study demonstrated a positive linear
relationship between mobility and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. These
findings are partially consistent with other studies suggesting the benefits of
mobility restrictions. Although more detailed approach is needed to precisely
understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of a
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

photorealistic 3D virtual data representing the physical environment. The
innovation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) has provided additional
high-resolution imaging capabilities with low cost for mapping a relatively
large area of interest. These cutting-edge technologies have caught the US Army
and Navy's attention for the purpose of rapid 3D battlefield reconstruction,
virtual training, and simulations. Our previous works have demonstrated the
importance of information extraction from the derived photogrammetric data to
create semantic-rich virtual environments (Chen et al., 2019). For example, an
increase of simulation realism and fidelity was achieved by segmenting and
replacing photogrammetric trees with game-ready tree models. In this work, we
further investigated the semantic information extraction problem and focused on
the ground material segmentation and object detection tasks. The main
innovation of this work was that we leveraged both the original 2D images and
the derived 3D photogrammetric data to overcome the challenges faced when using
each individual data source. For ground material segmentation, we utilized an
existing convolutional neural network architecture (i.e., 3DMV) which was
originally designed for segmenting RGB-D sensed indoor data. We improved its
performance for outdoor photogrammetric data by introducing a depth pooling
layer in the architecture to take into consideration the distance between the
source images and the reconstructed terrain model. To test the performance of
our improved 3DMV, a ground truth ground material database was created using
data from the One World Terrain (OWT) data repository. Finally, a workflow for
importing the segmented ground materials into a virtual simulation scene was
introduced, and visual results are reported in this paper.

that splits convex optimization problems with saddle-point structure into
smaller subproblems. Unlike those obtained in most splitting methods, these
subproblems can generally be solved efficiently because they involve simple
operations such as matrix-vector multiplications or proximal mappings that are
fast to evaluate numerically. This advantage comes at the price that the linear
PDHG method requires precise stepsize parameters for the problem at hand to
achieve an optimal convergence rate. Unfortunately, these stepsize parameters
are often prohibitively expensive to compute for large-scale optimization
problems, such as those in machine learning. This issue makes the otherwise
simple linear PDHG method unsuitable for such problems, and it is also shared
by most first-order optimization methods as well. To address this issue, we
introduce accelerated nonlinear PDHG methods that achieve an optimal
convergence rate with stepsize parameters that are simple and efficient to
compute. We prove rigorous convergence results, including results for strongly
convex or smooth problems posed on infinite-dimensional reflexive Banach
spaces. We illustrate the efficiency of our methods on $\ell_{1}$-constrained
logistic regression and entropy-regularized matrix games. Our numerical
experiments show that the nonlinear PDHG methods are considerably faster than
competing methods.

growing stable crystal. To investigate the role pre-critical clusters play in
nucleation, we develop a simple thermodynamic model for crystal nucleation in
terms of cluster size and the degree of cluster order that allows us to alter
the work of forming the pre-critical clusters without effecting the properties
of the critical cluster. The steady state and transient nucleation behaviour of
the system are then studied numerically, for different microscopic ordering
kinetics. We find that the models exhibits a generic order-disorder transition

increasing the accessibility of disordered pre-critical clusters decreases both

amplitudes representing density cumulants, as well as the grand potential. In
contrast to other approaches reported in the literature the theory does not use
perturbation theory in the interaction picture and an integral formulation as a
starting point, but rather requires a propagation of the resulting differential
equation for the amplitudes. While the theory is applicable to general classes
of many-body problems in principle, here, the theory is illustrated using
simple model systems. For one-body Fermionic Hamiltonians, Fermi-Dirac one-body

is determining if the present model tends to an homogeneous and isotropic FRW
model, during its evolution. Also, we want to establish how the parameters and
initial conditions of the model, quantitatively, influence the isotropization
of the present model. In order to simplify our task, we use the Misner
parametrization of the KS metric. In terms of that parametrization the KS
metric has two metric functions: the scale factor $a(t)$ and $\beta(t)$, which
measures the spatial anisotropy of the model. We solve, numerically, the
Einstein's equations of the model and find a solution where the universe starts
to expand from a, small, initial size and continues to expand until it ends in
a {\it Big Rip} singularity. We explicitly show that for the expansive
solution, after same time, the universe becomes isotropic. Based on that
result, we can speculate that the expansive solution may represent an initial,
anisotropic, stage of our Universe, that later, due to the expansion, became
isotropic.

degeneracies, have shown greater advantages in sensitive enhancement than
second-order EPs (EP2s). Therefore, seeking higher-order EPs in various quantum
systems is important for quantum information science. Here we propose a
benchmark cavity optomechanical (COM) system consisting of a mechanical
resonator (MR) coupled to two cavities via radiation pressure for predicting
the third-order exceptional point (EP3). We first give the pseudo-Hermitian
condition for the non-Hermitian COM system by taking the bath effects into
account. Then we consider the mechanical gain effect and we find that the
pseudo-Hermitian COM system without $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can host both the
EP3 and EP2 for symmetric and asymmetric cavities. In the symmetric case, only
the EP3 or EP2 can be predicted in the parameter space, but the EP3 and EP2 can
be transformed into each other by tuning the COM coupling strength in the
asymmetric case. We further consider the case of one cavity with gain. For this
case, the pseudo-Hermitian COM system is $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and can also
host the EP3 or EP2. The influence of system parameters on them are discussed.
Our proposal provides a potential way to realize sensitive detection and study
other physical phenomena {around} higher-order EP3 in non-Hermitian COM
systems.

lattice clock, in which spatially-resolved, movable ensembles of ultra-cold
strontium atoms are trapped in the same optical lattice, interrogated
simultaneously by a shared clock laser, and read-out in parallel. By performing
synchronized Ramsey interrogations of ensemble pairs we observe atom-atom

3.3 hours of averaging. These results demonstrate that applications requiring

optimized online based on an efficient supervised learning framework.
Simulation results show that for a polar code of length 512 with 256

theoretically using linear stability analyses. The onset time depends on the
interaction between the permeability profile and the location of the
concentration perturbation peak beyond which the concentration of CO$_2$
decays. A thin low-permeability layer can either accelerate or delay the onset
time of the convective instability depending on the nature of the permeability
variation - whether the permeability transition is smooth or layered, the
Rayleigh number (Ra), and the location of the permeability change ($\hat{a}$)
relative to the perturbation peak ($\hat{a}_{c^{*}}$), which scales as
$\hat{a}_{c^{*}}\approx 14Ra^{-1}$ for homogeneous systems. However, the low
permeable layer has no effect on the onset time when it is near the lower

steady state for self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow (SG-CFD). This
paper focus on effects of mass cascade on halo energy, momentum, dispersion,
size, and density. Halo with fast mass accretion has an expanding core. Mass
cascade forms a new layer of mass that deforms the original halo and induces
nonzero radial flow (outwards in core and inwards in outer regions). The
inward/outward flow leads to an extra length scale (scale radius) that is not
present in isothermal profile. Halo concentration c=3.5 can be derived for fast
growing halos. For cusp-core controversy, a double-power-law density is
proposed as a result of nonzero radial flow. The inner/outer density are
controlled by halo deformation rate and halo growth, respectively. The slower
deformation at center, the steeper density. For fast growing halos, radial flow
at center is simply Hubble flow that leads to the existence of central core.
Mass cascade leads to nonzero halo surface energy/tension and radial flow that
enhances dispersion in outer region. An effective exponent of gravity
$n_e$=-1.3 (not -1) is obtained due to halo surface energy. Halo size follows a
geometric Brownian motion and lognormal distribution. Brownian motion of
particles in evolving halos leads to Fokker-Planck equations for particle
distribution that is dependent on the radial and osmotic flow. Complete
solutions of particle distribution are presented based on a simple model of
osmotic flow. The proposed model agrees with N-body simulation for various halo
group sizes. With reference pressure/density defined at center, equation of
state can be established for relative pressure/density. Pressure, density, and
dispersion at halo center are presented. The core size $x_c$ is obtained where
Hubble flow is dominant. Simple closures are proposed for self-consistent halo
density.

link from the observer (encoder) to the controller. We investigate the optimal
trade-off between the improved LQG cost and the consumed communication
(information) resources, measured with the conditional directed information,
across all encoding-decoding policies. The main result is a semidefinite
programming formulation for that optimization problem in the finite-horizon
scenario, which applies to time-varying linear dynamical systems. This result
extends a seminal work by Tanaka et al., where the only information the
controller knows about the system state arrives via a communication channel, to
the scenario where the controller has also access to a noisy observation of the
system state. As part of our derivation to show the optimiality of an encoder
that transmits a memoryless Gaussian measurement of the state, we show that the
presence of the controller's observations at the encoder can not reduce the
minimal directed information. For time-invariant systems, where the optimal
policy may be time-varying, we show in the infinite-horizon scenario that the
optimal policy is time-invariant and can be computed explicitly from a solution
of a finite-dimensional semidefinite programming. The results are demonstrated

efficiency is sensitive to the splitting parameters, we offer a data-driven
approach, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) method based on the Bayesian
inference, to predict the GADI framework's relatively optimal parameters. The
GPR method requires a small training data set to learn the regression
prediction mapping, which has sufficient accuracy and high generalization
capability. It allows us to efficiently solve linear systems with a one-shot
computation, and does not require any repeated computations to obtain
relatively optimal splitting parameters. Finally, we use the three-dimensional

that the proposed framework is faster tens to thousands of times than the

this work, we use spatially resolved HST/STIS spectroscopic observations of
three nearby NSCs (hosted by NGC 5102, NGC 5206, and NGC 205) to constrain
their formation histories by exploring radial variations of the stellar
populations within each cluster. Utilizing full-spectrum fitting, we find
substantial age and metallicity gradients within the central 0.""9 (16~pc) of
the NSC in NGC 5102 where populations near the center are young/metal-rich (age
~400~Myr and [M/H] ~-0.4) and become older/metal-poor at larger radii (mean age
~1~Gyr and mean [M/H] ~-1.6 in the radial range [0.""3, 0.""9]). This behavior
suggests that the young/metal-rich population at the center was formed from a
period of in situ formation, while the older/metal-poor populations were likely
formed by inspiraled globular clusters. The two broad populations observed in
the NGC 5102 NSC (young/metal-rich and old/metal-poor) appear to be linked to
the transition between the two morphological components of the NSC derived from
the surface-brightness profile in Nguyen et al. (2018)(arXiv:1711.04314). The
radial ranges explored in NGC 5206 and NGC 205 were much smaller due to poor
data quality; in NGC 5206 we find a similar metallicity gradient to NGC 5102
(but with much lower significance), while the data for NGC 205 is too poor to
reach any conclusions. Overall, this data highlights the links between the
morphological and stellar population complexity of NSCs and their formation
mechanisms.

trimap. Recently, deep learning based methods propagate the alpha values from
the known regions to unknown regions according to the similarity between them.
However, we find that more than 50\% pixels in the unknown regions cannot be
correlated to pixels in known regions due to the limitation of small effective
reception fields of common convolutional neural networks, which leads to
inaccurate estimation when the pixels in the unknown regions cannot be inferred
only with pixels in the reception fields. To solve this problem, we propose
Long-Range Feature Propagating Network (LFPNet), which learns the long-range
context features outside the reception fields for alpha matte estimation.
Specifically, we first design the propagating module which extracts the context
features from the downsampled image. Then, we present Center-Surround Pyramid
Pooling (CSPP) that explicitly propagates the context features from the
surrounding context image patch to the inner center image patch. Finally, we
use the matting module which takes the image, trimap and context features to
estimate the alpha matte. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on the
AlphaMatting and Adobe Image Matting datasets.

Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and cooperative intelligent transportation

systems' safety using various sensors and communication devices. However, it is
found difficult to deploy the C-ITS framework in South Korea, because CAVs
produce a massive amount of data every minute but it cannot be transmitted via
existing communication network. Thus, raw data must be sampled to reduce the
size of the data over communication network and transmitted to the server for
further processing. On the other hand, the sampled data must be highly accurate
to ensure the safety of different agents in C-ITS. Thus, in this study, we
designed and developed a C-ITS architecture and data flow, including messages
and protocols for the safety monitoring system of CAVs, and determined the
optimal sampling interval for data transmission while considering the trade-off
between communication efficiency and reliability of safety performance
indicators. Three safety performance indicators were introduced: severe
deceleration, lateral position variance, and inverse time to collision. A field
test is conducted to collect data from various sensors installed in the CAV,
determining the optimal sampling interval. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is conducted
to ensure statistical consistency between sampled and raw datasets. The effects
of the sampling interval on message delay, data accuracy, and communication

with side-coupled geometry are computed and related to universal functions. The
computation relies on a real-space formulation of the numerical
renormalization-group (NRG) procedure. The real-space construction, dubbed
eNRG, is more straightforward than the NRG discretization and allows more
faithful description of the coupling between quantum dots and conduction
states. The procedure is applied to an Anderson-model description of a quantum
wire side-coupled to a single quantum dot. A gate potential controls the dot
occupation. In the Kondo regime, the electrical conductance through this device
is known to map linearly onto a universal function of the temperature scaled by
the Kondo temperature. Here, the energy moments from which the Seebeck
coefficient and the thermal conductance can be computed are shown to map
linearly onto universal functions also. The moments and transport properties
computed by the eNRG procedure are shown to agree very well with these
analytical developments. Algorithms facilitating comparison with experimental
results are discussed. As an illustration, one of the algorithms is applied to
thermal dependence of the thermopower measured by K\""{o}hler [PhD Thesis, TUD,

designed for simultaneous input and state estimation that provides
minimum-variance unbiased estimates, and these estimates are projected onto the
constrained space restricted by inequality constraints subsequently. We prove
that the estimation errors and their covariances from CARE are less than those
from unconstrained algorithms and confirm that this property can further reduce
the false negative rate in attack detection. We show that estimation errors of

or a Weinstein manifold. One can construct an ""action"" of $H^1(M,\mathbb{G}_m)$
on the Fukaya category (wrapped Fukaya category in the exact case) that
reflects the action of $Symp^0(M,\omega_M)$ on the set of Lagrangian branes. A
priori this action is only analytic. The purpose of this work is to show the
algebraicity of this action under some assumptions.
  We use this to prove a tameness result for the sheaf of Lagrangian Floer
homology groups obtained by moving one of the Lagrangians via global symplectic
isotopies. We also show the algebraicity of the locus of $z\in
H^1(M,\mathbb{G}_m)$ that fix a Lagrangian brane in the Fukaya category. The
latter has applications to Lagrangian flux. Finally, we prove a statement in
mirror symmetry: in the Weinstein case, assume that $M$ is mirror to an affine
or projective variety $X$, that there exists an exact Lagrangian torus
$L\subset M$ such that $H^1(M)\to H^1(L)$ is surjective, and that $L$ is sent
to a smooth point of $x\in X$ under the mirror equivalence. Then we construct a
Zariski chart of $X$ containing $x$, that is isomorphic to
$H^1(L,\mathbb{G}_m)$, and such that other points of this chart correspond to
non-exact deformations of $L$ (possibly equipped with unitary local systems).
In particular, this implies rationality of the irreducible component containing
$x$; however, it is stronger.
  Under our assumptions, one can construct an algebraic action of
$H^1(M,\mathbb{G}_m)$, namely the action by non-unitary local systems. By
combining techniques from family Floer homology and non-commutative geometry,
we prove that this action coincides with the geometric action mentioned in the
first paragraph. We use this to deduce the theorems above.

practical application are often generated by multiple factors, so the use of
tensors to represent the data containing the internal structure of multiple
factors came into being. However, different from the matrix case, constructing
reasonable sparse measure of tensor is a relatively difficult and very
important task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new tensor sparsity
measure called Tensor Full Feature Measure (FFM). It can simultaneously
describe the feature information of each dimension of the tensor and the
related features between two dimensions, and connect the Tucker rank with the
tensor tube rank. This measurement method can describe the sparse features of
the tensor more comprehensively. On this basis, we establish its non-convex
relaxation, and apply FFM to low rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor
robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). LRTC and TRPCA models based on FFM
are proposed, and two efficient Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM)
algorithms are developed to solve the proposed model. A variety of real

with prominent H$\alpha$ filaments and vertical extensions of the regular

in matching the vertical distribution of non-thermal radio emission, and the
vertical steepening of the associated spectral index, in a consistent

spin exceeding a sufficiently high threshold can be calculated using the
Generalised Pareto Distribution. This allows us to estimate the average number
of PBHs amongst which we can find a single PBH which formed with spin exceeding
a high threshold. We found that the primordial spin distribution gives rise to
exceedingly rare near-extremal spin PBHs at formation time: for typical
parameter values, roughly up to one in a hundred million PBHs would be formed
with spin exceeding the Thorne limit. We discuss conditions under which even
more extreme-spin PBHs may be produced, including modifying the skewness and
kurtosis of the spin distribution via a smooth transformation. We deduce from
our calculations that, if indeed asteroid-mass PBHs above the current
observational limit on evaporating PBHs of mass ~10^{17} g contribute
significantly to the dark matter, it is likely that some of them could be
near-extremal PBHs.

account the location and spectrum of the burst and the detector response, the
targeted coherent search is more powerful to unveil weak and sub-threshold

experiencing ion evaporation are simulated using an electrohydrodynamic model
with field-enhanced thermionic emission in steady state for an
axially-symmetric geometry. Solutions are explored as a function of the
external background field, meniscus dimension, hydraulic impedance and liquid
temperature. Statically stable solutions for emitting menisci are found to be
constrained to a set of conditions: a minimum hydraulic impedance, a maximum
current output, and a narrow range of background fields that maximizes at
menisci sizes of 0.5-3 microns in radius. Static stability is lost when the
electric field adjacent to the electrode that holds the meniscus corresponds to
an electric pressure that exceeds twice the surface tension stress of a sphere
of the same size as the meniscus. Preliminary investigations suggest this limit
to be universal, therefore independent of most ionic liquid properties,
reservoir pressure, hydraulic impedance or temperature and could explain the
experimentally observed bifurcation of a steady ion source into two or more
emission sites. Ohmic heating near the emission region increases the liquid
temperature, which is found to be important to accurately describe stability
boundaries. Temperature increase does not affect the current output when the
hydraulic impedance is constant. This phenomenon is thought to be due to an
improved interface charge relaxation enhanced by the higher electrical
conductivity. Dissipated Ohmic energy is mostly conducted to the electrode
wall. The higher thermal diffusivity of the wall versus the liquid, allows the
ion source to run in steady state without heating.

to the complex interaction between heterogeneous entities (e.g., visit,
disease, medication) in clinical data. With the availability of real-world
clinical data such as electronic health records and insurance claims, many deep
learning methods are proposed for complication risk profiling. However, these
existing methods face two open challenges. First, data heterogeneity relates to
those methods leveraging clinical data from a single view only while the data
can be considered from multiple views (e.g., sequence of clinical visits, set
of clinical features). Second, generalized prediction relates to most of those
methods focusing on single-task learning, whereas each complication onset is
predicted independently, leading to suboptimal models. We propose a multi-view
multi-task network (MuViTaNet) for predicting the onset of multiple
complications to tackle these issues. In particular, MuViTaNet complements
patient representation by using a multi-view encoder to effectively extract
information by considering clinical data as both sequences of clinical visits
and sets of clinical features. In addition, it leverages additional information
from both related labeled and unlabeled datasets to generate more generalized
representations by using a new multi-task learning scheme for making more
accurate predictions. The experimental results show that MuViTaNet outperforms
existing methods for profiling the development of cardiac complications in
breast cancer survivors. Furthermore, thanks to its multi-view multi-task
architecture, MuViTaNet also provides an effective mechanism for interpreting
its predictions in multiple perspectives, thereby helping clinicians discover
the underlying mechanism triggering the onset and for making better clinical

additional results and indicate directions for future research by making
explicit open questions and gaps in the literature. We also prove that a few
tree shape statistics that have been used to measure tree balance in the

indicate that their properties are not as useful for practical purposes.

self-interested players aim to optimize their local objectives that depend on
their own decisions and the decisions of others and are influenced by some

characterized by a list of excluded minors, but unlike graphs, this list may
need to be infinite in general. However, for each fixed finite field $\mathbb
F$, the list needs to contain only finitely many $\mathbb F$-representable
matroids, due to the well-quasi-ordering of $\mathbb F$-representable matroids
of bounded branch-width under taking matroid minors [J. F. Geelen, A. M. H.
Gerards, and G. Whittle (2002)]. But this proof is non-constructive and does
not provide any algorithm for computing these $\mathbb F$-representable

  We consider the class of matroids of path-width at most $k$ for fixed $k$. We
prove that for a finite field $\mathbb F$, every $\mathbb F$-representable
excluded minor for the class of matroids of path-width at most $k$ has at most
$2^{|\mathbb{F}|^{O(k^2)}}$ elements. We can therefore compute, for any integer

a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for checking whether the path-width of

excluded pivot-minor for the class of graphs having linear rank-width at most
$k$ has at most $2^{2^{O(k^2)}}$ vertices, which also results in a similar

matrices of noise are learned to filter out the noise of the IMU raw data.
Second, the refined pitch and roll are adopted to retrieve a gravity-aligned
BEV image of each frame using differentiable camera projection. Finally, a
differentiable pose estimator is utilized to estimate the remaining 3 DoF poses
between the BEV frames: leading to a 5 DoF pose estimation. Our method allows
for learning the covariance matrices end-to-end supervised by the pose

statistical predictions of large-eddy simulations (LES). The
ensemble-variational (EnVar) approach aims to minimize a cost function that is
defined as the discrepancy between LES predictions and reference statistics
from experiments or, in the present demonstration, independent direct numerical
simulations (DNS). This methodology is applied to adjust the Smagorinsky
subgrid model and obtain data assimilated LES (DA-LES) which accurately
estimate the statistics of turbulent channel flow. To separately control the
mean and fluctuations of the modeled subgrid tensor, and ultimately the first-
and second-order flow statistics, two types of model corrections are
considered. The first one optimizes the wall-normal profile of the Smagorinsky
coefficient, while the second one introduces an adjustable steady forcing in
the momentum equations to independently act on the mean flow. Using these two
elements, the data assimilation procedure can satisfactorily modify the subgrid
model and accurately recover reference flow statistics. The retrieved subgrid
model significantly outperforms more elaborate baseline models such as dynamic
and mixed models, in a posteriori testing. The robustness of the present data
assimilation methodology is assessed by changing the Reynolds number and
considering grid resolutions that are away from usual recommendations. Taking
advantage of the stochastic formulation of EnVar, the developed framework also
provides the uncertainty of the retrieved model.

extracting more discriminative view-level features and effectively aggregating
the multi-view images of a 3D model, but the latent relationship among these
multi-view images is not fully explored. Thus, we tackle this problem from the
perspective of exploiting the relationships between patch features to capture
long-range associations among multi-view images. To capture associations among
views, in this work, we propose a novel patch convolutional neural network
(PCNN) for view-based 3D model retrieval. Specifically, we first employ a CNN
to extract patch features of each view image separately. Secondly, a novel
neural network module named PatchConv is designed to exploit intrinsic
relationships between neighboring patches in the feature space to capture
long-range associations among multi-view images. Then, an adaptive weighted
view layer is further embedded into PCNN to automatically assign a weight to
each view according to the similarity between each view feature and the
view-pooling feature. Finally, a discrimination loss function is employed to
extract the discriminative 3D model feature, which consists of softmax loss
values generated by the fusion lassifier and the specific classifier. Extensive

$G$ and bulk $K$ moduli being orders of magnitude smaller than those of
glasses. Third, many low-frequency vibrational modes are excited, which form a
characteristic plateau with the onset frequency $\omega_\ast$ in the
vibrational density of states. Structural, mechanical, and vibrational

fills in slot locations with the proper items using a sufficient attention
mechanism. Our approach combines the strengths of both classical slot filling

build a deep neural network that recognizes multiple vision-threatening
diseases for the given case. As the diagnostic efficacy of CFP and OCT is
disease-dependent, the network's ability of being both selective and
interpretable is important. Moreover, as both data acquisition and manual
labeling are extremely expensive in the medical domain, the network has to be
relatively lightweight for learning from a limited set of labeled multi-modal
samples. Prior art on retinal disease recognition focuses either on a single
disease or on a single modality, leaving multi-modal fusion largely
underexplored. We propose in this paper Multi-Modal Multi-Instance Learning
(MM-MIL) for selectively fusing CFP and OCT modalities. Its lightweight
architecture (as compared to current multi-head attention modules) makes it
suited for learning from relatively small-sized datasets. For an effective use
of MM-MIL, we propose to generate a pseudo sequence of CFPs by over sampling a
given CFP. The benefits of this tactic include well balancing instances across
modalities, increasing the resolution of the CFP input, and finding out regions
of the CFP most relevant with respect to the final diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 1,206 multi-modal cases from
1,193 eyes of 836 subjects demonstrate the viability of the proposed model.

during hydraulic fracturing of shale gas production. Generally, in order to
accurately simulate the large-scale (field-scale) proppant transport process,
constructing a fast and accurate sub-scale proppant settling model, or
surrogate model, becomes a critical issue, since mapping between physical
parameters and proppant settling velocity is complex. Previously, particle
settling has usually been investigated via high-fidelity experiments and
meso-scale numerical simulations, both of which are time-consuming. In this
work, a new method is proposed and utilized, i.e., the multi-fidelity neural
network (MFNN), to construct a settling surrogate model, which could utilize
both high-fidelity and low-fidelity (thus, less expensive) data. The results
demonstrate that constructing the settling surrogate with the MFNN can reduce
the need for high-fidelity data and thus computational cost by 80%, while the
accuracy lost is less than 5% compared to a high-fidelity surrogate. Moreover,
the investigated particle settling surrogate is applied in macro-scale proppant
transport simulation, which shows that the settling model is significant to
proppant transport and yields accurate results. This opens novel pathways for
rapidly predicting proppant settling velocity in reservoir applications.

problem with partial observation, in which the coefficients depend in a
non-linear way not only on the state process $X_t$ and its control $u_t$ but
also on the conditional law $E[X_t|\mathcal{F}_t^Y]$ of the state process
conditioned with respect to the past of observation process $Y$. We first
deduce the well-posedness of the controlled system by showing weak existence
and uniqueness in law. Neither supposing convexity of the control state space
nor differentiability of the coefficients with respect to the control variable,
we study Peng's stochastic maximum principle for our control problem. The
novelty and the difficulty of our work stem from the fact that, given an
admissible control $u$, the solution of the associated control problem is only
a weak one. This has as consequence that also the probability measure in the
solution $P^{u}=L^{u}_TQ$ depends on $u$ and has a density $L^{u}_T$ with
respect to a reference measure $Q$. So characterizing an optimal control leads
to the differentiation of non-linear functions
$f(P^{u}\circ\{E^{P^{u}}[X_t|\mathcal{F}_t^Y]\}^{-1})$ with respect to
$(L^{u}_T,X_t)$. This has as consequence for the study of Peng's maximum
principle that we get a new type of first and second order variational
equations and adjoint backward stochastic differential equations, all with new
mean-field terms and with coefficients which are not Lipschitz. For their
estimates and for those for the Taylor expansion new techniques have had to be
introduced and rather technical results have had to be established. The
necessary optimality condition we get extends Peng's one with new, non-trivial

that, similar to a system without energy constraints, the transmitter buffer

respiratory failure with in-hospital mortality of 35-46%. High mortality is
thought to be related in part to challenges in making a prompt diagnosis, which
may in turn delay implementation of evidence-based therapies. A deep neural
network (DNN) algorithm utilizing unbiased ventilator waveform data (VWD) may
help to improve screening for ARDS. We first show that a convolutional neural
network-based ARDS detection model can outperform prior work with random forest
models in AUC (0.95+/-0.019 vs. 0.88+/-0.064), accuracy (0.84+/-0.026 vs
0.80+/-0.078), and specificity (0.81+/-0.06 vs 0.71+/-0.089). Frequency
ablation studies imply that our model can learn features from low frequency
domains typically used for expert feature engineering, and high-frequency
information that may be difficult to manually featurize. Further experiments
suggest that subtle, high-frequency components of physiologic signals may
explain the superior performance of DL models over traditional ML when using
physiologic waveform data. Our observations may enable improved
interpretability of DL-based physiologic models and may improve the
understanding of how high-frequency information in physiologic data impacts the

of IrO$_2$ at different temperatures employing high resolution photoemission
spectroscopy with photon energies spanning from ultraviolet to hard $x$-ray

covalency in the bulk compared to the surface electronic structure. The
branching ratio of the spin-orbit split Ir core level peaks is found to be
larger than its atomic values and it enhances further in the bulk electronic
structure. Such deviation from the atomic description of the core level
spectroscopy manifests the enhancement of the orbital moment due to the solid
state effects. The valence band spectra could be captured well within the
density functional theory. The photon energy dependence of the features in the
valence band spectra and their comparison with the calculated results show
dominant Ir 5$d$ character of the features near the Fermi level; O 2$p$ peaks
appear at higher binding energies. Interestingly, the O 2$p$ contributions of
the feature at the Fermi level is significant and it enhances at low

holding prognostic information are often challenging to interpret, have
difficulties generalizing across data acquisitions, or are only applicable to
pre-operative MR data. In this paper we aim to address these issues by
introducing novel imaging features that can be automatically computed from MR
images and fed into machine learning models to predict patient survival. The
features we propose have a direct biological interpretation: They measure the
deformation caused by the tumor on the surrounding brain structures, comparing
the shape of various structures in the patient's brain to their expected shape
in healthy individuals. To obtain the required segmentations, we use an
automatic method that is contrast-adaptive and robust to missing modalities,
making the features generalizable across scanners and imaging protocols. Since
the features we propose do not depend on characteristics of the tumor region
itself, they are also applicable to post-operative images, which have been much
less studied in the context of survival prediction. Using experiments involving
both pre- and post-operative data, we show that the proposed features carry
prognostic value in terms of overall- and progression-free survival, over and

shows that binarization causes a great loss of information in the forward and
backward propagation. We present a novel Distribution-sensitive Information
Retention Network (DIR-Net) that retains the information in the forward and
backward propagation by improving internal propagation and introducing external
representations. The DIR-Net mainly relies on three technical contributions:
(1) Information Maximized Binarization (IMB): minimizing the information loss
and the binarization error of weights/activations simultaneously by weight
balance and standardization; (2) Distribution-sensitive Two-stage Estimator
(DTE): retaining the information of gradients by distribution-sensitive soft
approximation by jointly considering the updating capability and accurate
gradient; (3) Representation-align Binarization-aware Distillation (RBD):
retaining the representation information by distilling the representations
between full-precision and binarized networks. The DIR-Net investigates both
forward and backward processes of BNNs from the unified information
perspective, thereby providing new insight into the mechanism of network
binarization. The three techniques in our DIR-Net are versatile and effective
and can be applied in various structures to improve BNNs. Comprehensive

our DIR-Net consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art binarization

becoming more accurate and faster. However, it is still challenging to design
reasonable network structures that aim at obtaining the best accuracy under a
limited computational budget. In this paper, we propose a Tree block, named
after its appearance, which extends the One-Shot Aggregation (OSA) module while
being more lightweight and flexible. Specifically, the Tree block replaces each
of the $3\times3$ Conv layers in OSA into a stack of shallow residual block
(SRB) and $1\times1$ Conv layer. The $1\times1$ Conv layer is responsible for
dimension increasing and the SRB is fed into the next step. By doing this, when
aggregating the same number of subsequent feature maps, the Tree block has a
deeper network structure while having less model complexity. In addition,
residual connection and efficient channel attention(ECA) is added to the Tree
block to further improve the performance of the network. Based on the Tree
block, we build efficient backbone models calling TreeNets. TreeNet has a
similar network architecture to ResNet, making it flexible to replace ResNet in
various computer vision frameworks. We comprehensively evaluate TreeNet on
common-used benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for classification, MS COCO for
object detection, and instance segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate
that TreeNet is more efficient and performs favorably against the current
state-of-the-art backbone methods.

  Multi-Robot Systems",,,,,"cs.RO cs.LG cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robustness is key to engineering, automation, and science as a whole.
However, the property of robustness is often underpinned by costly requirements
such as over-provisioning, known uncertainty and predictive models, and known
adversaries. These conditions are idealistic, and often not satisfiable.
Resilience on the other hand is the capability to endure unexpected
disruptions, to recover swiftly from negative events, and bounce back to
normality. In this survey article, we analyze how resilience is achieved in
networks of agents and multi-robot systems that are able to overcome adversity
by leveraging system-wide complementarity, diversity, and redundancy - often
involving a reconfiguration of robotic capabilities to provide some key ability
that was not present in the system a priori. As society increasingly depends on
connected automated systems to provide key infrastructure services (e.g.,
logistics, transport, and precision agriculture), providing the means to
achieving resilient multi-robot systems is paramount. By enumerating the
consequences of a system that is not resilient (fragile), we argue that
resilience must become a central engineering design consideration. Towards this
goal, the community needs to gain clarity on how it is defined, measured, and
maintained. We address these questions across foundational robotics domains,
spanning perception, control, planning, and learning. One of our key
contributions is a formal taxonomy of approaches, which also helps us discuss
the defining factors and stressors for a resilient system. Finally, this survey
article gives insight as to how resilience may be achieved. Importantly, we
highlight open problems that remain to be tackled in order to reap the benefits
of resilient robotic systems.

different scales by the stress transferred at the matrix-fibre interfaces and
at any surface where material discontinuity occurs. In particular, the
mechanical response of elastomeric composites where the reinforcement is
composed by cords with helically wound fibres is heavily compromised by fatigue
and delamination phenomena occurring at cord-rubber as well as at the ply
interfaces, since rubber and polymeric matrices are mainly vulnerable to the
accumulation of deviatoric energy due to the shear stresses transferred across
the surfaces. Despite the large diffusion of composites in a vast field of
applications and the mature knowledge of their behaviour, some key mechanical
aspects underlying failure mechanisms are still partially unclear. For example,
stress amplification and strain localization are often difficult to predict by
means of analytical solutions and averaging techniques that usually conceal
stress gradients. In this work, we analyse coupling between torsional and
tensile loads in twisted cords, which are adopted in many cases to reinforce
composites and rubbers in tire applications. We provide a model characterized
by an enriched cord-matrix mechanical interplay able to theoretically explain
and predict actual stress distributions responsible for the onset of
delamination and fatigue-guided phenomena that are experimentally observed in
these composites. In particular, we demonstrate that the assumption of a
monoclinic/trigonal behaviour for the mechanical response of the hierarchical
strands allows to estimate, by means of analytical formulas and a
homogenization approach, hitherto neglected shear stresses at the
matrix-reinforcement interface. These stresses are transferred to the
neighbouring regions, leading to post-elastic behaviour and failure events.

nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations for
nebular-phase Type Ibc SNe starting from state-of-the-art explosion models with
detailed nucleosynthesis. Our grid of progenitor models is derived from He
stars that were subsequently evolved under the influence of wind mass loss.
These He stars, which most likely form through binary mass exchange, synthesize
less oxygen than their single-star counterparts with the same zero-age main
sequence (ZAMS) mass. This reduction is greater in He-star models evolved with
an enhanced mass loss rate. We obtain a wide range of spectral properties at
200d. In models from He stars with an initial mass >6Msun, the [OI] 6300, 6364
is of comparable or greater strength than [CaII] 7291,7323 -- the strength of
[OI] 6300, 6364 increases with He-star initial mass. In contrast, models from
lower mass He stars exhibit a weak [OI] 6300, 6364, strong [CaII] 7291,7323,
but also strong NII lines and FeII emission below 5500A. The ejecta density,
modulated by the ejecta mass, the explosion energy, and clumping, has a
critical impact on the gas ionization, line cooling, and the spectral
properties. FeII dominates the emission below 5500A and is stronger at earlier
nebular epochs. It ebbs as the SN ages, while the fractional flux in [OI] 6300,
6364 and [CaII] 7291,7323 increases, with a similar rate, as the ejecta
recombine. Although the results depend on the adopted wind mass loss rate and
pre-SN mass, we find that He stars of 6-8Msun initially (ZAMS mass of
23-28Msun) match adequately the properties of standard SNe Ibc. Our results for
less massive He stars are more perplexing, since the predicted spectra are not
seen in nature. They may be missed by current surveys or associated with Type
Ibn SNe in which interaction dominates over decay power. [Abridged]

with the principles of the renormalization group. In addition to the original
multi-scale-setting approach (PMCm), two variations of the PMC have been
proposed to deal with ambiguities associated with the uncalculated higher order
terms in the pQCD series, i.e. the single-scale-setting approach (PMCs) and the
procedures based on ``intrinsic conformality"" (PMC$_\infty$). In this paper, we
will give a detailed comparison of these PMC approaches by comparing their

determines an overall effective running coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$ by the recursive
use of the renormalization group equation, whose argument $Q$ represents the
actual momentum flow of the process. Our numerical results show that the PMCs
method, which involves a somewhat simpler analysis, can serve as a reliable
substitute for the full multi-scale PMCm method, and that it leads to more
precise pQCD predictions with small residual scale dependence.

structure. At low outflow velocities (< 50 km/s) the angular momentum
distribution is similar to the disk and the gas is in a fountain flow. Gas at
high outflow velocities (> 200 km/s), penetrating deep into the halo, has close
to zero angular momentum, and originates from the centre of the galaxies. As
the mass loading factors of the cosmic ray driven outflows are of order unity
and higher, we conclude that this process is important for the removal of low
angular momentum gas from evolving disk galaxies and the transport of,
potentially metal enriched, material from galactic centres far into the
galactic haloes.

  predictors using multivariable Mendelian randomization",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  When genetic variants in a gene cluster are associated with a disease
outcome, the causal pathway from the variants to the outcome can be difficult
to disentangle. For example, the chemokine receptor gene cluster contains
genetic variants associated with various cytokines. Associations between
variants in this cluster and stroke risk may be driven by any of these
cytokines. Multivariable Mendelian randomization is an extension of standard
univariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the direct effects of related
exposures with shared genetic predictors. However, when genetic variants are
clustered, a Goldilocks dilemma arises: including too many highly-correlated
variants in the analysis can lead to ill-conditioning, but pruning variants too
aggressively can lead to imprecise estimates or even lack of identification. We
propose multivariable methods that use principal component analysis to reduce
many correlated genetic variants into a smaller number of orthogonal components
that are used as instrumental variables. We show in simulations that these
methods result in more precise estimates that are less sensitive to numerical
instability due to both strong correlations and small changes in the input
data. We apply the methods to demonstrate the most likely causal risk factor
for stroke at the chemokine gene cluster is monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.

neuroscience. However, due to the image degradation during the imaging process,
the large variety of mitochondrial structures, as well as the presence of

contrastive learning framework to learn a better feature representation from
hard examples to improve segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a point sampling
strategy to pick out representative pixels from hard examples in the training
phase. Based on these sampled pixels, we introduce a pixel-wise label-based
contrastive loss which consists of a similarity loss term and a consistency
loss term. The similarity term can increase the similarity of pixels from the
same class and the separability of pixels from different classes in feature
space, while the consistency term is able to enhance the sensitivity of the 3D
model to changes in image content from frame to frame. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on MitoEM dataset as well as FIB-SEM dataset and
show better or on par with state-of-the-art results.

during the years 2017-2021 which is attributed to another episode of dust
formation similar to the one reported during the likely periastron passage at

The source reaches a lower emission state in June 2020 (close to the recent

in the colliding wind region by the WC stellar wind close to the periastron in
an eccentric orbit. The time interval between the previous and latest X-ray low

$G\leq10.5$, falling to $\lesssim 50\%$ for $G\leq12$. (2) There are probably a

hosts (which dominate the Kepler sample). (4) To obtain a magnitude-limited
sample of HJs that is larger than the Kepler sample by an order of magnitude,
the limiting magnitude should be approximately $G\approx12.5$. This magnitude

with small inter-class variances, has been significantly advanced in recent
years. However, ultra-fine-grained visual categorization (ultra-FGVC), which
targets at identifying subclasses with extremely similar patterns, has not
received much attention. In ultra-FGVC datasets, the samples per category are
always scarce as the granularity moves down, which will lead to overfitting
problems. Moreover, the difference among different categories is too subtle to
distinguish even for professional experts. Motivated by these issues, this
paper proposes a novel compositional feature embedding and similarity metric
(CECS). Specifically, in the compositional feature embedding module, we
randomly select patches in the original input image, and these patches are then
replaced by patches from the images of different categories or masked out. Then
the replaced and masked images are used to augment the original input images,
which can provide more diverse samples and thus largely alleviate overfitting
problem resulted from limited training samples. Besides, learning with diverse
samples forces the model to learn not only the most discriminative features but
also other informative features in remaining regions, enhancing the
generalization and robustness of the model. In the compositional similarity
metric module, a new similarity metric is developed to improve the
classification performance by narrowing the intra-category distance and
enlarging the inter-category distance. Experimental results on two ultra-FGVC
datasets and one FGVC dataset with recent benchmark methods consistently
demonstrate that the proposed CECS method achieves the state of-the-art
performance.

  Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2021)",,,,"cs.CG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of coordinated motion planning for a swarm of simple,
identical robots: From a given start grid configuration of robots, we need to
reach a desired target configuration via a sequence of parallel, continuous,
collision-free robot motions, such that the set of robots induces a connected
grid graph at all integer times. The objective is to minimize the makespan of
the motion schedule, i.e., to reach the new configuration in a minimum amount
of time. We show that this problem is NP-hard, even for deciding whether a
makespan of 2 can be achieved, while it is possible to check in polynomial time
whether a makespan of 1 can be achieved. On the algorithmic side, we establish
simultaneous constant-factor approximation for two fundamental parameters, by
achieving constant stretch for constant scale. Scaled shapes (which arise by
increasing all dimensions of a given object by the same multiplicative factor)
have been considered in previous seminal work on self-assembly, often with
unbounded or logarithmic scale factors; we provide methods for a generalized
scale factor, bounded by a constant. Moreover, our algorithm achieves a
constant stretch factor: If mapping the start configuration to the target
configuration requires a maximum Manhattan distance of $d$, then the total
duration of our overall schedule is $O(d)$, which is optimal up to constant
factors.

  Deformation Field Integration and Non-Rigid Feature Fusion","15 pages. Accepted by IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Registration of brain MRI images requires to solve a deformation field, which
is extremely difficult in aligning intricate brain tissues, e.g., subcortical
nuclei, etc. Existing efforts resort to decomposing the target deformation
field into intermediate sub-fields with either tiny motions, i.e., progressive
registration stage by stage, or lower resolutions, i.e., coarse-to-fine
estimation of the full-size deformation field. In this paper, we argue that
those efforts are not mutually exclusive, and propose a unified framework for
robust brain MRI registration in both progressive and coarse-to-fine manners
simultaneously. Specifically, building on a dual-encoder U-Net, the
fixed-moving MRI pair is encoded and decoded into multi-scale deformation
sub-fields from coarse to fine. Each decoding block contains two proposed novel
modules: i) in Deformation Field Integration (DFI), a single integrated
sub-field is calculated, warping by which is equivalent to warping
progressively by sub-fields from all previous decoding blocks, and ii) in
Non-rigid Feature Fusion (NFF), features of the fixed-moving pair are aligned
by DFI-integrated sub-field, and then fused to predict a finer sub-field.
Leveraging both DFI and NFF, the target deformation field is factorized into
multi-scale sub-fields, where the coarser fields alleviate the estimate of a
finer one and the finer field learns to make up those misalignments insolvable
by previous coarser ones. The extensive and comprehensive experimental results
on both private and public datasets demonstrate a superior registration
performance of brain MRI images over progressive registration only and
coarse-to-fine estimation only, with an increase by at most 8% in the average
Dice.

commit, fail a regressioninducing commit, and pass a working commit. In this
work, we address the challenges of (1) identifying potential regression-fixing
commits from the code evolution history, (2) migrating the test and its code
dependencies over the history, and (3) minimizing the compilation overhead
during the regression search. We build our tool, RegMiner, which harvested 537

  representation of the deformation map",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CE cs.GR cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work proposes a model-reduction approach for the material point method
on nonlinear manifolds. Our technique approximates the $\textit{kinematics}$ by
approximating the deformation map using an implicit neural representation that
restricts deformation trajectories to reside on a low-dimensional manifold. By
explicitly approximating the deformation map, its spatiotemporal gradients --
in particular the deformation gradient and the velocity -- can be computed via
analytical differentiation. In contrast to typical model-reduction techniques
that construct a linear or nonlinear manifold to approximate the (finite number
of) degrees of freedom characterizing a given spatial discretization, the use
of an implicit neural representation enables the proposed method to approximate
the $\textit{continuous}$ deformation map. This allows the kinematic
approximation to remain agnostic to the discretization. Consequently, the
technique supports dynamic discretizations -- including resolution changes --
during the course of the online reduced-order-model simulation.
  To generate $\textit{dynamics}$ for the generalized coordinates, we propose a
family of projection techniques. At each time step, these techniques: (1)
Calculate full-space kinematics at quadrature points, (2) Calculate the
full-space dynamics for a subset of `sample' material points, and (3) Calculate
the reduced-space dynamics by projecting the updated full-space position and
velocity onto the low-dimensional manifold and tangent space, respectively. We
achieve significant computational speedup via hyper-reduction that ensures all
three steps execute on only a small subset of the problem's spatial domain.
Large-scale numerical examples with millions of material points illustrate the
method's ability to gain an order of magnitude computational-cost saving --
indeed $\textit{real-time simulations}$ -- with negligible errors.

multiple, fully-labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. However,
in many applications, relevant labeled source datasets may not be available,
and collecting source labels can be as expensive as labeling the target data
itself. In this paper, we investigate Multi-source Few-shot Domain Adaptation
(MFDA): a new domain adaptation scenario with limited multi-source labels and
unlabeled target data. As we show, existing methods often fail to learn
discriminative features for both source and target domains in the MFDA setting.
Therefore, we propose a novel framework, termed Multi-Source Few-shot
Adaptation Network (MSFAN), which can be trained end-to-end in a
non-adversarial manner. MSFAN operates by first using a type of prototypical,
multi-domain, self-supervised learning to learn features that are not only
domain-invariant but also class-discriminative. Second, MSFAN uses a small,
labeled support set to enforce feature consistency and domain invariance across
domains. Finally, prototypes from multiple sources are leveraged to learn
better classifiers. Compared with state-of-the-art MDA methods, MSFAN improves
the mean classification accuracy over different domain pairs on MFDA by 20.2%,
9.4%, and 16.2% on Office, Office-Home, and DomainNet, respectively.

by nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds to chart the non-local deformation
of fixed HeLa cells induced by AFM indentation, providing data for studying
cell mechanics without requiring detailed knowledge about the local contact.
The competition between the elasticity and capillarity on the cells is
observed. We show that the apparent elastic moduli of the cells would have been
overestimated if the capillarity is not considered (as in most previous studies
using local depth-loading data). We also find reduction of both elastic moduli

nanodiamond sensing of non-local deformation with nanometer precision is
particularly suitable for studying mechanics of cells.

as the world tends to be more and more digitalized. Classical cryptographic
protocols mainly depend on the mathematical complicacy of encoding functions
and the shared key, like RSA protocol in which security depends upon the fact
that factoring a big number is a hard problem to the current computers. This
means that high computing power can help you crack traditional encryption
methods. Quantum machines claim to have this kind of power in many instances.
Factorization of big numbers may be possible with Shor's algorithm with quantum
machines in considerable time. Apart from this, the main problem is key sharing
i.e., how to securely share the key the first time to validate the encryption.
Here comes quantum key distribution. Two parties who are interested in
communication with each other, create a process, which claims considerable
security against an eavesdropper, by encoding and decoding information in
quantum states to construct and share a secret key. Quantum key distribution
may be done in a variety of ways. This paper begins with experimental
verification of the BB84 procedure utilizing four bases (using phase gates)
followed by the experimental realization of the SARG04 protocol which was
derived from BB84 Protocol to overcome PNS attack. The possibility of a
third-party attack and the effect of noise is considered and implemented. The
IBM Quantum Experience platform was used for all of the implementations.

memes has emerged as a powerful means to convey political, psychological, and
socio-cultural opinions. Although memes are typically humorous in nature,
recent days have witnessed a proliferation of harmful memes targeted to abuse
various social entities. As most harmful memes are highly satirical and
abstruse without appropriate contexts, off-the-shelf multimodal models may not
be adequate to understand their underlying semantics. In this work, we propose
two novel problem formulations: detecting harmful memes and the social entities
that these harmful memes target. To this end, we present HarMeme, the first
benchmark dataset, containing 3,544 memes related to COVID-19. Each meme went
through a rigorous two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, we labeled
a meme as very harmful, partially harmful, or harmless; in the second stage, we
further annotated the type of target(s) that each harmful meme points to:
individual, organization, community, or society/general public/other. The
evaluation results using ten unimodal and multimodal models highlight the
importance of using multimodal signals for both tasks. We further discuss the
limitations of these models and we argue that more research is needed to
address these problems.

future. Humans encounter uncertainty in different kinds of activity, from
sensory-motor control to dynamics in financial markets, what has been subject
of extensive studies. Representation of uncertainty with normal or lognormal
distribution is a common feature of many of those studies. For example,
proposed Bayessian integration of Gaussian multisensory input in the brain or
log-normal distribution of future asset price in renowned Black-Scholes-Merton
(BSM) model for pricing contingent claims.
  Standard deviation of log(future asset price) scaled by square root of time
in the BSM model is called implied volatility. Actually, log(future asset
price) is not normally distributed and traders account for that to avoid
losses. Nevertheless the BSM formula derived under the assumption of constant
volatility remains a major uniform framework for pricing options in financial
markets. I propose that one of the reasons for such a high popularity of the
BSM formula could be its ability to translate uncertainty measured with implied
volatility into price in a way that is compatible with human intuition for
measuring uncertainty.
  The present study deals with mathematical relationship between uncertainty
and the BSM implied volatility. Examples for a number of common probability
distributions are presented. Overall, this work proposes that representation of
various probability distributions in terms of the BSM implied volatility
profile may be meaningful in both biological and financial worlds. Necessary
background from financial mathematics is provided in the text.

prohibitively large and practitioners often resort to methods such as
distillation for serving. In this work, we investigate routing strategies at
different granularity (token, sentence, task) in MoE models to bypass
distillation. Experiments on WMT and a web-scale dataset suggest that
task-level routing (task-MoE) enables us to extract smaller, ready-to-deploy
sub-networks from large sparse models. On WMT, our task-MoE with 32 experts
(533M parameters) outperforms the best performing token-level MoE model
(token-MoE) by +1.0 BLEU on average across 30 language pairs. The peak
inference throughput is also improved by a factor of 1.9x when we route by
tasks instead of tokens. While distilling a token-MoE to a smaller dense model
preserves only 32% of the BLEU gains, our sub-network task-MoE, by design,
preserves all the gains with the same inference cost as the distilled student
model. Finally, when scaling up to 200 language pairs, our 128-expert task-MoE
(13B parameters) performs competitively with a token-level counterpart, while
improving the peak inference throughput by a factor of 2.6x.

impacts of climate change. Reducing carbon emissions could help prevent the
world from reaching a tipping point, where runaway emissions are likely.
Runaway emissions could lead to extremes in weather conditions around the world
-- especially in problematic regions unable to cope with these conditions.
However, the movement to a low-carbon energy supply can not happen
instantaneously due to the existing fossil-fuel infrastructure and the
requirement to maintain a reliable energy supply. Therefore, a low-carbon
transition is required, however, the decisions various stakeholders should make
over the coming decades to reduce these carbon emissions are not obvious. This
is due to many long-term uncertainties, such as electricity, fuel and
generation costs, human behaviour and the size of electricity demand. A well
choreographed low-carbon transition is, therefore, required between all of the
heterogenous actors in the system, as opposed to changing the behaviour of a
single, centralised actor. The objective of this thesis is to create a novel,
open-source agent-based model to better understand the manner in which the
whole electricity market reacts to different factors using state-of-the-art
machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. In contrast to other
works, this thesis looks at both the long-term and short-term impact that
different behaviours have on the electricity market by using these
state-of-the-art methods.
