Ahn","A Dynamic, Hierarchical Resource Model for Converged Computing","11 pages, four figures, five tables",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extreme dynamic heterogeneity in high performance computing systems and the
convergence of traditional HPC with new simulation, analysis, and data science
approaches impose increasingly more complex requirements on resource and job
management software (RJMS). However, there is a paucity of RJMS techniques that
can solve key technical challenges associated with those new requirements,
particularly when they are coupled. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic
and multi-level resource model approach to address three key well-known
challenges individually and in combination: i.e., 1) RJMS dynamism to
facilitate job and workflow adaptability, 2) integration of specialized
external resources (e.g. user-centric cloud bursting), and 3) scheduling cloud
orchestration framework tasks. The core idea is to combine a dynamic directed
graph resource model with fully hierarchical scheduling to provide a unified
solution to all three key challenges. Our empirical and analytical evaluations
of the solution using our prototype extension to Fluxion, a production
hierarchical graph-based scheduler, suggest that our unified solution can
significantly improve flexibility, performance and scalability across all three
problems in comparison to limited traditional approaches.

particularly Saturn and Jupiter, have been explored both through remote and
in-situ observations. Interpreting these observations often necessitates
simultaneous knowledge of the solar-wind conditions impinging on the
magnetosphere. Without an available upstream monitor, solar-wind context is
typically provided using models initiated with either the output of
magnetogram-constrained coronal models or, more commonly, in-situ observations
from 1 AU. While 1-AU observations provide a direct measure of solar wind
conditions, they are single-point observations and thus require interpolation
to provide inputs to outer-heliosphere solar-wind models. In this study we test
the different interpolation methods using synthetic 1-AU observations of
time-evolving solar-wind structure. The simplest method is ""corotation"", which
assumes solar-wind structure is steady state and rotates with the Sun. This
method of reconstruction produces discontinuities in the solar-wind inputs as
new observations become available. This can be reduced by corotating both back
and forward in time, but this still introduces large errors in the magnitude
and timing of solar wind streams. We show how the dynamic time warping (DTW)
algorithm can provide around an order-of-magnitude improvement in solar-wind
inputs to outer-heliosphere model from in-situ observations near 1 AU. This is
intended to build the foundation for further work demonstrating and validating
methods to improve inner-boundary conditions to outer-heliosphere solar-wind
models, including dealing with solar wind transients and quantifying the
improvements at Saturn and Jupiter.

it is of paramount importance to learn a policy that maximizes the reward while
avoiding potentially dangerous actions when there is uncertainty. There are two
main challenges usually associated with this problem. Firstly, learning through
online exploration is not possible due to the critical nature of such
applications. Therefore, we need to resort to observational datasets with no
counterfactuals. Secondly, such datasets are usually imperfect, additionally
cursed with missing values in the attributes of features. In this paper, we
consider the problem of constructing personalized policies using logged data

degraded version of $\Xb$ with missing values, is observed. We consider three
strategies for dealing with missingness. In particular, we introduce the
\textit{conservative strategy} where the policy is designed to safely handle
the uncertainty due to missingness. In order to implement this strategy we need
to estimate posterior distribution $p(\Xb|\Xt)$, we use variational autoencoder
to achieve this. In particular, our method is based on partial variational
autoencoders (PVAE) which are designed to capture the underlying structure of

their generalization to noise-free test sets. In this paper, we propose a
robust training strategy against label noise, called RAFNI, that can be used
with any CNN. This algorithm filters and relabels instances of the training set
based on the predictions and their probabilities made by the backbone neural
network during the training process. That way, this algorithm improves the
generalization ability of the CNN on its own. RAFNI consists of three
mechanisms: two mechanisms that filter instances and one mechanism that
relabels instances. In addition, it does not suppose that the noise rate is
known nor does it need to be estimated. We evaluated our algorithm using
different data sets of several sizes and characteristics. We also compared it

yielded 815 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), one Centaur and one Oort cloud

methodology that builds upon our previous search carried out on the first four
years of data. Here, all DES images were reprocessed with an improved detection
pipeline that leads to an average completeness gain of 0.47 mag per exposure,
as well as an improved transient catalog production and optimized algorithms
for linkage of detections into orbits. All objects were verified by visual
inspection and by computing the sub-threshold significance, the total
signal-to-noise ratio in the stack of images in which the object's presence is
indicated by the orbit fit, but no detection was reported. This yields a highly
pure catalog of TNOs complete to $r \approx 23.8$ mag and distances $29<d<2500$
au. The Y6 TNOs have minimum (median) of 7 (12) distinct nights' detections and
arcs of 1.1 (4.2) years, and will have $grizY$ magnitudes available in a
further publication. We present software for simulating our observational
biases that enable comparisons of population models to our detections. Initial
inferences demonstrating the statistical power of the DES catalog are: the data
are inconsistent with the CFEPS-L7 model for the classical Kuiper Belt; the 16
``extreme'' TNOs ($a>150$ au, $q>30$ au) are consistent with the null
hypothesis of azimuthal isotropy; and non-resonant TNOs with $q>38$ au, $a>50$

parameters of the theory. However, in a certain parameter regime, their defect
profiles are precisely obtained by standard theories. These are the models
relatives. Besides that, we investigate the $\beta-$Starobinsky potential in
the perspective of topological defects; and we have shown that it can support
kinklike solutions, for both canonical and non-canonical kinetics. As a result,
we propose two new kinds of generalizations on the $\beta-$Starobinsky model,
by considering the DBI approach. Finally, we explore the main characteristics

emplaced in short-period orbits. If it commonly operates, one would expect to
catch proto-Hot Jupiters on highly elliptical orbits that are undergoing
high-eccentricity tidal migration. As of yet, few such systems have been
discovered. Here, we introduce TOI-3362b (TIC-464300749b), an 18.1-day, 5
$M_{\rm Jup}$ planet orbiting a main-sequence F-type star that is likely
undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration. The orbital eccentricity is
0.815$^{+0.023}_{-0.032}$. With a semi-major axis of 0.153$^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$
au, the planet's orbit is expected to shrink to a final orbital radius of
0.051$^{+0.008}_{-0.006}$ au after complete tidal circularization. Several
mechanisms could explain the extreme value of the planet's eccentricity, such
as planet-planet scattering and secular interactions. Such hypotheses can be
tested with follow-up observations of the system, e.g., measuring the stellar
obliquity and searching for companions in the system with precise, long-term
radial velocity observations. The variation in the planet's equilibrium
temperature as it orbits the host star and the tidal heating at periapse make
this planet an intriguing target for atmospheric modeling and observation.
Because the planet's orbital period of 18.1 days is near the limit of TESS's
period sensitivity, even a few such discoveries suggest that proto-Hot Jupiters
may be quite common.

federated learning framework with heterogeneous on-device models through
Zero-shot Knowledge Transfer, named by FedZKT. Specifically, FedZKT allows
devices to independently determine the on-device models upon their local
resources. To achieve knowledge transfer across these heterogeneous on-device
models, a zero-shot distillation approach is designed without any prerequisites
for private on-device data, which is contrary to certain prior research based
on a public dataset or a pre-trained data generator. Moreover, this
compute-intensive distillation task is assigned to the server to allow the
participation of resource-constrained devices, where a generator is
adversarially learned with the ensemble of collected on-device models. The
distilled central knowledge is then sent back in the form of the corresponding
on-device model parameters, which can be easily absorbed on the device side.
Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of
FedZKT towards on-device knowledge agnostic, on-device model heterogeneity, and

many methods, based on different approaches, which are often specialized in
only upscaling or downscaling. In this paper, independently of the (reduced or
enhanced) size we aim to get, we approach the problem at a continuous scale
where the underlying continuous image is globally approximated by the tensor
product Lagrange polynomial interpolating at a suitable grid of first kind
Chebyshev zeros. This is a well-known approximation tool that is widely used in
many applicative yields, due to the optimal behavior of the related Lebesgue
constants. Here we show how Lagrange-Chebyshev interpolation can be fruitfully
applied also for resizing an arbitrary digital image in both downscaling and
upscaling. The performance of the proposed method has been tested in terms of
the standard SSIM and PSNR metrics. The results indicate that, in upscaling, it
is almost comparable with the classical Bicubic resizing method with slightly
better metrics, but in downscaling a much higher performance has been observed
in comparison with Bicubic and other recent methods too. Moreover, in
downscaling cases with an odd scale factor, we give an estimate of the mean
squared error produced by our method and prove it is theoretically null (hence
PSNR equals to infinite and SSIM equals to one) in absence of noise or initial
artifacts on the input image.

wireless networks, over-the-air computation (OAC) enables efficient function
computation in multiple-access edge computing, where a fusion center aims to
compute a function of the data distributed at edge devices. Existing OAC relies
exclusively on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation at the fusion center to
recover the arithmetic sum of the transmitted signals from different devices.
ML estimation, however, is much susceptible to noise. In particular, in the
misaligned OAC where there are channel misalignments among received signals, ML
estimation suffers from severe error propagation and noise enhancement. To
address these challenges, this paper puts forth a Bayesian approach by letting
each edge device transmit two pieces of statistical information to the fusion
center such that Bayesian estimators can be devised to tackle the
misalignments. Numerical and simulation results verify that, 1) For the aligned
and synchronous OAC, our linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator
significantly outperforms the ML estimator. In the low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime, the LMMSE estimator reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by at
least 6 dB; in the high SNR regime, the LMMSE estimator lowers the error floor
of MSE by 86.4%; 2) For the asynchronous OAC, our LMMSE and sum-product maximum
a posteriori (SP-MAP) estimators are on an equal footing in terms of the MSE
performance, and are significantly better than the ML estimator. Moreover, the
SP-MAP estimator is computationally efficient, the complexity of which grows
linearly with the packet length.

correctly even in the presence of an adaptive adversary. Recently, several
sophisticated frameworks for robustification of classical streaming algorithms
have been developed. One of the main open questions in this area is whether
efficient adversarially robust algorithms exist for moment estimation problems
under the turnstile streaming model, where both insertions and deletions are
allowed. So far, the best known space complexity for streams of length $m$,
achieved using differential privacy (DP) based techniques, is of order
$\tilde{O}(m^{1/2})$ for computing a constant-factor approximation with high
constant probability.
  In this work, we propose a new simple approach to tracking moments by
alternating between two different regimes: a sparse regime, in which we can
explicitly maintain the current frequency vector and use standard sparse
recovery techniques, and a dense regime, in which we make use of existing
DP-based robustification frameworks. The results obtained using our technique
break the previous $m^{1/2}$ barrier for any fixed $p$. More specifically, our
space complexity for $F_2$-estimation is $\tilde{O}(m^{2/5})$ and for
$F_0$-estimation, i.e., counting the number of distinct elements, it is $\tilde
O(m^{1/3})$.
  All existing robustness frameworks have their space complexity depend
multiplicatively on a parameter $\lambda$ called the \emph{flip number} of the
streaming problem, where $\lambda = m$ in turnstile moment estimation. The best
known dependence in these frameworks (for constant factor approximation) is of
order $\tilde{O}(\lambda^{1/2})$, and it is known to be tight for certain
problems. Again, our approach breaks this barrier, achieving a dependence of
order $\tilde{O}(\lambda^{1/2 - c(p)})$ for $F_p$-estimation, where $c(p) > 0$
depends only on $p$.

one of those basis is the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory, which can
successfully explain the mechanism of various desirable properties of cNNs,
particularly the global convergence in the training process. In this paper, we
study a class of qcNN composed of a quantum data-encoder followed by a cNN. The
quantum part is randomly initialized according to unitary 2-designs, which is
an effective feature extraction process for quantum states, and the classical
part is also randomly initialized according to Gaussian distributions; then, in
the NTK regime where the number of nodes of the cNN becomes infinitely large,
the output of the entire qcNN becomes a nonlinear function of the so-called
projected quantum kernel. That is, the NTK theory is used to construct an
effective quantum kernel, which is in general nontrivial to design. Moreover,
NTK defined for the qcNN is identical to the covariance matrix of a Gaussian
process, which allows us to analytically study the learning process and as a
consequence to have a condition of the dataset such that qcNN may perform
better than classical counterparts. These properties are investigated in
thorough numerical experiments; particularly, we demonstrate that the qcNN

LiDAR semantic segmentation to a 2D segmentation task on the range image.
However, the LiDAR range image is still naturally different from the regular 2D
RGB image; for example, each position on the range image encodes the unique
geometry information. In this paper, we propose a new projection-based LiDAR
semantic segmentation pipeline that consists of a novel network structure and
an efficient post-processing step. In our network structure, we design a FID
(fully interpolation decoding) module that directly upsamples the
multi-resolution feature maps using bilinear interpolation. Inspired by the 3D
distance interpolation used in PointNet++, we argue this FID module is a 2D
version distance interpolation on $(\theta, \phi)$ space. As a parameter-free
decoding module, the FID largely reduces the model complexity by maintaining
good performance. Besides the network structure, we empirically find that our
model predictions have clear boundaries between different semantic classes.
This makes us rethink whether the widely used K-nearest-neighbor
post-processing is still necessary for our pipeline. Then, we realize the
many-to-one mapping causes the blurring effect that some points are mapped into
the same pixel and share the same label. Therefore, we propose to process those
occluded points by assigning the nearest predicted label to them. This NLA
(nearest label assignment) post-processing step shows a better performance than
KNN with faster inference speed in the ablation study. On the SemanticKITTI
dataset, our pipeline achieves the best performance among all projection-based
methods with $64 \times 2048$ resolution and all point-wise solutions. With a
ResNet-34 as the backbone, both the training and testing of our model can be
finished on a single RTX 2080 Ti with 11G memory. The code is released.

surfaces of a slab. Yet, we also propose the existence of global equilibrium
spin currents, which are net bulk spin-currents along specific crystallographic
directions of materials. Equilibrium spin currents are allowed by symmetry in a
very broad class of systems having gyrotropic point groups. The physics behind
equilibrium spin currents is uncovered by making an analogy between electronic
systems with SOC and non-Abelian gauge theories. The electron spin can be seen
as the analogous of the color degree of freedom and equilibrium spin currents
can then be identified with diamagnetic color currents appearing as the
response to an effective non-Abelian magnetic field generated by SOC.
Equilibrium spin currents are not associated with spin transport and
accumulation, but they should nonetheless be carefully taken into account when
computing transport spin currents. We provide quantitative estimates of
equilibrium spin currents for several systems, specifically metallic surfaces

summarize essential features of high-dimensional data. This learning problem is
often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned
representations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled.
It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal
criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this
paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing
non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and
disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual
quantities and observable consequences of causal assertions. This yields
computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which
representations satisfy the desiderata of interest and learn non-spurious and
disentangled representations from single observational datasets.

The anomalous transport of the cells was well described by fractional Brownian
motion that was heterogeneous in both time and space. Hemocyte motion became
less persistent over time. LanB1 and SCAR mutants disrupted the collective
cellular motion and reduced its persistence due to the modification of
viscoelasticity and actin-based motility respectively. The anomalous motility
of the hemocytes oscillated in time with alternating epoques of varying

user-generated information, e.g., number of downloads and ratings. However, new
apps often have few (or even no) user feedback, suffering from the classic
cold-start problem. How to quickly identify and then recommend new apps of high
quality is a challenging issue. Here, a fundamental requirement is the
capability to accurately measure an app's quality based on its inborn features,
rather than user-generated features. Since users obtain first-hand experience
of an app by interacting with its views, we speculate that the inborn features
are largely related to the visual quality of individual views in an app and the
ways the views switch to one another. In this work, we propose AppQ, a novel
app quality grading and recommendation system that extracts inborn features of
apps based on app source code. In particular, AppQ works in parallel to perform
code analysis to extract app-level features as well as dynamic analysis to
capture view-level layout hierarchy and the switching among views. Each app is
then expressed as an attributed view graph, which is converted into a vector
and fed to classifiers for recognizing its quality classes. Our evaluation with
an app dataset from Google Play reports that AppQ achieves the best performance
with accuracy of 85.0\%. This shows a lot of promise to warm-start app grading

that for Rayleigh channels, blind channel estimation enabled by MIMO increases
the testing accuracy by up to $40\%$ when the models are trained and tested

there emerge quantum neural architectures based on different designs of quantum
neurons. A fundamental question in quantum deep learning arises: what is the
best quantum neural architecture? Inspired by the design of neural
architectures for classical computing which typically employs multiple types of
neurons, this paper makes the very first attempt to mix quantum neuron designs
to build quantum neural architectures. We observe that the existing quantum
neuron designs may be quite different but complementary, such as neurons from
variational quantum circuits (VQC) and Quantumflow. More specifically, VQC can
apply real-valued weights but suffer from being extended to multiple layers,
while QuantumFlow can build a multi-layer network efficiently, but is limited
to use binary weights. To take their respective advantages, we propose to mix
them together and figure out a way to connect them seamlessly without
additional costly measurement. We further investigate the design principles to
mix quantum neurons, which can provide guidance for quantum neural architecture
exploration in the future. Experimental results demonstrate that the identified
quantum neural architectures with mixed quantum neurons can achieve 90.62% of

thermal Casimir force exists not only along the center-to-center displacements

drive a variety of dynamics such as global rotations, self-propulsion, and
spinning of the spheres. We also show that the Casimir energy in thermal

spheres and that the lateral Casimir force will act between the spheres even in
thermal equilibrium to relax the system into the minimum energy state without
transferring net energy and momentum to the environment. The developed

universe by inducing clumping in the baryon density at small scales. They were
recently proposed as a candidate model to relieve the Hubble tension. We
investigate the consistency of the constraints on a clumping factor parameter
$b$ in a simplistic model, using the latest CMB data from Planck, ACT DR4 and
SPT-3G 2018. For the combined CMB data alone, we find no evidence for clumping
being different from zero, though when adding a prior on $H_0$ based on the
latest distance-ladder analysis of the SH0ES team, we report a weak detection
of $b$. Our analysis of simulated datasets shows that ACT DR4 has more
constraining power with respect to SPT-3G 2018 due to the degeneracy breaking
power of the TT band powers (not included in SPT). Simulations also suggest
that the TE,EE power spectra of the two datasets should have the same
constraining power. However, the ACT DR4 TE,EE constraint is tighter than
expectations, while the SPT-3G 2018 one is looser. While this is compatible
with statistical fluctuations, we explore systematic effects which may account
for such deviations. Overall, the ACT results are only marginally consistent
with Planck or SPT-3G, at the $2-3\sigma$ level within $\Lambda$CDM+$b$ and
$\Lambda$CDM, while Planck and SPT-3G are in good agreement. Combining the CMB
data together with BAO and SNIa provides an upper limit of b<0.4 at 95\% c.l.
(b<0.5 without ACT). Adding a SH0ES-based prior on the Hubble constant gives $b
= 0.31^{+0.11}_{-0.15}$ and $H_0=69.28 \pm 0.56$ km/s/Mpc ($b =
0.41^{+0.14}_{-018}$ and $H_0=69.70 \pm 0.63$ km/s/Mpc without ACT). Finally,
we forecast constraints on $b$ for the full SPT-3G survey, Simons Observatory,
and CMB-S4, finding improvements by factors of 1.5 (2.7 with Planck), 5.9 and
7.8, respectively, over Planck alone.

the stellar/baryonic mass Tully-Fisher relation and the Fall (mass-angular

the two fastest rotators, lie comfortably on both these scaling relations

gas accretion diluting the metallicity. Finally, we present the highest

wedge reconstruction, we consider reconstructing the bulk matter transition

matrix is given by a thermofield double state with a projection by the initial

this paper, we focus on the persistent observable known as ""curve deviation,""
and we compute the observable using the Bondi-Sachs approach to asymptotically
flat spacetimes at the leading, nontrivial order in inverse Bondi radius. The
curve deviation is related to the final separation of two observers who have an
initial separation, initial relative velocity, and relative acceleration. The
displacement gravitational wave memory effect is the part of the curve
deviation that depends on the initial separation and is the entire contribution
for initially comoving, inertial observers at large Bondi radius. The spin and
center-of-mass memory effects are contained within the dependence of the curve
deviation on the initial relative velocity, and the dependence of the curve
deviation on relative acceleration contains observables distinct from these
known memory effects. We find that the full curve deviation observable can be
written in terms of differences in nonradiative data before and after the
radiation (which we call the ""charge"" contribution), along with a nonlinear
""flux"" contribution that vanishes in the absence of gravitational radiation.

starburst galaxies at z~1-1.7 at typical ~1"" resolution, we report on the
effects of mid-IR- and X-ray-detected active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the
reservoirs and excitation of molecular gas in a sample of 55 objects. We find
detectable nuclear activity in ~30% of the sample. The presence of dusty tori
influences the IR SED of galaxies, as highlighted by the strong correlation
among the AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity budget (fAGN =
LIR,AGN/LIR), its hard X-ray emission, and the Rayleigh-Jeans to mid-IR
(S1.2mm/S24um) observed color, with consequences on the empirical SFR
estimates. Nevertheless, we find only marginal effects of AGN on the CO
(J=2,4,5,7) or neutral carbon ([CI](1-0), [CI](2-1)) line luminosities and on
the derived molecular gas excitation as gauged by line ratios and the full
SLEDs. The [CI] and CO emission up to J=5,7 thus primarily traces the
properties of the host in typical IR luminous galaxies. However, we highlight
the existence of a large variety of line luminosities and ratios despite the
homogeneous selection. In particular, we find a sparse group of AGN-dominated
sources with the highest LIR,AGN/LIR,SFR ratios, >3, that are more luminous in
CO(5-4) than what is predicted by the L'CO(5-4)-LIR,SFR relation, which might
be the result of the nuclear activity. For the general population, our findings
translate into AGN having minimal effects on quantities such as gas and dust
fractions and SFEs. If anything, we find hints of a marginal tendency of AGN
hosts to be compact at far-IR wavelengths and to display 1.8x larger dust
optical depths. In general, this is consistent with a marginal impact of the
nuclear activity on the gas reservoirs and star formation in average
star-forming AGN hosts with LIR>5e11 Lsun, typically underrepresented in
surveys of quasars and SMGs.

studies have found that H$\alpha$ and UV SFRs inferred with these assumptions
generally agree for typical star-forming galaxies, but become increasingly
discrepant for galaxies with higher SFRs ($\gtrsim$100 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$),
with H$\alpha$-to-UV SFR ratios being larger for these galaxies. Our analysis
shows that this trend persists even after carefully accounting for the
apertures over which H$\alpha$ and UV-based SFRs (and the nebular and stellar
continuum reddening) are derived. Furthermore, our results imply that H$\alpha$
SFRs may be higher in the centers of large galaxies (i.e., where there is
coverage by the spectroscopic aperture) compared to their outskirts, which
could be indicative of inside-out galaxy growth. Overall, we suggest that the
persistent difference between nebular and stellar continuum reddening and high
H$\alpha$-to-UV SFR ratios at the centers of large galaxies may be indicative
of a patchier distribution of dust in galaxies with high SFRs.

constraining users to align their 3D controllers with their intended stroke

oscillator comprising synthetic circuit elements, we demonstrate static and
Floquet PT breaking transitions, including those at vanishingly small gain and

conserved quantities in this open, balanced gain-loss system, both in the
static and Floquet cases. Lastly, by measuring the circuit energy, we unveil a
giant dynamical asymmetry along exceptional point (EP) contours that emerge
symmetrically from the Hermitian degeneracies at Floquet resonances. Distinct
from material or parametric gain and loss mechanisms, our protocol enables
on-demand parity-time symmetry in a minimal classical system -- a single

processes as the Markovian evolution of quantum channels, which leads us to
dynamical semigroups of superchannels. A superchannel is a linear map that maps
quantum channels to quantum channels, while satisfying suitable consistency
relations. If the input and output quantum channels act on the same space, then
we can consider dynamical semigroups of superchannels. No useful constructive
characterization of the generators of such semigroups is known. We characterize
these generators in two ways: First, we give an efficiently checkable criterion
for whether a given map generates a dynamical semigroup of superchannels.
Second, we identify a normal form for the generators of semigroups of quantum
superchannels, analogous to the GKLS form in the case of quantum channels. To
derive the normal form, we exploit the relation between superchannels and
semicausal completely positive maps, reducing the problem to finding a normal
form for the generators of semigroups of semicausal completely positive maps.
We derive a normal for these generators using a novel technique, which applies
also to infinite-dimensional systems. Our work paves the way to a thorough
investigation of semigroups of superchannels: Numerical studies become feasible
because admissible generators can now be explicitly generated and checked. And
analytic properties of the corresponding evolution equations are now accessible

manufacturing, oil and gas enterprises for representing engineering schematics
and equipment layout. There is an urgent need to extract and digitize
information from P&IDs without the cost of annotating a varying set of symbols
for each new use case. A robust one-shot learning approach for symbol
recognition i.e., localization followed by classification, would therefore go a
long way towards this goal. Our method works by sampling pixels sequentially
along the different contour boundaries in the image. These sampled points form
paths which are used in the prototypical line diagram to construct a graph that
captures the structure of the contours. Subsequently, the prototypical graphs
are fed into a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) which is
trained to classify graphs into one of the given symbol classes. Further, we
append embeddings from a Resnet-34 network which is trained on symbol images
containing sampled points to make the classification network more robust.
Since, many symbols in P&ID are structurally very similar to each other, we
utilize Arcface loss during DGCNN training which helps in maximizing symbol
class separability by producing highly discriminative embeddings. The images
consist of components attached on the pipeline (straight line). The sampled
points segregated around the symbol regions are used for the classification
task. The proposed pipeline, named OSSR-PID, is fast and gives outstanding
performance for recognition of symbols on a synthetic dataset of 100 P&ID
diagrams. We also compare our method against prior-work on a real-world private
dataset of 12 P&ID sheets and obtain comparable/superior results. Remarkably,
it is able to achieve such excellent performance using only one prototypical
example per symbol.

scalar field in the decoupling limit of the dilatonic Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The
emerging spacetimes were either non-singular or singular and containing black
holes of a Schwarzschild type. A size of the region, in which the gravitational
dynamics was observed was controlled by an absolute value of the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling. Dependencies of characteristics of the forming black holes on the
dilatonic and Gauss-Bonnet parameters turned out to be similar in the case of
black hole masses and radii as well as their time of formation in terms of
retarded time. In the cases of masses and radii minima were observed, while in
the remaining case a maximum existed. The electric charge of the emerging black
holes possessed a maximum when measured versus the dilatonic coupling constant
and was strictly decreasing with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. All the
characteristics changed monotonically with the field self-interaction
strengths. The times of formation and charges of black holes decreased, while
masses and radii increased with the self-interaction strengths of the dynamical
fields. Values of the energy density, radial pressure, pressure anisotropy and
the collapsing scalar fields were the biggest along the null hypersurface of
propagation of the initial peaks of the scalar fields. For big values of the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, an increase in their values was also observed
in the vicinity of the central singularity within the whole range of advanced
time. Non-zero values of the dilaton field outside the black hole event horizon
may indicate a formation of a hairy black hole. The local temperature
calculated along the apparent horizon was increasing for late times of the

areas, where the dynamics of the gravity-matter system was observed.

graph-based tasks. The key idea for GNNs is to obtain informative

However, it remains an open question whether the neighborhood information is
adequately aggregated for learning representations of nodes with few neighbors.
To address this, we propose a simple and efficient data augmentation strategy,
local augmentation, to learn the distribution of the node features of the
neighbors conditioned on the central node's feature and enhance GNN's
expressive power with generated features. Local augmentation is a general
framework that can be applied to any GNN model in a plug-and-play manner. It
samples feature vectors associated with each node from the learned conditional
distribution as additional input for the backbone model at each training
iteration. Extensive experiments and analyses show that local augmentation
consistently yields performance improvement when applied to various GNN
architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. For example, experiments show
that plugging in local augmentation to GCN and GAT improves by an average of
3.4\% and 1.6\% in terms of test accuracy on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.
Besides, our experimental results on large graphs (OGB) show that our model

the operation and debugging of software systems. However, the current logging
process is mostly manual and ad hoc, and thus, proper placement and content of
logging statements remain as challenges. To overcome these challenges, methods
that aim to automate log placement and log content, i.e., 'where, what, and how

research, that is ""to predict the log statements by utilizing source code
clones and natural language processing (NLP)"", as these approaches provide
additional context and advantage for log prediction. We pursue the following
four research objectives: (RO1) investigate whether source code clones can be
leveraged for log statement location prediction, (RO2) propose a clone-based
approach for log statement prediction, (RO3) predict log statement's
description with code-clone and NLP models, and (RO4) examine approaches to
automatically predict additional details of the log statement, such as its
verbosity level and variables. For this purpose, we perform an experimental
analysis on seven open-source java projects, extract their method-level code
clones, investigate their attributes, and utilize them for log location and
description prediction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of log-aware
clone detection for automated log location and description prediction and
outperforms the prior work.

problem of forgotten learning knowledge and potential high cost of training.
Therefore, we propose a strategy that combines the idea of neural network
structure search with a pruning algorithm to alleviate this problem. This
algorithm searches and extends the network structure on existing winning ticket
sub-network to producing new winning ticket recursively. This allows the
training and pruning process to continue without compromising performance. A
new winning ticket sub-network with deeper network structure, better
generalization ability and better test performance can be obtained in this
recursive manner. This method can solve: the difficulty of training or
performance degradation of the sub-networks after pruning, the forgetting of
the weights of the original lottery ticket hypothesis and the difficulty of
generating winning ticket sub-network when the final network structure is not
given. We validate this strategy on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. And after
relating it to similar biological phenomena and relevant lottery ticket
hypothesis studies in recent years, we will further propose a new hypothesis to
discuss which factors that can keep a network juvenile, i.e., those possible
factors that influence the learning potential or generalization performance of

program operates the national forest inventory of the US. Traditionally, the
FIA program has relied on sample-based approaches -- permanent plot networks
and associated design-based estimators -- to estimate forest variables across
large geographic areas and long periods of time. These approaches generally
offer unbiased inference on large domains but fail to provide reliable
estimates for small domains due to low sample sizes. Rising demand for small
domain estimates will thus require the FIA program to adopt non-traditional
estimation approaches that are capable of delivering defensible estimates of
forest variables at increased spatial and temporal resolution, without the
expense of collecting additional field data. In light of this challenge, the
development of small area estimation (SAE) methods for FIA data has become an
active and highly productive area of research. Yet, SAE methods remain
difficult to apply to FIA data, due in part to the complex data structures and
inventory design used by the FIA program. Thus, we argue that a new suite of

demand for inference on large geographic areas and long time periods to
inference on small spatial and/or temporal domains. Herein, we present rFIA, an

to perform implicitly regularized Model Selection on $\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$

gravity model is a widely-used approach for estimating and predicting
population flows in urban mobility networks, assuming the scale-free property.
Prior studies have reported good performance results for the gravity model at
certain levels of aggregation. However, the characteristics of urban mobility
networks might vary depending on the spatial and temporal resolutions of data.
Hence, the sensitivity of gravity model performance to variation in the level
of aggregation of data and the temporal and spatial scale of urban mobility
networks needs to be examined. The basic gravity model is tested on urban
mobility networks on an hourly and daily scale using fine-grained
location-based human mobility data for multiple US metropolitan counties to
address this gap. The findings suggest that: (1) finer-scale urban mobility
networks do not demonstrate a scale-free property; (2) the performance of the
basic gravity model decays for predicting population flow in the finer-scale
urban mobility networks; (3) the variations in population density distribution
and mobility network structure and properties across counties do not
significantly influence the performance of gravity models. Hence, gravity
models may not be suitable for modeling urban mobility networks with daily or
hourly aggregation of census tract to census tract movements. The findings
highlight the need for new urban mobility network models or machine learning
approaches to predict fine-scale and high temporal-resolution urban mobility
networks better.

extension of the channel polarization phenomenon to distributed algorithms. The
method leverages an algorithmic split operation that transforms two identical

operation in Polar Codes. This operation preserves the average runtime,
analogous to the conservation of Shannon capacity in channel polarization. By
leveraging a recursive construction in a similar spirit to the Fast Fourier
Transform, this method synthesizes virtual compute nodes with dispersed return
time distributions, which we call computational polarization. We show that the
runtime distributions form a functional martingale processes, identify their
limiting distributions in closed-form expressions together with non-asymptotic
convergence rates, and prove strong convergence results in Banach spaces. We
provide an information-theoretic lower bound on the overall runtime of any

asymptotically achieves the optimal runtime for computing linear functions. An
important advantage is the near linear time decoding procedure, which is
significantly cheaper than Maximum Distance Separable codes.

malicious TLS flows is an important, but challenging, problem. Prior works have
proposed supervised machine learning detectors using TLS features. However, by
trying to represent all malicious traffic, supervised binary detectors produce
models that are too loose, thus introducing errors. Furthermore, they do not
distinguish flows generated by different malware. On the other hand, supervised
multi-class detectors produce tighter models and can classify flows by malware
family, but require family labels, which are not available for many samples.
  To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel unsupervised
approach to detect and cluster malicious TLS flows. Our approach takes as input
network traces from sandboxes. It clusters similar TLS flows using 90 features
that capture properties of the TLS client, TLS server, certificate, and
encrypted payload; and uses the clusters to build an unsupervised detector that
can assign a malicious flow to the cluster it belongs to, or determine it is
benign. We evaluate our approach using 972K traces from a commercial sandbox

precision and recall with an F1 score of 0.993. We compare our unsupervised
detector with two state-of-the-art approaches, showing that it outperforms
both. The false detection rate of our detector is 0.032% measured over four

estimate consumer choice behavior. However, behavioral economics has provided
strong empirical evidence of irrational choice behavior, such as halo effects,
that are incompatible with this framework. Models belonging to the Random
Utility Maximization family may therefore not accurately capture such
irrational behavior. Hence, more general choice models, overcoming such
limitations, have been proposed. However, the flexibility of such models comes
at the price of increased risk of overfitting. As such, estimating such models
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an estimation method for the
recently proposed Generalized Stochastic Preference choice model, which
subsumes the family of Random Utility Maximization models and is capable of
capturing halo effects. Specifically, we show how to use partially-ranked
preferences to efficiently model rational and irrational customer types from
transaction data. Our estimation procedure is based on column generation, where
relevant customer types are efficiently extracted by expanding a tree-like data
structure containing the customer behaviors. Further, we propose a new
dominance rule among customer types whose effect is to prioritize low orders of
interactions among products. An extensive set of experiments assesses the
predictive accuracy of the proposed approach. Our results show that accounting
for irrational preferences can boost predictive accuracy by 12.5% on average,

up the possibility of a much richer set of electronic phases. In this work, we

function of the $c/a$ ratio. We have found that as the $c/a$ ratio decreases

ferromagnetic semiconductor to a ferromagnetic metal, while passing through a

even more interesting when viewed with respect to the volume of each structure.

demonstrates a distinctive transition from a diffusive to a weak localization
regime beyond a critical scattering density that depends on $\chi$. The
transition is characterized by studying the Thouless number and the spectral
statistics of the scattering resonances. In particular, by tuning the $\chi$
parameter, we demonstrate large spectral gaps and suppressed sub-radiant
proximity resonances, facilitating light localization. Moreover, consistently
with previous studies, our results show a region of the transport phase diagram
where the investigated scattering systems become transparent. Our work provides
a systematic description of the transport and weak localization properties of
light in stealthy hyperuniform structures and motivates the engineering of
novel photonic systems with enhanced light-matter interactions for applications
to both classical and quantum devices.

simplest stochastic models to describe variability of active galactic nuclei
(AGN). An AGN light curve can be converted to just two DRW model parameters -
the signal decorrelation timescale $\tau$ and the asymptotic amplitude
${SF}_{\infty}$. By simulation means, we have recently shown that in order to
measure the decorrelation timescale accurately, the experiment or the light
curve length must be at least 10 times the underlying decorrelation timescale.
In this paper, we investigate the origin of this requirement and find that
typical AGN light curves do not sufficiently represent the intrinsic stationary
process. We simulated extremely long (10,000$\tau$) AGN light curves using DRW,
and then measured the variance and the mean of short light curves spanning
1-1000$\tau$. We modeled these light curves with DRW to obtain both the signal
decorrelation timescale $\tau$ and the asymptotic amplitude ${SF}_{\infty}$.
The variance in light curves shorter than $\approx30\tau$ is smaller than that
of the input process, as estimated by both a simple calculation from the light
curve and by DRW modeling. This means that while the simulated stochastic
process is intrinsically stationary, short light curves do not adequately
represent the stationary process. Since the variance and timescale are
correlated, underestimated variances in short light curves lead to
underestimated timescales as compared to the input process. It seems, that a
simulated AGN light curve does not fully represent the underlying DRW process
until its length reaches even $\approx30$ decorrelation timescales. Modeling
short AGN light curves with DRW leads to biases in measured parameters of the
model - the amplitude being too small and the timescale being too short.

However, the adoption of biocatalysis is limited by our ability to select
enzymes that will catalyze their natural chemical transformation on non-natural
substrates. While machine learning and in silico directed evolution are
well-posed for this predictive modeling challenge, efforts to date have
primarily aimed to increase activity against a single known substrate, rather
than to identify enzymes capable of acting on new substrates of interest. To
address this need, we curate 6 different high-quality enzyme family screens
from the literature that each measure multiple enzymes against multiple
substrates. We compare machine learning-based compound-protein interaction
(CPI) modeling approaches from the literature used for predicting drug-target
interactions. Surprisingly, comparing these interaction-based models against
collections of independent (single task) enzyme-only or substrate-only models
reveals that current CPI approaches are incapable of learning interactions
between compounds and proteins in the current family level data regime. We
further validate this observation by demonstrating that our no-interaction
baseline can outperform CPI-based models from the literature used to guide the
discovery of kinase inhibitors. Given the high performance of non-interaction
based models, we introduce a new structure-based strategy for pooling residue
representations across a protein sequence. Altogether, this work motivates a
principled path forward in order to build and evaluate meaningful predictive

studied the force feedback's effect via an experiment, where seven human

the tasks with both mappings after practice, and the force feedback improved
their performances. However, the subjects exhibited two distinct teleoperation

of different categories of users in this regard. Focusing on the case of music
streaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one
year and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of
recommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we
compute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within
their listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called
`organic' use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four
categories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity,
both in terms of dispersion -- how much users consume the same content
repeatedly -- and popularity -- how popular is the content they consume. We
show that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms --
algorithmic and editorial -- may drive the consumption of more or less diverse
content in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users.
Finally, we compare users' streaming histories with the music programming of a
selection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio
programs are usually more tilted toward repetition than users' listening
histories, they often program more songs from less popular artists. On the
whole, our results highlight the nontrivial effects of platform-mediated
recommendation on consumption, and lead us to speak of `filter niches' rather
than `filter bubbles'. They hint at further ramifications for the study and

generalizations of differential geometric structures on a smooth manifold. The
symmetrization of the bracket on an anti-commutable pre-Leibniz algebroid
satisfies a certain property depending on a choice of an equivalence class of
connections which are called admissible. These admissible connections are shown
to be necessary to generalize aforementioned structures on pre-Leibniz
algebroids. Consequently, we prove that, provided certain conditions,
statistical and conjugate connection structures are equivalent when defined for
admissible connections. Moreover, we also show that for
`projected-torsion-free' connections, one can generalize Hessian metrics and
Hessian structures. We prove that any Hessian structure yields a statistical
structure, where these results are completely parallel to the ones in the
manifold setting. We also prove a mild generalization of the fundamental
theorem of statistical geometry. Moreover, we generalize $\alpha$-connections,
strongly conjugate connections and relative torsion operator, and prove some
analogous results.

high-performing solutions. To illuminate the elite solutions for a space of
behaviours, QD algorithms require the definition of a suitable behaviour space.
If the behaviour space is high-dimensional, a suitable dimensionality reduction
technique is required to maintain a limited number of behavioural niches. While
current methodologies for automated behaviour spaces focus on changing the
geometry or on unsupervised learning, there remains a need for customising
behavioural diversity to a particular meta-objective specified by the end-user.
In the newly emerging framework of QD Meta-Evolution, or QD-Meta for short, one
evolves a population of QD algorithms, each with different algorithmic and
representational characteristics, to optimise the algorithms and their
resulting archives to a user-defined meta-objective. Despite promising results
compared to traditional QD algorithms, QD-Meta has yet to be compared to
state-of-the-art behaviour space automation methods such as Centroidal Voronoi
Tessellations Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites Algorithm

paper performs an empirical study of QD-Meta on function optimisation and
multilegged robot locomotion benchmarks. Results demonstrate that QD-Meta
archives provide improved average performance and faster adaptation to a priori
unknown changes to the environment when compared to CVT-MAP-Elites and AURORA.
A qualitative analysis shows how the resulting archives are tailored to the
meta-objectives provided by the end-user.

m-th moment of the age processes. Interestingly, this technique allows us to
approximate the average age by solving a simple set of linear equations.
Equipped with this approach, we also provide a sequential convex approximation
method to optimize the average age by calibrating the parameters of the system.
Finally, we consider an age-dependent CSMA environment where the backoff

contrast its performance to the age-blind CSMA and showcase the age performance

Khintchine-Groshev theorem which does not carry a monotonicity assumption when
$nm>2$. Our results bring the inhomogeneous theory almost in line with the
homogeneous theory, where it is known by a result of Beresnevich and Velani
(2010) that monotonicity is not required when $nm>1$. That result resolved a
conjecture of Beresnevich, Bernik, Dodson, and Velani (2009), and our work
resolves almost every case of the natural inhomogeneous generalization of that
conjecture. Regarding the two cases where $nm=2$, we are able to remove
monotonicity by assuming extra divergence of a measure sum, akin to a linear
forms version of the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture. When $nm=1$ it is known by
work of Duffin and Schaeffer (1941) that the monotonicity assumption cannot be
dropped.
  The key new result is an independence inheritance phenomenon; the underlying
idea is that the sets involved in the $((n+k)\times m)$-dimensional
Khintchine-Groshev theorem ($k\geq 0$) are always $k$-levels more
probabilistically independent than the sets involved the $(n\times
m)$-dimensional theorem. Hence, it is shown that Khintchine's theorem itself
underpins the Khintchine-Groshev theory.

personal account of how these concepts arose. This is followed by a description
of some recent ideas where the coupling of transverse orbital and spin angular
momentum (SAM) in tightly focused laser beams produces interesting new effects.
The deflection of a focused light beam by an atom in the focus is reminiscent
of the Magnus effect known from aerodynamics. Momentum conservation dictates an
accompanying light force on the atom, transverse to the optical axis. As a
consequence, an atom held in an optical tweezer will be trapped at a small
distance of up to $\lambda/2\pi$ away from the optical axis, which depends on
the spin state of the atom and the magnetic field direction. This opens up new
avenues to control the state of motion of atoms in optical tweezers as well as
potential applications in quantum gates and interferometry.

  Channels with Feedback",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper focuses on the Layered Packet Erasure Broadcast Channel (LPE-BC)
with Channel Output Feedback (COF) available at the transmitter. The LPE-BC is
a high-SNR approximation of the fading Gaussian BC recently proposed by Tse and
Yates, who characterized the capacity region for any number of users and any
number of layers when there is no COF. This paper provides a comparative
overview of this channel model along the following lines: First, inner and
outer bounds to the capacity region (set of achievable rates with backlogged
arrivals) are presented: a) a new outer bound based on the idea of the
physically degraded broadcast channel, and b) an inner bound of the LPE-BC with
COF for the case of two users and any number of layers. Next, an inner bound on
the stability region (set of exogenous arrival rates for which packet arrival
queues are stable) for the same model is derived. The capacity region inner
bound generalizes past results for the two-user erasure BC, which is a special
case of the LPE-BC with COF with only one layer. The novelty lies in the use of
inter-user and inter-layer network coding retransmissions (for those packets
that have only been received by the unintended user), where each random linear
combination may involve packets intended for any user originally sent on any of
the layers. For the case of $K = 2$ users and $Q \geq 1$ layers, the inner
bounds to the capacity region and the stability region coincide; both
strategically employ the novel retransmission protocol. For the case of $Q = 2$
layers, sufficient conditions are derived by Fourier-Motzkin elimination for
the inner bound on the stability region to coincide with the capacity outer
bound, thus showing that in those cases the capacity and stability regions
coincide.

$n$-dimensional normally (with identity covariance matrix) or Poisson
distributed vector under the squared loss. In a Bayesian setting the optimal
estimator is given by the prior-dependent conditional mean. In a frequentist
setting various shrinkage methods were developed over the last century. The
framework of empirical Bayes, put forth by Robbins (1956), combines Bayesian
and frequentist mindsets by postulating that the parameters are independent but
with an unknown prior and aims to use a fully data-driven estimator to compete
with the Bayesian oracle that knows the true prior. The central figure of merit
is the regret, namely, the total excess risk over the Bayes risk in the worst
case (over the priors). Although this paradigm was introduced more than 60
years ago, little is known about the asymptotic scaling of the optimal regret
in the nonparametric setting.
  We show that for the Poisson model with compactly supported and
subexponential priors, the optimal regret scales as $\Theta((\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n})^2)$ and $\Theta(\log^3 n)$, respectively, both attained by the
original estimator of Robbins. For the normal mean model, the regret is shown
to be at least $\Omega((\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})^2)$ and $\Omega(\log^2 n)$
for compactly supported and subgaussian priors, respectively, the former of
which resolves the conjecture of Singh (1979) on the impossibility of achieving
bounded regret; before this work, the best regret lower bound was $\Omega(1)$.
In addition to the empirical Bayes setting, these results are shown to hold in
the compound setting where the parameters are deterministic. As a side
application, the construction in this paper also leads to improved or new lower
bounds for density estimation of Gaussian and Poisson mixtures.

document-centric manifestation for system-wide orchestration. First, a data
coordinator manages the lifecycle of sensors and serves models with correct
data through automated transformations. Next, a resource-aware model server
executes multiple models in isolation through model abstraction, pipeline
automation and feature sharing. An adaptive scheduler then orchestrates the
best-effort executions of multiple models across heterogeneous accelerators,
balancing latency and throughput. Finally, microservices with REST APIs serve
synthesised model predictions, system statistics, and continuous deployment.
Collectively, these components enable SensiX++ to serve multiple models
efficiently with fine-grained control on edge devices while minimising data
operation redundancy, managing data and device heterogeneity, reducing resource
contention and removing manual MLOps. We benchmark SensiX++ with ten different
vision and acoustics models across various multi-tenant configurations on
different edge accelerators (Jetson AGX and Coral TPU) designed for sensory

metallicity that implies the progenitor was probably a low mass globular

0.04^{+0.11}_{-0.03}$) and a large peak-to-peak range in [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe]
abundance ratios, consistent with the light element abundance patterns seen in
the most metal-poor globular clusters. However, unlike any other globular
cluster, we also find an intrinsic spread in [Sr II/Fe] spanning $\sim$1 dex,
while [Ba II/Fe] shows nearly no intrinsic spread ($\sigma(\mathrm{[Ba~II/H]})
= {0.03}^{+0.10}_{-0.02}$). This abundance signature is best interpreted as
slow neutron capture element production from a massive fast-rotating metal-poor
star ($15-20 \mathrm{M}_\odot$, $v_\mathrm{ini}/v_\mathrm{crit} = 0.4$,
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}] = -3.8$). The low inferred cluster mass suggests the system
would have been unable to retain supernovae ejecta, implying that any massive
fast-rotating metal-poor star that enriched the interstellar medium must have
formed and evolved before the globular cluster formed. Neutron capture element
production from asymptotic giant branch stars or magneto-rotational
instabilities in core-collapse supernovae provide poor fits to the
observations. We also report one Phoenix stream star to be a lithium-rich giant
($A(\mathrm{Li}) = 3.1 \pm 0.1$). At $[\mathrm{Fe/H}] = -2.93$ it is among the

(e.g., physics-informed neural networks) softly enforce physics constraints by
including partial differential equation (PDE)-based loss functions but need
re-discretization of the PDEs using auto-differentiation. Training these neural
nets on observational data showed that one could solve forward and inverse
problems in one shot. They evaluate the state variables and the parameters in a
PDE. This re-discretization of PDEs is not necessarily an attractive option for
domain scientists that work with physics-based codes that have been developed
for decades with sophisticated discretization techniques to solve complex

constrained machine learning framework, AdjointNet, allowing domain scientists
to embed their physics code in neural network training workflows. This
embedding ensures that physics is constrained everywhere in the domain.
Additionally, the mathematical properties such as consistency, stability, and
convergence vital to the numerical solution of a PDE are still satisfied. We
show that the proposed AdjointNet framework can be used for parameter
estimation (and uncertainty quantification by extension) and experimental
design using active learning. The applicability of our framework is
demonstrated for four flow cases. Results show that AdjointNet-based inversion

equations, Fenichel theory, and center manifold theory, we derive the
appropriate $\varepsilon$ whose magnitude regulates the validity of the
quasi-steady-state reduction employed in the reported experimental procedures
for intermolecular autocatalytic zymogen activation reaction. Although the
model equations are two-dimensional, the fast/slow dynamics are rich. The phase
plane exhibits a dynamic transcritical bifurcation point in a particular
singular limit. The existence of such a bifurcation is relevant, because the
critical manifold losses normal hyperbolicity and classical Fenichel theory is
inapplicable. Furthermore, we show that in some cases chemical reversibility
can be interpreted dynamically as an imperfection, since the presence of
reversibility can destroy the bifurcation structure present in the singular
limit. We show that the reduction method by which QSS reductions are justified
can depend on the path taken in parameter space. Specifically, we show that the
standard quasi-steady-state reduction for this reaction is justifiable by
center manifold theory in one limit, and via Fenichel theory in a different
limit.

to provide accurate building segmentation for satellite imagery captured from a
large range of off-nadir angles. Based on Bayesian deep learning, we explicitly
design our method to learn the data noise via aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty modeling. Satellite image metadata (e.g., off-nadir angle and

systems with large quantum fluctuations. In contrast to semi-classical

magnetically ordered and spin liquid states, as well as the continuous
evolution of the corresponding excitation spectrum. The square lattice
Heisenberg antiferromagnet is one of the first models that was approached with
the Schwinger boson theory. Here we revisit this problem to reveal several
subtle points that were omitted in previous treatments and that are crucial to
further develop this formalism. These points include the freedom for the choice
of the saddle point (Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling and choice of the
condensate) and the $1/N$ expansion in the presence of a condensate. A key
observation is that the spinon condensate leads to Feynman diagrams that
include contributions of different order in $1/N$, which must be accounted to
get a qualitatively correct excitation spectrum. We demonstrate that a proper
treatment of these contributions leads to an exact cancellation of the
single-spinon poles of the dynamical spin structure factor, as expected for a
magnetically ordered state. The only surviving poles are the ones arising from
the magnons (two-spinon bound states), which are the true collective modes of

responsible for a particular geometric arrangement of confined systems of
identical fermions even when there is no interaction between them. These
geometric structures, called Pauli crystals, are predicted for a
two-dimensional system of free fermions under harmonic confinement. It is
assumed that the system consists of neutral fermionic atoms with their spins
frozen (spin-polarized) in order to avoid any form of electromagnetic
interaction. These crystalline patterns emerge as the most frequent
configurations seen in a large collection of single-shot pictures of the
system. In this work, we pursue the possibility of this outcome and consider a
theoretical model that may capture both qualitatively and quantitatively key
features of the above mentioned setup. Our approach treats a quantum system of
non-interacting fermions as an effective classical system of particles that
interact with an effective statistical interaction potential that mimics the
quantum statistics. For this model, we consider two-dimensional few-body
systems of harmonically confined particles that interact with a statistical
potential and calculate analytically the minimum energy configuration for
specific values of relevant parameters. The results for N=3 and 6 particles
show that the minimum energy configuration corresponds to and is in good
quantitative agreement with the reported values of Pauli crystals seen in
single-shot imaging data obtained via the configuration density technique.
Numerical results for larger systems of N=15 and 30 particles show that the
crystalline configurations observed are not the same as the classical Wigner
crystal structures that emerge should the confined charged particles interact
with a Coulomb potential. An important question floated is whether such
structures do really exist in a quantum system.

enhancement of adhesion by picosecond ultrasonics measurements which show an
increase in the interfacial stiffness by 70% after annealing. Since it is
straigthforward to apply, the presented self-sealing method is thus a promising
route toward realizing ultrathin hermetic pressure sensors.

driving that is solenoidal, compressive, and a natural mixture of the two,

filamentary molecular clouds in the star-forming region N159E (the Papillon

turbulence driving parameter in an extragalactic region. We use a non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) analysis of the CO isotopologues to construct
a gas density PDF, which we find to be largely log-normal in shape with some
intermittent features indicating deviations from lognormality. We find that the
width of the log-normal part of the density PDF is comparable to the supersonic
turbulent Mach number, resulting in $b \approx 0.9$. This implies that the
driving mode of turbulence in N159E is primarily compressive. We speculate that
the compressive turbulence could have been powered by gravo-turbulent
fragmentation of the molecular gas, or due to compression powered by H I flows
that led to the development of the molecular filaments observed by ALMA in the

introduced for deterministic evaluation of ML experiments in a real, controlled

proposed to collect buggy versions of ML libraries and run deterministic ML

based on our limited dataset to show that bugs which occurred in PyTorch do

practitioners respond to requirements changes(RCs) with different emotions, and
that their emotions vary at stages of the RC handling life cycle, such as
receiving, developing, and delivering RCs. Objective: We wanted to study more
comprehensively how practitioners emotionally respond to RCs. Method: We
conducted a world-wide survey with the participation of 201 software
practitioners. In our survey, we used the Job-related Affective Well-being
Scale (JAWS) and open-ended questions to capture participants emotions when
handling RCs in their work and query about the different circumstances when
they feel these emotions. We used a combined approach of statistical analysis,
JAWS, and Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) for Data Analysis to analyse
our survey data. Findings: We identified (1) emotional responses to RCs, i.e.,
the most common emotions felt by practitioners when handling RCs; (2) different
stimuli -- such as the RC, the practitioner, team, manager, customer -- that
trigger these emotions through their own different characteristics; (3)emotion
dynamics, i.e., the changes in emotions during the project and RC handling life
cycles; (4) distinct events where particular emotions are triggered:project
milestones, and RC stages; (5) and time related matters that regulate the
emotion dynamics. Conclusion: Practitioners are not pleased with receiving RCs
all the time. Last minute RCs introduced closer to a deadline especially
violate emotional well-being of practitioners. We present some practical
recommendations for practitioners to follow, including a dual-purpose
emotion-centric decision guide to help decide when to introduce or accept an
RC, and some future key research directions.

that are impracticable in problems with a large number of underlying assets
(due to the curse of dimensionality) or with incomplete asset dynamics
information. In this paper, we extend for the first time a famous off-policy
deterministic actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (ACRL) algorithm to the
problem of solving a risk averse Markov decision process that models risk using
a time consistent recursive expectile risk measure. This new ACRL algorithm
allows us to identify high quality time consistent hedging policies (and equal
risk prices) for options, such as basket options, that cannot be handled using
traditional methods, or in context where only historical trajectories of the
underlying assets are available. Our numerical experiments, which involve both
a simple vanilla option and a more exotic basket option, confirm that the new
ACRL algorithm can produce 1) in simple environments, nearly optimal hedging
policies, and highly accurate prices, simultaneously for a range of maturities
2) in complex environments, good quality policies and prices using reasonable
amount of computing resources; and 3) overall, hedging strategies that actually
outperform the strategies produced using static risk measures when the risk is
evaluated at later points of time.

attention since it brings better performance for low resource languages (LRLs)
and saves more space. However, existing multilingual machine translation models
face a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of
different languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We
argue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning
competencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the
learning competencies of different languages and propose Competence-based
Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation, named CCL-M.
Specifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high
resource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) Self-evaluated
Competence, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2)
HRLs-evaluated Competence, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned
according to HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence. Based on the above competencies,
we utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the
training set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel
competenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting
training samples in multilingual training. Experimental results show that our
approach has achieved a steady and significant performance gain compared to the
previous state-of-the-art approach on the TED talks dataset.

  https://github.com/CompVis/metric-learning-divide-and-conquer-improved",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Deep metric learning (DML) is a cornerstone of many computer vision
applications. It aims at learning a mapping from the input domain to an
embedding space, where semantically similar objects are located nearby and
dissimilar objects far from another. The target similarity on the training data
is defined by user in form of ground-truth class labels. However, while the
embedding space learns to mimic the user-provided similarity on the training
data, it should also generalize to novel categories not seen during training.
Besides user-provided groundtruth training labels, a lot of additional visual
factors (such as viewpoint changes or shape peculiarities) exist and imply
different notions of similarity between objects, affecting the generalization
on the images unseen during training. However, existing approaches usually
directly learn a single embedding space on all available training data,
struggling to encode all different types of relationships, and do not
generalize well. We propose to build a more expressive representation by
jointly splitting the embedding space and the data hierarchically into smaller
sub-parts. We successively focus on smaller subsets of the training data,
reducing its variance and learning a different embedding subspace for each data
subset. Moreover, the subspaces are learned jointly to cover not only the
intricacies, but the breadth of the data as well. Only after that, we build the
final embedding from the subspaces in the conquering stage. The proposed
algorithm acts as a transparent wrapper that can be placed around arbitrary
existing DML methods. Our approach significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art on image retrieval, clustering, and re-identification tasks

target domain due to data privacy and safety. To overcome this challenge,
recently, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) has attracted the attention of
researchers, where both a trained source model and unlabeled target samples are
given. Existing SFDA methods either adopt a pseudo-label based strategy or
generate more samples. However, these methods do not explicitly reduce the
distribution shift across domains, which is the key to a good adaptation.
Although there are no source samples available, fortunately, we find that some
target samples are very similar to the source domain and can be used to
approximate the source domain. This approximated domain is denoted as the
pseudo-source domain. In this paper, inspired by this observation, we propose a
novel method based on the pseudo-source domain. The proposed method firstly
generates and augments the pseudo-source domain, and then employs distribution
alignment with four novel losses based on pseudo-label based strategy. Among
them, a domain adversarial loss is introduced between the pseudo-source domain
the remaining target domain to reduce the distribution shift. The results on
three real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

numbers of localized increases in the radial solar wind speed and associated
sharp deflections of the magnetic field - switchbacks (SB). A possible
generation mechanism of SBs is through magnetic reconnection between open and
closed magnetic flux near the solar surface, termed interchange reconnection
that leads to the ejection of flux ropes (FR) into the solar wind. Observations
also suggest that SBs undergo merging, consistent with a FR picture of these
structures. The role of FRs merging in controlling the structure of SB in the
solar wind is explored through direct observations, through analytic analysis,
and numerical simulations. Analytic analysis reveals key features of the
structure of FR and their scaling with the heliocentric distance R that are
consistent with observations and that reveal the critical role of merging in
controlling the SB structure. FR merging is shown to be energetically favorable
to reduce the strength of the wrapping magnetic field and drive the observed
elongation of SBs. A further consequence is the resulting dominance of the
axial magnetic field within SBs that leads to the characteristic sharp rotation
of the magnetic field into the axial direction at the SB boundary that is
revealed in observations. Finally, the radial scaling of the SB area in the FR
model of SBs suggests that the observational probability of SB identification
should be insensitive to R, which is consistent with the most recent
statistical analysis of SB observations from PSP.

distributionally robust optimization, which minimizes the worst-case expected
loss over the set of language pairs. We further show how to practically
optimize this objective for large translation corpora using an iterated best
response scheme, which is both effective and incurs negligible additional
computational cost compared to standard empirical risk minimization. We perform
extensive experiments on three sets of languages from two datasets and show
that our method consistently outperforms strong baseline methods in terms of
average and per-language performance under both many-to-one and one-to-many

  Behaviours from Multimodal Videos","8 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Distracted driving is one of the major reasons for vehicle accidents.
Therefore, detecting distracted driving behaviors is of paramount importance to
reduce the millions of deaths and injuries occurring worldwide. Distracted or
anomalous driving behaviors are deviations from 'normal' driving that need to
be identified correctly to alert the driver. However, these driving behaviors
do not comprise one specific type of driving style and their distribution can
be different during the training and test phases of a classifier. We formulate
this problem as a supervised contrastive learning approach to learn a visual
representation to detect normal, and seen and unseen anomalous driving
behaviors. We made a change to the standard contrastive loss function to adjust
the similarity of negative pairs to aid the optimization. Normally, in a (self)
supervised contrastive framework, the projection head layers are omitted during
the test phase as the encoding layers are considered to contain general visual
representative information. However, we assert that for a video-based
supervised contrastive learning task, including a projection head can be
beneficial. We showed our results on a driver anomaly detection dataset that
contains 783 minutes of video recordings of normal and anomalous driving
behaviors of 31 drivers from the various top and front cameras (both depth and
infrared). Out of 9 video modalities combinations, our proposed contrastive
approach improved the ROC AUC on 6 in comparison to the baseline models (from
4.23% to 8.91% for different modalities). We performed statistical tests that
showed evidence that our proposed method performs better than the baseline
contrastive learning setup. Finally, the results showed that the fusion of
depth and infrared modalities from the top and front views achieved the best
AUC ROC of 0.9738 and AUC PR of 0.9772.

tensors) completion from partially observed samplings. We consider that a
tensor is a superposition of multiple low-rank components. In particular, each
component can be represented as multilinear connections over several latent
factors and naturally mapped to a specific tensor network (TN) topology. In
this paper, we propose a fundamental tensor decomposition (TD) framework:
Multi-Tensor Network Representation (MTNR), which can be regarded as a linear
combination of a range of TD models, e.g., CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition, Tensor Train (TT), and Tensor Ring (TR). Specifically, MTNR
represents a high-order tensor as the addition of multiple TN models, and the
topology of each TN is automatically generated instead of manually
pre-designed. For the optimization phase, an adaptive topology learning (ATL)
algorithm is presented to obtain latent factors of each TN based on a rank
incremental strategy and a projection error measurement strategy. In addition,
we theoretically establish the fundamental multilinear operations for the
tensors with TN representation, and reveal the structural transformation of
MTNR to a single TN. Finally, MTNR is applied to a typical task, tensor
completion, and two effective algorithms are proposed for the exact recovery of
incomplete data based on the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) scheme and
Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) framework. Extensive
numerical experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of MTNR compared with the start-of-the-art methods.

data collection. However, simulating sensors, including tactile sensors, has
been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we propose Taxim, a realistic
and high-speed simulation model for a vision-based tactile sensor, GelSight. A
GelSight sensor uses a piece of soft elastomer as the medium of contact and
embeds optical structures to capture the deformation of the elastomer, which
infers the geometry and forces applied at the contact surface. We propose an
example-based method for simulating GelSight: we simulate the optical response
to the deformation with a polynomial look-up table. This table maps the
deformed geometries to pixel intensity sampled by the embedded camera. In order
to simulate the surface markers' motion that is caused by the surface stretch
of the elastomer, we apply the linear elastic deformation theory and the
superposition principle. The simulation model is calibrated with less than 100
data points from a real sensor. The example-based approach enables the model to
easily migrate to other GelSight sensors or its variations. To the best of our
knowledge, our simulation framework is the first to incorporate marker motion
field simulation that derives from elastomer deformation together with the
optical simulation, creating a comprehensive and computationally efficient
tactile simulation framework. Experiments reveal that our optical simulation
has the lowest pixel-wise intensity errors compared to prior work and can run
online with CPU computing. Our code and supplementary materials are

automatically assesses the security of the IoT network by capturing potential
attack paths. We evaluate the viability of our approach using a
proof-of-concept smart building system model which contains a variety of
real-world IoT devices and potential vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of the
proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of automatically
predicting the vulnerability metrics of new vulnerabilities with more than 90%
accuracy, on average, and identifying the most vulnerable attack paths within
an IoT network. The produced assessment results can serve as a guideline for
cybersecurity professionals to take further actions and mitigate risks in a

higher one of 0.49$\pm$0.02, while inner halo stars possibly own the highest

decrease toward higher [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/H], and [M/H] abundances. However, the
suppressing impacts of the [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/H], and [M/H] are more significant

Trust-ya, as a model of some elements of status processes in human groups. The
game is designed to elicit status-driven leader-follower behaviours as a means
to observe and influence social hierarchy. It involves a Bach/Stravinsky game
of deference in a group, in which people on each turn can either invest with
another player or hope someone invests with them. Players who receive
investment capital are able to gamble for payoffs from a central pool which
then can be shared back with those who invested (but a portion of it may be
kept, including all of it). The bigger gambles (people with more investors) get
bigger payoffs. Thus, there is a natural tendency for players to coalesce as
investors around a 'leader' who gambles, but who also shares sufficiently from
their winnings to keep the investors 'hanging on'. The 'leader' will want to
keep as much as possible for themselves, however. The game is played
anonymously, but a set of 'status symbols' can be purchased which have no value
in the game itself, but can serve as a 'cheap talk' communication device with
other players. This paper introduces the game, relates it to status theory in
social psychology, and shows some simple simulated and human experiments that
demonstrate how the game can be used to study status processes and dynamics in
human groups.

measurement precision over traditional sensing protocols. Multi-mode
non-Hermitian lattice dynamics can provide exponentially-enhanced quantum
sensing where the quantum Fisher information (QFI) per photon increases
exponentially with the lattice size. However, somewhat surprisingly, it was
also shown that the quintessential non-Hermitian skin effect does not provide
any true advantage. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of optimizing
the phase of the coherent drive, and the position of the injection and
detection in multi-mode non-Hermitian quantum sensing. The QFI per photon can
be exponentially-enhanced or exponentially-reduced depending on parameters of
the drive and detection. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for large
amplification by choosing appropriate coherent drive parameters, the
non-Hermitian skin effect can provide exponentially-enhanced quantum sensing.
Moreover, in the regime beyond linear response, skin-effect can also provide a
dramatic advantage as compared to the local perturbation, and the proposed
protocol is robust in tuning the amplification factor.

offer suitable conditions for triggering ECME, only seven such stars have been
reported so far within a span of more than two decades. In this paper, we
report the discovery of eight more MRPs, thus more than doubling the sample

observation program using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope over the years
2015-2021. Adding these stars to the previously known MRPs, we infer that at

suggesting that observation of ECME is not a rare phenomenon. The significantly
larger sample of MRPs allows us for the first time to perform a statistical
analysis comparing their physical properties. We present an empirical relation
that can be used to predict whether a magnetic hot star is likely to produce
ECME. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the physical parameters that play
the primary role in the efficiency of the phenomenon are the maximum surface
magnetic field strength and the surface temperature. In addition, we present
strong evidence of the influence of the plasma density distribution on ECME
pulse profiles. Results of this kind further motivate the search for MRPs as a

viability in explaining the observed fermion masses and mixing parameters along
with the baryon asymmetry produced via thermal leptogenesis. The Yukawa sector
of the model consists of complex $10_H$ and $\overline{126}_H$ scalars with a
Peccei-Quinn like symmetry and it leads to strong correlations among the Yukawa
couplings of all the standard model fermions including the couplings and masses
of the right-handed (RH) neutrinos. The latter implies the necessity to include
the second lightest RH neutrino and flavor effects for the precision
computation of leptogenesis. We use the most general density matrix equations
to calculate the temperature evolution of flavoured leptonic asymmetry. A
simplified analytical solution of these equations, applicable to the RH
neutrino spectrum predicted in the model, is also obtained which allows one to
fit the observed baryon to photon ratio along with the other fermion mass
observables in a numerically efficient way. The analytical and numerical
solutions are found to be in agreement within a factor of ${\cal O}(1)$. We
find that the successful leptogenesis in this model does not prefer any

other to the Minkowski Poynting vector in electrodynamics. The latter picks up
the extra non-conservative terms while the former does not. To understand the
source of energy conversion and power flow in the detection systems, we apply
the two Poynting theorems to axion modified electrodynamics, for both the
resonant cavity and broadband low-mass axion detectors. We show that both

framework of the Abraham-Minkowski controversy? In reality, this should be
confirmed by experiment when the axion is detected. However, many
electrodynamic experiments have ruled in favour of the Minkowski Poynting

losses, called `SPLICE` (Synthetic Paid Loss and Incurred Cost Experience). In
three modules, case estimates are simulated in continuous time, and a record is
output for each individual claim. Revisions for the case estimates are also
simulated as a sequence over the lifetime of the claim, in a number of
different situations. Furthermore, some dependencies in relation to case
estimates of incurred losses are incorporated, particularly recognizing certain
properties of case estimates that are found in practice. For example, the
magnitude of revisions depends on ultimate claim size, as does the distribution
of the revisions over time. Some of these revisions occur in response to
occurrence of claim payments, and so `SPLICE` requires input of simulated
per-claim payment histories. The claim data can be summarized by accident and
payment ""periods"" whose duration is an arbitrary choice (e.g. month, quarter,
etc.) available to the user.
  `SPLICE` is a fully documented R package that is publicly available and open

experience called `SynthETIC` (Avanzi et al., 2021a,b), which offers flexible
modelling of occurrence, notification, as well as the timing and magnitude of
individual partial payments. This is in contrast with the incurred losses,

elements for purely chemically selecting accreted stars, we analyse 4164 stars
with low-$\alpha$ abundances and halo kinematics. These are most different to
the Milky Way stars for abundances of Mg, Si, Na, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Cu. Based
on the significance of abundance differences and detection rates, we apply
Gaussian mixture models to various element abundance combinations. We find the
most populated and least contaminated component, which we confirm to represent
GSE, contains 1049 stars selected via [Na/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] in GALAH+ DR3. We
provide tables of our selections and report the chrono-chemodynamical

dynamical selection of GSE stars, including $30 <
\sqrt{J_R~/~\mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}} < 55$, we can characterise an
unprecedented 24 abundances of this structure with GALAH+ DR3. Our chemical
selection allows us to prevent circular reasoning and characterise the
dynamical properties of the GSE, for example mean
$\sqrt{J_R~/~\mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}} = 26_{-14}^{+9}$. We find only
$(29\pm1)\%$ of the GSE stars within the clean dynamical selection region. Our
methodology will improve future studies of accreted structures and their

impinging on an array of sensors and estimating their directions-of-arrival
(DOAs) in the presence of spatially white nonuniform noise is considered. It is
known that, in the case of nonuniform noise, the stochastic likelihood function
cannot be concentrated with respect to the diagonal elements of noise
covariance matrix. Therefore, the stochastic maximum-likelihood (SML) DOA
estimation and source enumeration in the presence of nonuniform noise requires
multidimensional search with very high computational complexity. Recently, two
algorithms for estimating noise covariance matrix in the presence of nonuniform
noise have been proposed in the literature. Using these new estimates of noise
covariance matrix, an approach for obtaining the SML estimate of signal DOAs is
proposed. In addition, new approaches are proposed for SML source enumeration
with information criteria in the presence of nonuniform noise. The important
feature of the proposed SML approaches for DOA estimation and source
enumeration is that they have admissible computational complexity. In addition,
some of them are robust against correlation between source signals. The
performance of the proposed DOA estimation and source enumeration approaches
are investigated using computer simulations.

malware via reverse engineering is still a time-consuming and mostly manual
task. For this reason, it is necessary to develop techniques that automate
parts of the reverse engineering process and that can evade the built-in
countermeasures of modern malware. The main contribution of this paper is a
novel method to automatically find so-called Points-of-Interest (POIs) in
executed programs. POIs are instructions that interact with data that is known
to an analyst. They can be used as beacons in the analysis of malware and can
help to guide the analyst to the interesting parts of the malware. Furthermore,
we propose a metric for POIs , the so-called confidence score that estimates
how exclusively a POI will process data relevant to the malware. With the goal
of automatically extract peers in P2P botnet malware, we demonstrate and
evaluate our approach by applying it on four botnets (ZeroAccess, Sality,
Nugache, and Kelihos). We looked into the identified POIs for known IPs and
ports and, by using this information, leverage it to successfully monitor the
botnets. Furthermore, using our scoring system, we show that we can extract
peers for each botnet with high accuracy.

numbers and sums of Fibonacci numbers. One of our main results says that for
every sufficiently large integer $k$ there exists a prime number that can be
represented as the sum of $k$ different and non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
This property is closely related to, and based on, a prime number theorem for
certain morphic sequences. The proof of such a prime number theorem, combined
with a corresponding local result, is the central contribution of this paper,
from which we derive the result stated in the beginning. Problems of this type
have been discussed intensively in the context of the base-$q$ expansion. The
Gelfond problems (1968/1969), and the Sarnak conjecture, were the driving
forces of this development. Mauduit and Rivat resolved the question on the sum
of digits of prime numbers (2010) and the sum of digits of squares (2009), thus
leaving open only part of the third Gelfond problem. Later the second author
(2017) proved Sarnak's conjecture for all automatic sequences, which are based
on the q-ary expansion of integers, and which generalize the sum-of-digits
function in base $q$ considerably. In order to obtain corresponding results for
Fibonacci numbers, we have to extend Mauduit and Rivat's method considerably.
In fact, we are departing significantly from this method, proving the statement
that $\exp(2\pi i \vartheta\mathsf z(n))$ has \emph{level of distribution} $1$
(here $\mathsf z(n)$ is the number of Fibonacci numbers needed to write $n$ as
their sum). This latter result forms an essential part of our treatment of the
occurring sums of type $\textrm I$ and $\textrm{II}$ and uses Gowers norms
related to $\mathsf z(n)$ as a central technical tool. The appearance of Gowers
norms in our method is intimately tied to the iterated application of a new
generalization of van der Corput's inequality.

multiphase fluid flow and boiling heat transfer in porous media with internal
heat generation. Although extremely relevant and important, only limited
studies are available in the open literature on the effects of coolant
subcooling in heat-generating porous media and hence, this requires a detailed
analysis. The analysis is carried out using a developed computational model of
multiphase fluid flow through clear fluid and porous media considering the
relevant heat transfer and mass transfer phenomena. Results suggest that the
qualitative nature of boiling heat transfer from the heat-generating porous
body, with subcooled coolants, remain similar to that observed with a saturated
coolant. Quantitative differences are, however, observed as a result of
solid-liquid convective heat transfer, and competing mechanisms of boiling and
condensation heat transfer, when subcooled liquid coolant is present. It is
observed that a substantially larger heating power density is required - as
coolant subcooling is increased - for achieving the same temperature rise in
the porous body. Dryout power density at different coolant subcooling is also
observed to follow a similar trend. The thermal energy removal limit is, hence,
observed to be substantially enhanced in presence of subcooled coolants.
Further, the dryout region within the porous body is observed to gradually
shift towards its interior as the coolant subcooling is increased.

large-scale balanced datasets but still performs poorly on real-world
long-tailed data. Previous methods often adopt class re-balanced training
strategies to effectively alleviate the imbalance issue, but might be a risk of
over-fitting tail classes. The recent decoupling method overcomes over-fitting
issues by using a multi-stage training scheme, yet, it is still incapable of
capturing tail class information in the feature learning stage. In this paper,
we show that soft label can serve as a powerful solution to incorporate label
correlation into a multi-stage training scheme for long-tailed recognition. The
intrinsic relation between classes embodied by soft labels turns out to be
helpful for long-tailed recognition by transferring knowledge from head to tail
classes.
  Specifically, we propose a conceptually simple yet particularly effective
multi-stage training scheme, termed as Self Supervised to Distillation (SSD).
This scheme is composed of two parts. First, we introduce a self-distillation
framework for long-tailed recognition, which can mine the label relation
automatically. Second, we present a new distillation label generation module
guided by self-supervision. The distilled labels integrate information from
both label and data domains that can model long-tailed distribution
effectively. We conduct extensive experiments and our method achieves the

probing the properties of axion-like particles. Due to the strong magnetic
fields of these sources, surface photons may partially convert into such
particles in the large magnetospheric region surrounding the stars, which will
result in distinctive signatures in their spectra. However, the interaction
depends on the polarization state of the radiation and is rather weak due to
the low experimentally allowed values of the coupling constant $g_{\gamma a}$.
In this work, we compute the degree of photon-axion transition in the case of
100% O-mode polarization and spectral energy distribution of an isotropic
blackbody with uniform surface temperature. The stellar magnetic field is
assumed to be dipolar. We show that with the maximum effect reached for the
magnetic fields $\sim10^{13}$ - $10^{14}$ G (typical for X-ray dim isolated
neutron stars) and $g_{\gamma a} = 2 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$, the optical
flux is reduced by 30 - 40%, while the high-energy part of the spectrum is not
affected. The low-energy decrease exceeds 5% at $g_{\gamma a} \geq 2 \times

via Markov decision processes (MDPs) or partially observable MDPs (POMDPs),
with application to artificial intelligence and operations research, among
others. Traditionally, policy synthesis techniques are proposed such that a
total expected cost or reward is minimized or maximized. However, optimality in
the total expected cost sense is only reasonable if system behavior in the
large number of runs is of interest, which has limited the use of such policies
in practical mission-critical scenarios, wherein large deviations from the
expected behavior may lead to mission failure. In this paper, we consider the
problem of designing policies for MDPs and POMDPs with objectives and
constraints in terms of dynamic coherent risk measures, which we refer to as
the constrained risk-averse problem. For MDPs, we reformulate the problem into
a infsup problem via the Lagrangian framework and propose an optimization-based
method to synthesize Markovian policies. For MDPs, we demonstrate that the
formulated optimization problems are in the form of difference convex programs
(DCPs) and can be solved by the disciplined convex-concave programming (DCCP)
framework. We show that these results generalize linear programs for
constrained MDPs with total discounted expected costs and constraints. For
POMDPs, we show that, if the coherent risk measures can be defined as a Markov
risk transition mapping, an infinite-dimensional optimization can be used to
design Markovian belief-based policies. For stochastic finite-state controllers
(FSCs), we show that the latter optimization simplifies to a
(finite-dimensional) DCP and can be solved by the DCCP framework. We
incorporate these DCPs in a policy iteration algorithm to design risk-averse
FSCs for POMDPs.

later recommendations catering to that polarisation. This latter contribution
calls for urgency in designing safer RL-based recommenders; the former suggests
that creating such safe recommenders will require a fundamental shift in design

at an optical interface, is intrinsically an incident-polarization-sensitive
phenomenon. Recently, an approach to eliminate the polarization dependence by
equalizing the reflection coefficients of two linear polarizations has been
proposed, but is only valid when the beam waist is sufficiently larger than the
wavelength. Here, we demonstrate that an interface, at which the reflection
coefficients of the two linear polarizations are the same and so are their
derivatives with respect to the incident angle, supports the
polarization-independent spin Hall shift, even when the beam waist is
comparable to the wavelength. In addition, an isotropic-anisotropic interface
that exhibits the polarization-independent spin Hall shift over the entire
range of incident angles is presented. Monte-Carlo simulations prove that spin
Hall shifts are degenerate under any polarization and reaches a half of beam
waist under unpolarized incidence. We suggest an application of the
beam-waist-scale spin Hall effect of light as a tunable beam-splitting device
that is responsive to the incident polarization. The spin Hall shift that is
independent of the incident polarization at any incident angle will facilitate
a wide range of applications including practical spin-dependent devices and
active beam splitters.

  atmospheres and oceans","Accepted for publication in AGU Advances",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The meridional temperature profile of the upper layers of planetary
atmospheres is set through a balance between differential radiative heating by
a nearby star, or by intrinsic heat fluxes emanating from the deep interior,
and the redistribution of that heat across latitudes by turbulent flows. These
flows spontaneously arise through baroclinic instability of the meridional
temperature gradients maintained by the forcing. When planetary curvature is
neglected, this turbulence takes the form of coherent vortices that mix the
meridional temperature profiles. However, the curvature of the planet favors
the emergence of Rossby waves and zonal jets that restrict the meridional
wandering of the fluid columns, thereby reducing the mixing efficiency across
latitudes. A similar situation arises in the ocean, where the baroclinic
instability of zonal currents leads to enhanced meridional heat transport by a
turbulent flow consisting of vortices and zonal jets. A recent scaling theory
for the turbulent heat transport by vortices is extended to include the impact
of planetary curvature, in the framework of the two-layer quasigeostrophic
beta-plane model. This leads to a quantitative parameterization providing the
meridional temperature profile in terms of the externally imposed heat flux in
an idealized model of planetary atmospheres and oceans. In addition, it
provides a quantitative prediction for the emergent criticality, i.e., the
degree of instability in a canonical model of planetary atmosphere or ocean.

built a maximally complete multi-wavelength dataset of these sources from
archival data from near-IR to millimetre wavelengths. We review the LBV
classification on the basis of the IR SED. To derive characteristic dust
parameters, we fitted the photometry resulting from a stacking analysis. For
comparison we also stacked the images of low- and intermediate-mass evolved
stars in the LMC. We find four classes of sources: 1) LBVs showing mid-IR dust
emission plus near-IR free-free emission from an ionised stellar wind (Class
1a) or only mid-IR dust emission (Class 1b); 2) LBVs with a near-IR excess due
to free-free emission only (Class 2); 3) objects with an sgB[e] classification;
and 4) objects with no detected stellar winds and no circumstellar matter in
their SEDs. From the stacking analysis of the 18 Class 1 and 2 objects in the
LMC, we derived an integrated dust mass of $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.03} M_\odot$. This
is two orders of magnitude larger than the value inferred from stacking 1342
extreme-AGB stars. The dust mass of individual LBVs does not correlate with the
stellar parameters, possibly suggesting that the dust production mechanism is
independent of the initial stellar mass or that the stars have different
evolutionary histories. The total dust yield from LBVs over the age of the LMC
is $\sim 10^4-10^5 M_\odot$. LBVs are potentially the second most important
source of dust in normal galaxies. The role of dust destruction in LBV nebulae
by a possible subsequent SN blast wave has yet to be determined. Recent
theoretical developments in the field of dust processing by SN shocks highlight
the potential survival of dust from the pre-existing circumstellar nebula.

factors that degrades the global model performance. However, there has been
very little research on if and how class imbalance can affect the global
performance. class imbalance in federated learning is much more complex than
that in traditional non-distributed machine learning, due to different class
imbalance situations at local clients. Class imbalance needs to be re-defined
in distributed learning environments. In this paper, first, we propose two new
metrics to define class imbalance -- the global class imbalance degree (MID)
and the local difference of class imbalance among clients (WCS). Then, we
conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of class imbalance on the
global performance in various scenarios based on our definition. Our results
show that a higher MID and a larger WCS degrade more the performance of the

  Accessible","Accepted at EMNLP 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Model robustness to bias is often determined by the generalization on
carefully designed out-of-distribution datasets. Recent debiasing methods in
natural language understanding (NLU) improve performance on such datasets by
pressuring models into making unbiased predictions. An underlying assumption
behind such methods is that this also leads to the discovery of more robust
features in the model's inner representations. We propose a general
probing-based framework that allows for post-hoc interpretation of biases in
language models, and use an information-theoretic approach to measure the
extractability of certain biases from the model's representations. We
experiment with several NLU datasets and known biases, and show that,
counter-intuitively, the more a language model is pushed towards a debiased
regime, the more bias is actually encoded in its inner representations.

To summarize more accurately and similar to human writing patterns, we applied
modified sentence reordering. We evaluated our proposed models on six

Given
graph $G$ is decomposable into $k$ odd subgraphs if its edge set can be
partitioned into $k$ subsets each of which induces an odd subgraph of $G$. The
minimum value of $k$ for which such a decomposition of $G$ exists is the odd
chromatic index, $\chi_{o}'(G)$, introduced by Pyber (1991). For every
$k\geq\chi_{o}'(G)$, the graph $G$ is said to be odd $k$-edge-colorable. Apart
from two particular exceptions, which are respectively odd $5$- and odd
$6$-edge-colorable, the rest of connected loopless graphs are odd
$4$-edge-colorable, and moreover one of the color classes can be reduced to
size $\leq2$. In addition, it has been conjectured that an odd
$4$-edge-coloring with a color class of size at most $1$ is always achievable.
Atanasov et al. (2016) characterized the class of subcubic graphs in terms of

characterization of all subdivisions of odd graphs in terms of the value of the

spectra have been widely studied. X-rays from the central star may play a
crucial role in the thermodynamics and chemistry of the circumstellar material
as well as in the atmospheric evolution of young planets. In this paper we
present model spectra based on spectral parameters derived from the
observations of young stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster from the Chandra Orion
Ultradeep Project (COUP). The spectra are then used to calculate new
photoevaporation prescriptions that can be used in disc and planet population
synthesis models. Our models clearly show that disc wind mass loss rates are
controlled by the stellar luminosity in the soft (100 eV - 1 keV) X- ray band.
New analytical relations are provided for the mass loss rates and profiles of
photoevaporative winds as a function of the luminosity in the soft X-ray band.
The agreement between observed and predicted transition disc statistics
moderately improved using the new spectra, but the observed population of
strongly accreting large cavity discs can still not be reproduced by these
models. Furthermore, our models predict a population of non-accreting
transition discs that are not observed. This highlights the importance of
considering the depletion of millimeter-sized dust grains from the outer disc,
which is a likely reason why such discs have not been detected yet.

[(CaCuO2)n(Ca2Fe2O5)m]N superlattices is also subject to the oxidizing
environment used during the cool-down procedure and therefore to a minimization
of oxygen vacancies within the CuO2 planes. The inserted Ca2Fe2O5 layers buffer
charge imbalances triggered by point defect formation during growth, minimizing
cationic defects in the infinite-layer CaCuO2 layers thus stabilizing
monolithic infinite-layer CaCuO2 slabs; embedding CaCuO2 within a superlattice
enables extended two-dimensional CuO2 planes and therefore superconductivity
while Ca2Fe2O5 serves similar to the charge-reservoir layers in the cuprate
superconductors synthesized from incongruent melts.

and then apply it in solving some PDE's originated from the fluid mechanics. In
more details, to our most interest are the incompressible homogeneous
Navier-Stokes equations. These equations have been investigated mathematically
for almost one century. Yet, the question of proving well-posedness (i.e.
existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions) lacks satisfactory answer. A
large part of the known positive results in connection with Navier-Stokes
equations are those in which the initial data $u_0$ is supposed to have a small
norm in some critical or scaling invariant functional space. All those spaces
are embedded in the homogeneous Besov space $\dot B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}.$. A
breakthrough was made in the paper [16] by Koch and Tataru, where the authors
showed the existence and the uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes
system in case when the norm $\|u_0\|_{\mathrm{BMO}^{-1}}$ is small enough. The
principal goal of these notes is to present a new proof of the theorem by Koch
and Tataru on the Navier-Stokes system, namely the one using the tent spaces
theory. We also hope that after having read these notes, the reader will be
convinced that the theory of tent spaces is highly likely to be useful in the
study of other equations in fluid mechanics. These notes are mainly based on
the content of the article [1] by P. Auscher and D. Frey. However, in [1] the
authors deal with a slightly more general system of parabolic equations of
Navier-Stokes type. Here we have chosen to write down a self-contained text
treating only the relatively easier case of the classical incompressible
homogeneous Navier-Stokes equations.

previous result is reconsidered, and it is shown that bridge splitting may
significantly increase the adhesion forces when one of the surfaces is rough.
The resistance to shear is also examined, and it is shown that bridge splitting
on a rough surface can lead to a steady capillary-induced shear force that
scales linearly with translation velocity, even in the absence of contact-line

using Schur's complement method. However,only the right-hand scaling
coefficients are computed for symmetric near-field matrix leading to saving of

scaling coefficients are just the transpose of the right-scaling blocks. Next,
the near-field blocks are replaced by scaled near-field diagonal blocks. Now
the scaled near-field blocks in combination with far-field and scaling
coefficients are subjected to power series solution terminating after only two
terms. As all the operations are performed on the near-field blocks, the
complexity of scaling coefficient computation is retained as O(N). The power
series solution only involves the matrix-vector product of the far-field,
scaling coefficients blocks, and inverse of scaled near-field blocks. Hence,
the solution cost remains O(NlogN). Several numerical results are presented to

is described by the unique entropy solution of a hyperbolic conservation law,
supplemented by a boundary condition depending on the range of $\beta$. Namely,
if $\beta \geqslant 0$, then the boundary condition prescribes the particle
current through the origin, whereas if $\beta<0$, the destruction of particles
at the origin has no macroscopic effect on the system and no boundary condition
is imposed at the hydrodynamic limit.

to the formation of ring-or disk-shaped phason trails inside dislocation loops.
To find the capture efficiency of point defects by a dislocation loop with the

pursued under two paradigms: task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, which
perform goal-oriented functions, and open-domain dialogue (ODD) systems, which
focus on non-goal-oriented chitchat. The two dialogue modes can potentially be
intertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as easily done by a
friendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in conversational agents,
as the integration makes them more accessible and useful. Our paper addresses
this problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn dialogues. Based on the
popular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset FusedChat, by rewriting
the existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This procedure constructs
conversation sessions containing exchanges from both dialogue modes. It
features inter-mode contextual dependency, i.e., the dialogue turns from the
two modes depend on each other. Rich dependency patterns including co-reference
and ellipsis are features. The new dataset, with 60k new human-written ODD
turns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a benchmark to test a dialogue
model's ability to perform inter-mode conversations. This is a more challenging
task since the model has to determine the appropriate dialogue mode and
generate the response based on the inter-mode context. But such models would
better mimic human-level conversation capabilities. We evaluate baseline models
on this task, including classification-based two-stage models and two-in-one
fused models. We publicly release FusedChat and the baselines to propel future

its various applications. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt an

autoregressively from left to right. Despite the convincing performance, the
speed is limited because of the one-by-one decoding strategy. As opposed to
autoregressive models, non-autoregressive models predict the results in
parallel with a much shorter inference time, but the accuracy falls behind the
autoregressive counterpart considerably. In this paper, we propose a Parallel,
Iterative and Mimicking Network (PIMNet) to balance accuracy and efficiency.
Specifically, PIMNet adopts a parallel attention mechanism to predict the text
faster and an iterative generation mechanism to make the predictions more
accurate. In each iteration, the context information is fully explored. To
improve learning of the hidden layer, we exploit the mimicking learning in the
training phase, where an additional autoregressive decoder is adopted and the
parallel decoder mimics the autoregressive decoder with fitting outputs of the
hidden layer. With the shared backbone between the two decoders, the proposed
PIMNet can be trained end-to-end without pre-training. During inference, the
branch of the autoregressive decoder is removed for a faster speed. Extensive
experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency

functional time series are further reduced into low-dimensional scalar factor
matrices. The dimensionally reduced factor matrices can reasonably convey
useful information in the original HDFTS. All the temporal dynamics contained

model can be regarded as a general case of several existing functional factor
models. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate the performance of the
proposed method in model fitting. In an empirical study of the Japanese

critical barriers in developing effective DRL models. Conventional exploration
strategy (e.g., the $\epsilon$-greedy) may barely work under such an

a mechanism by which electrons moving around the cold second harmonic ECR layer

series of computer vision tasks, yet they still suffer from adversarial
examples. % crafted in a similar fashion as CNNs. In this paper, we posit that
adversarial attacks on transformers should be specially tailored for their
architecture, jointly considering both patches and self-attention, in order to
achieve high transferability. More specifically, we introduce a dual attack
framework, which contains a Pay No Attention (PNA) attack and a PatchOut
attack, to improve the transferability of adversarial samples across different
ViTs. We show that skipping the gradients of attention during backpropagation
can generate adversarial examples with high transferability. In addition,
adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing randomly sampled subsets of
patches at each iteration achieve higher attack success rates than attacks
using all patches. We evaluate the transferability of attacks on
state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs. The results of these
experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual attack can greatly boost
transferability between ViTs and from ViTs to CNNs. In addition, the proposed
method can easily be combined with existing transfer methods to boost
performance. Code is available at https://github.com/zhipeng-wei/PNA-PatchOut.

experience, mainly VR sickness and overall comfort, while immersed in an
autonomously moving telepresence robot through a virtual reality headset. In
particular, we focus on how the robot turns and the distance it keeps from
objects, with the goal of planning suitable trajectories for an autonomously
moving immersive telepresence robot in mind; rotational acceleration is known
for causing the majority of VR sickness, and distance to objects modulates the
optical flow. We ran a within-subjects user study (n = 36, women = 18) in which
the participants watched three panoramic videos recorded in a virtual museum
while aboard an autonomously moving telepresence robot taking three different
paths varying in aspects such as turns, speeds, or distances to walls and
objects. We found a moderate correlation between the users' sickness as
measured by the SSQ and comfort on a 6-point Likert scale across all paths.
However, we detected no association between sickness and the choice of the most
comfortable path, showing that sickness is not the only factor affecting the
comfort of the user. The subjective experience of turn speed did not correlate
with either the SSQ scores or comfort, even though people often mentioned
turning speed as a source of discomfort in the open-ended questions. Through
exploring the open-ended answers more carefully, a possible reason is that the
length and lack of predictability also play a large role in making people
observe turns as uncomfortable. A larger subjective distance from walls and
objects increased comfort and decreased sickness both in quantitative and
qualitative data. Finally, the SSQ subscales and total weighted scores showed
differences by age group and by gender.

utility functions are continuous. These games typically have a highly
complicated structure of Nash equilibria, and numerical methods for the
equilibrium computation are known only for particular classes of continuous
games, such as two-player polynomial games or games in which pure equilibria
are guaranteed to exist. This contribution focuses on the computation and
approximation of a mixed strategy equilibrium for the whole class of
multiplayer general-sum continuous games. We vastly extend the scope of
applicability of the double oracle algorithm, initially designed and proved to
converge only for two-player zero-sum games. Specifically, we propose an
iterative strategy generation technique, which splits the original problem into
the master problem with only a finite subset of strategies being considered,
and the subproblem in which an oracle finds the best response of each player.
This simple method is guaranteed to recover an approximate equilibrium in
finitely many iterations. Further, we argue that the Wasserstein distance (the
earth mover's distance) is the right metric for the space of mixed strategies
for our purposes. Our main result is the convergence of this algorithm in the
Wasserstein distance to an equilibrium of the original continuous game. The
numerical experiments show the performance of our method on several classes of

method is based on two important properties of batch normalization statistics

separation and intra-class incohesion. To preserve this fine-grained
distribution information: 1) We calculate the per-class BNS of the calibration
dataset as the BNS centers of each class and propose a BNS-centralized loss to
force the synthetic data distributions of different classes to be close to
their own centers. 2) We add Gaussian noise into the centers to imitate the
incohesion and propose a BNS-distorted loss to force the synthetic data
distribution of the same class to be close to the distorted centers. By
utilizing these two fine-grained losses, our method manifests the

traditionally served as a minimal model for chaotic and intermittent
atmospheric motions, even the dynamics of the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection system is not fully represented by the Lorenz equations, and such
differences have yet to be clearly identified in a systematic manner. In this
paper, the convection problem is revisited through an investigation of various
dynamical behaviors exhibited by a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation
(DNS) and the generalized expansion of the Lorenz equations (GELE) derived by
considering additional higher-order harmonics in the spectral expansions of
periodic solutions. Notably, the GELE allows us to understand how nonlinear
interactions among high-order modes alter the dynamical features of the Lorenz
equations including fixed points, chaotic attractors, and periodic solutions.
It is verified that numerical solutions of the DNS can be recovered from the
solutions of GELE when we consider the system with sufficiently high-order
harmonics. At the lowest order, the classic Lorenz equations are recovered from
GELE. Unlike in the Lorenz equations, we observe limit tori, which are the
multi-dimensional analogue of limit cycles, in the solutions of the DNS and
GELE at high orders. Initial condition dependency in the DNS and Lorenz
equations is also discussed.

studies of several types of AR structures. The main goals are to investigate
whether ARs can be engaged in long-period oscillations as unified oscillatory
entities and, if so, to determine the spectral pattern of such oscillations.
Time series of characteristic parameters of the ARs, such as, the total area,
total unsigned radial magnetic flux, and tilt angle, were measured and recorded
using the image moment method. The power spectra were built out of
Gaussian-apodised and zero-padded datasets. There are long-period oscillations
ranging from 2 to 20 h, similarly to the characteristic lifetimes of
super-granulation, determined from the datasets of the AR total area and radial
magnetic flux, respectively. However, no periodicity in tilt angle data was
found. Whatever nature these oscillations have, they must be energetically
supported by convective motions beneath the solar surface. The possible
interpretations can be related to different types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
oscillations of the multi-scale structure of the AR magnetic field, which is
probably linked with the characteristic turnover timescales of the
super-granulation cells. The presence of oscillations in the radial magnetic
flux data may be connected to periodic flux emergence or cancellation

the estimation of instantaneous channels and the design of beamforming vectors

matrices may occur due to the change in the environment and the user location.
Although several works have proposed efficient algorithms to estimate the
channel covariance matrices after any change occurs, how to detect such a
change accurately and quickly is still an open problem in the literature. In
this paper, we focus on channel covariance change detection between a
multi-antenna base station (BS) and a single-antenna user equipment (UE). To
provide theoretical performance limit, we first propose a genie-aided change
detector based on the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test assuming the channel
covariance matrix after change is known, and characterize the corresponding
missed detection and false alarm probabilities. Then, this paper considers the
practical case where the channel covariance matrix after change is unknown. The
maximum likelihood (ML) estimation technique is used to predict the covariance
matrix based on the received pilot signals over a certain number of coherence
blocks, building upon which the LLR-based change detector is employed.
Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can detect the change with low
error probability even when the number of channel samples is small such that
the estimation of the covariance matrix is not that accurate. This result
verifies the possibility to detect the channel covariance change both
accurately and quickly in practice.

of recommenders that shift their focus from individual modeling to group
recommendation. Since the group preference is a mixture of various
predilections from group members, the fundamental challenge of group
recommendation is to model the correlations among members. Existing methods
mostly adopt heuristic or attention-based preference aggregation strategies to
synthesize group preferences. However, these models mainly focus on the
pairwise connections of users and ignore the complex high-order interactions
within and beyond groups. Besides, group recommendation suffers seriously from
the problem of data sparsity due to severely sparse group-item interactions. In
this paper, we propose a self-supervised hypergraph learning framework for
group recommendation to achieve two goals: (1) capturing the intra- and
inter-group interactions among users; (2) alleviating the data sparsity issue
with the raw data itself. Technically, for (1), a hierarchical hypergraph
convolutional network based on the user- and group-level hypergraphs is
developed to model the complex tuplewise correlations among users within and
beyond groups. For (2), we design a double-scale node dropout strategy to
create self-supervision signals that can regularize user representations with
different granularities against the sparsity issue. The experimental analysis
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed
model and also elucidates the rationality of the hypergraph modeling and the
double-scale self-supervision.

addresses MinMax mTSP, where the objective is to minimize the max tour length

large mTSP instances frequently, making the natural trade-off between computing
time and solution quality of great importance. However, exact and heuristic
algorithms become inefficient as the number of cities increases, due to their
computational complexity. Encouraged by the recent developments in deep
reinforcement learning (dRL), this work approaches the mTSP as a cooperative
task and introduces DAN, a decentralized attention-based neural method that
aims at tackling this key trade-off. In DAN, agents learn fully decentralized
policies to collaboratively construct a tour, by predicting each other's future

Recently, we proposed BinSketch, a sketching technique for compressing binary
vectors to binary vectors. In this paper, we show how to extend BinSketch and
use it for network hashing. Our proposal named QUINT is built upon BinSketch,
and it embeds nodes of a sparse network onto a low-dimensional space using
simple bi-wise operations. QUINT is the first of its kind that provides
tremendous gain in terms of speed and space usage without compromising much on
the accuracy of the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to
compare QUINT with seven state-of-the-art network embedding methods for two end
tasks - link prediction and node classification. We observe huge performance
gain for QUINT in terms of speedup (up to 7000x) and space saving (up to 80x)

consistent top-performer for both the tasks among the baselines across all the

QUINT retains enough structural information which can be used further to
approximate many topological properties of networks with high confidence.

chronology of Nedagolla indicates that this mixed NC-CC isotopic composition
was established relatively late, more than 7 million years after Solar System
formation. The mixed NC-CC isotopic composition is consistent with the chemical
composition of Nedagolla, which combines signatures of metal segregation under
more oxidizing conditions (relative depletions in Mo and W), characteristic for
CC bodies, and more reducing conditions (high Si and Cr contents),
characteristic for some NC bodies, in a single sample. These data combined
suggest that Nedagolla formed as the result of collisional mixing of NC and CC
core material, which partially re-equilibrated with silicate mantle material
that predominantly derives from the NC body. These mixing processes might have
occurred during a hit-and-run collision between two differentiated bodies,

minimizing the difference of two convex functions, has been found rich
applications in statistical learning and studied extensively for decades.
However, existing methods are primarily based on multi-stage convex relaxation,
only leading to weak optimality of critical points. This paper proposes a
coordinate descent method for minimizing a class of DC functions based on
sequential nonconvex approximation. Our approach iteratively solves a nonconvex
one-dimensional subproblem globally, and it is guaranteed to converge to a
coordinate-wise stationary point. We prove that this new optimality condition
is always stronger than the standard critical point condition and directional
point condition under a mild \textit{locally bounded nonconvexity assumption}.
For comparisons, we also include a naive variant of coordinate descent methods

\textit{Luo-Tseng error bound assumption}, coordinate descent methods achieve
\textit{Q-linear} convergence rate. Also, for many applications of interest, we

perturbation theory of correlated fermions. The Green functions are introduced
to implement systematically dynamical corrections to the static mean-field
theory. The renormalizations enter the perturbation theory via self-consistent
evaluations of one-particle and two-particle Green functions. The one-particle
self-consistency is discussed within the Baym-Kadanoff construction. We point
to an inherent dichotomy of the Baym-Kadanoff approach in the relation between
one and two-particle Green functions. They are the Schwinger-Dyson equation,
directly derived from the generating Luttinger-Ward functional, and the Ward
identity. The latter imposes a severe restriction on the two-particle
irreducible vertex and is not guaranteed in the Baym-Kadanoff approach. No
approximate theory is capable to obey both relations. I further discuss the
two-particle approach with two-particle renormalizations that offers a way to
reconcile the Schwinger-Dyson equation and the Ward identity. The two-particle
irreducible vertex from the critical Bethe-Salpeter equation becomes a
generating functional in the two-particle renormalization of the perturbation
theory. The irreducible vertex is used in the Ward identity to determine the
order parameter beyond the critical point and in the Bethe-Salpeter equation
representing the vertex of the Schwinger-Dyson equation to determine the
spectral self-energy in such a way that the thermodynamic critical behavior
from both equations is qualitatively the same. Finally, I discuss a static
mean-field-like approximation with a renormalized effective interaction
determined self-consistently that leads to a qualitatively correct description
of strong electron correlations in impurity and lattice models.

brain-computer interface (BCI). One-dimensional (1-D) EEG signal is yet easily
disturbed by certain artifacts (a.k.a. noise) due to the high temporal
resolution. Thus, it is crucial to remove the noise in received EEG signal.
Recently, deep learning-based EEG signal denoising approaches have achieved
impressive performance compared with traditional ones. It is well known that
the characteristics of self-similarity (including non-local and local ones) of
data (e.g., natural images and time-domain signals) are widely leveraged for
denoising. However, existing deep learning-based EEG signal denoising methods
ignore either the non-local self-similarity (e.g., 1-D convolutional neural
network) or local one (e.g., fully connected network and recurrent neural
network). To address this issue, we propose a novel 1-D EEG signal denoising
network with 2-D transformer, namely EEGDnet. Specifically, we comprehensively
take into account the non-local and local self-similarity of EEG signal through
the transformer module. By fusing non-local self-similarity in self-attention
blocks and local self-similarity in feed forward blocks, the negative impact
caused by noises and outliers can be reduced significantly. Extensive
experiments show that, compared with other state-of-the-art models, EEGDnet
achieves much better performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative
metrics.

performance as much as possible, and include parameter reduction techniques,
parameter quantization, and lossless compression techniques.
  In this chapter, we develop and describe a novel quantization paradigm for
DNNs: Our method leverages concepts of explainable AI (XAI) and concepts of
information theory: Instead of assigning weight values based on their distances
to the quantization clusters, the assignment function additionally considers
weight relevances obtained from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and the
information content of the clusters (entropy optimization). The ultimate goal
is to preserve the most relevant weights in quantization clusters of highest
information content.
  Experimental results show that this novel Entropy-Constrained and
XAI-adjusted Quantization (ECQ$^{\text{x}}$) method generates ultra
low-precision (2-5 bit) and simultaneously sparse neural networks while
maintaining or even improving model performance. Due to reduced parameter
precision and high number of zero-elements, the rendered networks are highly
compressible in terms of file size, up to $103\times$ compared to the
full-precision unquantized DNN model. Our approach was evaluated on different

used that aim at achieving acoustic transparency, i.e., listening with the
device in the ear is perceptually similar to the open ear. The equalization
filter needs to ensure that the superposition of the equalized signal played by
the device and the signal leaking through the device into the ear canal matches
a processed version of the signal reaching the eardrum of the open ear.
Depending on the processing delay of the hearing device, comb-filtering
artifacts can occur due to this superposition, which may degrade the perceived
sound quality. In this paper we propose a unified least-squares-based procedure
to design single- and multi-loudspeaker equalization filters for hearing
devices aiming at achieving acoustic transparency. To account for non-minimum
phase components, we introduce a so-called acausality management. To reduce
comb-filtering artifacts, we propose to use a frequency-dependent
regularization. Experimental results using measured acoustic transfer functions
from a multi-loudspeaker earpiece show that the proposed equalization filter

the impact of comb-filtering artifacts. A comparison between single- and

decouple classes from their dependencies in order to provide higher
modularization. However, bad DI practices often lead to negative consequences,
such as increasing coupling. Although white literature conjectures about the
existence of DI anti-patterns, there is no evidence on their practical
relevance, usefulness, and generality. Objective: The objective of this study
is to propose and evaluate a catalog of Java DI anti-patterns and associated
refactorings. Methodology: We reviewed existing reported DI anti-patterns in
order to analyze their completeness. The limitations found in literature
motivated proposing a novel catalog of 12 DI anti-patterns. We developed a tool
to statically analyze the occurrence level of the candidate DI anti-patterns in
both open-source and industry projects. Next, we survey practitioners to assess
their perception on the relevance, usefulness, and their willingness on
refactoring anti-pattern instances of the catalog. Results: Our static code
analyzer tool showed a relative recall of 92.19% and high average precision. It
revealed that at least 9 different DI anti-patterns appeared frequently in the
analyzed projects. Besides, our survey confirmed the perceived relevance of the
catalog and developers expressed their willingness to refactor instances of
anti-patterns from source code. Conclusion: The catalog contains Java DI
anti-patterns that occur in practice and that are perceived as useful. Sharing
it with practitioners may help them to avoid such anti-patterns, thus improving
source-code quality.

efficient retrieval of large-scale multi-modal data has become a trendy

first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not
able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that
all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle
unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this
paper, we propose a new model, termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS).
We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data, which could help

facilitated by offline states like sleep where previous experiences are

suggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying
previous experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical
architecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in
our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking
wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary
objective functions. We train the model on standard datasets of natural images
and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest
that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM
sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic
memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of
latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on
sleep states, memory replay and dreams and suggests a cortical implementation
of GANs.

there is an order relation $\le'$ on the clusters for which $[x] \le' |y]$. The
theory distinguishes itself from existing theories for clustering of ordered

bi-objective optimisation problem to obtain a hierarchical clustering seeking
to satisfy both. In particular, the order relation is weighted in the range
$[0,1]$, and if the similarity and the order relation are not aligned, then
order preservation may have to yield in favor of clustering. Finding an optimal

discriminative feature representations from complementary data modalities,
current progress is being slowed by the lack of large-scale modality-diverse
datasets. By leveraging the natural suitability of E-commerce, where different
modalities capture complementary semantic information, we contribute a
large-scale multi-modal pre-training dataset M5Product. The dataset comprises 5
modalities (image, text, table, video, and audio), covers over 6,000 categories
and 5,000 attributes, and is 500 larger than the largest publicly available
dataset with a similar number of modalities. Furthermore, M5Product contains
incomplete modality pairs and noise while also having a long-tailed
distribution, resembling most real-world problems. We further propose
Self-harmonized ContrAstive LEarning (SCALE), a novel pretraining framework
that integrates the different modalities into a unified model through an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism, where the importance of each modality is
learned directly from the modality embeddings and impacts the inter-modality
contrastive learning and masked tasks within a multi-modal transformer model.
We evaluate the current multi-modal pre-training state-of-the-art approaches
and benchmark their ability to learn from unlabeled data when faced with the
large number of modalities in the M5Product dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on four downstream tasks and demonstrate the superiority of our
SCALE model, providing insights into the importance of dataset scale and
diversity.

contemporary domain adaptation methods for cross-domain image understanding
perform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation
(WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario where source

marginal distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained
semantic structure in the embedding space, which have the problem of class
misalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near
features of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we
adopt the cluster assumption and learn cluster discriminatively with class
prototypes in the embedding space. We propose to leverage the location
information of the data points in the embedding space and model the location
information with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We
then design a network which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a
sub-module for unsupervised noise removal and propose a novel cluster-level
adversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target data with the less

conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on

substantially more numerous and especially promising to probe old stellar
populations.
  We aim to characterize the variability of SRVs, with focus on their
connection with Miras, in order to prepare the ground for investigating their
potential as distance indicators.
  We examine SRVs and Miras in the Magellanic Clouds from OGLE-III
observations, with data from Gaia and 2MASS. After cleaning the sample from
variability periods unrelated to pulsation, we classify each source by chemical
type and combination of pulsation modes. We examine the results in terms of
global photometric and pulsation properties.
  We identify four SRVs groups that fit the general evolutionary scenario
predicted by theory. SRVs dominated by fundamental-mode pulsation are very
similar to Miras, especially if mono-periodic. They further split into two
sub-groups, one of which follows the same sequence as Miras in the
period-luminosity and period-amplitude diagram, without discontinuity.
  The similarities between Miras and SRVs suggest that the latter can be
adopted as complementary distance indicators to the former, thereby at least
doubling the available number of LPVs suitable for use as distance indicators.
The traditional amplitude-based separation between Miras and SRVs is not
necessarily appropriate, and a more physically sound criterion should also
involve pulsation periods. While this would require comparatively longer time
series, they are expected to become accessible in the coming years even for
weak sources thanks to current and future large-scale surveys. The table of

also show that when covariates are not prognostic of the outcome,
l1-regularization remains as precise as the unadjusted estimator, even at small

is preserved for a few Gyr. It can grow together with a bar or appear later,
after bar formation. We considered two scenarios leading to the formation of
lopsided bars using controlled simulations. In the first, a Milky Way-like
galaxy interacts with a massive companion placed on a radial orbit in the plane
of the disk and perpendicular to the orientation of the bar at the time of the
first passage. In the second, the galaxy initially has an off-center disk and
the growth of the bar and its asymmetry is more similar to the one found in
IllustrisTNG galaxies, where it is also preceded by the presence of an
asymmetric disk. It is thus possible that lopsided bars are born in lopsided
disks, although in some cases, the time difference between the occurrence of
the asymmetry in the two components is quite large.

Hierarchical Neural Network (NHNN), a lightweight hierarchical neural network
model based on Bayesian nonparametric clustering. In comparison to Multitask
Learning approaches, the proposed model does not require domain/task labels. In
our experiments, the NHNN models generally outperform the models with similar
levels of complexity and state-of-the-art models in within-corpus and
cross-corpus tests. Through clustering analysis, we show that the NHNN models
are able to learn group-specific features and bridge the performance gap
between groups.

  general graphs","Updated reference",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a simple graph $G$, the {\it irregularity strength} of $G$, denoted by
$s(G)$, is the least positive integer $k$ such that there is a weight
assignment on edges $f: E(G) \to \{1,2,\dots, k\}$ attributing distinct
weighted degrees: $\tilde f(v):= \sum_{u: \{u,v\}\in E(G)} f(\{u,v\})$ to all
vertices $v\in V(G)$. It is straightforward that $s(G) \geq n/d$ for every
$d$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $d>1$. In 1987, Faudree and Lehel
conjectured in turn that there is an absolute constant $c$ such that $s(G) \leq
n/d + c$ for all such graphs. Even though the conjecture has remained open in
almost all relevant cases, it is more generally believed that there exists a
universal constant $c$ such that $s(G) \leq n/\delta + c$ for every graph $G$
on $n$ vertices with minimum degree $\delta \geq 1$ which does not contain an
isolated edge. In this paper we confirm that the generalized Faudree-Lehel
Conjecture holds for graphs with $\delta\geq n^\beta$ where $\beta$ is any
fixed constant larger than $0.8$. Furthermore, we confirm that the conjecture
holds in general asymptotically. That is we prove that for any
$\varepsilon\in(0,0.25)$ there exist absolute constants $c_1, c_2$ such that
for all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices with minimum degree %at least $\delta\geq 1$
and without isolated edges, $s(G) \leq
\frac{n}{\delta}(1+\frac{c_1}{\delta^{\varepsilon}})+c_2$, thus extending in
various aspects and strengthening a recent result of Przyby{\l}o, who showed
that $s(G) \leq \frac{n}{d}(1+
\frac{1}{\ln^{\epsilon/19}n})=\frac{n}{d}(1+o(1))$ for $d$-regular graphs with
$d\in [\ln^{1+\epsilon} n, n/\ln^{\epsilon}n]$, and improving an earlier
general upper bound: $s(G)< 6\frac{n}{\delta}+6$ of Kalkowski, Karo\'nski and
Pfender.

unsupervised sentence embedding. Among the previous un-supervised methods, the
latest state-of-the-art method, as far as we know, is unsupervised SimCSE
(unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE uses the InfoNCE1loss function in the training
stage by pulling semantically similar sentences together and pushing apart
dis-similar ones.Theoretically, we expect to use larger batches in unsup-SimCSE
to get more adequate comparisons among samples and avoid overfitting. However,
increasing the batch size does not always lead to improvements, but instead
even lead to performance degradation when the batch size exceeds a threshold.
Through statistical observation, we find that this is probably due to the
introduction of low-confidence negative pairs after in-creasing the batch size.
To alleviate this problem, we introduce a simple smoothing strategy upon the
InfoNCE loss function, termedGaussian Smoothing InfoNCE
(GS-InfoNCE).Specifically, we add random Gaussian noise vectors as negative
samples, which act asa smoothing of the negative sample space.Though being
simple, the proposed smooth-ing strategy brings substantial improvements to
unsup-SimCSE. We evaluate GS-InfoNCEon the standard semantic text similarity

to optimize the calls to the numerical codes to reduce the estimation costs.
Adaptive techniques can be used for this purpose, but in doing so, taking into

skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each
skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature
sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively
influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the
one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we
propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans
module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.
Specifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,
which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion
with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention
(named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to
effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.
Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace
the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate
automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our
UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves
consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation

significantly boost the data capacity and the secret key rate, respectively.
While the big potentials of light owning orbital angular momentum have been
widely ascertained, its technological deployment is still limited by the
difficulties deriving from the fabrication of integrated and scalable photonic
devices able to generate and manipulate it. Here, we present a photonic
integrated chip able to excite orbital angular momentum modes in an 800 m long
ring-core fiber, allowing us to perform parallel quantum key distribution using
2 and 3 different modes simultaneously. The experiment sets the first steps
towards quantum orbital angular momentum division multiplexing enabled by a

firmware package by modifying its content (e.g., injecting some malicious code)
and re-distributing it in the wild. In such a scenario, the firmware delivery
and update processes play a central role in ensuring firmware integrity.
Unfortunately, several existing solutions lack proper integrity verification,
exposing firmware to repackaging attacks. If this is not the case, they still
require an external trust anchor (e.g., signing keys or secure storage
technologies), which could limit their adoption in resource-constrained
environments. In addition, state-of-the-art frameworks do not cope with the
entire firmware production and delivery process, thereby failing to protect the
content generated by the firmware producers through the whole supply chain. To
mitigate such a problem, in this paper, we introduce PARIOT, a novel
self-protecting scheme for IoT that allows the injection of integrity checks,
called anti-tampering (AT) controls, directly into the firmware. The AT
controls enable the runtime detection of repackaging attempts without needing
external trust anchors or computationally expensive systems. PARIOT can be
adopted on top of existing state-of-the-art solutions ensuring the widest
compatibility with current IoT ecosystems and update frameworks. Also, we have
implemented this scheme into PARIOTIC, a prototype to automatically protect
C/C++ IoT firmware. The evaluation phase of 50 real-world firmware samples
demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed methodology and its robustness
against practical repackaging attacks without altering the firmware behavior or
severe overheads.

inconsistent reports. We show how fear of the uncertainty in the future
incentivizes the player to be truthful today. For Bernoulli distributions, we

verification framework for mechanized reasoning about the economic security
properties of composed decentralized-finance (DeFi) smart contracts. CFF
features three key properties. It is contract complete, meaning that it can
model any smart contract platform and all its contracts--Turing complete or
otherwise. It does so with asymptotically constant model overhead. It is also
attack-exhaustive by construction, meaning that it can automatically and
mechanically extract all possible economic attacks on users' cryptocurrency
across modeled contracts. Thanks to these properties, CFF can support multiple
goals: economic security analysis of contracts by developers, analysis of DeFi
trading risks by users, fees UX, and optimization of arbitrage opportunities by
bots or miners. Because CFF offers composability, it can support these goals
with reasoning over any desired set of potentially interacting smart contract
models. We instantiate CFF as an executable model for Ethereum contracts that
incorporates a state-of-the-art deductive verifier. Building on previous work,
we introduce extractable value (EV), a new formal notion of economic security
in composed DeFi contracts that is both a basis for CFF and of general
interest. We construct modular, human-readable, composable CFF models of four
popular, deployed DeFi protocols in Ethereum: Uniswap, Uniswap V2, Sushiswap,
and MakerDAO, representing a combined 24 billion USD in value as of March 2022.
We use these models along with some other common models such as flash loans,
airdrops and voting to show experimentally that CFF is practical and can drive
useful, data-based EV-based insights from real world transaction activity.
Without any explicitly programmed attack strategies, CFF uncovers on average an
expected $56 million of EV per month in the recent past.

of a dialogue system. Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems
that utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such
systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more
complex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take
uncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions
and less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often
evaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream
policy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in
neural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of
policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to
the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with
a user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating
these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the
robustness of the downstream dialogue policy. This highlights the importance of
developing neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account.

procedures is a critical task for aligning preoperative data with
intraoperative geometry for ensuring accurate surgical navigation. While the
finite element method (FEM) is a proven technique to effectively approximate
soft tissue deformation through biomechanical formulations, their degree of
success boils down to a trade-off between accuracy and speed. To circumvent
this problem, the most recent works in this domain have proposed leveraging
data-driven models obtained by training various machine learning algorithms --
e.g., random forests, artificial neural networks (ANNs) -- with the results of
finite element analysis (FEA) to speed up tissue deformation approximations by
prediction. These methods, however, do not account for the structure of the
finite element (FE) mesh during training that provides information on node
connectivities as well as the distance between them, which can aid with
approximating tissue deformation based on the proximity of force load points
with the rest of the mesh nodes. Therefore, this work proposes a novel
framework, PhysGNN, a data-driven model that approximates the solution of the
FEM by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), which are capable of accounting
for the mesh structural information and inductive learning over unstructured
grids and complex topological structures. Empirically, we demonstrate that the
proposed architecture, PhysGNN, promises accurate and fast soft tissue
deformation approximations, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
algorithms while promising enhanced computational feasibility, therefore

feed. One key problem is to allocate the limited slots in the feed to maximize
the overall revenue as well as improve user experience, which requires a good
model for user preference. Instead of modeling the influence of individual
items on user behaviors, the arrangement signal models the influence of the
arrangement of items and may lead to a better allocation strategy. However,
most of previous strategies fail to model such a signal and therefore result in
suboptimal performance. In addition, the percentage of ads exposed (PAE) is an
important indicator in ads allocation. Excessive PAE hurts user experience
while too low PAE reduces platform revenue. Therefore, how to constrain the PAE
within a certain range while keeping personalized recommendation under the PAE
constraint is a challenge. In this paper, we propose Cross Deep Q Network
(Cross DQN) to extract the crucial arrangement signal by crossing the
embeddings of different items and modeling the crossed sequence by
multi-channel attention. Besides, we propose an auxiliary loss for batch-level
constraint on PAE to tackle the above-mentioned challenge. Our model results in
higher revenue and better user experience than state-of-the-art baselines in

two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models of the shock surface. We
derive expressions of the standoff distances in 2D and 3D and of the normal to

  Two simple bow shock detection algorithms are constructed, one solely based
on a geometrical predictor from existing models, the other using this predicted
position to further refine it with the help of magnetometer data, an instrument
flown on many planetary missions.
  Both empirical techniques are applicable to any planetary environment with a
defined shock structure. Applied to the Martian environment and the NASA/MAVEN
mission, the predicted shock position is on average within 0.15 planetary
radius $R_p$ of the bow shock crossing. Using the predictor-corrector
algorithm, this estimate is further refined to within a few minutes of the true
crossing $\approx$0.05 $R_p$).
  Between 2014 and 2021, we detect 14,929 clear bow shock crossings,
predominantly quasi-perpendicular. Thanks to 2D conic and 3D quadratic fits, we
investigate the variability of the shock surface with respect to Mars Years

and $Z$ Mars Solar Orbital coordinates is on average small, we show that for
MY32 and MY35, Ls = [135-225$^\circ$] and high solar flux, it can become
particularly noticeable, and is superimposed to the usual North-South asymmetry
due in part to the presence of crustal magnetic fields.

due to their successful in estimating the robustness of NLP models. However,
existing works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a
single granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or
sentence-level), which is insufficient to explore the holistic textual space
for generation; (2) They need to query victim models hundreds of times to make
a successful attack, which is highly inefficient in practice. To address such
problems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to
effectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to
victim models. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement-learning based method to
train a multi-granularity attack agent through behavior cloning with the expert
knowledge from our MAYA algorithm to further reduce the query times.
Additionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only
output labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments
to evaluate our attack models by attacking BiLSTM, BERT and RoBERTa in two
different black-box attack settings and three benchmark datasets. Experimental
results show that our models achieve overall better attacking performance and
produce more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples compared to baseline
models. Besides, our adversarial attack agent significantly reduces the query
times in both attack settings. Our codes are released at

al. PacificVis 2016).
  In this paper, we study a hybrid visualization, which combines aspects of
word clouds and point labeling. In the considered setting, the input data
consists of a set of points grouped into categories and our aim is to place
multiple disjoint and axis-aligned rectangles, each representing a category,
such that they cover points of (mostly) the same category under some natural
quality constraints. In our visualization, we then place category names inside
the computed rectangles to produce a labeling of the covered points which
summarizes the predominant categories globally (in a word-cloud-like fashion)
while locally avoiding excessive misrepresentation of points (i.e., retaining
the precision of point labeling).
  We show that computing a minimum set of such rectangles is NP-hard. Hence, we
turn our attention to developing heuristics and exact SAT models to compute our
visualizations. We evaluate our algorithms quantitatively, measuring running
time and quality of the produced solutions, on several artificial and
real-world data sets. Our experiments show that the heuristics produce
solutions of comparable quality to the SAT models while running much faster.

spatial cross-correlation statistics for a reference set with known redshifts

simple parametrisation with an adaptive normalisation factor over the interval

GLF has a relatively constant power-law slope $\alpha \approx -1.2$ for $-17

alter unimolecular dissociation reaction rates when the cavity mode acts as a
reservoir for vibrational energy. We find a strong dependence on the initial

empty, the dissociation rate decreases, while when the cavity is initially
hotter than the molecule, the cavity can instead accelerate the reaction rate.
These results lay the foundation for further theoretical work toward
understanding the intriguing experimental results of vibrational polaritonic

biological processes, from cancer to ecology. The influential system of
equations introduced by Keller and Segel has proven a popular choice in the
modelling of such phenomena, but in its original form restricts to a
homogeneous population. To account for the possibility of phenotypic
heterogeneity, we extend to the case of a population continuously structured
across space, time and phenotype, where the latter determines variation in
chemotactic responsiveness, proliferation rate, and the level of chemical
environment modulation. The extended model considered here comprises a
non-local partial differential equation for the local phenotype distribution of
cells which is coupled, through an integral term, with a differential equation
for the concentration of an attractant, which is sensed and degraded by the
cells. In the framework of this model, we concentrate on a
chemotaxis/proliferation trade-off scenario, where the cell phenotypes span a
spectrum of states from highly-chemotactic but minimally-proliferative to
minimally-chemotactic but highly-proliferative. Using a combination of
numerical simulation and formal asymptotic analysis, we explore the properties
of travelling-wave solutions. The results of our study demonstrate how
incorporating phenotypic heterogeneity may lead to a highly-structured wave
profile, where cells in different phenotypic states dominate different spatial
positions across the invading wave, and clarify how the phenotypic structuring

answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up
models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning
using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.

  well as they seem to promise",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sigmoids (AKA s-curves or logistic curves) are commonly used in a diverse
spectrum of disciplines as models for time-varying phenomena showing initial
acceleration followed by slowing: technology diffusion, cumulative cases of an
epidemic, population growth towards a carrying capacity, etc. Existing work
demonstrates that retrospective fit of data is often impressive. We show that
in time series data, the future fit tends to be poor unless the data covers the
entire range from before to after the inflection point. We discuss the
theoretical reasons for this: the growth data provides little information about
the damping term (and vice-versa). As a consequence, forecasting with sigmoids
tends to be very unreliable. We suggest some practical approaches to improving
the viability of forecasting sigmoid models.

to build a classifier that can identify text complexity in order to present
Arabic language learners with texts suitable to their levels. The approach is
based on machine learning classification methods to discriminate between the
different levels of difficulty in reading and understanding a text. Several
models were trained on a large corpus mined from online Arabic websites and
manually annotated. The model uses both Count and TF-IDF representations and
applies five machine learning algorithms; Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli
Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest,
using unigrams and bigrams features. With the goal of extracting the text
complexity, the problem is usually addressed by formulating the level
identification as a classification task. Experimental results showed that
n-gram features could be indicative of the reading level of a text and could
substantially improve performance, and showed that SVM and Multinomial Naive
Bayes are the most accurate in predicting the complexity level. Best results
were achieved using TF-IDF Vectors trained by a combination of word-based
unigrams and bigrams with an overall accuracy of 87.14% over four classes of
complexity.

machine learning has had a dramatic impact on data centre energy consumption,
which has risen to environmentally significant levels. Using light to send
information between compute nodes can dramatically decrease this energy
consumption while simultaneously increasing bandwidth. Through
wavelength-division multiplexing with chip-based microresonator Kerr frequency
combs, independent information channels can be encoded onto many distinct
colours of light in the same optical fibre for massively parallel data
transmission with low energy. While previous demonstrations have relied on
benchtop equipment for filtering and modulating Kerr comb wavelength channels,
data centre interconnects require a compact on-chip form factor for these
operations. Here, we demonstrate the first integrated silicon photonic
transmitter using a Kerr comb source. The demonstrated architecture is scalable
to hundreds of wavelength channels, enabling a fundamentally new class of
massively parallel terabit-scale optical interconnects for future green

  BOTDA sensor","7 pages, 6 figures",,,,"eess.SP physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of Internet of Things, there is an urgent need for sensors with
large-scale sensing capability for scenarios such as intelligent monitoring of
production lines and urban infrastructure. Brillouin optical time domain
analysis (BOTDA) sensors, which can monitor thousands of continuous points
simultaneously, show great advantages in these applications. We propose a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the data of conventional
Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) sensors, which achieves
unprecedented performance improvement that allows to directly retrieve higher
spatial resolution (SR) from the sensing system that use long pump pulses. By
using the simulated Brillouin gain spectrums (BGSs) as the CNN input and the
corresponding high SR BFS as the output target, the trained CNN is able to
obtain a SR higher than the theoretical value determined by the pump pulse
width. In the experiment, the CNN accurately retrieves 0.5-m hotspots from the
measured BGS with pump pulses from 20 to 50 ns, and the acquired BFS is in
great agreement with 45/40 ns differential pulse-width pair (DPP) measurement
results. Compared with the DPP technique, the proposed CNN demonstrates a
2-fold improvement in BFS uncertainty with only half the measurement time. In
addition, by changing the training datasets, the proposed CNN can obtain
tunable high SR retrieval based on conventional BOTDA sensors that use long
pulses without any requirement of hardware modifications. The proposed data
post-processing approach paves the way to enable novel high spatial resolution
BOTDA sensors, which brings substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art
techniques in terms of system complexity, measurement time and reliability,
etc.

intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to
trade a good for which they hold private valuations. In this paper, we cast the
bilateral trade problem in a regret minimization framework over $T$ rounds of
seller/buyer interactions, with no prior knowledge on their private valuations.
Our main contribution is a complete characterization of the regret regimes for
fixed-price mechanisms with different feedback models and private valuations,
using as a benchmark the best fixed-price in hindsight. More precisely, we
prove the following tight bounds on the regret:
  - $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ for full-feedback (i.e., direct revelation mechanisms).
  - $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ for realistic feedback (i.e., posted-price mechanisms)
and independent seller/buyer valuations with bounded densities.
  - $\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and seller/buyer valuations with bounded
densities.
  - $\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and independent seller/buyer valuations.
  - $\Theta(T)$ for the adversarial setting.

spontaneously within a strongly-enough coupled theory. We treat a
field-theoretical quark model of QCD based on a linear+Coulomb Cornell
potential (to account for the longitudinal interaction), together with a
transverse interaction (to account for Coulomb-gauge gluons) in BCS
approximation. After extracting the well-known BCS ground state on which
abundant hadron phenomenology implementing dynamical chiral symmetry breaking
has been built, we find two excited replica vacuumlike states shown in figure
1. At the BCS level they are classically unstable, but second quantization
blocks transitions between them in volumes much larger than a hadron size.
Mesons built over the replica vacua have relative masses similar to normal
mesons on the ordinary vacuum; we find no negative-mass mode, confirming their
stability found earlier with a harmonic oscillator potential.

of partial differential equations are very attractive because they have much
lower geometrical requirements than standard body-fitted formulations. These
schemes do not require body-fitted unstructured mesh generation. In turn, the
numerical integration becomes more involved, because one has to compute
integrals on portions of cells (only the interior part). In practice, these
methods are restricted to level-set (implicit) geometrical representations,
which drastically limit their application. Complex geometries in industrial and
scientific problems are usually determined by (explicit) boundary
representations. In this work, we propose an automatic computational framework
for the discretisation of partial differential equations on domains defined by
oriented boundary meshes. The geometrical kernel that connects functional and
geometry representations generates a two-level integration mesh and a
refinement of the boundary mesh that enables the straightforward numerical
integration of all the terms in unfitted finite elements. The proposed
framework has been applied with success on all analysis-suitable oriented
boundary meshes (almost 5,000) in the Thingi10K database and combined with an
unfitted finite element formulation to discretise partial differential
equations on the corresponding domains.

of origin-destination flow maps (https://flowmapper.org). FlowMapper has four
major features that contribute to the advancement of existing flow mapping
systems. First, users can upload and process their own data to design and share
customized flow maps. The ability to save data, cartographic design and map
elements in a project file allows users to easily share their data and
cartographic design with others. Second, users can customize the flow line
symbology by including options to change the flow line style, width, and
coloring. FlowMapper includes algorithms for drawing curved line styles with
varying thickness along a flow line, which reduces the visual cluttering and
overlapping by tapering flow lines at origin and destination points. The
ability to customize flow symbology supports different flow map reading tasks
such as comparing flow magnitudes and directions and identifying flow and
location clusters that are strongly connected with each other. Third,
FlowMapper supports supplementary layers such as node symbol, choropleth, and
base maps to contextualize flow patterns with location references and
characteristics such as net-flow, gross flow, net-flow ratio, or a locational
attribute such as population density. FlowMapper also supports user
interactions to zoom, filter, and obtain details-on-demand functions to support
visual information seeking about nodes, flows and regions. Finally, the
web-based architecture of FlowMapper supports server side computational
capabilities to process, normalize and summarize large flow data to reveal
natural patterns of flows.
