  for indistinguishable homogeneous agents: a convex optimization approach","16 pages, 3 figures. Revision; in particular, somewhat larger updates
  to sections 3 and 6",,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The inverse linear-quadratic optimal control problem is a system
identification problem whose aim is to recover the quadratic cost function and
hence the closed-loop system matrices based on observations of optimal
trajectories. In this paper, the discrete-time, finite-horizon case is
considered, where the agents are also assumed to be homogeneous and
indistinguishable. The latter means that the agents all have the same dynamics
and objective functions and the observations are in terms of ""snap shots"" of
all agents at different time instants, but what is not known is ""which agent
moved where"" for consecutive observations. This absence of linked optimal
trajectories makes the problem challenging. We first show that this problem is
globally identifiable. Then, for the case of noiseless observations, we show
that the true cost matrix, and hence the closed-loop system matrices, can be
recovered as the unique global optimal solution to a convex optimization
problem. Next, for the case of noisy observations, we formulate an estimator as
the unique global optimal solution to a modified convex optimization problem.
Moreover, the statistical consistency of this estimator is shown. Finally, the
performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by a number of numerical
examples.

capture the corresponding relations among these multi-format knowledge, our
approach uses masked language model objective to learn word knowledge, uses
triple classification objective and title matching objective to learn entity

physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to
incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss
function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We
demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for
relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical
phenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze
several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning
differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We
provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves
PDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems,
including making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that
these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN
architecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to
optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure
modes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's
loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively
more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem
as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the
entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to
1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular
PINN training.

  Algorithms?","13+29 pages, 5+3 figures",,,"LA-UR-21-28574","quant-ph cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are widely viewed as the best hope for
near-term quantum advantage. However, recent studies have shown that noise can
severely limit the trainability of VQAs, e.g., by exponentially flattening the
cost landscape and suppressing the magnitudes of cost gradients. Error
Mitigation (EM) shows promise in reducing the impact of noise on near-term
devices. Thus, it is natural to ask whether EM can improve the trainability of
VQAs. In this work, we first show that, for a broad class of EM strategies,
exponential cost concentration cannot be resolved without committing
exponential resources elsewhere. This class of strategies includes as special
cases Zero Noise Extrapolation, Virtual Distillation, Probabilistic Error
Cancellation, and Clifford Data Regression. Second, we perform analytical and
numerical analysis of these EM protocols, and we find that some of them (e.g.,
Virtual Distillation) can make it harder to resolve cost function values
compared to running no EM at all. As a positive result, we do find numerical
evidence that Clifford Data Regression (CDR) can aid the training process in
certain settings where cost concentration is not too severe. Our results show
that care should be taken in applying EM protocols as they can either worsen or
not improve trainability. On the other hand, our positive results for CDR
highlight the possibility of engineering error mitigation methods to improve
trainability.

differs from the well-known Bell's nonlocality. For bipartite states, the RBN
concerns how much an element of reality associated with a given observable is
affected upon local measurements on a subsystem. Here, we present an analytical
proof for the unitary invariance of the RBN and that it presents a monotonous
behavior upon the action of unital and non-unital local quantum noise. We
illustrate our results by employing the two-qubits Werner state and thermal
quantum correlated states. We show how the RBN is limited by the initial
equilibrium temperature and, especially, that it decays asymptotically with it.
These results also corroborate the hierarchy relationship between the
quantifiers of RBN and global quantum discord, showing that RBN can capture
undetectable nonlocal aspects even for non-discordant states. Finally, we argue
how our results can be employed to use the RBN as a security tool in quantum

that by suitable measurement taken on one of the two system only1 the state of
the other system can not only be determined but steered too. That is, it
conveys the potential ability to steer the state of another physical system
without interacting with it by implementing independent measurements, this
nonlocal phenomenon was named steering. On the other hand, the first proposals
about the nonlocality of a single photon focus on showing the Bell nonlocality
by using a single photon path entanglement. This path entanglement of a single
photon was also used for analyzing and experimentally produce the steering of a
single photon. However, these established facts have been recently called into
question suggesting that single-photon entanglement is not non-local. In this
letter, we show that by incorporating and manipulating the internal degrees of
freedom of the photon, together with the external path, it is easy to
demonstrate the nonlocal effect of steering of a single photon's state. In this
sense, the experimental set-up that we propose differs from the one reported in
the quantum optics literature which only uses, to the best of our knowledge,
the path entanglement of photons for showing the steering phenomenon, i.e. here
we exploit the entanglement between the internal and external degrees of
freedom of the photon to show this nonlocal effect. The introduction of the
photon's internal degrees of freedom in the experimental set-up gives us new
insight, advantages and possibilities to control the nonlocal character of the
single-photon entangled state.

$\sim40$\%) already for a small voltage bias ($\sim 200$ $\mu$V) thanks to the
small energy scale of the system: the Al superconducting gap. With the help of
an analytical theoretical model we can link the maximum rectification to the
spin polarization of the barrier and describe the quasi-ideal Schottky-diode
behavior of the junction. This cryogenic spintronic rectifier is promising for
the application in highly-sensitive radiation detection for which two different

induces several peculiar features in their equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium

existence of universal scaling regimes, where diverse physical systems and
observables display quantitative agreement, generates a common framework, where
the efforts of different research communities can be -- in some cases
rigorously -- connected. Still, the application of this general framework to
particular experimental realisations requires the identification of the regimes
where the universality phenomenon is expected to appear. In the present review
we summarise the recent investigations of many-body quantum systems with
long-range interactions, which are currently realised in Rydberg atom arrays,
dipolar systems, trapped ion setups and cold atoms in cavity experiments. Our
main aim is to present and identify the common and (mostly) universal features
induced by long-range interactions in the behaviour of quantum many-body
systems. We will discuss both the case of very strong non-local couplings, i.e.
the non-additive regime, and the one in which energy is extensive, but
nevertheless low-energy, long wavelength properties are altered with respect to
the short-range limit. Cases of competition with other local effects in the

by presenting its lattice of theories as the image of a lattice homomorphism,
with certain properties ensuring that the resulting logic is finitary and
substitution invariant. Every finitary, substitution invariant logic arises
from a filter pair. Particular classes of logics can be characterized as
arising from special classes of filter pairs. We consider so-called congruence
filter pairs, i.e. filter pairs for which the domain of the lattice

the class of logics admitting a presentation by such a filter pair is exactly
the class of logics having an algebraic semantics. We study the properties of a
certain Galois connection coming with such filter pairs. We give criteria for a
congruence filter pair to present a logic in some classes of the Leibniz

Leibniz operator. As an application, we show a bridge theorem, stating that the

viewpoints. Recent approaches combine monocular depth networks with inpainting
networks to achieve compelling results. A drawback of these techniques is the
use of hard depth layering, making them unable to model intricate appearance
details such as thin hair-like structures. We present SLIDE, a modular and
unified system for single image 3D photography that uses a simple yet effective
soft layering strategy to better preserve appearance details in novel views. In
addition, we propose a novel depth-aware training strategy for our inpainting
module, better suited for the 3D photography task. The resulting SLIDE approach
is modular, enabling the use of other components such as segmentation and
matting for improved layering. At the same time, SLIDE uses an efficient
layered depth formulation that only requires a single forward pass through the
component networks to produce high quality 3D photos. Extensive experimental
analysis on three view-synthesis datasets, in combination with user studies on
in-the-wild image collections, demonstrate superior performance of our
technique in comparison to existing strong baselines while being conceptually

is the prevalence in the inner heliosphere of large amplitude, Alfv\'enic
magnetic field reversals termed 'switchbacks'. These $\delta B_R/B \sim
\mathcal{O}(1$) fluctuations occur on a range of timescales and in {\em
patches} separated by intervals of quiet, radial magnetic field. We use
measurements from PSP to demonstrate that patches of switchbacks are localized
within the extensions of plasma structures originating at the base of the
corona. These structures are characterized by an increase in alpha particle
abundance, Mach number, plasma $\beta$ and pressure, and by depletions in the
magnetic field magnitude and electron temperature. These intervals are in
pressure-balance, implying stationary spatial structure, and the field
depressions are consistent with overexpanded flux tubes. The structures are
asymmetric in Carrington longitude with a steeper leading edge and a small
($\sim$1$^\circ$) edge of hotter plasma and enhanced magnetic field
fluctuations. Some structures contain suprathermal ions to $\sim$85 keV that we
argue are the energetic tail of the solar wind alpha population. The structures
are separated in longitude by angular scales associated with supergranulation.
This suggests that these switchbacks originate near the leading edge of the
diverging magnetic field funnels associated with the network magnetic field -
the primary wind sources. We propose an origin of the magnetic field
switchbacks, hot plasma and suprathermals, alpha particles in interchange
reconnection events just above the solar transition region and our measurements
represent the extended regions of a turbulent outflow exhaust.

interactions is varied while preserving all original scaling symmetries and
inviscid invariants. Decreasing the value of $\lambda$ leads to a change in the
direction of the energy cascade at a critical value $\lambda_c \sim 0.3$. In
this work, we perform numerical simulations at varying $\lambda$ in the forward
energy cascade range and at changing the Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}$. We show
that for a fixed injection rate, as $\lambda \to \lambda_c$, the kinetic energy
diverges with a scaling law $\mathcal{E} \propto (\lambda-\lambda_c)^{-2/3}$.
The energy spectrum is shown to display a larger bottleneck as $\lambda$ is
decreased. The forward heterochiral flux and the inverse homochiral flux both
increase in amplitude as $\lambda_c$ is approached while keeping their
difference fixed and equal to the injection rate. As a result, very close to
$\lambda_c$ a stationary state is reached where the two opposite fluxes are of
much higher amplitude than the mean flux and large fluctuations are observed.
Furthermore, we show that intermittency as $\lambda_c$ is approached is
reduced. The possibility of obtaining a statistical description of regular
Navier-Stokes turbulence as an expansion around this newly found critical point
is discussed.

constrained optimisation, where we seek a low-complexity, data-dependent
selection set on which, with a guaranteed probability, the regression function
is uniformly at least as large as the threshold; subject to this constraint, we
would like the region to contain as much mass under the marginal feature
distribution as possible. This leads to a natural notion of regret, and our
main contribution is to determine the minimax optimal rate for this regret in
both the sample size and the Type I error probability. The rate involves a
delicate interplay between parameters that control the smoothness of the
regression function, as well as exponents that quantify the extent to which the
optimal selection set at the population level can be approximated by families
of well-behaved subsets. Finally, we expand the scope of our previous results

polarization between heteronuclei, particularly in biomolecular spectroscopy:
they are easy to setup and involve low power deposition. Still, these
short-pulse polarization transfers schemes are challenged by fast solvent
chemical exchange. An alternative to improve these heteronuclear transfers is
J-driven cross polarization (J-CP), which transfers polarization by
spin-locking the coupled spins under Hartmann-Hahn conditions. J-CP provides
certain immunity against chemical exchange and other T2-like relaxation
effects, a behavior that is here examined in depth by both Liouville-space
numerical and analytical derivations describing the transfer efficiency. While
superior to INEPT-based transfers, fast exchange may also slow down these J-CP
transfers, hurting their efficiency. This study therefore explores the
potential of repeated projective operations to improve 1H->15N and 1H->15N->13C
J-CP transfers in the presence of fast solvent chemical exchanges. It is found
that while repeating J-CP provides little 1H->15N transfer advantages over a
prolonged CP, multiple contacts that keep both the water and the labile protons
effectively spin-locked can improve 1H->15N->13C transfers in the presence of
chemical exchange. The ensuing Looped, Concatenated Cross Polarization (L-CCP)
compensates for single J-CP losses by relying on the 13C longer lifetimes,
leading to a kind of algorithmic cooling that can provide high polarization for
the 15N as well as carbonyl and alpha 13Cs. This can facilitate certain
experiments, as demonstrated with triple resonance experiments on intrinsically
disordered proteins involving labile, chemically exchanging protons.

polarization anisotropies and $\mu$-spectral distortions have been considered
to measure (squeezed) primordial scalar bispectra in a range of scales
inaccessible to primary CMB bispectra. In this work we address whether it is
possible to constrain tensor non-Gaussianities with these cross-correlations.
We find that only primordial tensor bispectra with statistical anisotropies
leave distinct signatures, while isotropic tensor bispectra leave either
vanishing or highly suppressed signatures. We discuss how the angular
dependence of squeezed bispectra in terms of the short and long momenta
determine the non-zero cross-correlations. We also discuss how these
non-vanishing configurations are affected by the way in which primordial
bispectra transform under parity. By employing the so-called BipoSH formalism
to capture the observational effects of statistical anisotropies, we make
Fisher-forecasts to assess the detection prospects from $\mu T$, $\mu E$ and
$\mu B$ cross-correlations. Observing statistical anisotropies in squeezed
$\langle \gamma \gamma \gamma\rangle$ and $\langle \gamma \gamma \zeta\rangle$
bispectra is going to be challenging as the imprint of tensor perturbations on
$\mu$-distortions is subdominant to scalar perturbations, therefore requiring a
large, independent amplification of the effect of tensor perturbations in the
$\mu$-epoch. In absence of such a mechanism, statistical anisotropies in
squeezed $\langle \zeta \zeta \gamma\rangle$ bispectrum are the most relevant
sources of $\mu T$, $\mu E$ and $\mu B$ cross-correlations. In particular, we
point out that in anisotropic inflationary models where $\langle \zeta \zeta
\zeta \rangle$ leaves potentially observable signatures in $\mu T$ and $\mu E$,
the detection prospects of $\langle \zeta \zeta \gamma\rangle$ from $\mu B$ are
enhanced.

with 90$^{\circ}$ turn angle between neighboring spins in the external magnetic
field. Such state is formed by the Eu spin layers in the superconducting iron
arsenide RbEuFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$. The peculiarity of this spin configuration is
that it is not realized in the standard Heisenberg model with bilinear exchange
interactions. A minimum model allowing for such a state requires the
biquadratic nearest-neighbor interaction term. In addition, in tetragonal
materials the 90$^\circ$ helix state may be stabilized by the in-plane
four-fold anisotropy term, which also fixes helix orientation with respect to
the crystal lattice. Such a system has a very rich behavior in the external
magnetic field. The magnetic field induces the metamagnetic transition to the
double-periodic state with the moment angles ($\alpha$, $\alpha$, $-\alpha$,
$-\alpha$) with respect to the field for the four subsequent spins. The
transition field to this state from the deformed helix is determined by the
strength of biquadratic interaction. The transition is second order for small
biquadratic coupling and becomes first order when this coupling exceeds the
critical value. On the other hand, the aligned state at high magnetic field
becomes unstable with respect to formation of incommensurate fan state which
transforms into the double-periodic state with decreasing magnetic field. The
range of this incommensurate state near the saturation field is proportional to
square of the biquadratic coupling. In addition, when the magnetic field is
applied along one of four the equilibrium moment directions, the deformed helix
state experience the first-order rotation transition at the field determined by
the four-fold anisotropy. rotation transition at the field determined by the

correspondence is reasonably well-defined in most cases. But what about
correspondence between two objects of completely different category -- e.g., a
shoe and a bottle? Does there exist any correspondence? Inspired by humans'
ability to: (a) generalize beyond semantic categories and; (b) infer functional

of correspondences between these two images for a given task? For example, what
are the correspondences between a bottle and shoe for the task of pounding or
the task of pouring. We introduce a new dataset: FunKPoint that has ground

a modular task-driven representation for attacking this problem and demonstrate
that our learned representation is effective for this task. But most
importantly, because our supervision signal is not bound by semantics, we show
that our learned representation can generalize better on few-shot

literature. In the context of mixture cure rate model, the standard approach to
model the effect of covariates on the cured or uncured probability is to use a
logistic function. This readily implies that the boundary classifying the cured
and uncured subjects is linear. In this paper, we propose a new mixture cure
rate model based on interval censored data that uses the support vector machine
(SVM) to model the effect of covariates on the uncured or the cured probability
(i.e., on the incidence part of the model). Our proposed model inherits the
features of the SVM and provides flexibility to capture classification
boundaries that are non-linear and more complex. Furthermore, the new model can
be used to model the effect of covariates on the incidence part when the
dimension of covariates is high. The latency part is modeled by a proportional
hazards structure. We develop an estimation procedure based on the expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the cured/uncured probability and the
latency model parameters. Our simulation study results show that the proposed
model performs better in capturing complex classification boundaries when
compared to the existing logistic regression based mixture cure rate model. We
also show that our model's ability to capture complex classification boundaries
improve the estimation results corresponding to the latency parameters. For
illustrative purpose, we present our analysis by applying the proposed
methodology to an interval censored data on smoking cessation.

observe mostly disjoint sets of attacks: 96% of IXP-inferred attacks were
invisible to a sizable honeypot platform. Second, we assess the effectiveness

detect new reflectors and purposefully rotate between them. At the same time,
we reveal that attackers are a small step away from bringing about
significantly higher amplification factors (14x). Third, we identify and
fingerprint a major attack entity by studying patterns in attack traces. We
show that this entity dominates the DNS amplification ecosystem by carrying out
59% of the attacks, and provide an in-depth analysis of its behavior over time.

takes into account the composite nature of the null hypothesis. PhyloMed
enables us to test the overall mediation effect of the entire microbial

Following this we perform qualitative analysis of the electronic properties to
understand the origin of this non-trivial behavior followed by the quantitative
analysis of the Z$_2$ classification which indicates that AgSrBi is a strong TI

were much more common in studies conducted with Java and C code. Conclusion: We
conclude that we can see a positive impact of the good API design on crypto
misuses for Python applications. Further, our analysis of MicroPython projects
reveals the importance of hybrid analyses.

algebra of BPS $G_2$ instantons. These are instantonic configurations that
govern the partition functions of 7d SYM theories on local $G_2$ holonomy
manifolds $\mathcal X$. To shed light on such structure, we begin investigating
the relation with parent 4d $\mathcal N=1$ theories obtained by geometric
engineering M-theory on $\mathcal X$. The main point of this paper is to
substantiate the following dream: the holomorphic sector of such theories on
multi-centered Taub-NUT spaces gives rise to an algebra whose characters
organise the $G_2$ instanton partition function. As a first step towards this
program, we argue by string duality that a multitude of geometries $\mathcal X$
exist that are dual to well-known 4d SCFTs arising from D3 branes probes of CY
cones: all these models are amenable to analysis along the lines suggested by
Dijkgraaf, Gukov, Neitzke and Vafa in the context of topological M-theory.
Moreover, we discuss an interesting relation to Costello's twisted M-theory,
which arises at local patches, and is a key ingredient in identifying the
relevant algebras.

muon $q/p_T$ distribution of a sample of $W \to \mu\nu$ decays and the $\phi^*$
distribution of a sample of $Z\to\mu\mu$ decays the $W$ boson mass is
determined to be \begin{equation*} m_{W} = 80354 \pm 23_{\rm stat} \pm 10_{\rm

uncertainties correspond to contributions from statistical, experimental
systematic, theoretical and parton distribution function sources. This is an
average of results based on three recent global parton distribution function
sets. The measurement agrees well with the prediction of the global electroweak
fit and with previous measurements.

the notion of the Rademacher symbol $\psi_{p,q}$, and provide several
characterizations. Among other things, we generalize Ghys's theorem for modular
knots around any ""missing"" torus knot $K_{p,q}$ in $S^3$ and in a lens space.

from a large offline dataset of robot interaction. In order to accomplish this,
humans need easy and effective ways of specifying tasks to the robot. Goal
images are one popular form of task specification, as they are already grounded
in the robot's observation space. However, goal images also have a number of
drawbacks: they are inconvenient for humans to provide, they can over-specify
the desired behavior leading to a sparse reward signal, or under-specify task
information in the case of non-goal reaching tasks. Natural language provides a
convenient and flexible alternative for task specification, but comes with the
challenge of grounding language in the robot's observation space. To scalably
learn this grounding we propose to leverage offline robot datasets (including
highly sub-optimal, autonomously collected data) with crowd-sourced natural
language labels. With this data, we learn a simple classifier which predicts if
a change in state completes a language instruction. This provides a
language-conditioned reward function that can then be used for offline
multi-task RL. In our experiments, we find that on language-conditioned
manipulation tasks our approach outperforms both goal-image specifications and
language conditioned imitation techniques by more than 25%, and is able to
perform visuomotor tasks from natural language, such as ""open the right drawer""
and ""move the stapler"", on a Franka Emika Panda robot.

graph representations without human annotations. Although remarkable progress
has been witnessed recently, the success behind GCL is still left somewhat

considerations within a general GCL paradigm, including augmentation functions,
contrasting modes, contrastive objectives, and negative mining techniques.
Then, to understand the interplay of different GCL components, we conduct
extensive, controlled experiments over a set of benchmark tasks on datasets
across various domains. Our empirical studies suggest a set of general receipts
for effective GCL, e.g., simple topology augmentations that produce sparse
graph views bring promising performance improvements; contrasting modes should
be aligned with the granularities of end tasks. In addition, to foster future
research and ease the implementation of GCL algorithms, we develop an
easy-to-use library PyGCL, featuring modularized CL components, standardized
evaluation, and experiment management. We envision this work to provide useful
empirical evidence of effective GCL algorithms and offer several insights for
future research.

status. Traditionally, activity data have been gathered using patient
self-report. However, these subjective data can suffer from bias and are
difficult to collect over long time periods. Smartphones offer an opportunity
to address these challenges. The smartphone has built-in sensors that can be
programmed to collect data objectively, unobtrusively, and continuously. Due to
their widespread adoption, smartphones are also accessible to most of the

extracting information optimally from multiple sensors to identify the unique
features of different activities. In our study, we analyze data collected by
the accelerometer and gyroscope, which measure the phone's acceleration and
angular velocity, respectively. We propose an extension to the ""movelet method""
that jointly incorporates both sensors. We also apply this joint-sensor method
to a data set we collected previously. The findings show that combining data
from the two sensors can result in more accurate activity recognition than
using each sensor alone. For example, the joint-sensor method reduces errors of
the gyroscope-only method in differentiating between standing and sitting. It
also reduces errors of the accelerometer-only method in classifying vigorous
activities.

investigate the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ and its relationship with the

Reducing temperature further produces a sharp upturn in $\kappa$, associated
with an increasing mean-free path. We identify this as the high-temperature

eventually is cut-off by other scattering effects, including phonons, disorder,

methods for automated SZ diagnosis via electroencephalography (EEG) signals.
The obtained results are compared with those of conventional intelligent

Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland, has been used. First, EEG signals
were divided into 25 s time frames and then were normalized by z-score or norm
L2. In the classification step, two different approaches were considered for SZ
diagnosis via EEG signals. In this step, the classification of EEG signals was
first carried out by conventional machine learning methods, e.g., support
vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, na\""ive Bayes, random
forest, extremely randomized trees, and bagging. Various proposed DL models,
namely, long short-term memories (LSTMs), one-dimensional convolutional
networks (1D-CNNs), and 1D-CNN-LSTMs, were used in the following. In this step,
the DL models were implemented and compared with different activation
functions. Among the proposed DL models, the CNN-LSTM architecture has had the
best performance. In this architecture, the ReLU activation function with the
z-score and L2-combined normalization was used. The proposed CNN-LSTM model has
achieved an accuracy percentage of 99.25%, better than the results of most

find that group normalization enhances the robustness of networks across

models across different datasets where statistics of image features change. We
also find that single-stage detectors do not generalize well to larger image

can easily be used on images of different sizes. We hope that our comprehensive

that the observed excesses at $400GeV$ in the $t \bar t$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$

directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of
matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the
learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system
firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on
its sparse SfM+MVS reconstruction from COLMAP. Then, we show that the
shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and
propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor
the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map
acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further
improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with
surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based
optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors. In

replicate. Recently, Blokhuis et al. gave a stoechiometric definition of
autocatalysis for reaction networks, stating the existence of a combination of
reactions such that the balance for all autocatalytic species is strictly
positive, and investigated minimal autocatalytic networks, called {\em
autocatalytic cores}. By contrast, spontaneous autocatalysis -- namely,
exponential amplification of all species internal to a reaction network,
starting from a diluted regime, i.e. low concentrations -- is a dynamical
property.
  We introduce here a topological condition (Top) for autocatalysis, namely:
restricting the reaction network description to highly diluted species, we
assume existence of a strongly connected component possessing at least one
reaction with multiple products (including multiple copies of a single
species). We find this condition to be necessary and sufficient for
stoechiometric autocatalysis. When degradation reactions have small enough
rates, the topological condition further ensures dynamical autocatalysis,
characterized by a strictly positive Lyapunov exponent giving the instantaneous
exponential growth rate of the system.
  The proof is generally based on the study of auxiliary Markov chains. We
provide as examples general autocatalytic cores of Type I and Type III in the
typology of Blokhuis et al. In a companion article, Lyapunov exponents and the
behavior in the growth regime are studied quantitatively beyond the present
diluted regime .

in learning representations that are transferable across a wide range of
downstream tasks. Different from the traditional representation learning that
is based mostly on discretized labels, vision-language pre-training aligns
images and texts in a common feature space, which allows zero-shot transfer to
a downstream task via prompting, i.e., classification weights are synthesized
from natural language describing classes of interest. In this work, we show
that a major challenge for deploying such models in practice is prompt
engineering, which requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming --
one needs to spend a significant amount of time on words tuning since a slight
change in wording could have a huge impact on performance. Inspired by recent
advances in prompt learning research in natural language processing (NLP), we
propose Context Optimization (CoOp), a simple approach specifically for
adapting CLIP-like vision-language models for downstream image recognition.
Concretely, CoOp models a prompt's context words with learnable vectors while
the entire pre-trained parameters are kept fixed. To handle different image
recognition tasks, we provide two implementations of CoOp: unified context and
class-specific context. Through extensive experiments on 11 datasets, we
demonstrate that CoOp requires as few as one or two shots to beat hand-crafted
prompts with a decent margin and is able to gain significant improvements over
prompt engineering with more shots, e.g., with 16 shots the average gain is
around 15% (with the highest reaching over 45%). Despite being a learning-based
approach, CoOp achieves superb domain generalization performance compared with
the zero-shot model using hand-crafted prompts.

often require large datasets for training and can fail spectacularly on

explores an alternative, hierarchical approach to sequence-to-sequence learning
with quasi-synchronous grammars, where each node in the target tree is
transduced by a node in the source tree. Both the source and target trees are
treated as latent and induced during training. We develop a neural
parameterization of the grammar which enables parameter sharing over the
combinatorial space of derivation rules without the need for manual feature
engineering. We apply this latent neural grammar to various domains -- a
diagnostic language navigation task designed to test for compositional

clothing that can move naturally. Despite progress on 3D scanning and modeling
of human bodies, there is still no technology that can easily turn a static
scan into an animatable avatar. Automating the creation of such avatars would
enable many applications in games, social networking, animation, and AR/VR to
name a few. The key problem is one of representation. Standard 3D meshes are
widely used in modeling the minimally-clothed body but do not readily capture
the complex topology of clothing. Recent interest has shifted to implicit
surface models for this task but they are computationally heavy and lack
compatibility with existing 3D tools. What is needed is a 3D representation
that can capture varied topology at high resolution and that can be learned
from data. We argue that this representation has been with us all along -- the
point cloud. Point clouds have properties of both implicit and explicit
representations that we exploit to model 3D garment geometry on a human body.
We train a neural network with a novel local clothing geometric feature to
represent the shape of different outfits. The network is trained from 3D point
clouds of many types of clothing, on many bodies, in many poses, and learns to
model pose-dependent clothing deformations. The geometry feature can be
optimized to fit a previously unseen scan of a person in clothing, enabling the
scan to be reposed realistically. Our model demonstrates superior quantitative
and qualitative results in both multi-outfit modeling and unseen outfit
animation. The code is available for research purposes.

the choice of the H-impact collisional data and oscillator strengths. The
forbidden [O I] line at 630 nm is less model-dependent, as it forms nearly in

strength for this transition is more uncertain than for the 777 nm lines.
Modelled in 3D NLTE with the Ni I blend, the 630 nm line yields an abundance of

unlensed sub-10-kpc binaries. We also analyse spectra of two images of the

studying microlensing and the quasar host galaxy. Signs of the PDLA are also
seen in the second source, however a deeper spectrum is still required to
confirm this. Thanks to the multiple lines-of-sight from lensing and two quasar

star formation originally given by Hernquist & Springel in 2003. The key
assumption of this formalism is that star formation proceeds from cold gas, at
a rate that is limited by an internal consumption timescale at early times, or
by the rate of generation of gas via cooling at late times. These processes are
analysed as a function of the mass of dark matter haloes and integrated over
the halo population. We modify this approach in two main ways to make it more
general: (1) halo collapse times are included explicitly, so that the behaviour
is physically reasonable at late times; (2) allowance is made for a
mass-dependent baryon fraction in haloes, which incorporates feedback effects.
This model reproduces the main features of the observed baryonic Tully-Fisher
relationship, and is consistent with observational estimates of the baryon mass
fraction in the intergalactic medium. With minimal adjustment of parameters,
our approach reproduces the observed history of cosmic star formation within a
factor of two over the redshift range $0 < z < 10$. This level of agreement is
comparable to that achieved by state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. Our
simplified apparatus has pedagogical value in illuminating the results of such
detailed calculations, and also serves as a means for rapid approximate
exploration of non-standard cosmological models.

gluing tools that allow us to reduce partitionability of a given complex to
that of smaller constituent relative subcomplexes such as the disk or the open

distinctive shelling/constructible flavor. We also give a tool to lift
partitionability of relative simplicial complexes to that of the preimages of

also allow us to evaluate which models are in accordance with observations. The
results already known to General Relativity must be reproduced to some extent

compositional generalization. Lastly, we find that key question difficulty
factors are: cascading errors from the retrieval component, frequency of

average, non-linear with the steepest gradients in the intermediate mass range
($\log(M/M_\sun) \sim 10$), flatter gradients for high-mass galaxies, and the
flattest gradients for low-mass galaxies. However, the general trend of
steepening N/O gradient for higher masses, reported in previous studies,

galaxy mean stellar age traced by the $D$(4000) index. For galaxies of lower
masses, both gradients are, generally, steeper for intermediate values of
$D$(4000) and flatter for low and high values of $D$(4000). Only the most

an evolution of the metallicity gradients with the age of stellar population.

since TLS is quite a burden for MQTT implementations on class-0 IoT devices.
Such a broker thus transparently interconnects securely and insecurely
connected devices; we argue that such mixed mode operation can actually be a
significant security problem: Clients can only control the security level of
their own connection to the broker, but they cannot enforce any protection
towards other clients. We describe an enhancement of such a publish/subscribe
mechanism to allow for enforcing specified security levels of publishers or
subscribers by only forwarding messages via connections which satisfy the
desired security levels. For example, a client publishing a message over a
secured channel can instruct the broker to forward the message exclusively to
subscribers that are securely connected. We prototypically implemented our

Biological tissues are nearly incompressible. However, standard methods employ

setting Poisson's ratio to be close to 0.5. This approach can produce results
that are plausible qualitatively but inaccurate quantatively. This approach
also causes numerical instabilities and locking in coarse discretizations or
otherwise poses a prohibitive restriction on the size of the time step. We
propose a novel approach to alleviate these issues by replacing indirect volume
preservation using Poisson's ratios with direct enforcement of zonal volume
constraints, while controlling fine-scale volumetric deformation through a
cell-wise compression penalty. To increase realism, we propose an epidermis
model to mimic the dramatically higher surface stiffness on real skinned

with precise volume preservation but without locking artifacts. Due to the
volume preservation not being tied to mesh discretization, our method also
allows a resolution consistent simulation of incompressible materials. Our

isotropic microdroplets with $N$ mobile DNA linkers results in spontaneous and
reversible self-organization of the DNA into $Z(N)$ binding patches, selecting
a predictable valence. We understand this valence thermodynamically, deriving a
free energy functional for droplet-droplet adhesion that accurately predicts
the equilibrium size of and molecular organization within patches, as well as
the observed valence transitions with $N$. Thus, microscopic self-organization
can be programmed by choosing the molecular properties and concentration of

the MO-FEM yields a multiterm Sylvester matrix equation where the additional

timeseries, we apply post-processing calculations using the Paperboats code. We
find that efficiency of dust destruction depends strongly on the rate of grain
shattering due to grain-grain collisions. The effective dust destruction is
similar to previous theoretical estimates when grain-grain collisions are
omitted, but with grain shattering included, the net destruction efficiency is
roughly one order of magnitude higher. This result indicates that the dust
destruction rate in the ISM may have been severely underestimated in previous

(Eri II), an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy that lies close to the Milky Way virial

Dark Energy Camera, plus $F475W, F606W, F814W$ space data from the Advanced
Camera for Surveys. We report the detection of 67 RR Lyrae (RRL) stars and 2
Anomalous Cepheids, most of them new discoveries. With the RRL stars, we
measure the distance modulus of Eri II, $\mu_0=22.84\pm 0.05$ mag
(D$_{\odot}=370\pm9$ kpc) and derive a metallicity spread of 0.3 dex (0.2 dex
intrinsic). The colour distribution of the horizontal branch (HB) and the
period distribution of the RRL stars can be nicely reproduced by a combination
of two stellar models of [Fe/H]=($-2.62$, $-2.14$). The overall low metallicity
is consistent with the red giant branch bump location, 0.65 mag brighter than
the HB. These results are in agreement with previous spectroscopic studies. The
more metal-rich RRL and the RRab stars have greater central concentration than
the more metal-poor RRL and the RRc stars that are mainly located outside $\sim
1$ r$_{\rm h}$. This is similar to what is found in larger dwarf galaxies such
as Sculptor, and in agreement with an outside-in galaxy formation scenario.
This is remarkable in such a faint dwarf galaxy with an apparently single and
extremely short ($<1$ Gyr) star formation burst. Finally, we have derived new
and independent structural parameters for Eri II and its star cluster using our
new data that are in very good agreement with previous estimates.

functions from agents in social environments. To model realistic social
dynamics, MIRL methods must account for suboptimal human reasoning and
behavior. Traditional formalisms of game theory provide computationally
tractable behavioral models, but assume agents have unrealistic cognitive
capabilities. This research identifies and compares mechanisms in MIRL methods
which a) handle noise, biases and heuristics in agent decision making and b)
model realistic equilibrium solution concepts. MIRL research is systematically
reviewed to identify solutions for these challenges. The methods and results of
these studies are analyzed and compared based on factors including performance
accuracy, efficiency, and descriptive quality. We found that the primary
methods for handling noise, biases and heuristics in MIRL were extensions of
Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) IRL to multi-agent settings. We also found that many
successful solution concepts are generalizations of the traditional Nash
Equilibrium (NE). These solutions include the correlated equilibrium, logistic
stochastic best response equilibrium and entropy regularized mean field NE.
Methods which use recursive reasoning or updating also perform well, including
the feedback NE and archive multi-agent adversarial IRL. Success in modeling
specific biases and heuristics in single-agent IRL and promising results using
a Theory of Mind approach in MIRL imply that modeling specific biases and
heuristics may be useful. Flexibility and unbiased inference in the identified
alternative solution concepts suggest that a solution concept which has both
recursive and generalized characteristics may perform well at modeling
realistic social interactions.

typically are symmetric (square, rectangular, or circular) and work well for
structured, dense sensor data such as pixel arrays (i.e., image). However,
symmetric shapes lead to pose ambiguity when using sparse sensor data such as
LiDAR point clouds and suffer from the quantization uncertainty of the LiDAR.
This paper introduces the concept of optimizing target shape to remove pose
ambiguity for LiDAR point clouds. A target is designed to induce large
gradients at edge points under rotation and translation relative to the LiDAR
to ameliorate the quantization uncertainty associated with point cloud
sparseness. Moreover, given a target shape, we present a means that leverages
the target's geometry to estimate the target's vertices while globally
estimating the pose. Both the simulation and the experimental results (verified
by a motion capture system) confirm that by using the optimal shape and the
global solver, we achieve centimeter error in translation and a few degrees in

suffer from vaccine distribution inequality and vaccine acceptance, leading to
insufficient public immunity provided by the vaccine products. While a major
current focus in vaccine acceptance research is how to model and inform vaccine
acceptance based on social-demographic parameters, characteristics of vaccine
acceptance are not well understood and in particular, it is not known whether
and how information diffusion influences vaccine acceptance. This study
examines how information diffusion can change vaccine acceptance by developing
a comprehensive computational model with an agent-based simulation technique to
overcome the modeling and quantification complexity associated with
socio-demographics, vaccine types, population statistics, and information
diffusion. Our analyses, calibrated by the vaccine acceptance survey data from
the provinces and territories of Canada, provide clear evidence that the
propagation of information can greatly influence vaccine acceptance rates. The
results illustrate that spread of negative messages about the COVID-19 vaccines
can cause significant vaccine hesitancy that challenges the goal of a high

occasionally reversibly bound to the surface and diffuse on it before reaching

its predictions are tested by Brownian Dynamics computer simulations. It is
found that the surface diffusion can be crucial in mediating the association to

the dynamical horizon geometry in a binary black hole merger scenario using
numerical relativity. First, in the inspiral phase, owing to the deformations,
the dynamical horizons of the two black holes are found to steadily acquire
multipole moments that vanish when the horizons are isolated. Out of these, the
dominant moment is found to be the quadrupole moment. Second, we show that they
encode detailed information about the dynamics of the binary black hole system.
The dominant quadrupole multipole moment is particularly shown to be strongly
correlated with the gravitational field of the system at future null infinity.
Therefore, the gravitational waves carried away from the system contain
information about the geometrical structure of the black holes in the
strong-field regime. Third, we also find that, in the post-merger phase, the
multipolar structure of the outer common dynamical horizon of the system is
strongly correlated with that of the individual horizons just before the
merger. The outer common horizon then settles down to equilibrium as suggested
by the decay of the multipole moments gained by the system through the inspiral
phase.

temperatures. Using line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry, we identify the
dominant contribution to the total flux emanating from Sn and Ga sources at
these temperatures to be due to the unintentional formation and evaporation of
the respective suboxides SnO and Ga$_{2}$O. We quantitatively describe this
phenomenon by a rate-equation model that takes into account the O background
pressure, the resulting formation of the suboxides via oxidation of the metal
source, and their subsequent thermally activated evaporation. As a result, the
total flux composed of the metal and the suboxide fluxes exhibit an
\textsf{S}-shape temperature dependence instead of the expected linear one in
an Arrhenius plot, in excellent agreement with the available experimental data.
Our model reveals that the thermally activated regimes at low and high
temperatures are almost exclusively due to suboxide and metal evaporation,
respectively, joined by an intermediate plateau-like regime in which the flux
is limited by the available amount of O. An important suboxide contribution is
expected for all elemental sources whose suboxide exhibits a higher vapor
pressure than the element, such as B, Ga, In, La, Si, Ge, Sn, Sb, Mo, Nb, Ru,
Ta, V, and W. This contribution can play a decisive role in the molecular beam
epitaxy of oxides, including multicomponent or complex oxides, from elemental
sources. Finally, our model predicts suboxide-dominated growth in low-pressure
chemical vapor deposition of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and In$_{2}$O$_{3}$.

consider the effect of these parameters on prediction quality. In this work, we
attempt to identify a robust set of parameters related to smearing and
tetrahedron methods that return numerically accurate and efficient results for
a wide variety of metallic systems. The effects of smearing and tetrahedron
methods on the total energy, number of self-consistent field cycles, and forces
on atoms are studied in two popular DFT codes: the Vienna Ab initio Simulation
Package (VASP) and Quantum Espresso (QE). From nearly 40,000 computations, it
is apparent that the optimal smearing depends on the system, smearing method,
smearing parameter, and $k$-point density. The benefit of smearing is a minor
reduction in the number of self-consistent field cycles, which is independent
of the smearing method or parameter. A large smearing parameter -- what is
considered large is system dependent -- leads to inaccurate total energies and
forces. Bl\""ochl's tetrahedron method leads to small improvements in total
energies. When treating diverse systems with the same input parameters, we
suggest using as little smearing as possible due to the system dependence of
smearing and the risk of selecting a parameter that gives inaccurate energies
and forces.

Floquet modes with momentum bands separated by gaps (rather than energy bands

in a PTC spontaneously emits radiation, and, when associated with momentum-gap

modulation of the refractive index. Moreover, under strong electron-photon
coupling, the quantum formulation reveals that the spontaneous emission into
the PTC bandgap experiences destructive quantum interference with the emission
of the electron into the PTC band modes, leading to suppression of the
interdependent emission. Free-electron physics in PTCs offers a new platform
for studying a plethora of exciting phenomena such as radiating dipoles moving
at relativistic speeds and highly efficient quantum interactions with free
electrons. Radiation emission in PTCs and its non-resonant nature hold the
promise for constructing new particle detectors with adjustable sensitivity and

node in a synchronous system starts with a binary input. The goal is to reach
agreement in the presence of Byzantine faulty nodes. We consider the setting
where communication between nodes is modelled via a directed hypergraph. In the
classical point-to-point communication model, the communication between nodes
is modelled as a simple graph where all messages sent on an edge are private
between the two endpoints of the edge. This allows a faulty node to equivocate,
i.e., lie differently to its different neighbors. Different models have been
proposed in the literature that weaken equivocation. In the local broadcast
model, every message transmitted by a node is received identically and
correctly by all of its neighbors. In the hypergraph model, every message
transmitted by a node on a hyperedge is received identically and correctly by
all nodes on the hyperedge. Tight network conditions are known for each of the
three cases for undirected (hyper)graphs. For the directed models, tight
conditions are known for the point-to-point and local broadcast models.
  In this work, we consider the directed hypergraph model that encompasses all
the models above. Each directed hyperedge consists of a single head (sender)
and at least one tail (receiver), This models a local multicast channel where
messages transmitted by the sender are received identically by all the
receivers in the hyperedge. For this model, we identify tight network
conditions for consensus. We observe how the directed hypergraph model reduces
to each of the three models above under specific conditions. In each case, we
relate our network condition to the corresponding known tight conditions. The
directed hypergraph model also encompasses other practical network models of
interest that have not been explored previously, as elaborated in the paper.

line emission. We identified 11 cores, whose masses range from 1.1 $M_\odot$ to
19.0 $M_\odot$. Ignoring magnetic fields, the virial parameters of the cores
are below unity, implying that the cores are gravitationally bound. However,
when magnetic fields are included, the prestellar cores are close to virial
equilibrium, while the protostellar cores remain sub-virialized. Star formation
activity has already started in this clump. Four collimated outflows are
detected in CO and SiO. H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH emission coincide with the
high-velocity components seen in the CO and SiO emission. The outflows are
randomly oriented for the natal filament and the magnetic field. The
position-velocity diagrams suggest that episodic mass ejection has already

load monitoring and decomposition of electrical equipment has been receiving
widespread attention from academia and industry. For the purpose of improving
the performance of non-intrusive load decomposition, a non-intrusive load
decomposition method based on a hybrid deep learning model is proposed. In this
method, first of all, the data set is normalized and preprocessed. Secondly, a
hybrid deep learning model integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with
long short-term memory network (LSTM) is constructed to fully excavate the
spatial and temporal characteristics of load data. Finally, different
evaluation indicators are used to analyze the mixture. The model is fully
evaluated, and contrasted with the traditional single deep learning model.
Experimental results on the open dataset UK-DALE show that the proposed
algorithm improves the performance of the whole network system. In this paper,
the proposed decomposition method is compared with the existing traditional
deep learning load decomposition method. At the same time, compared with the
obtained methods: spectral decomposition, EMS, LSTM-RNN, and other algorithms,
the accuracy of load decomposition is significantly improved, and the test
accuracy reaches 98%.

into an axisymmetric turbulent plume that contains dense particles with a
settling velocity that is considerably smaller than the plume velocity. We
consider the effect of particle size, particle concentration, and the
orientation of the plume buoyancy flux - either in the same or opposite
direction to the particle buoyancy flux. When the plume buoyancy flux is in the
opposite direction to the particle buoyancy flux, entrainment into the plume
increases by up to 40%. The rate of entrainment increases linearly with the
ratio of particle buoyancy flux to fluid buoyancy flux but does not depend on
the particle size. In contrast, when the plume buoyancy flux is in the same
direction as the particle buoyancy flux, entrainment into the plume is
unaffected by the addition of particles. The observed increase in entrainment,
when the plume and particle buoyancy fluxes are in opposite directions, is
consistent with inertial clustering whereby particles are ejected from regions
of relatively high vorticity and accumulate in regions of relatively high
strain rate within the turbulent flow field. Regions with high particle
concentration can then experience convective instabilities that affect the
entrainment of ambient fluid into the plume. The differing behaviour observed
based on the plume buoyancy flux orientation is also consistent with the above
mechanism. Finally, based on the laboratory findings, we propose a new
expression for the entrainment coefficient to take into account the effect of
suspended particles of opposing buoyancy flux to the plume buoyancy flux.

state estimation. State estimation for locomotion over dynamic rigid surfaces

remains under-explored, although state estimator designs for stationary rigid
surfaces have been extensively studied. Addressing DRS locomotion in state
estimation is a challenging problem mainly due to the nonlinear, hybrid nature
of walking dynamics, the nonstationary surface-foot contact points, and
hardware imperfections (e.g., limited availability, noise, and drift of onboard
sensors). Towards solving this problem, we introduce an Invariant Extended
Kalman Filter (InEKF) whose process and measurement models explicitly consider
the DRS movement and hybrid walking behaviors while respectively satisfying the
group-affine condition and invariant form. Due to these attractive properties,
the estimation error convergence of the filter is provably guaranteed for
hybrid DRS locomotion. The measurement model of the filter also exploits the
holonomic constraint associated with the support-foot and surface orientations,
under which the robot's yaw angle in the world becomes observable in the
presence of general DRS movement. Experimental results of bipedal walking on a
rocking treadmill demonstrate the proposed filter ensures the rapid error
convergence and observable base yaw angle.

applications in agricultural monitoring, and satellite imagery is becoming an

Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains
constrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised
classification models. When training data is not available in one region,
classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the
distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between
regions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that
uses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting
for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type
composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior
probabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for
shifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in
the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to
substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in
Western Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that
in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications
ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training
departments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were
6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was
statistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any type of
classifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve

flexibility by incentivizing consumers with dynamic prices. In this paper, we
quantify demand flexibility using an efficient tool called time-varying
elasticity, whose value may change depending on the prices and decision
dynamics. This tool is particularly useful for evaluating the demand response
potential and system reliability. Recent empirical evidences have highlighted
some abnormal features when studying demand flexibility, such as delayed
responses and vanishing elasticities after price spikes. Existing methods fail
to capture these complicated features because they heavily rely on some
predefined (often over-simplified) regression expressions. Instead, this paper
proposes a model-free methodology to automatically and accurately derive the
optimal estimation pattern. We further develop a two-stage estimation process
with Siamese long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Here, a LSTM network
encodes the price response, while the other network estimates the time-varying
elasticities. In the case study, the proposed framework and models are
validated to achieve higher overall estimation accuracy and better description
for various abnormal features when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

reduce the power consumption of neural network inference. A promising category
of accelerators utilizes nonvolatile memory arrays to both store weights and
perform $\textit{in situ}$ analog computation inside the array. While prior
work has explored the design space of analog accelerators to optimize
performance and energy efficiency, there is seldom a rigorous evaluation of the
accuracy of these accelerators. This work shows how architectural design
decisions, particularly in mapping neural network parameters to analog memory
cells, influence inference accuracy. When evaluated using ResNet50 on ImageNet,
the resilience of the system to analog non-idealities - cell programming
errors, analog-to-digital converter resolution, and array parasitic resistances
- all improve when analog quantities in the hardware are made proportional to
the weights in the network. Moreover, contrary to the assumptions of prior
work, nearly equivalent resilience to cell imprecision can be achieved by fully
storing weights as analog quantities, rather than spreading weight bits across
multiple devices, often referred to as bit slicing. By exploiting
proportionality, analog system designers have the freedom to match the
precision of the hardware to the needs of the algorithm, rather than attempting
to guarantee the same level of precision in the intermediate results as an
equivalent digital accelerator. This ultimately results in an analog
accelerator that is more accurate, more robust to analog errors, and more
energy-efficient.

the photon bubble instability. We present the results of two dimensional
radiation relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a non-accreting,
static atmosphere to study the development of this instability assuming
isotropic Thomson scattering in the slow diffusion regime that is relevant to
neutron star accretion columns. Photon bubbles generally grow faster toward
shorter wavelengths, until a maximum growth rate is achieved at the radiation
viscosity length scale, which is generally quite small and requires high
numerical resolution to simulate. We confirm the consistency between our
simulation results and linear theory in detail, and show that the nonlinear
evolution inevitably leads to collapse of the atmosphere with the higher
resolution simulation collapsing faster due to the presence of shorter length
scale nonlinear structures. At least in static atmospheres with horizontally
periodic boundary conditions, this resolution dependence may make simulations
of the nonlinear dynamics of photon bubble instability in neutron star

will persist upon inclusion of an accretion flow through the top and
magnetically-confined horizontal boundaries through which photons can escape.

mass-metallicity relationship, and the metallicities of observed UCDs are
consistent with those of simulated stripped nuclei for objects with M >
$10^{7}~M_{\odot}$. The colours of observed UCDs are also consistent with our
simulated stripped nuclei, for objects with M > $10^{7}~M_{\odot}$, with more
massive objects being redder. We find that the colours of stripped nuclei
exhibit a bimodal red and blue distribution that can be explained by the
dependency of colour on age and metallicity, and by the mass-colour relation.

with the colour of blue globular clusters. We conclude that the internal

model poisoning vulnerabilities to practically launch a new stealthy attack,
dubbed AdvTrojan. AdvTrojan is stealthy because it can be activated only when:
1) a carefully crafted adversarial perturbation is injected into the input
examples during inference, and 2) a Trojan backdoor is implanted during the
training process of the model. We leverage adversarial noise in the input space
to move Trojan-infected examples across the model decision boundary, making it
difficult to detect. The stealthiness behavior of AdvTrojan fools the users
into accidentally trust the infected model as a robust classifier against
adversarial examples. AdvTrojan can be implemented by only poisoning the
training data similar to conventional Trojan backdoor attacks. Our thorough
analysis and extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that
AdvTrojan can bypass existing defenses with a success rate close to 100% in
most of our experimental scenarios and can be extended to attack federated
learning tasks as well.

TeV detection has not yet been reported (either not yet observed, or observed
but not detected). Using two kinds of supervised machine-learning (SML)
methods, we searched for new possible TeV candidates (PTCs) among the
nondetected objects by assessing the similarity of their multi-wavelength
properties to existing TeV-detected objects. The classification results of the
two SML classifiers were combined and the 24 highest-confidence PTCs were
proposed as the best candidates. We calculate, here, the 12 year averaged Fermi
spectra of these PTCs and estimate their detectability by extrapolating the
Fermi spectrum and including the extragalactic background light attenuation.
Four candidates are suggested to have a high likelihood of being detected by
the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory and 24 are candidates for the

reduce the behavior of the system to the properties of a handful of parameters.
In neural circuits, these parameters are typically the firing rates of
distinct, homogeneous subgroups of neurons. Knowledge of the firing rates under
conditions of interest can reveal essential information on both the dynamics of
neural circuits and the way they can subserve brain function. The goal of this
chapter is to provide an elementary introduction to the mean field approach for
populations of spiking neurons. We introduce the general idea in networks of
binary neurons, starting from the most basic results and then generalizing to
more relevant situations. This allows to derive the mean field equations in a
simplified setting. We then derive the mean field equations for populations of
integrate-and-fire neurons. An effort is made to derive the main equations of
the theory using only elementary methods from calculus and probability theory.
The chapter ends with a discussion of the assumptions of the theory and some of
the consequences of violating those assumptions. This discussion includes an
introduction to balanced and metastable networks, and a brief catalogue of

simulate compressible inviscid/viscous flows with/without discontinuities. In
this method, based on the strong form equation, the divergence of the flux on
each vertex is computed directly from fluxes nearby by means of high order
least-square. In order to capture discontinuities, numerical flux of high order
accuracy is calculated on each edge and serves as supporting data of the
least-square computation of the divergence. The high accuracy of the numerical
flux depends on the high order WENO interpolation on each edge. To reduce the
computing cost and complexity, a curvlinear stencil is assembled for each edge
so that the economical one-dimensional WENO interpolation can be applied. With
the derivatives introduced, two-dimensional Hermite interpolation on a
curvilinear stencil is applied to keep the stencil compact and avoids using
many supporting points. In smooth region, the Hermite least-square 2D
interpolation of 5 nodes is adopted directly to achieve the fifth order
accuracy. Near a discontinuity, three values obtained by means of least-square
2D interpolation of 3 nodes, are weighted to obtain one value of the second
order accuracy. After obtaining the flow states on both sides of the middle
point of an edge, numerical flux of high order accuracy along the edge can be
calculated. For inviscid flux, analytical flux on vertices and numerical flux
along edges are used to compute the divergence. While for viscous flux, only
analytical viscous flux on vertices are used. The divergence of the fluxes and
their derivatives on each vertex are used to update the conservative variables
and their derivatives with an explicit Runger-Kutta time scheme. Several
canonical numerical cases were solved to test the accuracy and the capability
of shock capturing of this method.

applications (for example processing enormous amounts of images in real-time in
autonomous driving) tend to lead to excessive energy consumption for the end
users, whose devices are usually energy-constrained. In this context,
energy-efficiency becomes a critical challenge to be solved for harnessing
these promising applications to realize 'green' 6G networks. As a remedy,
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed for improving the
energy efficiency by beneficially reconfiguring the wireless propagation
environment. In conventional RIS solutions, however, the received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) sometimes may even become
degraded. This is because the signals impinging upon an RIS are typically
contaminated by interfering signals which are usually dynamic and unknown. To
address this issue, `learning' the properties of the surrounding spectral
environment is a promising solution, motivating the convergence of artificial
intelligence and spectrum sensing, termed here as spectrum learning (SL).
Inspired by this, we develop an SL-aided RIS framework for intelligently
exploiting the inherent characteristics of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum
for green 6G networks. Given the proposed framework, the RIS controller becomes
capable of intelligently `{think-and-decide}' whether to reflect or not the
incident signals. Therefore, the received SINR can be improved by dynamically
configuring the binary ON-OFF status of the RIS elements. The energy-efficiency
benefits attained are validated with the aid of a specific case study. Finally,
we conclude with a list of promising future research directions.

discriminability beyond visual concepts, which has been employed in Few-Shot
Learning (FSL) to achieve further gains. However, semantic information is only
available for labeled samples but absent for unlabeled samples, in which the
embeddings are rectified unilaterally by guiding the few labeled samples with
semantics. Therefore, it is inevitable to bring a cross-modal bias between
semantic-guided samples and nonsemantic-guided samples, which results in an
information asymmetry problem. To address this problem, we propose a
Modal-Alternating Propagation Network (MAP-Net) to supplement the absent
semantic information of unlabeled samples, which builds information symmetry
among all samples in both visual and semantic modalities. Specifically, the
MAP-Net transfers the neighbor information by the graph propagation to generate
the pseudo-semantics for unlabeled samples guided by the completed visual
relationships and rectify the feature embeddings. In addition, due to the large
discrepancy between visual and semantic modalities, we design a Relation
Guidance (RG) strategy to guide the visual relation vectors via semantics so
that the propagated information is more beneficial. Extensive experimental
results on three semantic-labeled datasets, i.e., Caltech-UCSD-Birds 200-2011,
SUN Attribute Database, and Oxford 102 Flower, have demonstrated that our
proposed method achieves promising performance and outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches, which indicates the necessity of information
symmetry.

threshold calibration circuit for the CMS Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) in the
High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. The discriminator threshold of the ETL readout
chip (ETROC) needs to be calibrated regularly to mitigate the circuit baseline
change. Traditional methods need a lot of communication through a slow control
system hence are time-consuming. This paper describes an in-pixel automatic
scheme with improvements in operating time and usability. In this scheme, a
sample-accumulation circuit is used to measure the average discriminator
output. A binary successive approximation and linear combination scan are
applied to find the equivalent baseline. The actual calibration procedure has
been first implemented in FPGA firmware and tested with the ETROC front-end
prototype chip (ETROC0). The calibration circuit has been implemented with
Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) and verified with Single Event Effects (SEEs)
simulation. A complete calibration process lasts 35 ms with a 40 MHz clock. In
the worst case, the dynamic and static power consumption are estimated to be
300 uW and 10.4 uW, respectively. The circuit design, implemented in a 65 CMOS
technology, will be integrated into ETROC2, the next iteration of the ETROC
with a 16x16 pixel matrix.

  Upgraded Classification of Discrete Fragment Populations","16 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The structure of the Kreutz system of sungrazing comets is shown to be much
more complex than formerly believed. Marsden's (1989) division into three
subgroups (I, II, IIa) is now greatly expanded, as new evidence is being
offered on nine populations of fragments -- I, Ia, II, IIa, III, Pre-I, Pe
(side branch of I), IIIa, and IV, incorporating carefully screened data sets
from a collection of gravitational orbits for 1500 SOHO/STEREO dwarf Kreutz
comets. Tight correlations between the nominal perihelion latitude and nominal
longitude of the ascending node are the result of ignored effects of an
outgassing-driven acceleration on the orbital motion. The average width of a
gap between adjacent populations in the corrected nodal longitude is near 9
deg; the overall range equals 66 deg. A self-consistent model postulates (i) an
initial breakup, in general proximity of aphelion, of a contact-binary parent
(progenitor) into its two lobes and the neck (originally linking the lobes),
giving birth to, respectively, Population I (Lobe I; the main residual mass
C/1843 D1), Population II (Lobe II; C/1882 R1), and Population Ia (the neck);
followed by (ii) progressive fragmentation of the lobes (primarily Lobe II),
mostly (but not exclusively) far from perihelion, giving successively rise to
the other populations and clusters of naked-eye Kreutz sungrazers and their
debris. The separation velocities were a few meters per second. Massive
fragments of Populations Pre-I, IIIa, and IV are yet to be discovered.
Relations among the products of cascading fragmentation are depicted in a
pedigree chart. The age of the Kreutz system is estimated at two millennia and
a mean orbital period of Lobe I and its main residual mass at ~740 yr. The
status is reviewed of the possible historical Kreutz comets seen in AD 1106, AD
363, and 372 BC.

invariant. We study the magnetic photonic crystal with a gap between the second

topological invariant that can be determined by symmetry-based indicators. We
show that under the space group No. 230 (Ia-3d), the topological invariant is
equal to half of the number of photonic bands below the gap, and therefore, the
band gap between the second and third lowest bands is always topologically
nontrivial, and to realize the topological phase, we need to open a gap for the
Dirac point at the P point by breaking time-reversal symmetry. With staggered
magnetization, the photonic bands are gapped, and the photonic crystal becomes
topological, whereas with uniform magnetization, a gap does not open, which can
be attributed to the minimal band connectivity exceeding two in this case. By
introducing the notion of Wyckoff positions, we show how the topological
characteristics are determined from the structure of the photonic crystals.

  Clean Data","Accepted by ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since training a large-scale backdoored model from scratch requires a large
training dataset, several recent attacks have considered to inject backdoors
into a trained clean model without altering model behaviors on the clean data.
Previous work finds that backdoors can be injected into a trained clean model
with Adversarial Weight Perturbation (AWP). Here AWPs refers to the variations
of parameters that are small in backdoor learning. In this work, we observe an
interesting phenomenon that the variations of parameters are always AWPs when
tuning the trained clean model to inject backdoors. We further provide
theoretical analysis to explain this phenomenon. We formulate the behavior of
maintaining accuracy on clean data as the consistency of backdoored models,
which includes both global consistency and instance-wise consistency. We
extensively analyze the effects of AWPs on the consistency of backdoored
models. In order to achieve better consistency, we propose a novel anchoring
loss to anchor or freeze the model behaviors on the clean data, with a
theoretical guarantee. Both the analytical and the empirical results validate
the effectiveness of the anchoring loss in improving the consistency,
especially the instance-wise consistency.

  Localization and Task-Decomposition",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The domain shift between the source and target domain is the main challenge
in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL). However, the target domain is
absolutely unknown during the training on the source domain, which results in
lacking directed guidance for target tasks. We observe that since there are
similar backgrounds in target domains, it can apply self-labeled samples as
prior tasks to transfer knowledge onto target tasks. To this end, we propose a
task-expansion-decomposition framework for CD-FSL, called Self-Taught (ST)
approach, which alleviates the problem of non-target guidance by constructing
task-oriented metric spaces. Specifically, Weakly Supervised Object
Localization (WSOL) and self-supervised technologies are employed to enrich
task-oriented samples by exchanging and rotating the discriminative regions,
which generates a more abundant task set. Then these tasks are decomposed into
several tasks to finish the task of few-shot recognition and rotation
classification. It helps to transfer the source knowledge onto the target tasks
and focus on discriminative regions. We conduct extensive experiments under the
cross-domain setting including 8 target domains: CUB, Cars, Places, Plantae,
CropDieases, EuroSAT, ISIC, and ChestX. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed ST approach is applicable to various metric-based models, and
provides promising improvements in CD-FSL.

  Detection and Segmentation in Medical Images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) that requires only normal (healthy)
training images is an important tool for enabling the development of medical
image analysis (MIA) applications, such as disease screening, since it is often
difficult to collect and annotate abnormal (or disease) images in MIA. However,
heavily relying on the normal images may cause the model training to overfit
the normal class. Self-supervised pre-training is an effective solution to this
problem. Unfortunately, current self-supervision methods adapted from computer
vision are sub-optimal for MIA applications because they do not explore MIA
domain knowledge for designing the pretext tasks or the training process. In
this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training method for UAD
designed for MIA applications, named Multi-class Strong Augmentation via
Contrastive Learning (MSACL). MSACL is based on a novel optimisation to
contrast normal and multiple classes of synthetised abnormal images, with each
class enforced to form a tight and dense cluster in terms of Euclidean distance
and cosine similarity, where abnormal images are formed by simulating a varying
number of lesions of different sizes and appearance in the normal images. In
the experiments, we show that our MSACL pre-training improves the accuracy of
SOTA UAD methods on many MIA benchmarks using colonoscopy, fundus screening and
Covid-19 Chest X-ray datasets.

  experiment",,,,"FERMILAB-PUB-21-391-ND","hep-ex physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will produce world-leading
neutrino oscillation measurements over the lifetime of the experiment. In this
work, we explore DUNE's sensitivity to observe charge-parity violation (CPV) in
the neutrino sector, and to resolve the mass ordering, for exposures of up to
100 kiloton-megawatt-years (kt-MW-yr). The analysis includes detailed
uncertainties on the flux prediction, the neutrino interaction model, and
detector effects. We demonstrate that DUNE will be able to unambiguously
resolve the neutrino mass ordering at a 3$\sigma$ (5$\sigma$) level, with a 66
(100) kt-MW-yr far detector exposure, and has the ability to make strong
statements at significantly shorter exposures depending on the true value of
other oscillation parameters. We also show that DUNE has the potential to make
a robust measurement of CPV at a 3$\sigma$ level with a 100 kt-MW-yr exposure
for the maximally CP-violating values $\delta_{\rm CP}} = \pm\pi/2$.
Additionally, the dependence of DUNE's sensitivity on the exposure taken in
neutrino-enhanced and antineutrino-enhanced running is discussed. An equal
fraction of exposure taken in each beam mode is found to be close to optimal
when considered over the entire space of interest.

  Recognition","ICCV 2021 (poster)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human pose is a useful feature for fine-grained sports action understanding.
However, pose estimators are often unreliable when run on sports video due to
domain shift and factors such as motion blur and occlusions. This leads to poor
accuracy when downstream tasks, such as action recognition, depend on pose.
End-to-end learning circumvents pose, but requires more labels to generalize.
  We introduce Video Pose Distillation (VPD), a weakly-supervised technique to
learn features for new video domains, such as individual sports that challenge
pose estimation. Under VPD, a student network learns to extract robust pose
features from RGB frames in the sports video, such that, whenever pose is
considered reliable, the features match the output of a pretrained teacher pose
detector. Our strategy retains the best of both pose and end-to-end worlds,
exploiting the rich visual patterns in raw video frames, while learning
features that agree with the athletes' pose and motion in the target video
domain to avoid over-fitting to patterns unrelated to athletes' motion.
  VPD features improve performance on few-shot, fine-grained action
recognition, retrieval, and detection tasks in four real-world sports video
datasets, without requiring additional ground-truth pose annotations.

partitioning them into disjoint clusters. Robust accuracy measures that
evaluate the goodness of clustering results are critical for algorithm
development and model diagnosis. Common problems of current clustering accuracy
measures include overlooking unmatched clusters, biases towards excessive
clusters, unstable baselines, and difficult interpretation. In this study, we
presented a novel accuracy measure, J-score, that addresses these issues.
  Methods. Given a data set with known class labels, J-score quantifies how
well the hypothetical clusters produced by clustering analysis recover the true
classes. It starts with bidirectional set matching to identify the
correspondence between true classes and hypothetical clusters based on Jaccard
index. It then computes two weighted sums of Jaccard indices measuring the
reconciliation from classes to clusters and vice versa. The final J-score is
the harmonic mean of the two weighted sums.
  Results. Via simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of J-score and
compared with existing measures. Our results show that J-score is effective in
distinguishing partition structures that differ only by unmatched clusters,
rewarding correct inference of class numbers, addressing biases towards
excessive clusters, and having a relatively stable baseline. The simplicity of
its calculation makes the interpretation straightforward. It is a valuable tool
complementary to other accuracy measures. We released an R/jScore package
implementing the algorithm.

For this purpose, we evolve the ideal GRMHD equations on top of an approximated
spacetime for the binary that is valid in every position of space, including
the black hole horizons, during the inspiral regime. We use relaxed initial
data for the circumbinary disk from a previous long-term simulation, where the
accretion is dominated by an $m=1$ overdensity called the lump. We compare our
new spinning simulation with a previous non-spinning run, studying how spin
influences the mini-disk properties. We analyze the accretion from the inner
edge of the lump to the black hole, focusing on the angular momentum budget of
the fluid around the mini-disks. We find that mini-disks in the spinning case
have more mass over a cycle than the non-spinning case. However, in both cases,
we find most of the mass received by the black holes is delivered by the direct
plunging of material from the lump. We also analyze the morphology and
variability of the electromagnetic fluxes and we find they share the same
periodicities of the accretion rate. In the spinning case, we find that the
outflows are $8$ times stronger than the non-spinning case. Our results will be
useful to understand and produce realistic synthetic light curves and spectra,
which can be used in future observations.

(RL) framework with novel rewards that facilitates unsupervised learning
avoiding tedious and impractical manual labelling for summarizing ultrasound
videos to enhance its utility as a triage tool in the emergency department (ED)
and for use in telemedicine. Using an attention ensemble of encoders, the high
dimensional image is projected into a low dimensional latent space in terms of:
a) reduced distance with a normal or abnormal class (classifier encoder), b)
following a topology of landmarks (segmentation encoder), and c) the distance
or topology agnostic latent representation (convolutional autoencoders). The
decoder is implemented using a bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM)
which utilizes the latent space representation from the encoder. Our new
paradigm for video summarization is capable of delivering classification labels
and segmentation of key landmarks for each of the summarized keyframes.
Validation is performed on lung ultrasound (LUS) dataset, that typically
represent potential use cases in telemedicine and ED triage acquired from
different medical centers across geographies (India, Spain and Canada).

features that arise from the complex nature of the energy spectrum. Under
periodic boundary conditions (PBC), the energy spectrum describes rather
generally closed loops in complex plane, characterized by integer nonzero
winding numbers. Such nontrivial winding provides the topological signature of
the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), i.e. the macroscopic condensation of bulk
states at the lattice edges under open boundary conditions (OBC). In spite of
the great relevance of band winding in the non-Hermitian topological band
theory and the related NHSE, most of current results rely on tight-binding
models of non-Hermitian systems, while exact Bloch wave function analysis of
the NHSE and related topological band theory is still lacking. While
tight-binding models can correctly describe narrow-band electronic states with
a relatively weak degree non-Hermiticity, they are not suited to describe
high-energy wide-band electronic states and/or regimes corresponding to strong
non-Hermiticity. Here we consider the single-particle continuous Schr\""odinger
equation in a periodic potential, in which non-Hermiticity is introduced by an
imaginary vector potential in the equation, and show that the NHSE is
ubiquitous under OBC and characterized by a non-vanishing integer winding
number, even thought the energy spectrum under PBC always comprises an open
curve, corresponding to high-energy electronic states. We also show that the
interior of the PBC energy spectrum corresponds to the complex eigenenergies

The need to maintain multiple platform-specific codebases further complicates

is interpreted as the bound state of $\bar{D}^{*0}D^0/\bar{D}^0D^{*0}$ and
$D^{*-}D^+/D^-D^{*+}$ channels. In a cutoff-independent formalism, we relate
the coupling constants of $X(3872)$ with the two channels to the molecular wave
function. The isospin violating decays of $X(3872)$ are obtained by two
equivalent approaches, which amend some deficiencies about this issue in
literature. In the quantum field theory approach, the isospin violating decays
arise from the coupling constants of $X(3872)$ to two di-meson channels. In the
quantum mechanics approach, the isospin violating is attributed to wave
functions at the origin. We illustrate that how to cure the insufficient
results in literature. Within the comprehensive analysis, we bridge the isospin
violating decays of $X(3872)$ to its inner structure. Our results show that the
proportion of the neutral channel in $X(3872)$ is over $80\%$. As a by-product,
we calculate the strong decay width of $X(3872)\to \bar{D}^0 D^0\pi^0$ and

baryons is reported using proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass
energy of $13\text{ TeV}$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$5.4\text{ fb}^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment. The $\Omega^{0}_{c}$ and
$\Xi^{0}_{c}$ baryons are produced directly from proton interactions and
reconstructed in the $pK^{-}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ final state. The $\Omega^{0}_{c}$
lifetime is measured to be $276.5\pm13.4\pm4.4\pm0.7\text{ fs}$, and the
$\Xi^{0}_{c}$ lifetime is measured to be $148.0\pm2.3\pm2.2\pm0.2\text{ fs}$,
where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the
third due to the uncertainty on the $D^{0}$ lifetime. These results confirm
previous LHCb measurements based on semileptonic beauty-hadron decays, which
disagree with earlier results of a four times shorter $\Omega^{0}_{c}$
lifetime, and provide the single most precise measurement of the
$\Omega^{0}_{c}$ lifetime.

introduced as a spectral- and energy-efficient architecture to assist wireless
communication systems. In the HRRIS, a single or few active relay elements are
deployed along with a large number of passive reflecting elements, allowing it
to not only reflect but also amplify the incident signals. In this work, we
investigate the potential of the HRRIS in aiding the computation offloading in
a single-user mobile edge computing system. The objective is to minimize the
offloading latency while ensuring the secrecy of user data against a malicious
eavesdropper. We develop efficient solutions to this latency minimization
problem based on alternating optimization. Through numerical results, we show
that the deployment of the HRRIS can result in a considerable reduction in
latency. Furthermore, the latency reduction gain offered by the HRRIS is much
more significant than that of the conventional reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS).

discovery in K2Cr3As3 single crystal that, the spin susceptibility measured by
75As Knight shift below Tc is unchanged with the magnetic field H0 applied in
the ab plane, but vanishes toward zero temperature when H0 is along the c axis,
which unambiguously establishes this compound as a spin-triplet superconductor

optical field is pivoted on the time reversal symmetry breaking. The symmetry
breaking happens in the cavity optomechanical system (COS) due to non uniform
radiation pressure as a result of light-matter interaction, and is crucial in
building non-reciprocal optical devices. In our proposed COS, we study the
non-reciprocal transport of optical signals across two ports via three optical
modes optomechanically coupled to the mechanical excitations of two
nano-mechanical resonators (NMRs) under the influence of strong classical drive
fields and weak probe fields. By tuning different system parameters, we
discover the conversion of reciprocal to non-reciprocal signal transmission. We
reveal perfect nonreciprocal transmission of output fields when the effective
cavity detuning parameters are near resonant to the NMRs' frequencies. The
unidirectional non-reciprocal signal transport is robust to the optomechanical
coupling parameters at resonance conditions. Moreover, the cavities' photon
loss rates play an inevitable role in the unidirectional flow of signal across
the two ports. Bidirectional transmission can be fully controlled by the phase
changes associated with the incoming probe and drive fields via two ports. Our
scheme may provide a foundation for the compact non-reciprocal communication
and quantum information processing, thus enabling new devices that route
photons in unconventional ways such as all-optical diodes, optical transistors
and optical switches.

swarm of interceptors to simultaneously capture a target capable of executing
various kinds of motions. Unlike leader-follower cooperative guidance
techniques, the swarm of interceptors has no leader and each interceptor
executes its own guidance command in a distributive fashion, thus obviating the
residency of the mission over a single interceptor. We first design cooperative
guidance commands subject to target's mobility, followed by the same when the
target is stationary, and also account for interceptors' changing topologies.
We further show through rigorous analysis that the proposed cooperative
guidance laws guarantee consensus in the interceptors' time-to-go values within
a predefined-time. The proposed design allows a feasible time of consensus in
time-to-go to be set arbitrarily at will during the design regardless of the
interceptors' initial time-to-go values, thereby ensuring a simultaneous target
interception. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed design via
simulations for interceptors connected over static and dynamic networks.

discovery. Generally, free energy gap is calculated between two states (e.g.,
ligand binding and unbinding). The energy gap implicitly includes the effects
of changes in protein dynamics induced by the binding ligand. However, the
relationship between protein dynamics and binding affinity remains unclear.
Here, we propose a novel method that represents protein behavioral change upon
ligand binding with a simple feature that can be used to predict protein-ligand
affinity. From unbiased molecular simulation data, an unsupervised deep
learning method measures the differences in protein dynamics at a
ligand-binding site depending on the bound ligands. A dimension-reduction
method extracts a dynamic feature that is strongly correlated to the binding
affinities. Moreover, the residues that play important roles in protein-ligand
interactions are specified based on their contribution to the differences.
These results indicate the potential for dynamics-based drug discovery.

protrusions, created by leader cells, in the monolayer boundary. Information
transmission and communication between individual entities in the cohesive
collective lead to long-range order, vortical structures, and disorder to
ordered phase transitions. We ask the following questions: what makes a leader?
What is the role of followers in leader cell formation? We used a
particle-based model to simulate epithelial cell migrations on substrates of
9.4 kPa, 21 kPa and 33 kPa stiffness. The dynamics of cellular motion in the
ensemble are governed by orientational Vicsek and inter-cellular interactions
between neighboring particles. The model also includes bending, curvature-based
motility, and acto-myosin contractile cable forces on the contour, in addition
to density dependent noise and cell proliferations. We show that border forces
are essential in the leader cell formation and the overall areal expansions of
epithelial monolayers on substrates. Radial velocities and areal expansions of
the monolayer agree with experiments reported for epithelial cells on
substrates of varied stiffness. Ordering in follower cells within a specific
region of the monolayer was apparent on substrates of higher stiffness and
occurred prior to the emergence of leader cells. We demonstrate that regions of
increased cell density occur behind the leader cell edge on all three
substrates. Finally, we assessed the role of cell divisions on the ordering of
velocities in the monolayer. These results demonstrate that monolayer
heterogeneities, caused by density instabilities in the interior regions,
correlate with leader cell formation during epithelial migrations.

known state of the art bounds of the form $\Omega(\log n/(k(n)\log\log n))$ for
similar combinatorial optimization problems, where $k(n)$ depends on the
optimality value. For example, for the largest clique problem $k(n)$
corresponds to the square of the size of the clique [Rossman 2010]. At the same
time our results are not quite comparable since in our case the circuits are
required to produce a solution itself rather than solving the associated

perturbations. Long-range limits result in a single parameter scaling of the
Lyapunov spectrum, with the inverse largest Lyapunov exponent being the only
diverging control parameter and the rescaled spectrum approaching an analytical
function. Short-range limits result in a dramatic slowing down of
thermalization which manifests through the rescaled Lyapunov spectrum
approaching a non-analytic function. An additional diverging length scale
controls the exponential suppression of all Lyapunov exponents relative to the
largest one.

systems. This introduces new risks for cyber attacks, which can compromise the
security and disrupt the functionality of these systems. It is therefore
necessary to build such systems with strong guarantees of resiliency against
cyber attacks. One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal
verification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber
security properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber
security and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM
into the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking and lightweight
FM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of
terms. We further develop categories based on the type of computing system FM
are applied in. Solutions in each class and category are presented, discussed,
compared and summarised. We describe historical highlights and developments and
present a state-of-the-art review in the area of FM in cyber security. This
review is presented from the point of view of FM practitioners and researchers,
commenting on the trends in each of the classes and categories. This is
achieved by considering all types of FM, several types of security and safety
critical systems and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article hence
provides a comprehensive overview of FM and techniques available to system
designers of security-critical systems, simplifying the process of choosing the
right tool for the task. The article concludes by summarising the discussion of
the review, focusing on best practices, challenges, general future trends and
directions of research within this field.

study the effect of adding an inner-loop controller using the incremental
nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) method, and the effect of adding an

executed properly, transfer learning algorithms can impair the learning
performance instead of improving it -- commonly known as negative transfer. In
this paper, we study transfer learning from a Bayesian perspective, where a
parametric statistical model is used. Specifically, we study three variants of
transfer learning problems, instantaneous, online, and time-variant transfer
learning. For each problem, we define an appropriate objective function, and
provide either exact expressions or upper bounds on the learning performance
using information-theoretic quantities, which allow simple and explicit
characterizations when the sample size becomes large. Furthermore, examples
show that the derived bounds are accurate even for small sample sizes. The
obtained bounds give valuable insights into the effect of prior knowledge for
transfer learning, at least with respect to our Bayesian formulation of the
transfer learning problem. In particular, we formally characterize the
conditions under which negative transfer occurs. Lastly, we devise two (online)
transfer learning algorithms that are amenable to practical implementations,
one of which does not require the parametric assumption. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithms with real data sets, focusing primarily on when

$(n+1)$-qubit GHZ states and the operations of measure-flip and reflect, the
proposed protocol can use the measured and reflected qubits as the secret keys
instead of only the measured qubits in the previous MSQSS protocols. This
provides an idea to improve the qubit efficiency when extending semi quantum
protocol to the multi-party case. Compared with similar studies, the proposed

automatically analyzing and categorizing information from complex computer
simulations. Here we design an ensemble machine learning framework that can
independently and robustly categorize and dissect simulation data output
contents of turbulent flow patterns into distinct structure catalogues. The
segmentation is performed using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, which
segments physical structures by grouping together similar pixels in simulation
images. The accuracy and robustness of the resulting segment region boundaries
are enhanced by combining information from multiple simultaneously-evaluated
clustering operations. The stacking of object segmentation evaluations is
performed using image mask combination operations. This statistically-combined
ensemble (SCE) of different cluster masks allows us to construct cluster
reliability metrics for each pixel and for the associated segments without any
prior user input. By comparing the similarity of different cluster occurrences
in the ensemble, we can also assess the optimal number of clusters needed to
describe the data. Furthermore, by relying on ensemble-averaged spatial segment
region boundaries, the SCE method enables reconstruction of more accurate and
robust region of interest (ROI) boundaries for the different image data
clusters. We apply the SCE algorithm to 2-dimensional simulation data snapshots
of magnetically-dominated fully-kinetic turbulent plasma flows where accurate
ROI boundaries are needed for geometrical measurements of intermittent flow
structures known as current sheets.

  Welding Training Tasks",,,,,"cs.HC cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents the development of a multi-sensor user interface to
facilitate the instruction of arc welding tasks. Traditional methods to acquire
hand-eye coordination skills are typically conducted through one-to-one
instruction where trainees must wear protective helmets and conduct several
tests. This approach is inefficient as the harmful light emitted from the
electric arc impedes the close monitoring of the process; Practitioners can
only observe a small bright spot. To tackle these problems, recent training
approaches have leveraged virtual reality to safely simulate the process and
visualize the geometry of the workpieces. However, the synthetic nature of
these types of simulation platforms reduces their effectiveness as they fail to
comprise actual welding interactions with the environment, which hinders the
trainees' learning process. To provide users with a real welding experience, we
have developed a new multi-sensor extended reality platform for arc welding
training. Our system is composed of: (1) An HDR camera, monitoring the real
welding spot in real-time; (2) A depth sensor, capturing the 3D geometry of the
scene; and (3) A head-mounted VR display, visualizing the process safely. Our
innovative platform provides users with a ""bot trainer"", virtual cues of the
seam geometry, automatic spot tracking, and performance scores. To validate the
platform's feasibility, we conduct extensive experiments with several welding
training tasks. We show that compared with the traditional training practice
and recent virtual reality approaches, our automated multi-sensor method
achieves better performances in terms of accuracy, learning curve, and
effectiveness.

iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human

in a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as
human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI
frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we
show that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing
human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:
given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class
c_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,
stripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,
that need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification
category of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the
iterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our
framework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to
understand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating
that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI

are a separate category to Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies, or just their
natural continuation towards low stellar masses. In this letter, we show that
the rotation curve of the gas rich UDG AGC 242019 is well fit by a dark matter
halo with inner slope that asymptotes to -0.54, and that such fit provides a
concentration parameter that matches theoretical expectations. This finding,
together with previously works in which shallow inner profiles are derived for
UDGs, shows that the structural properties of these galaxies are like other
observed LSBs. UDGs show slowly rising rotation curves and this favours
formation scenarios in which internal processes, such as SNae driven gas
outflows, are acting to modify UDGs profiles.

real-time hyperspectral imaging system for surgical decision-making possible.
However, optimal exploitation of the captured data requires solving an
ill-posed demosaicking problem and applying additional spectral corrections to
recover spatial and spectral information of the image. In this work, we propose
a deep learning-based image demosaicking algorithm for snapshot hyperspectral

medical images acquired with snapshot mosaic cameras, a synthetic image
generation approach is proposed to simulate snapshot images from existing
medical image datasets captured by high-resolution, but slow, hyperspectral
imaging devices. Image reconstruction is achieved using convolutional neural
networks for hyperspectral image super-resolution, followed by cross-talk and
leakage correction using a sensor-specific calibration matrix. The resulting
demosaicked images are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing
clear improvements in image quality compared to a baseline demosaicking method
using linear interpolation. Moreover, the fast processing time of~45\,ms of our
algorithm to obtain super-resolved RGB or oxygenation saturation maps per image

for its seamless integration into real-time surgical hyperspectral imaging
applications.

that a superposition of massive bodies would lead to a violation of the
Equivalence Principle. It has been argued that this violation implies that such
a superposition must inevitably spontaneously collapse (like in the
Di\'osi-Penrose model). We identify the origin of such an assertion in the
impossibility of finding a local, classical reference frame in which Einstein's
Equivalence Principle would hold. In contrast, we argue that the formulation of
the Equivalence Principle can be generalised so that it holds for reference
frames that are associated to quantum systems in a superposition of spacetimes.
The core of this new formulation is the introduction of a quantum
diffeomorphism to such Quantum Reference Frames (QRFs). This procedure
reconciles the principle of linear superposition in Quantum Theory with the
principle of general covariance and the Equivalence Principle of General
Relativity. Hence, it is not necessary to invoke a gravity-induced spontaneous
state reduction when a massive body is prepared in a spatial superposition.

plasma and material transport in the gas-phase from the growth/sputtering
processes at the bounding surfaces. Interface models based on analytic
expressions or look-up tables inherently restrict this complex interaction to a
bare minimum. A machine learning model has recently been shown to overcome this
remedy for Ar ions bombarding a Ti-Al composite target. However, the chosen
network structure (i.e., a multilayer perceptron) provides approximately 4
million degrees of freedom, which bears the risk of overfitting the relevant
dynamics and complicating the model to an unreliable extend. This work proposes
a conceptually more sophisticated but parameterwise simplified regression
artificial neural network for an extended scenario, considering a variable
instead of a single fixed Ti-Al stoichiometry. A convolutional
$\beta$-variational autoencoder is trained to reduce the high-dimensional
energy-angular distribution of sputtered particles to a latent space
representation of only two components. In addition to a primary decoder which
is trained to reconstruct the input energy-angular distribution, a secondary
decoder is employed to reconstruct the mean energy of incident Ar ions as well
as the present Ti-Al composition. The mutual latent space is hence conditioned
on these quantities. The trained primary decoder of the variational autoencoder
network is subsequently transferred to a regression network, for which only the
mapping to the particular latent space has to be learned. While obtaining a
competitive performance, the number of degrees of freedom is drastically
reduced to 15,111 and 486 parameters for the primary decoder and the remaining
regression network, respectively. The underlying methodology is general and can
easily be extended to more complex physical descriptions with a minimal amount

as one of the most practical, long-term, and safe solutions to tackle a growing
threat originating from the emission of CO$_2$. Successfully executing and
planning the process necessitates a comprehensive understanding of CO$_2$
transport properties -- particularly the diffusion coefficient, influencing the
behavior of CO$_2$ dissolution in water/brine regarding the shape of viscous
fingers, the onset of instabilities, etc. In this research, Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulation was employed to compute the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient in
various NaCl saline water concentrations under the broad spectrum of
temperatures and pressures to acquire a data-set. The NaCl concentration
increase gives rise to a decrease in the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, by which
the reduction is most notably at higher temperatures. In addition, the rise in
the CO$_2$ diffusion at elevated temperatures can be explained by the cation's
hydration shell size reduction with temperature increment due to intensifying
repulsive forces among water molecules. A new precise correlation is proposed
for estimating CO$_2$ diffusion coefficients. Regarding the pressure variation
effects, no tangible changes are observed with pressure increase. Furthermore,
the variability of the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient in the presence of other
salts, namely MgCl2, CaCl2, KCl, and Na2SO4, were computed separately.
Comparing the influence of various salts, CaCl2 and KCl have the highest and
lowest effect on the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, respectively. Finally, a set
of direct numerical simulations was conducted to study the impact of the CO$_2$
diffusion coefficient on the CO$_2$ dissolution process. The results shed light
on the importance of CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient changes under the saline
water condition in predicting dissolution process behavior and further
calculations.

to two distinct attention-based models, and both are interpretable models that
incorporate interpretability directly into the structure of a process

transition from a highly symmetric cubic phase to a rhombohedral structure at
low temperatures. In order to achieve the highly symmetric cubic phase at low
temperatures suitable for quantum behaviour, we have employed the modified
Bridgman method to grow a high-quality single-crystalline sample of SnTe.
Analysis of the crystal structure using Laue diffraction and rocking curve
measurements show a very high degree of single crystallinity of the sample.
Resistivity and the specific heat data do not show the signature of structural
transition down to the lowest temperature studied. The magnetic susceptibility
shows diamagnetic behaviour. All these properties manifest the behaviour of a
typical bulk semiconductor with conducting surface states as expected in a
topological material. Detailed powder x-ray diffraction measurements show cubic

Each rotator is a particle connected by a massless elastic rod with a
frictionless pivot; it has two degrees of freedom, length and angle of
rotation. The rods of the rotators and the elastic bonds between the nearest
rotators are linearly elastic, and the nonlinearity of the system is of a
purely geometric nature. It is shown that long-lived rotobreathers can exist if
the stiffness of the rods is high enough to create a relatively wide gap in the
phonon spectrum of the chain. The frequency of angular rotation of the
rotobreather cannot be above the optical band of the phonon spectrum and is in
the spectrum gap. Generally speaking, the rotation of the rotobreather is
accompanied by radial oscillations, however, one can choose such initial
conditions so that the radial oscillations are minimal. Some parameters of
rotobreathers with minimal radial vibrations are presented on the basis of
numerical simulations. The results obtained qualitatively describe the behavior
of physical systems with coupled rotators.

In this regime, the long-time dynamics is captured by an incoherent process
between two metastable states, which correspond to the preferred phases of the

often predict that an offender will be rearrested even when they deem the
likelihood of re-arrest to be well below 50%; (2) Participants do not anchor on
the RAI's predictions; (3) The time spent on the survey varies widely across
participants and most cases are assessed in less than 10 seconds; (4) Judicial
decisions, unlike participants' predictions, depend in part on factors that are
orthogonal to the likelihood of re-arrest. These results highlight the
influence of several crucial but often overlooked design decisions and concerns
around generalizability when constructing crowdsourcing studies to analyze the
impacts of RAIs.

so-called optical quantum state synthesizer (OQSS), consisting of Gaussian
input states, linear optics, and photon-number resolving detectors, is a
promising method for non-Gaussian state preparation. However, an inevitable and
crucial problem is the complexity of the numerical simulation of the state
preparation on a classical computer. This problem makes it very challenging to
generate important non-Gaussian states required for advanced quantum
information processing. Thus, an efficient method to design OQSS circuits is
highly desirable. To circumvent the problem, we offer a scheme employing a
backcasting approach, where the circuit of OQSS is divided into some sublayers,
and we simulate the OQSS backwards from final to first layers. Moreover, our
results show that the detected photon number by each detector is at most 2,
which can significantly reduce the requirements for the photon-number resolving
detector. By virtue of the potential for the preparation of a wide variety of
non-Gaussian states, the proposed OQSS can be a key ingredient in general
optical quantum information processing.

identified materials as exogenic on the basis of an absorption near 1 um that
is indicative of anhydrous silicates. The exogenic materials are spatially
resolved by the telescopic camera PolyCam. All such materials are brighter than
their surroundings, and they are expressed in a variety of morphologies:
homogeneous, breccia-like, inclusion-like, and others. Inclusion-like features
are the most common. Visible spectrophotometry was obtained for 46 of the 77
locations from MapCam images. Principal component analysis indicates at least
two trends: (i) mixing of Bennu's average spectrum with a strong 1-um band
absorption, possibly from pyroxene-rich material, and (ii) mixing with a weak
1-um band absorption. The endmember with a strong 1-um feature is consistent
with Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite (HED) meteorites, whereas the one showing a
weak 1-um feature may be consistent with HEDs, ordinary chondrites, or
carbonaceous chondrites. The variation in the few available near-infrared
reflectance spectra strongly suggests varying compositions among the exogenic
materials. Thus, Bennu might record the remnants of multiple impacts with
different compositions to its parent body, which could have happened in the
very early history of the Solar System. Moreover, at least one of the exogenic
objects is compositionally different from the exogenic materials found on the

exceeding the typical protoplanetary disc lifetime. These `Peter Pan discs' can
be explained as primordial discs that evolve in a low-radiation environment.
The persistently low masses of the host stars raise the question whether
primordial discs can survive up to these ages around stars of higher mass. In
this work we explore the way in which different mass loss processes in
protoplanetary discs limit their maximum lifetimes, and how this depends on
host star mass. We find that stars with masses $\lesssim$ 0.6 M$_\odot$ can
retain primordial discs for $\sim$50 Myr. At stellar masses $\gtrsim$ 0.8
M$_\odot$, the maximum disc lifetime decreases strongly to below 50 Myr due to
relatively more efficient accretion and photoevaporation by the host star.
Lifetimes up to 15 Myr are still possible for all host star masses up to
$\sim$2 M$_\odot$. For host star masses between 0.6 and 0.8 M$_\odot$,
accretion ceases and an inner gap forms before 50 Myr in our models.
Observations suggest that such a configuration is rapidly dispersed. We
conclude that Peter Pan discs can only occur around M dwarf stars.

not apply to the former setting, as pure fluids do not diffuse. The present
paper puts forward an additional mechanism, one that applies to both settings.
It is shown that disparities between the drop and vapor in terms of their
pressure and chemical potential give rise to a flow. Its direction depends on
the vapor density and the drop's size. In undersaturated or saturated vapor,
all drops evaporate -- but in oversaturated (yet thermodynamically stable)
vapor, there exists a critical radius: smaller drops evaporate, larger drops
act as centers of condensation and grow. The developed model is used to
estimate the evaporation time of a drop floating in saturated vapor. It is
shown that, if the vapor-to-liquid density ratio is small, so is the
evaporative flux -- as a result, millimeter-sized water drops at temperatures
lower than $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ survive for days. If, however, the
temperature is comparable (but not necessarily close) to its critical value,
such drops evaporate within minutes. Micron-sized drops, in turn, evaporate

questions surrounding the effect, and is the focus of this article. Here we
show, through a careful analysis of the non-local voltages on a multi-terminal
Corbino geometry, that the chiral edge channels continue to exist without
applied magnetic field up to the Curie temperature of bulk ferromagnetism of
the magnetic topological insulator, and that thermally activated bulk
conductance is responsible for this quantization breakdown. Our results offer
important insights on the nature of the topological protection of these edge
channels, provide an encouraging sign for potential applications, and establish
the multi-terminal Corbino geometry as a powerful tool for the study of edge
channel transport in topological materials.

envisioning a NextG scenario where the network leverages quantum annealing for
cellular baseband processing. We gather and synthesize insights on power

operational cost, and feasibility timelines surrounding quantum technology.
Armed with these data, we analyze and project the quantitative performance

computational and power advantage over CMOS hardware, while matching its

quantum annealing hardware operating at a 102 $\mu$s problem latency and 3.1M

(PDEs) are of pivotal interest to many research fields, including physics,

preferred over explicit ones to improve stability and correctness. However,
existing semi-implicit methods are usually iterative and employ a
general-purpose solver, which may be sub-optimal for a specific class of PDEs.
In this paper, we propose a neural solver to learn an optimal iterative scheme
in a data-driven fashion for any class of PDEs. Specifically, we modify a
single iteration of a semi-implicit solver using a deep neural network. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the correctness and convergence of neural
solvers analogous to conventional iterative solvers. In addition to the
commonly used Dirichlet boundary condition, we adopt a diffuse domain approach
to incorporate a diverse type of boundary conditions, e.g., Neumann. We show
that the proposed neural solver can go beyond linear PDEs and applies to a
class of non-linear PDEs, where the non-linear component is non-stiff. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method on 2D and 3D scenarios. To this end, we
show how our model generalizes to parameter settings, which are different from
training; and achieves faster convergence than semi-implicit schemes.

disciplines, yet the procedure of determining activity values is unexpectedly
not standardized in the literature. Although the measured raw acceleration
signal can be diversely processed, and then the activity values can be
calculated by different activity calculation methods, the documentations of
them are generally incomplete or vary by manufacturer. These numerous activity
metrics may require different types of preprocessing of the acceleration
signal. For example, digital filtering of the acceleration signals can have
various parameters; moreover, both the filter and the activity metrics can also
be applied per axis or on the magnitudes of the acceleration vector. Level
crossing-based activity metrics also depend on unclearly determined threshold
level values. Due to the serious inconsistency of determining activity values,
we created a detailed and comprehensive comparison of the different available
activity calculation procedures because, up to the present, it was lacking in
the literature. We assessed the different methods by analysing the triaxial
acceleration signals measured during a 10-day movement of 42 subjects. We
calculated 148 different activity signals for each subject's movement using the
combinations of various types of preprocessing and 7 different activity metrics
applied on both axial and magnitude data. We determined the linear relationship
between the metrics by correlation analysis, while we also examined the effects
of the preprocessing steps. Moreover, we established that the standard
deviation of the data series can be used as an appropriate, adaptive and
generalized threshold level for the level intersection-based metrics. On the
basis of these results, our work also serves as a general guide on how to
proceed if one wants to determine activity from the raw acceleration data.

used to realize the qubits possess additional quantum states in the accessible
energy range. We use optimal control theory to determine the maximum achievable
gate speed for two-qubit gates in the qubit subspace of the many-level Hilbert
space, and we analyze the effect of the additional quantum states on the gate
speed. We identify two competing mechanisms. On one hand, higher energy levels
are generally more strongly coupled to each other. Under suitable conditions,
this stronger coupling can be utilized to make two-qubit gates significantly
faster than the reference value based on simple qubits. On the other hand, a
weak anharmonicity constrains the speed at which the system can be adequately
controlled: according to the intuitive picture, faster operations require
stronger control fields, which are more likely to excite higher levels in a
weakly anharmonic system, which in turn leads to faster decoherence and
uncontrolled leakage outside the qubit space. In order to account for this
constraint, we modify the pulse optimization algorithm to avoid pulses that
lead to appreciable population of the higher levels. In this case we find that
the presence of the higher levels can lead to a significant reduction in the
maximum achievable gate speed. We also compare the optimal-control gate speeds
with those obtained using the cross-resonance/selective-darkening gate
protocol. We find that the latter, with some parameter optimization, can be
used to achieve a relatively fast implementation of the CNOT gate. These
results can help the search for optimized gate implementations in realistic
quantum computing architectures, such as those based on superconducting

includes processes showing arbitrary path dependence, long range correlations
or dynamic sampling spaces; suggesting that typicality is a generic property of
stochastic processes, regardless of their complexity. Our results impact

holes (SMBHs) is an essential ingredient of galaxy formation simulations. The
orbital evolution of SMBHs is affected by dynamical friction that cannot be
predicted self-consistently by contemporary simulations of galaxy formation in
representative volumes. Instead, such simulations typically use a simple
""repositioning"" of SMBHs, but the effects of this approach on SMBH and galaxy
properties have not yet been investigated systematically. Based on a suite of
smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with the SWIFT code and a
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton subgrid gas accretion model, we investigate the impact of
repositioning on SMBH growth and on other baryonic components through AGN
feedback. Across at least a factor ~1000 in mass resolution, SMBH repositioning
(or an equivalent approach) is a necessary prerequisite for AGN feedback;
without it, black hole growth is negligible. Limiting the effective
repositioning speed to $\lesssim$ 10 km/s delays the onset of AGN feedback and
severely limits its impact on stellar mass growth in the centre of massive
galaxies. Repositioning has three direct physical consequences. It promotes
SMBH mergers and thus accelerates their initial growth. In addition, it raises
the peak density of the ambient gas and reduces the SMBH velocity relative to
it, giving a combined boost to the accretion rate that can reach many orders of
magnitude. Our results suggest that a more sophisticated and/or better
calibrated treatment of SMBH repositioning is a critical step towards more
predictive galaxy formation simulations.

been identified and characterized through a topological order parameter that is
challenging to measure in experiments. Here, we propose the Raman-dressed
spin-orbit coupled gas as a novel platform to explore excited-state quantum
phase transitions. In a weakly-coupled regime, the dressed system is equivalent
to a spinor gas with tunable spin-spin interactions. Through this equivalence
we are able to define a new excited-state phase of the dressed gas. The phase
is characterize by the the behavior of the spatial density modulations, or
stripes, induced by spin-orbit coupling, and can in principle be measured in
current state-of-the-art experiments with ultracold atoms. Conversely, we show
that the properties of the excited phase can be exploited to prepare stripe
states with large and stable density modulations.

forced to match the label provided by the annotator and is not given the
flexibility to choose an alternative to inconsistencies that it might be able

``correctly'' classified in classes which they do not actually belong to. This
may reduce the performances of the network and thus incite to build more
complex networks without even checking the quality of the training data. In
this work, we question the reliability of the annotated datasets. For that
purpose, we introduce the notion of ghost loss, which can be seen as a regular
loss that is zeroed out for some predicted values in a deterministic way and
that allows the network to choose an alternative to the given label without
being penalized. After a proof of concept experiment, we use the ghost loss
principle to detect confusing images and erroneously labeled images in

(QCD) phase transition in the context of core collapse supernovae. To this end,
we conduct axially symmetric numerical relativity simulations with multi-energy
neutrino transport, using a hadron-quark hybrid equation of state (EOS). We
consider four non-rotating progenitor models, whose masses range from $9.6$ to
$70$ M$_\odot$. We find that the two less massive progenitor stars (9.6 and
11.2 M$_\odot$) show a successful explosion, which is driven by the neutrino
heating. They do not undergo the QCD phase transition and leave behind a
neutron star (NS). As for the more massive progenitor stars (50 and 70
M$_\odot$), the proto-neutron star (PNS) core enters the phase transition
region and experiences the second collapse. Because of a sudden stiffening of
the EOS entering to the pure quark matter regime, a strong shock wave is formed
and blows off the PNS envelope in the 50 M$_\odot$ model. Consequently, the
remnant becomes a quark core surrounded by hadronic matters, leading to the
formation of the hybrid star. However for the 70 M$_\odot$ model, the shock
wave cannot overcome the continuous mass accretion and it readily becomes a
black hole. We find that the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from
supernova explosions driven by the hadron-quark phase transition are detectable
for the present generation of neutrino and GW detectors. Furthermore, the
analysis of the GW detector response reveals unique kHz signatures, which will
allow us to distinguish this class of supernova explosions from failed and
neutrino-driven explosions.

type II radio bursts than EUV waves. Finally, there exists a tendency for type

  Usually the research field of runaway stars focuses on O- and B-type stars,
because these objects are better detectable at larger distances than late-type
stars. Early-type runaway stars have the advantage, that they evolve faster and
can therefore better be confirmed to be young. In contrast to this, the
catalogue of young runaway stars within 3 kpc by Tetzlaff, Neuh\""auser, & Hohle

catalogue were originally classified as young ($\le 50$ Myr) runaway stars by
using Hipparcos data to estimate the ages from their location in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and evolutionary models.

of 0.3 AU have revealed a magnetic field dominated by Alfv\'enic structures
that undergo large local variations or even reversals of the radial magnetic
field. They are called magnetic switchbacks, they are consistent with folds in
magnetic field lines within a same magnetic sector, and are associated with
velocity spikes during an otherwise calmer background. They are thought to
originate either in the low solar atmosphere through magnetic reconnection
processes, or result from the evolution of turbulence or velocity shears in the
expanding solar wind. In this work, we investigate the temporal and spatial
characteristic scales of magnetic switchback patches. We define switchbacks as
a deviation from the nominal Parker spiral direction and detect them
automatically for PSP encounters 1, 2, 4 and 5. We focus in particular on a
5.1-day interval dominated by switchbacks during E5. We perform a wavelet
transform of the solid angle between the magnetic field and the Parker spiral
and find periodic spatial modulations with two distinct wavelengths,
respectively consistent with solar granulation and supergranulation scales. In
addition we find that switchback occurrence and spectral properties seem to
depend on the source region of the solar wind rather than on the radial
distance of PSP. These results suggest that switchbacks are formed in the low
corona and modulated by the solar surface convection pattern.

updated Kalman filter equations, the proposed error model accurately predicts
the covariance of the estimation error and gives a relation between the
performance of the filter and its energy consumption, depending on the noise
level in the memories. Then, since memories are responsible for a large part of
the energy consumption of embedded systems, optimization methods are introduced
so as to minimize the memory energy consumption under a desired estimation
performance of the filter. The first method computes the optimal energy levels
allocated to each memory bank individually, and the second one optimizes the
energy allocation per groups of memory banks. Simulations show a close match
between the theoretical analysis and experimental results. Furthermore, they
demonstrate an important reduction in energy consumption of more than 50%.

coalescence effect, i.e., estimated tracks of targets in close proximity tend
to merge and can become indistinguishable. Interestingly, in MHT, an opposite
effect to track coalescence called track repulsion can be observed. In this
paper, we review the estimation strategies of the MHT, JPDA, and the recently

interaction is attributed to the nonmetricity of a flat, symmetric, but not
metric-compatible affine connection, have been a topic of growing interest in
recent studies. Numerous works study the cosmology of symmetric teleparallel
gravity assuming a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while
working in the so-called ""coincident gauge"", further assuming that the
connection coefficients vanish. However, little attention has been paid to the
fact that both of these assumptions rely on the freedom to choose a particular
coordinate system in order to simplify the metric or the connection, and that
they may, in general, not be achieved simultaneously. Here we construct the
most general symmetric teleparallel geometry obeying the conditions of
homogeneity and isotropy, without making any assumptions on the properties of
the coordinates, and present our results in both the usual cosmological
coordinates and in the coincident gauge. We find that in general these
coordinates do not agree, and that assuming both to hold simultaneously allows
only for a very restricted class of geometries. For the general case, we derive
the energy-momentum-hypermomentum conservation relations and the cosmological
dynamics of selected symmetric teleparallel gravity theories. Our results show
that the symmetric teleparallel connection in general contributes another
scalar quantity into the cosmological dynamics, which decouples only for a
specific class of theories from the dynamics of the metric, and only if the
most simple geometry is chosen, in which both assumed coordinate systems agree.
Most notably, the $f(Q)$ class of theories falls into this class.

magnetic field of $\mu_0H_{\rm c1} = 13.1(1)~\rm T$ is found to close the
singlet-triplet energy gap, the magnitude of which is governed by the
antiferromagnetic intradimer, $J_0 \approx 21~\rm K$, and interdimer, $J'

another, while spins of the same species are aligned parallel. The magnetism in

For this reason, it is still common practice to approximate $W(\omega)$ using a

limited by its simplistic description of the frequency dependence of the
polarizability, i.e. of $W$.

sampling of the polarizability in the frequency complex plane and a multi-pole
interpolation can lead to a level of accuracy comparable with full-frequency
methods at much lower computational cost. Moreover, both accuracy and cost are
controllable by the number of poles used in MPA. Eventually we validate the MPA
approach in selected prototype systems, showing that full-frequency quality

of the stars spans more than one order of magnitude. Many spectroscopic
investigations of its red-giant- and sub-giant- branches have revealed multiple
peaks in the iron abundance distribution. The metallicity distribution of
main-sequence (MS) stars is not well characterized yet, due to the faintness of
the stars and lack of data. So far, almost all studies of MS stars are based on
photometric measurements. Our goal is to investigate the metallicity
distribution of a statistically significant sample of MS stars in $\omega$ Cen.
In particular, we aim at revisiting the metallicity difference between the red
and blue MS of the cluster. We used MUSE spectra obtained for the central
region of $\omega$ Cen to derive metallicities for $\approx$4200 MS stars. We
find that blue MS stars are on average $\approx$0.1 dex more metal-rich than
their red counterparts. On the basis of this new estimate, we find that the two
sequences can be fit on the Hubble Space Telescope color-magnitude diagram with
two isochrones having the same global metallicity and age but a higher helium
abundance for the blue MS, that is $\Delta Y \lesssim$ 0.1. Furthermore, we
determine the average metallicity of the five main populations along $\omega$
Cen MS and these estimates are consistent with expectations from previous
photometric studies.

have become topical of late, enabling the development of novel applications in
numerous research fields. Key to this is the remarkable similarities they hold
with quantum entangled states, which arises from the non-separability between
the spatial and polarisation degrees of freedom (DoF). As such, the demand for
diversification of generation methods and characterization techniques have
increased dramatically. Here we put forward a comprehensive tutorial about the
use of DMDs in the generation and characterization of vector modes, providing
details on the implementation of techniques that fully exploits the unsurpassed
advantage of Digital Micromirrors Devices (DMDs), such as their high refresh
rates and polarisation independence. We start by briefly describing the
operating principles of DMD and follow with a thorough explanation of some of
the methods to shape arbitrary vector modes. Finally, we describe some
techniques aiming at the real-time characterization of vector beams. This
tutorial highlights the value of DMDs as an alternative tool for the generation
and characterization of complex vector light fields, of great relevance in a

local shock region in the HST-1, indicating that the particle acceleration of
TeV electrons occurred far away (~100 pc) from the core. Assuming the fading
time to be equal to the synchrotron cooling time, the magnetic field is
constrained to be B ~1.94 ${\delta}^{1/3}$ mG. Moreover, the photon index of

the radiative inefficiency accretion flow of the core or inverse Compton

performed with an average-pooling, where all the activations are treated
equally, or with a max-pooling operation that only retains an element with
maximum activation while discarding the others. Both of these operations are
restrictive and have previously been shown to be sub-optimal. To address this
issue, a novel pooling scheme, named\emph{ ordinal pooling}, is introduced in
this work. Ordinal pooling rearranges all the elements of a pooling region in a
sequence and assigns a different weight to each element based upon its order in
the sequence. These weights are used to compute the pooling operation as a
weighted sum of the rearranged elements of the pooling region. They are learned
via a standard gradient-based training, allowing to learn a behavior anywhere
in the spectrum of average-pooling to max-pooling in a differentiable manner.
Our experiments suggest that it is advantageous for the networks to perform
different types of pooling operations within a pooling layer and that a hybrid
behavior between average- and max-pooling is often beneficial. More
importantly, they also demonstrate that ordinal pooling leads to consistent
improvements in the accuracy over average- or max-pooling operations while
speeding up the training and alleviating the issue of the choice of the pooling
operations and activation functions to be used in the networks. In particular,
ordinal pooling mainly helps on lightweight or quantized deep learning
architectures, as typically considered e.g. for embedded applications.

evolutionary processes is introduced. Such solutions are characterized by an
energy balance where a suitable, rate-dependent, dissipation cost is optimized
at jump times. The cost is reminiscent of the limit effect of small inertial
terms. Therefore, this notion proves to be a suitable one to describe the
asymptotic behavior of evolutions of mechanical systems with rate-independent
dissipation in the limit of vanishing inertia and viscosity. It is indeed
proved, in finite dimension, that these evolutions converge to IBV solutions.
If the viscosity operator is neglected, or has a nontrivial kernel, the weaker
notion of Inertial Virtual Viscosity (IVV) solutions is introduced, and the
analogous convergence result holds. Again in a finite-dimensional context, it
is also shown that IBV and IVV solutions can be obtained via a natural
extension of the Minimizing Movements algorithm, where the limit effect of
inertial terms is taken into account.

speech is an important area of research with numerous spoken language
technology based applications. Speaker age estimation has applications in
enabling personalization and age-appropriate curation of information and
content. However, research in speaker age estimation in children is especially
challenging due to paucity of relevant speech data representing the
developmental spectrum, and the high signal variability especially intra age
variability that complicates modeling. Most approaches in children speaker age
estimation adopt methods directly from research on adult speech processing. In
this paper, we propose features specific to children and focus on speaker's
phone duration as an important biomarker of children's age. We propose phone
duration modeling for predicting age from child's speech. To enable that,
children speech is first forced aligned with the corresponding transcription to
derive phone duration distributions. Statistical functionals are computed from
phone duration distributions for each phoneme which are in turn used to train
regression models to predict speaker age. Two children speech datasets are
employed to demonstrate the robustness of phone duration features. We perform
age regression experiments on age categories ranging from children studying in
kindergarten to grade 10. Experimental results suggest phone durations contain
important development-related information of children. Phonemes contributing
most to estimation of children speaker age are analyzed and presented.

reversals are characterized by the beneficial allele for a given context (e.g.,
niche, time, trait or sex) being dominant in that context. This
context-dependence at least partially mitigates the fitness consequence of
heterozygotes carrying one of the 'wrong' alleles for their context and can
result in balancing selection that maintains both alleles. Despite being
dismissed by some early on, dominance reversals are an inevitable outcome of
antagonistic selection under reasonable assumptions, and mounting empirical
evidence largely supports this theory. Here we review the theory and empirical
evidence for beneficial reversals of dominance. Along the way, we identify some

function for faster training convergence 2) Systematic pruning of filters of

transformation of the space of training samples as it gets transformed by each
successive layer during training, by changing the activation function. The
impact of changing activation function on the convergence during training is
reported for the task of binary classification. A novel activation function
aimed at faster convergence for classification tasks is proposed. Here, Betti
numbers are used to quantify topological complexity of data. Results of
experiments on popular synthetic binary classification datasets with large
Betti numbers(>150) using MLPs are reported. Results show that the proposed
activation function results in faster convergence requiring fewer epochs by a
factor of 1.5 to 2, since Betti numbers reduce faster across layers with the
proposed activation function. The proposed methodology was verified on
benchmark image datasets: fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and cat-vs-dog images, using
CNNs. Based on empirical results, we propose a novel method for pruning a
trained model. The trained model was pruned by eliminating filters that
transform data to a topological space with large Betti numbers. All filters
with Betti numbers greater than 300 were removed from each layer without
significant reduction in accuracy. This resulted in faster prediction time and
reduced memory size of the model.

discuss the evacuation travel and refueling times under scenarios of various

time-dependent situation for the prototype model of strong correlations, the
Anderson impurity model. We use the equation of motion method to obtain closed

This efficiency of solvers is in surprising contrast to the traditional

believed to be hard in the worst case. In an attempt to resolve this apparent
discrepancy between theory and practice, theorists have proposed the study of
these solvers as proof systems that would enable establishing appropriate lower
and upper bounds on their complexity. For example, in recent years it has been
shown that (idealized models of) SAT solvers are polynomially equivalent to the
general resolution proof system for propositional logic, and SMT solvers that
use the CDCL(T) architecture are polynomially equivalent to the Res*(T) proof
system. In this paper, we extend this program to the MCSAT approach for SMT
solving by showing that the MCSAT architecture is polynomially equivalent to
the Res*(T) proof system. Thus, we establish an equivalence between CDCL(T) and
MCSAT from a proof-complexity theoretic point of view. This is a first and
essential step towards a richer theory that may help (parametrically)
characterize the kinds of formulas for which MCSAT-based SMT solvers can
perform well.

Traditional solutions follow a pose transfer strategy, from the moving
character to the source character shape, that relies on skeletal pose
parametrization. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that
transfers the source shape style onto the moving character. The expected
benefit is to avoid the inherently difficult pose to shape conversion required
with skeletal parametrization applied on real characters. To this purpose, we
consider image style transfer techniques and investigate how to adapt them to
3D human shapes. Adaptive Instance Normalisation (AdaIN) and SPADE
architectures have been demonstrated to efficiently and accurately transfer the
style of an image onto another while preserving the original image structure.
Where AdaIN contributes with a module to perform style transfer through the
statistics of the subjects and SPADE contribute with a residual block
architecture to refine the quality of the style transfer. We demonstrate that
these approaches are extendable to the 3D shape domain by proposing a
convolutional neural network that applies the same principle of preserving the
shape structure (shape pose) while transferring the style of a new subject
shape. The generated results are supervised through a discriminator module to
evaluate the realism of the shape, whilst enforcing the decoder to synthesise
plausible shapes and improve the style transfer for unseen subjects. Our
experiments demonstrate an average of $\approx 56\%$ qualitative and
quantitative improvements over the baseline in shape transfer through
optimization-based and learning-based methods.

retarget poses between different characters. Traditional methods that tackle
this problem require a clear definition of the pose, and use this definition to

the character's pose. This offers the advantage of not having to define
equivalences between 3D human poses, which is not straightforward as poses tend
to change depending on the identity of the character performing them, and as
their meaning is highly contextual. To achieve the deformation transfer, we
propose a neural encoder-decoder architecture where only identity information
is encoded and where the decoder is conditioned on the pose. We use pose
independent representations, such as isometry-invariant shape characteristics,
to represent identity features. Our model uses these features to supervise the
prediction of offsets from the deformed pose to the result of the transfer. We
show experimentally that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both

majority of efforts have been on the development of vaccines and the mass
immunization of the public. While the daily case numbers were following a
decreasing trend, the emergent of new virus mutations and variants still pose a
significant threat. As economies start recovering and societies start opening
up with people going back into office buildings, schools, and malls, we still
need to have the ability to detect and minimize the spread of COVID-19.
Individuals with COVID-19 may show multiple symptoms such as cough, fever, and
shortness of breath. Many of the existing detection techniques focus on
symptoms having the same equal importance. However, it has been shown that some
symptoms are more prevalent than others. In this paper, we present a multimodal
method to predict COVID-19 by incorporating existing deep learning classifiers
using convolutional neural networks and our novel probability-based weighting
function that considers the prevalence of each symptom. The experiments were
performed on an existing dataset with respect to the three considered modes of
coughs, fever, and shortness of breath. The results show considerable
improvements in the detection of COVID-19 using our weighting function when
compared to an equal weighting function.

a non-canonical bracket that is a hybrid between a Poisson Bracket and a Nambu
Bracket. The resulting non-canonical bracket is parameterized both the by the
skew-symmetric payoff matrix and a mediating function. The mediating function
is only sometimes a conserved quantity, but plays a critical role in the
determination of the dynamics. As a by-product, we show that for the replicator
dynamics this function arises in the definition of a natural metric on which
phase flow-volume is preserved. Additionally, we show that the non-canonical
bracket satisfies all the same identities as the Poisson bracket except for the
Jacobi identity (JI), which is satisfied for special cases of the mediating
function. In particular, the mediating function that gives rise to the
replicator dynamics yields a bracket that satisfies JI. This neatly explains
why the mediating function allows us to derive a metric on which phase flow is
conserved and suggests a natural geometry for zero-sum games that extends the
Symplectic geometry of the Poisson bracket and potentially an alternate
approach to quantizing evolutionary games.

spins in merging binaries measured with gravitational waves. Some analyses find
that a significant fraction of merging binaries contain at least one black hole
with a spin tilt $>90^\circ$ with respect to the orbital angular momentum
vector, which has been interpreted as a signature for dynamical assembly. Other
analyses find the data are consistent with a bimodal population in which some
binaries contain black holes with negligible spin while the rest contain black
holes with spin vectors preferentially aligned with the orbital angular
momentum vector. In this work, we scrutinize models for the distribution of
black hole spins to pinpoint possible failure modes in which the model yields a
faulty conclusion. We reanalyze data from the second LIGO--Virgo
gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-2) using a revised spin model, which
allows for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spins. In agreement
with recent results by Roulet et al., we show that the GWTC-2 detections are
consistent with two distinct sub-populations. We estimate that $29-75\%$ (90\%
credible interval) of merging binaries contain black holes with negligible spin
$\chi \approx 0$. The remaining binaries are part of a second sub-population in
which the spin vectors are preferentially (but not exactly) aligned to the
orbital angular momentum. The black holes in this second sub-population are
characterized by spins of $\chi\sim0.45$. We suggest that the inferred spin
distribution is consistent with the hypothesis that all merging binaries form

interesting advantages since it provides the decision-maker with the complete
information about the set of non-dominated points (Pareto front) and a clear
overview of the problem. However, providing many solutions to the
decision-maker might also be overwhelming. As an alternative approach,
presenting a representative set of solutions of the Pareto front may be
advantageous. Choosing such a representative set is by itself also a
multi-objective problem that must consider the number of solutions to present,
the uniformity, and/or the coverage of the representation, to guarantee its
quality. This paper proposes three algorithms for the representation problem
for multi-objective integer linear programming problems with two or more
objective functions, each one of them dealing with each dimension of the
problem (cardinality, coverage, and uniformity). Such algorithms are all based
on the $\epsilon$-constraint approach. In addition, the paper also presents
strategies to overcome poor estimations of the Pareto front bounds. The
algorithms were tested on the ability to efficiently generate the whole Pareto
front or its representation. The uniformity and cardinality algorithms proved
to be very efficient both in binary and integer problems, being amongst the
best in the literature. Both coverage and uniformity algorithms provide good
quality representations on their targeted objective, while the cardinality
algorithm appears to be the most flexible, privileging uniformity for lower
cardinality representations and coverage on higher cardinality.

this approach has advantages, the widespread adoption of two photon
photopolymerization is hindered by the need for expensive ultrafast lasers and
extremely slow print speeds. Here we present an analogous quadratic process,
triplet-triplet-annihilation-driven 3D printing, that enables volumetric
printing at a focal point driven by <4 milliwatt-power continuous wave
excitation. To induce photopolymerization deep within a vat, the key advance is
the nanoencapsulation of photon upconversion solution within a silica shell
decorated with solubilizing polymer ligands. This scalable self-assembly
approach allows for scatter-free nanocapsule dispersal in a variety of organic
media without leaking the capsule contents. We further introduce an excitonic
strategy to systematically control the upconversion threshold to support either
monovoxel or parallelized printing schemes, printing at power densities
multiple orders of magnitude lower than power densities required for
two-photon-based 3D printing. The application of upconversion nanocapsules to

parcellation atlases and spatial habitats, along with classical radiomic and
geometric features; to study their combined predictive power for analysing
overall survival. A cross validation strategy with grid search is proposed to
simultaneously select and evaluate the most predictive feature subset based on
its predictive power. A Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is employed for
univariate feature selection, followed by the prediction of patient-specific
survival functions by three multivariate parsimonious models viz. Coxnet,

aggregation of several low bitrate channels to fewer channels with higher
spectral efficiency. The method is based on optical vector summation
facilitated by coherent spectral superposition. Thereby it does not need any
optical nonlinearities and is based on linear signal processing with an
electro-optic modulator. Furthermore, optical phase tuning required for vector
addition can be easily achieved by a phase tuning of the radio frequency signal
driving the modulator. We experimentally demonstrate the aggregation of two 10

aggregation of two 10 Gbaud QPSK signals into 10 Gbaud QAM-16, as well as the
aggregation of sinc-shaped Nyquist signals. The presented concept of in-line
all-optical aggregation demonstrates considerable improvement in network
spectrum utilization and can significantly enhance the operational capacity

driving novel hardware solutions beyond charging of electrical wires given a
resurrection to application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-based
accelerators. These innovations include photonic ASICs (P-ASIC) due to
prospects of performing optical linear (and also nonlinear) operations, such as
multiply-accumulate for vector matrix multiplications or convolutions, without
iterative architectures. Such photonic linear algebra enables picosecond delay
when photonic integrated circuits are utilized, via on-the-fly mathematics.
However, the neurons full function includes providing a nonlinear activation
function, knowns as thresholding, to enable decision making on inferred data.
Many P-ASIC solutions performing this nonlinearity in the electronic domain,
which brings challenges in terms of data throughput and delay, thus breaking
the optical link and introducing increased system complexity via domain
crossings. This work follows the notion of utilizing enhanced
light-matter-interactions to provide efficient, compact, and engineerable
electro-optic neuron nonlinearity. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a novel
electro-optic device to engineer the shape of this optical nonlinearity to
resemble a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) - the most-commonly used nonlinear
activation function in neural networks. We combine the counter-directional
transfer functions from heterostructures made out of two electro-optic
materials to design a diode-like nonlinear response of the device. Integrating
this nonlinearity into a photonic neural network, we show how the
electrostatics of this thresholders gating junction improves machine learning
inference accuracy and the energy efficiency of the neural network.

plans in individual sport disciplines have achieved a mature phase. In order to
confirm their added value, they have been deployed into practice. As a result,
several methods have been developed for generating well formulated training
plans on computers automatically that, typically, depend on the collection of
past sport activities. However, monitoring the realization of the performed
training sessions still represents a bottleneck in automating the process of
sport training as a whole. The objective of this paper is to present a new
low-cost and efficient embedded device for monitoring the realization of sport
training sessions that is dedicated to monitor cycling training sessions. We
designed and developed a new bike computer, i.e. the AST-Monitor, that can be
mounted easily on almost every bicycle. The aforementioned bike computer is
based on the Raspberry Pi device that supports different external sensors for
capturing the data during the realization of sport training sessions. An
adjusted GUI tailored to the needs of athletes is developed, along with the
hardware. The proof of concept study, using the AST-Monitor in practice,
revealed the potential of the proposed solution for monitoring of realized
sport training sessions automatically. The new device also opens the door for
the future utilization of Artificial Intelligence in a wide variety of sports.

  Soft Actuators",,,"10.1186/s40648-022-00225-9",,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Roboticists have been seeking to address this situation in recent years
through the use of soft robots. Unfortunately, identifying appropriate models
for the complete analysis and investigation of soft robots for design and
control purposes can be problematic. This paper seeks to address this challenge
by proposing two complementary modeling techniques for a particular type of
soft robotic actuator known as a Fiber-Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosure (FREE).
We propose that researchers can leverage multiple models to fill gaps in the
understanding of the behavior of soft robots. We present and evaluate both a
dynamic, lumped-parameter model and a finite element model to extend
understanding of the practicability of FREEs in soft robotic applications. The
results with the lumped-parameter model demonstrate that it predicts the actual
rotational motion of a FREE with at most 4% error when a closed-loop controller
is embedded in the system. Additionally, finite element analysis was used to
study FREE design parameters as well as the workspace achieved with a module
comprised of multiple FREEs. Our finite element results indicate that
variations in the material properties of the elastic enclosure of a FREE are
more significant than variations in fiber properties. Finally, finite element
results show that a 30-degree difference in winding angle dramatically alters
the shape of the workspace generated by four FREEs assembled into a module.
Concludingly, comments are made about the relative advantages and limitations
of lumped-parameter and finite element models of FREEs and FREE modules in
providing useful insights into their behavior.

  kernel integral for graphic processing unit","18 pages",,,,"cs.DC eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Morlet or Gabor wavelet transforms as well as Gaussian smoothing, are widely
used in signal processing and image processing. However, the computational
complexity of their direct calculations is proportional not only to the number
of data points in a signal but also to the smoothing size, which is the
standard deviation in the Gaussian function in their transform functions. Thus,
when the standard deviation is large, its considerable computation time
diminishes the advantages of aforementioned transforms. Therefore, it is
important to formulate an algorithm to reduce the calculation time of the
transformations. In this paper, we first review calculation methods of Gaussian
smoothing by using the sliding Fourier transform (SFT) and our proposed
attenuated SFT (ASFT) \cite{YamashitaICPR2020}. Based on these methods, we
propose two types of calculation methods for Morlet wavelet transforms. We also
propose an algorithm to calculate SFT using the kernel integral on graphic
processing unit (GPU). When the number of calculation cores in GPU is not less
than the number of data points, the order of its calculation time is the
logarithm of the smoothing size and does not depend on the number of data
points. Using experiments, we compare the two methods for calculating the
Morlet wavelet transform and evaluate the calculation time of the proposed
algorithm using a kernel integral on GPU. For example, when the number of data
points and the standard deviation are 102400 and 8192.0, respectively, the
calculation time of the Morlet wavelet transform by the proposed method is
0.545 ms, which 413.6 times faster than a conventional method.

condition monitoring of modern scientific laboratories, as well as to allow
users to perform actions from remote locations in case of detection of
specified events. The system is battery operated and does not require the
presence of a Local Area Network (LAN) or WiFi (which are typically not
available in case of, e.g. power losses), as it exploits the growing
infrastructure of Internet of Things (IoT) Low Power Wide Area Networks
(LPWAN). In particular our system exploits the new SigFox
ultra-narrow-bandwidth (UNB) infrastructure, and provides for a bidirectional
link between the instrumentation and the remote user even in case of power line
outages, which are among the most critical situations that a scientific
laboratory can withstand. The system can detect the occurrence of predefined
events in very short times, and either autonomously react with a series of
predefined actions, also allowing a remote user to timely perform additional
actions on the system through an user-friendly smartphone application or via a
browser interface. The system also embeds a novel power-loss detection
architecture, which detects power line failures in less than 2 ms. We provide a
full characterization of the prototype, including reaction times, connection
latencies, sensors sensitivity, and power consumption.
