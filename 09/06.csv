theoretically and empirically, how exploiting a given cluster structure can
significantly improve the regret and computational cost compared to using
standard Thompson sampling. In the case of the stochastic multi-armed bandit we
give upper bounds on the expected cumulative regret showing how it depends on

Impedance control is used by most AAN controllers to create a compliant force
field around a target motion to ensure tracking accuracy while allowing
moderate kinematic errors. However, since the parameters governing the shape of
the force field are often tuned manually or adapted online based on simplistic
assumptions about subjects' learning abilities, the effectiveness of
conventional AAN controllers may be limited. In this work, we propose a novel
adaptive AAN controller that is capable of autonomously reshaping the force
field in a phase-dependent manner according to each individual's motor
abilities and task requirements. The proposed controller consists of a modified
Policy Improvement with Path Integral algorithm, a model-free, sampling-based
reinforcement learning method that learns a subject-specific impedance
landscape in real-time, and a hierarchical policy parameter evaluation
structure that embeds the AAN paradigm by specifying performance-driven
learning goals. The adaptability of the proposed control strategy to subjects'
motor responses and its ability to promote short-term motor adaptations are
experimentally validated through treadmill training sessions with able-bodied
subjects who learned altered gait patterns with the assistance of a powered
ankle-foot orthosis.

queries to the adjacency matrix. Here, for an $n$-vertex graph with adjacency
matrix $A$, one can query a vector $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ and receive the answer
$Ax$. We give a randomized algorithm that can output a spanning forest of a
weighted graph with constant probability after $O(\log^4(n))$ matrix-vector

Sun et al.\ (ICALP 2019) that gives a randomized algorithm that can output a
spanning forest of a graph after $O(\log^4(n))$ matrix-vector multiplication
queries to the signed vertex-edge incidence matrix of the graph. As an
application, we show that a quantum algorithm can output a spanning forest of
an unweighted graph after $O(\log^5(n))$ cut queries, improving and simplifying
a result of Lee, Santha, and Zhang (SODA 2021), which gave the bound
$O(\log^8(n))$.
  In the second part of the paper, we turn to showing lower bounds on the
linear query complexity of determining if a graph is connected. If $w$ is the
weight vector of a graph (viewed as an $\binom{n}{2}$ dimensional vector), in a
linear query one can query any vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \choose 2}$ and
receive the answer $\langle z, w\rangle$. We show that a zero-error randomized
algorithm must make $\Omega(n)$ linear queries in expectation to solve
connectivity. As far as we are aware, this is the first lower bound of any kind
on the unrestricted linear query complexity of connectivity. We show this lower

As underwater scenes exhibit weak view-dependent specularity, an angular patch
tends to have uniform intensity when sampled at the correct depth. We thus
impose this angular uniformity as a constraint for depth estimation. For
efficient angular resampling, we design a fast approximation algorithm based on
multivariate polynomial regression to approximate nonlinear refraction paths.
We further develop a light field calibration algorithm that estimates the

that it uses Stacked AutoEncoder(SAE) network to project original
high-dimensional dynamical systems onto a low dimensional nonlinear subspace
and predict the fluid dynamics using an attentionbased deep learning method. A
new model reduction neural network architecture for fluid flow problem is
presented. The SAE network compresses high-dimensional physical information
into several much smaller sized representations in a latent space. These
representations are expressed by a number of codes in the middle layer of SAE
neural network. Then, those codes at different time levels are trained to
construct a set of hyper-surfaces with multi variable response functions using
attention-based deep learning methods. The inputs of the attention-based
network are previous time levels' codes and the outputs of the network are
current time levels' codes. The codes at current time level are then projected
back to the original full space by the decoder layers in the SAE network. The
capability of this data-driven reduced order model (DDROM) is illustrated
numerically by two test cases: flow past a cylinder, and a lock exchange,
respectively. The results obtained show that the DDROM performs better in terms
of accuracy than the popular model reduction method namely proper orthogonal
decomposition. The improvement is assessed by comparison with a high fidelity

between 2000 and 2014. We found that the MENA region is at an early stage for
renewable energy with a high potential for solar energy, making it attractive
for investors. However, the high dependency on oil for consumption and
exporting might not provide a prosperous environment for renewable technologies
to grow. Therefore, a greater focus on decoupling economic growth from energy
consumption will have a long-lasting impact on fiscal revenues for net-oil
exporting countries. Moreover, the consequences of the decoupling will allow
more renewables penetration in the current energy mix enabling many countries
to reach their Paris Agreement goals. For short-term energy policy actions,
starting a subsidy reform towards the final repeal of subsidies is a must as
these measures relate to all end-use sectors and impact fiscal stability in
many countries. With its 1.65GW Benban Solar Park in Aswan, Egypt has shown an

all primes $p$ if and only if they are conjugate by an element in

We study the problem of finding this extension $E$. Since a result by Latimer

context of $R$-conjugacy for $R$ any integral domain, we can adapt an existing
algorithm for $\mathbb{Z}$-conjugacy to a new context. We also offer a method

nanocrystalline regime, offers a promising pathway to further improve the
strength-to-weight ratio of Al alloys. Unfortunately, the fabrication of
nanocrystalline metals often requires non-equilibrium processing routes, which
typically limit the specimen size and require large energy budgets. In this
study, multiple dopant atoms in ternary Al alloys are deliberately selected to
enable segregation to the grain boundary region and promote the formation of
amorphous complexions. Three different fully dense bulk nanocrystalline Al
alloys (Al-Mg-Y, Al-Fe-Y, and Al-Ni-Y) with small grain sizes were successfully
fabricated using a simple powder metallurgy approach, with full densification
connected directly to the onset of amorphous complexion formation. All the
compositions demonstrate densities above 99% with grain sizes of <60 nm
following consolidation via hot pressing at 585 oC. The very fine grain
structure results in excellent mechanical properties, with nanoindentation
hardness values in the range of 2.2-2.8 GPa. Detailed microstructural
characterization verifies the segregation of all dopant species to grain
boundaries as well as the formation of amorphous complexions, which suggests
their influential role in aiding effective consolidation and endowing thermal
stability in the alloys. Moreover, nanorods with a core-shell structure are
also observed at the grain boundaries, which likely contribute to the
stabilization of the grain structure and high strength. Finally, intermetallic
particles with a sizes of hundreds of nanometers form. As a whole, the results
presented here demonstrate a general alloy design strategy of segregation and
boundary evolution pathway that enables the fabrication of multiple
nanocrystalline Al alloys with hierarchical microstructures and improved
performance.

scales, domain, and so on. Many splitting algorithms have been designed for
efficient temporal discretization. In this paper, our goal is to use temporal
splitting concepts in designing machine learning algorithms and, at the same
time, help splitting algorithms by incorporating data and speeding them up.
Since the spitting solution usually has an explicit and implicit part, we will
call our method hybrid explicit-implict (HEI) learning. We will consider a
recently introduced multiscale splitting algorithms. To approximate the
dynamics, only a few degrees of freedom are solved implicitly, while others
explicitly. In this paper, we use this splitting concept in machine learning
and propose several strategies. First, the implicit part of the solution can be
learned as it is more difficult to solve, while the explicit part can be
computed. This provides a speed-up and data incorporation for splitting
approaches. Secondly, one can design a hybrid neural network architecture
because handling explicit parts requires much fewer communications among
neurons and can be done efficiently. Thirdly, one can solve the coarse grid
component via PDEs or other approximation methods and construct simpler neural
networks for the explicit part of the solutions. We discuss these options and
implement one of them by interpreting it as a machine translation task. This
interpretation successfully enables us using the Transformer since it can
perform model reduction for multiple time series and learn the connection. We
also find that the splitting scheme is a great platform to predict the coarse
solution with insufficient information of the target model: the target problem
is partially given and we need to solve it through a known problem. We conduct
four numerical examples and the results show that our method is stable and
accurate.

enables decision-making under uncertainty. Classifier design aims at building
models from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either
explicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training
data are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and
evaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer
learning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant
source domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has
received little attention for performance assessment, notably in error
estimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge
transferability in the context of classification error estimation within a
Bayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square
error (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which
enables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a
small-sample setting. Using Monte Carlo importance sampling, we employ the
proposed estimator to evaluate the classification accuracy of a broad family of
classifiers that span diverse learning capabilities. Experimental results based
on both synthetic data as well as real-world RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data show
that our proposed OBTL error estimation scheme clearly outperforms standard
error estimators, especially in a small-sample setting, by tapping into the
data from other relevant domains.

investigate the credibility of this view by comparing volunteers' locational

The GPS tracks of the users at the time of connection. In more than 60\% of

device's location is many times larger than the area of the cell tower's VP. To
comprise 90\% of the possible locations of the devices that may be connected to

of the VPs adjacent to the tower's VPs. An additional, third, ring of the

the nature of the MPN structure and service and entail essential overlap

a factor of 2 - 3, compared to standard models. Part of this may be due to
diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region (BLR), which is indicated
by excess lags around the Balmer jump. Standard cross correlation lag analysis
techniques are usually used to just recover the peak or centroid lag and can
not easily distinguish between reprocessing from the disk and BLR. However,
frequency-resolved lag analysis, where the lag is determined at each Fourier
frequency, has the potential to separate out reprocessing on different size
scales. Here we present simulations to demonstrate the potential of this method
and then apply a maximum likelihood approach to determine frequency-resolved
lags in NGC 5548. We find that the lags in NGC 5548 generally decrease smoothly
with increasing frequency, and are not easily described by accretion disk
reprocessing alone. The standard cross correlation lags are consistent with
lags at frequencies lower than 0.1 per day, indicating they are dominated from
reprocessing at size scales greater than about 10 light days. A combination of
a more distant reprocessor, consistent with the BLR, along with a
standard-sized accretion disk is more consistent with the observed lags than a
larger disk alone.

helps our general understanding of stellar progenitors and circumstellar medium
(CSM) interactions in CCSNe. We also highlight the importance of near-infrared
(NIR) surveys for early detections of SNe in dusty environments. SN 2020qmp
displays characteristic hydrogen lines in its optical spectra, as well as a
plateau in its optical LC, hallmarks of a type IIP SN. We do not detect linear
polarization during the plateau phase, with a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.78%.
Through hydrodynamical LC modeling and an analysis of its nebular spectra, we
estimate a progenitor mass of around 11 solar masses, and an explosion energy
of around 0.8e51 erg. We find that the spectral energy distribution cannot be
explained by a simple CSM interaction model, assuming a constant shock velocity
and steady mass-loss rate, and the excess X-ray luminosity compared with the
synchrotron radio luminosity suggests deviations from equipartition. Finally,
we demonstrate the advantages of NIR surveys over optical surveys for the
detection of dust-obscured CCSNe in the local universe. Specifically, our
simulations show that the Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer will detect
about 14 more CCSNe out of 75 expected in its footprint within 40 Mpc, over
five years than an optical survey equivalent to the Zwicky Transient Facility
would detect. We have determined or constrained the main properties of SN
2020qmp and of its progenitor, highlighting the value of multiwavelength
follow-up observations of nearby CCSNe. We have also shown that forthcoming NIR
surveys will finally enable us to do a nearly complete census of CCSNe in the
local universe.

isolate small spin clusters, demonstrate the convergence of our learning
algorithm on one such example, and then investigate the learnability of these

Approach: We propose the utilization of filter banks (creating sub-band
components of the EEG signal) in conjunction with DNNs. In this context, we
created three different models: a recurrent neural network (FBRNN) analyzing
the time domain, a 2D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-2D) processing
complex spectrum features and a 3D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-3D)
analyzing complex spectrograms, which we introduce in this study as possible
input for SSVEP classification. We tested our neural networks on three open
datasets and conceived them so as not to require calibration from the final
user, simulating a user-independent BCI. Results: The DNNs with the filter
banks surpassed the accuracy of similar networks without this preprocessing
step by considerable margins, and they outperformed common SSVEP classification
methods (SVM and FBCCA) by even higher margins. Conclusion and significance:
Filter banks allow different types of deep neural networks to more efficiently
analyze the harmonic components of SSVEP. Complex spectrograms carry more
information than complex spectrum features and the magnitude spectrum, allowing
the FBCNN-3D to surpass the other CNNs. The performances obtained in the
challenging classification problems indicates a strong potential for the
construction of portable, economical, fast and low-latency BCIs.

amounts of data should be analyzed, manipulated and stored. In the traditional
storage/memory hierarchy, each compute node retains its data objects in its
local volatile DRAM. Whenever the DRAM's capacity becomes insufficient for
storing this data, the computation should either be distributed between several
compute nodes, or some portion of these data objects must be stored in a
non-volatile block device such as a hard disk drive or an SSD storage device.
Optane DataCenter Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM), a new technology introduced
by Intel, provides non-volatile memory that can be plugged into standard memory
bus slots and therefore be accessed much faster than standard storage devices.
In this work, we present and analyze the results of a comprehensive performance
assessment of several ways in which DCPMM can 1) replace standard storage
devices, and 2) replace or augment DRAM for improving the performance of HPC
scientific computations. To achieve this goal, we have configured an HPC system
such that DCPMM can service I/O operations of scientific applications, replace
standard storage devices and file systems (specifically for diagnostics and
checkpoint-restarting), and serve for expanding applications' main memory. We
focus on keeping the scientific codes with as few changes as possible, while
allowing them to access the NVM transparently as if they access persistent
storage. Our results show that DCPMM allows scientific applications to fully
utilize nodes' locality by providing them with sufficiently-large main memory.
Moreover, it can be used for providing a high-performance replacement for
persistent storage. Thus, the usage of DCPMM has the potential of replacing
standard HDD and SSD storage devices in HPC architectures and enabling a more
efficient platform for modern supercomputing applications.

images from existing public datasets do not represent real-world scenarios well
enough in terms of view variations and data distributions (where real faces
largely outnumber synthetic faces). The state-of-the-art methods do not
generalize well in real-world problems and lack the interpretability of
detection results. Performance of existing GAN-face detection models degrades
significantly when facing imbalanced data distributions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a robust, attentive, end-to-end network that can spot
GAN-generated faces by analyzing their eye inconsistencies. Specifically, our
model learns to identify inconsistent eye components by localizing and
comparing the iris artifacts between the two eyes automatically. Our deep
network addresses the imbalance learning issues by considering the AUC loss and
the traditional cross-entropy loss jointly. Comprehensive evaluations of the
FFHQ dataset in terms of both balanced and imbalanced scenarios demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

The goal of the paper is to study the 3D distribution of small-scale

Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter. We used a first commissioning
data set acquired by the EUI's High Resolution EUV telescope on 30 May 2020 in
the 174 {\AA} passband and we combined it with simultaneous data taken by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory in a
similar 171 {\AA} passband. The two-pixel spatial resolution of the two
telescopes is 400 km and 880 km, respectively, which is sufficient to identify
the campfires in both data sets. The two spacecraft had an angular separation
of around 31.5 degrees (essentially in heliographic longitude), which allowed
for the 3D reconstruction of the campfire position. These observations
represent the first time that stereoscopy was achieved for brightenings at such
a small scale. Manual and automatic triangulation methods were used to
characterize the campfire data. The height of the campfires is located between
1000 km and 5000 km above the photosphere and we find a good agreement between
the manual and automatic methods. The internal structure of campfires is mostly
unresolved by AIA; however, for a particularly large campfire, we were able to
triangulate a few pixels, which are all in a narrow range between 2500 and 4500
km. The low height of EUI campfires suggests that they belong to the previously
unresolved fine structure of the transition region and low corona of the quiet
Sun. They are probably apexes of small-scale dynamic loops heated internally to
coronal temperatures. This work demonstrates that high-resolution stereoscopy
of structures in the solar atmosphere has become feasible.

more diffuse emission is expected. LDR2 reveals the presence of extended radio
structures around 66/99 of the BL Lac nuclei, with angular extents ranging up
to 115 arcseconds, corresponding to spatial extents of 410 kpc. The extended
emission is likely to be both unbeamed diffuse emission and beamed emission
associated with relativistic bulk motion in jets. The spatial extents and
luminosities of the extended emission are consistent with the AGN unification
scheme where BL Lacs correspond to low-excitation radio galaxies with the jet
axis aligned along the line-of-sight. While extended emission is detected
around the majority of BL Lacs, the median 144-1400 MHz spectral index and core
dominance at 144 MHz indicate that the core component contributes ~42% on
average to the total low-frequency flux density. A stronger correlation was
found between the 144 MHz core flux density and the gamma-ray photon flux (r =
0.69) compared to the 144 MHz extended flux density and the gamma-ray photon
flux (r = 0.42). This suggests that the radio-to-gamma-ray connection weakens
at low radio frequencies because the population of particles that give rise to

pervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window
estimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace
projection; to store the marginalization prior we employ a matrix square root
of the Hessian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid forming normal
equations and update the square root prior directly with a specialized QR
decomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is
algebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on
the Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deficient Jacobians
producing a prior equivalent to SC with Moore-Penrose inverse. Our evaluation
of visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demonstrates that
the proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows
that in single precision, conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to
numeric failures and reduced accuracy. We analyse numeric properties of the

dimension of the metric space, we show that the distortion of STV is $O(d \log
\log m)$, where $m$ represents the number of candidates. For doubling metrics
this implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general
metrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by
Skowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under
low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first
nexus between the performance of any voting rule and the ""intrinsic

nearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind.

learning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes. Specifically, we introduce
simple, deterministic and decentralized exploration/exploitation dynamics, and
we show that they converge to a candidate with $O(1)$ distortion. Finally,
driven by applications in facility location games, we consider several
refinements and extensions of the standard metric-setting. Namely, we prove

Existing works with optimal strategies are computationally complex and are not

facilitating bursty traffic in a PON framework while satisfying strict QoS (age

$\tau\sim100{\rm days}$, similar as normal quasars. And, based on BH mass in
SDSS J1039 through the msig relation and on the correlation between AGN
continuum luminosity and total H$\alpha$ luminosity, the expected broad
H$\alpha$, if there was, could be re-constructed with line width about
$300-1000{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ and with line flux about $666\times10^{-17}{\rm

robust evidence to reject the probability that the intrinsic probable broad

Moreover, the SDSS J1039 does follow the same correlation between continuum
luminosity and [O~{\sc iii}] line luminosity as the one for normal broad line
AGN, indicating SDSS J1039 classified as a changing-look AGN at dim state can

psychosocial intervention to persons with dementia (PwDs). We aim at a
conversation strategy for the robot by reinforcement learning to stimulate the
PwD to talk. Specifically, to characterize the stochastic reactions of a PwD to
the robot's actions, a simulation model of a PwD is developed which features
the transition probabilities among different PwD states consisting of the
response relevance, emotion levels and confusion conditions. A Q-learning (QL)
algorithm is then designed to achieve the best conversation strategy for the
robot. The objective is to stimulate the PwD to talk as much as possible while
keeping the PwD's states as positive as possible. In certain conditions, the
achieved strategy gives the PwD choices to continue or change the topic, or
stop the conversation, so that the PwD has a sense of control to mitigate the
conversation stress. To achieve this, the standard QL algorithm is revised to
deliberately integrate the impact of PwD's choices into the Q-value updates.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the learning convergence and
validate the efficacy of the achieved strategy. Tests show that the strategy is
capable to duly adjust the difficulty level of prompt according to the PwD's
states, take actions (e.g., repeat or explain the prompt, or comfort) to help
the PwD out of bad states, and allow the PwD to control the conversation
tendency when bad states continue.

long, with different mechanisms: the tensor force, cross-shell mixing, and
three-body forces, proposed to explain the cancellations that lead to a small
transition matrix element. Purpose: We revisit and analyze the role of the
tensor force for the $\beta$ decay of $^{14}$C as well as of neighboring
isotopes. Methods: We add a tensor force to the Gogny interaction, and derive
an effective Hamiltonian for shell-model calculations. The calculations were
carried out in a $p$-$sd$ model space to investigate cross-shell effects.
Furthermore, we decompose the wave functions according to the total orbital
angular momentum $L$ in order to analyze the effects of the tensor force and
cross-shell mixing.
  Results: The inclusion of the tensor force significantly improves the
shell-model calculations of the $\beta$-decay properties of carbon isotopes. In
particular, the anomalously slow $\beta$ decay of $^{14}$C can be explained by
the isospin $T=0$ part of the tensor force, which changes the components of
$^{14}$N with the orbital angular momentum $L=0,1$, and results in a dramatic
suppression of the Gamow-Teller transition strength. At the same time, the
description of other nearby $\beta$ decays are improved.
  Conclusions: Decomposition of wave function into $L$ components illuminates
how the tensor force modifies nuclear wave functions, in particular suppression
of $\beta$-decay matrix elements. Cross-shell mixing also has a visible impact
on the $\beta$-decay strength. Inclusion of the tensor force does not seem to
significantly change, however, binding energies of the nuclei within the
phenomenological interaction.

time-sensitive 5G applications. However, the ""microburst"" may occur even in
lightly-loaded scenarios, which leads to the indeterministic service latency
(i.e., unpredictable delay or delay variation), hence hindering the deployment
of MEC. Deterministic IP networking (DIP) has been proposed that can provide
bounds on latency, and high reliability in the large-scale networks.
Nevertheless, the direct migration of DIP into the MEC network is non-trivial
owing to its original design for the Ethernet with homogeneous devices.
Meanwhile, DIP also faces the challenges on the network throughput and
scheduling flexibility. In this paper, we delve into the adoption of DIP for
the MEC networks and some of the relevant aspects. A deterministic MEC (D-MEC)
network is proposed to deliver the deterministic service (i.e., providing the
MEC service with bounded service latency). In the D-MEC network, two
mechanisms, including the cycle mapping and cycle shifting, are designed to
enable: (i) seamless and deterministic transmission with heterogeneous
underlaid resources; and (ii) traffic shaping on the edges to improve the
resource utilization. We also formulate a joint configuration to maximize the
network throughput with deterministic QoS guarantees. Extensive simulations

decreases then increases as the curvature correction tends towards the
Chern-Simons limit in a backreaction dependent fashion. However, the decrease
of the backreaction, the increase of the scalar mass, or the increase of the
number of nodes will weaken this subtle effect of the curvature correction.
Moreover, for the curvature correction approaching the Chern-Simons limit, we
find that the gap frequency $\omega_g/T_c$ of the conductivity decreases first
and then increases when the backreaction increases in a scalar mass dependent
fashion, which is different from the finding in the ($3+1$)-dimensional

exhibits two distinctive features: a deviation in the peak region and a second
bump appearing $\sim 61$~days after the main peak. Although a binary-lens model
can explain the overall features, it leaves subtle but noticeable residuals in
the peak region. We find that the residuals can be explained by the presence of
either a planetary companion located close to the primary of the binary lens
(3L1S model) or an additional close companion to the source (2L2S model).
Although the 3L1S model is favored over the 2L2S model, with $\Delta\chi^2\sim
8$, securely resolving the degeneracy between the two models is difficult with
the currently available photometric data. According to the 3L1S interpretation,
the lens is a planetary system, in which a planet with a mass
$0.51^{+0.51}_{-0.23}~M_{\rm J}$ is in an S-type orbit around a binary composed
of stars with masses $0.27^{+0.27}_{-0.12}~M_\odot$ and
$0.10^{+0.10}_{-0.04}~M_\odot$. According to the 2L2S interpretation, on the
other hand, the source is composed of G- and K-type giant stars, and the lens
is composed of a low-mass M dwarf and a brown dwarf with masses
$0.12^{+0.12}_{-0.05}~M_\odot$ and $0.045^{+0.045}_{-.019}~M_\odot$,
respectively. The event illustrates the need for through model testing in the
interpretation of lensing events with complex features in light curves.

curve exhibits three distinctive sets of caustic-crossing features. It is found
that the overall features of the light curve are approximately described by a
binary-lens (2L1S) model, but the model leaves substantial residuals. We test
various interpretations with the aim of explaining the residuals. We find that
the residuals can be explained either by considering a nonrectilinear
lens-source motion caused by the microlens-parallax and lens-orbital effects or
by adding a low-mass companion to the binary lens (3L1S model). The degeneracy
between the higher-order 2L1S model and the 3L1S model is very severe, making
it difficult to single out a correct solution based on the photometric data.
This degeneracy was known before for two previous events (MACHO-97-BLG-41 and
OGLE-2013-BLG-0723), which led to the false detections of planets in binary
systems, and thus the identification of the degeneracy for KMT-2021-BLG-0322
illustrates that the degeneracy can be not only common but also very severe,
emphasizing the need to check both interpretations of deviations from 2L1S
models. From the Bayesian analysis conducted with the measured lensing
observables of the event timescale, angular Einstein radius, and microlens
parallax, it was estimated that the binary lens components have masses $(M_1,
M_2) =(0.62^{+0.25}_{-0.26}~M_\odot,0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.03}~M_\odot)$, for both
2L1S and 3L1S solutions, and the mass of the tertiary lens component according

Previous investigations suggest these structures to be associated with
shock-formation in the underlying evolution equations, with the regularizing
Gibbs-Thomson effect required for finite tip curvature. Here, we find a class
of exact solutions that act as attractors for the shape dynamics in two and
three dimensions. Intriguingly, the solutions exhibit large but finite tip

reason about the relations between them. To address this, we propose a
Star-shaped Reasoning Graph Network (S-RGN). Our S-RGN first constructs a
star-shaped graph where each surrounding node encodes the information of
comparisons in a feature dimension and the central node is employed as the
bridge for the interaction of surrounding nodes. Then we perform relational
reasoning on this star graph with iterative message passing. The proposed S-RGN
uses only one central node to analyze and process information from all
surrounding nodes, which limits its reasoning capacity. We further develop a
Hierarchical Reasoning Graph Network (H-RGN) to exploit more powerful and
flexible capacity. More specifically, our H-RGN introduces a set of latent
reasoning nodes and constructs a hierarchical graph with them. Then bottom-up
comparative information abstraction and top-down comprehensive signal
propagation are iteratively performed on the hierarchical graph to update the
node features. Extensive experimental results on four widely used kinship
databases show that the proposed methods achieve very competitive results.

obtaining efficient AI models for various real-time applications. Channel
pruning is one important compression strategy and is widely used in slimming
various DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to
remove channels whose importance is smallest. However, it remains unclear what
criteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various
channel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy
sampling strategies to train sub-nets, which often causes the training
instability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the
research gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable
Polarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be
plugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the
on-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process,
the polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to
exact zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin.
When training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed,
while other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution
kernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the
trained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show
that the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
various benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios. We also apply GDP to

test performance sees no drop (even slightly improved) with over 60% FLOPs

model for three-dimensional (3D) A2G channels under urban scenarios is
developed. By considering the factors, i.e., building height distribution,
building width, building space, carrier frequency, and transceiver's heights,
the proposed model is suitable for different frequencies and altitudes.
Moreover, in order to get a closed-form expression and reduce the computational
complexity, an approximate parametric model is also built with the
machine-learning (ML) method to estimate model parameters. The simulation
results show that the proposed model has good consistency with existing models
at the low altitude. When the altitude increases, it has better performance by
comparing with that of the ray-tracing Monte-Carlo simulation data. The

violation and CPT violation. The $K^{\ast}(892)$ (hereinafter referred to as
$K^{\ast}$) meson can be produced via $J/\psi$ decays at BESIII. In this paper,
we study CP violation and $K_S^0-K_L^0$ asymmetry in the $J/\psi$ decays
involving the $K^{\ast}$ meson in the final states and obtain the following
results \begin{align} {\mathcal A}_{CP}\left(J/\psi\rightarrow
K^{\ast}f_{J/\psi}\rightarrow K^0_{S}\pi
f_{J/\psi}\right)=\left(3.64\pm0.04\right)\times 10^{-3},\nonumber\\ {\mathcal

two cases: the samples of $10^{10}$ and $10^{12}$ $J/\psi$ events, we calculate
the expected numbers of the observed signal events on the CP violation and the
$K_S^0-K_L^0$ asymmetry in the $J/\psi$ decays with $K^{\ast}$ meson in the
final states, we find that the BESIII experiment may be able to unambiguously
observe CP violation and $K_S^0-K_L^0$ asymmetry for each of these two cases.
We study the possibility to constraint the CPT violation parameter $z$ and
discuss the sensitivity for the measurement of $z$ in $J/\psi$ decays with
$K^{\ast}$ meson in the final states at BESIII. The sensitivity of the
measurement of $z$ depend on the measured precision of the parameters
$m_L-m_S$, $\Gamma_L$, $\Gamma_S$, $p$ and $q$ and the consistence between the
values of $t_0$ and $t_1$ and the event selection criteria in experiment.

to the strictly stationary exponentially $\beta$-mixing case. Our analysis is
based on explicitly controlling the multiplier process arising from the
interaction between the noise and the function evaluations on inputs. It allows
for the interaction to be even polynomially heavy-tailed, which covers a

with twin-CME eruptions but without large SEP observations at L1 point. We
combine remote-sensing and in situ observations from multiple spacecraft to
investigate the role of magnetic connectivity in SEP detection and the CME
information in 3-dimensional (3D) space. We study one-on-one correlations of
the priCME 3D speed, flare intensity, suprathermal backgrounds, and height of
CME-CME interaction with the SEP intensity. Among these, the priCME speed is
found to correlate with the SEP peak intensity at the highest level. We use the
projection correlation method to analyze the correlations between combinations
of these multiple independent factors and the SEP peak intensity. We find that
the only combination of two or more parameters that has higher correlation with
the SEP peak intensity than the CME speed is the CME speed combined with the
propagation direction. This further supports the dominant role of the priCME in
controlling the SEP enhancements, and emphasizes the consideration of the
latitudinal effect. Overall, the magnetic connectivity in longitude as well as
latitude and the relatively lower priCME speed may explain the existence of the
twin-CME SEP-poor events. The role of the barrier effect of preCME(s) is
discussed for an event on 2013 October 28.

photons are twisted. We developed the full-twisted scattering theory to
describe the transfer of angular momentum before and after the interaction. It
is found that the total angular momentum (TAM) of the photon is equally
distributed among the positron and electron. For each photon TAM value, the
generated leptons gain higher average OAM number when the photon spin is
anti-parallel to its TAM. The impact of photon polarization on the OAM spectrum
profile and the scattering probability is more significant at small photon TAM
numbers, owing to the various interaction channels influenced by flipping the

The originality of our solution lies in quantizing the received signal by an
adapted 1-bit window comparator, rather than a traditional 1-bit quantizer.
This enables us to divide the space of observed binary sequences into two
typical sets (w.r.t. the distribution of the no. of 1's in a sequence)
asymptotically, where the first set corresponds to $\mathcal{H}_0$ and the
second to $\mathcal{H}_1$. As a result, we reduce the detection problem to
determining the highly probable set for an observed sequence. Thus, a very
low-complexity binary hypothesis detector is proposed and its probability of
detection is given. To show the high efficacy of the proposed 1-bit receiver
structure, we consider two wireless applications; jamming detection in a
massive MIMO system, and probing a non-stationary low-power transmitter in a
wireless sensor network (WSN), assuming unknown Rayleigh-fading channels.
Compared with an unquantized system employing a chi-square test, it is shown
that the performance loss can be roughly as large as $10\%$ in massive MIMO and
this gap diminishes as sequence length or/and jamming power increases. For WSN,
we show that compared with an unquantized system, the performance gap becomes
smaller when the observation interval is extended over a few symbols.

one-dimensional lattice systems to characterize two-dimensional topological
insulators. The main idea is to use spiral boundary conditions which sweep all
lattice sites in one-dimensional order. We find that the sign of the
polarization changes at topological transition points of the two-dimensional
Wilson-Dirac model (the lattice version of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model) in
the same way as in one-dimensional systems. Thus the polarization plays the
role of ""order parameter"" to characterize the topological insulating state and
enables us to study topological phases in different dimensions in a unified
way.

with full tunability and without dissipation. In our optical-lattice system,
the exciton is replaced by an atomic excitation, while an atomic matter wave is
substituted for the photon under a strong dynamical coupling. We access the
band structure of the matter-wave polariton spectroscopically by coupling the

real world software projects. They leverage predefined heuristic static
analysis rules to scan source code or binary code of a software project, and
report violations to these rules as warnings to be verified. However, the
advantages of static bug finders are overshadowed by such issues as uncovered
obvious bugs, false positives, etc. To improve these tools, many techniques
have been proposed to filter out false positives reported or design new static
analysis rules. Nevertheless, the under-performance of bug finders can also be
caused by the incorrectness of current rules contained in the static bug
finders, which is not explored yet. In this work, we propose a differential
testing approach to detect bugs in the rules of four widely-used static bug
finders, i.e., SonarQube, PMD, SpotBugs, and ErrorProne, and conduct a
qualitative study about the bugs found. To retrieve paired rules across static
bug finders for differential testing, we design a heuristic-based rule mapping
method which combines the similarity in rules description and the overlap in
warning information reported by the tools. The experiment on 2,728 open source
projects reveals 46 bugs in the static bug finders, among which 24 are fixed or
confirmed and the left are awaiting confirmation. We also summarize 13 bug
patterns in the static analysis rules based on their context and root causes,

or in other tools. This study indicates that the commonly-used static bug
finders are not as reliable as they might have been envisaged. It not only
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, but also highlights the need to
continue improving the reliability of the static bug finders.

identification of plant water stress status enables suitable corrective
measures to be applied to obtain the expected crop yield. Further, improving
crop yield through precision agriculture methods is a key component of climate
policy and the UN sustainable development goals [1]. Leaf water content (LWC)
is a measure that can be used to estimate water content and identify stressed
plants. LWC during the early crop growth stages is an important indicator of
plant productivity and yield. The effect of water stress can be instantaneous
[15], affecting gaseous exchange or long-term, significantly reducing [9, 18,
22]. It is thus necessary to identify potential plant water stress during the
early stages of growth [15] to introduce corrective irrigation and alleviate
stress. LWC is also useful for identifying plant genotypes that are tolerant to
water stress and salinity by measuring the stability of LWC even under
artificially induced water stress [18, 25]. Such experiments generally employ
destructive procedures to obtain the LWC, which is time-consuming and labor
intensive. Accordingly, this research has developed a non-destructive method to
estimate LWC from UAV-based hyperspectral data.

extraction from medical images with a wide array of applications in clinical
practice, such as clinical decision support in oncology. However, noise in low
dose computed tomography (CT) scans can impair the accurate extraction of
radiomic features. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using
deep learning generative models to improve the performance of radiomics from
low dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics
and LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival
prediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study
as generative models to transform low dose CT images into full dose CT images.
Radiomic features extracted from the original and improved CT scans were used
to build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention
based multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung
cancer diagnosis respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of the
models derived from the original and improved CT scans. Encoder-decoder
networks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival
prediction from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value<0.01). On the other hand, Encoder-decoder
network and CGAN can improve the AUC of lung cancer diagnosis from 0.84 to 0.88

significant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder network and
CGAN (p-value=0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs. Generative
models can improve the performance of low dose CT-based radiomics in different
tasks. Hence, denoising using generative models seems to be a necessary
pre-processing step for calculating radiomic features from low dose CTs.

MIS the acquired frames are compromised by different noises and get blurred
caused by motions from different sources. Moreover, when underwater environment

effects are originated from the environment, poor control on illuminations and
imaging conditions. Additionally, in MIS, procedure like automatic white

answer that question, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the
effect of confinement on a supercooled liquid activated by the periodic folding
of a molecular motor. We find that the motor opening angle controls the
activation of the medium and use that result to study the effect of different
activations on the confined supercooled liquid. We observe an increase of the
activation effect on the dynamics when the medium is confined. We find that the
confinement slowing down dependence with the pore radius depends on the
activation of the liquid. We argue that these findings result from a
modification of dynamic correlation lengths with activation. In this picture
the activation permits to control the liquid correlation length and dynamics
inside the pore. Studying the local structure we observe a modification of the
layering organization induced by the activation. We also find that the mobility
inside the pore depends on the layers, being larger where the local density is
small.

primary star and a hotter B-type secondary star. This paper presents the
time-series photometric and asteroseismic results of the EL CVn-type star
1SWASP J024743.37-251549.2. Well-defined eclipsing light curves were
constructed by using the novel high-cadence $BV$ data and archival {\it TESS}
data, and the physical parameters of each binary component were derived by
modeling the light curves. Multiple frequency analysis was performed to
investigate the pulsation properties of the binary components. A reliable
signal could not be detected in the high-frequency region of 100--300
day$^{-1}$, unlike in the previous discovery of three frequencies around 200
day$^{-1}$. This indicates that the pulsation amplitudes of the pre-helium
white dwarf secondary component decreased considerably. By contrast, 12
frequencies were detected in the range of 33 to 53 day$^{-1}$. Most of them
were classified as $\delta$ Sct-type pulsations originating from the primary
star. Theoretical frequencies for the seismic analysis were obtained by adding
the non-rotating model frequencies from the GYRE and their rotational shifts
from the complete calculation approach. Grid-based fitting was conducted for
various stellar properties. The theoretical frequencies and stellar parameters
of the best solution concurred well with the observations. The rotation rate
was constrained to 1.50 $\pm$ 0.02 day$^{-1}$, indicating the synchronized
rotation of the primary star. The results imply that the complete approach
based on the polytropic model is applicable to the seismic analysis of
fast-rotating $\delta$ Sct stars.

the proposed model has good consistency with existing models at the low

established for random growth and related KPZ systems, the validity of these

gap between stochastic KPZ systems and deterministic STC perturbations by
conducting extensive simulations of a prototypical STC system, namely the
logistic coupled map lattice. We show that the perturbation interfaces, defined
by the logarithm of the modulus of the perturbation vector components, exhibit
the universal, geometry-dependent statistical laws of the KPZ class, despite
the deterministic nature of STC. We demonstrate that KPZ statistics for three
established geometries arise for different initial profiles of the
perturbation, namely point (local), uniform, and ""pseudo-stationary"" initial
perturbations, the last being the statistically stationary state of KPZ
interfaces given independently of the Lyapunov vector. This geometry dependence
lasts until the KPZ correlation length becomes comparable to the system size.
Thereafter, perturbation vectors converge to the unique Lyapunov vector,
showing characteristic meandering, coalescence, and annihilation of borders of
piece-wise regions that remain different from the Lyapunov vector. Our work
implies that the KPZ universality for stochastic systems generally
characterizes deterministic STC perturbations, providing new insights for STC,
such as the universal dependence on initial perturbation and beyond.

in a variety of continuous systems including liquid crystals, filament bundles

overall broad line profile (FWHM $= 1000$ km/s) that is skewed towards
redshifted velocities up to at least $v\sim1000$ km/s. Using the optically thin
assumption, we estimate a strict lower limit for the total molecular CGM mass
observed by ACA of $M_{mol}^{CGM}>10^{10}~M_{\odot}$. There is however room for
up to $M^{CGM}_{mol}\sim 1.7\times 10^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$, once optically thick

crucial rule in seeding metal-enriched, dense gas on halo scales. However, the

restraint. Hence, rumors and fake news can quickly spread on a huge scale. This
may pose a threat to the credibility of social media and can cause serious
consequences in real life. Therefore, the task of rumor detection and
verification has become extremely important. Assessing the veracity of a social
media message (e.g., by fact checkers) involves analyzing the text of the
message, its context and any multimedia attachment. This is a very
time-consuming task that can be much helped by machine learning. In the
literature, most message veracity verification methods only exploit textual
contents and metadata. Very few take both textual and visual contents, and more
particularly images, into account. In this paper, we second the hypothesis that
exploiting all of the components of a social media post enhances the accuracy
of veracity detection. To further the state of the art, we first propose using
a set of advanced image features that are inspired from the field of image
quality assessment, which effectively contributes to rumor detection. These
metrics are good indicators for the detection of fake images, even for those
generated by advanced techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs).
Then, we introduce the Multimodal fusiON framework to assess message veracIty
in social neTwORks (MONITOR), which exploits all message features (i.e., text,
social context, and image features) by supervised machine learning. Such
algorithms provide interpretability and explainability in the decisions taken,
which we believe is particularly important in the context of rumor
verification. Experimental results show that MONITOR can detect rumors with an
accuracy of 96% and 89% on the MediaEval benchmark and the FakeNewsNet dataset,
respectively. These results are significantly better than those of
state-of-the-art machine learning baselines.

not answered. Some potentially habitable exoplanets have been hypothesized, but
since Earth is the only known habitable planet, measures of habitability are
necessarily determined with Earth as the reference. Several recent works

Classification of potentially habitable exoplanets using supervised learning is
another emerging area of study. However, both modeling and supervised learning
approaches suffer from drawbacks. We propose an anomaly detection method, the
Multi-Stage Memetic Algorithm (MSMA), to detect anomalies and extend it to an
unsupervised clustering algorithm MSMVMCA to use it to detect potentially

Earth is an anomaly, with the possibility of existence of few other anomalies

of a metal gate electrode with ungated and gated QH regions in both integer and
fractional QH regimes using a time-resolved measurement scheme. The observed
plasmon waveform was delayed and broadened due to the influence of the charge
puddles formed around the channel. The charge velocity and diffusion constant
of the plasmon mode were evaluated by analyzing the waveform using a
distributed circuit model. We found that the conductive puddles in the gated
region induce significant dissipation in plasmon transport. For instance, a
fractional interface channel with a reasonably fast velocity was obtained by
preparing a fractional state in the ungated region and an integer state in the
gated region, whereas a channel in the swapped configuration was quite
dissipative. This reveals a high-quality interface channel that provides a
clean path to transport fractional charges for studying various fractional QH
phenomena.

companionship defined as follows: For a theory $T$, $T_{\exists\vee\forall}$
denotes the logical consequences of $T$ which are boolean combinations of
universal sentences. $T^*$ is the AMC of $T$ if it is model complete and
$T_{\exists\vee\forall}=T^*_{\exists\vee\forall}$.
  We use AMC to study the continuum problem and to gauge the expressive power
of forcing. We show that (a definable version of) $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_2$ is
the unique solution to the continuum problem which can be in the AMC of a
""partial Morleyization"" of the $\in$-theory $\mathsf{ZFC}+$""there are class

forcibility overlaps with the apparently weaker notion of consistency for any
mathematical problem $\psi$ expressible as a $\Pi_2$-sentence of a (very large
fragment of) third order arithmetic ($\mathsf{CH}$, the Suslin hypothesis, the
Whitehead conjecture for free groups are a small sample of such problems
$\psi$).
  Partial Morleyizations can be described as follows: let
$\mathsf{Form}_{\tau}$ be the set of first order $\tau$-formulae; for
$A\subseteq \mathsf{Form}_\tau$, $\tau_A$ is the expansion of $\tau$ adding
atomic relation symbols $R_\phi$ for all formulae $\phi$ in $A$ and
$T_{\tau,A}$ is the $\tau_A$-theory asserting that each $\tau$-formula
$\phi(\vec{x})\in A$ is logically equivalent to the corresponding atomic
formula $R_\phi(\vec{x})$. For a $\tau$-theory $T$ $T+T_{\tau,A}$ is the
partial Morleyization of $T$ induced by $A\subseteq \mathsf{Form}_\tau$.
  Finally we characterize a strong form of Woodin's axiom $(*)$ as the
assertion that the first order theory of $H_{\aleph_2}$ as formalized in a
certain natural signature is model complete.

optimal and flexible operations by efficiently utilizing transportation
capacity. At the same time, interconnection of transport operations increases
complexity at a network level, which reduces the predictability of the response
of the system to disruptions. However, our understanding of the behavior of
such systems is still limited. In particular, the topology of the network,
which changes as the systems are integrated, is an important factor that
affects the performance of the entire system. Knowledge of such mechanisms
would be useful in the design and evaluation of integrated logistics. Here, we
developed a simple mathematical model that extracts the essence of the problem
and performed extensive numerical experiments by Monte Carlo simulations for
three scenarios that mimic changes in demand: (i) locally and temporally
increased traffic demand, (ii) globally and temporally increased traffic
demand, and (iii) permanent change in demand pattern, under various conditions
on the type of route-finding algorithm, network structure, and transportation
capacity. Adaptive route-finding algorithms were more effective in square
lattice and random networks, which contained many bypass routes, than in
hub-and-spoke networks. Furthermore, the square lattice and random networks
were robust to the change in the demand pattern and temporal blockage of
delivery paths (e.g., due to high demand). We suggest that such preferable
properties are only present in networks with redundancy and that the bypass
structure is an important criterion for designing network logistics.

renewable generation power the system can handle. In this paper, we aim to
provide an improved dispatchable region approximation method in distribution
networks. First, based on the nonlinear Dist-Flow model, an optimization
problem that minimizes the sum of slack variables is formulated to describe the
dispatchable region. The nonconvexity caused by alternating-current (AC) power
flow constraints makes it intractable. To deal with this issue, the problem is
relaxed to a second-order cone program (SOCP) whose strong dual problem is
derived. Then, an SOCP-based projection algorithm is developed to construct a
convex polytopic approximation. We prove that the proposed algorithm can
generate the accurate SOCP-relaxed dispatchable region under certain
conditions. Furthermore, a heuristic method is proposed to approximately remove
the regions that make the SOCP relaxation inexact. The final region obtained is
the difference of several convex sets and can be nonconvex. Thus, the proposed
approach may provide a better approximation of the actually nonconvex
dispatchable region than previous work that could construct convex sets only.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a high
accuracy of approximation with simple computation.

successful construction is due to the contribution of a time transformation.
The algorithm exhibits a good long-term numerical performance in stable

dynamics of order and chaos of charged particles is surveyed. In some
circumstances, an increase of the dragging effects of the spacetime seems to
weaken the extent of chaos from the global phase-space structure on Poincare
sections. However, an increase of the magnetic parameter strengthens the
chaotic properties. On the other hand, fast Lyapunov indicators show that there
is no universal rule for the dependence of the transition between different

do not always weaken the extent of chaos from a local point of view.

physicochemical processes on icy surfaces at very low temperatures. The present
study experimentally and computationally investigates the reaction of solid OCS
with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water at low temperatures. The
results show that the addition of H to OCS proceeds via quantum tunneling, and
further addition of H leads to the formation of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen

Supervised Learning (SL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), issues still exist.
Firstly, previous methods do not provide explicit and effective guidance for
Questioner to generate visually related and informative questions. Secondly,
the effect of RL is hampered by an incompetent component, i.e., the Guesser,
who makes image predictions based on the generated dialogs and assigns rewards
accordingly. To enhance VD Questioner: 1) we propose a Related entity enhanced
Questioner (ReeQ) that generates questions under the guidance of related
entities and learns entity-based questioning strategy from human dialogs; 2) we
propose an Augmented Guesser (AugG) that is strong and is optimized for the VD
setting especially. Experimental results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset show that
our approach achieves state-of-theart performance on both image-guessing task
and question diversity. Human study further proves that our model generates
more visually related, informative and coherent questions.

across a wide range of industries such as home maintenance, health care, light
manufacturing, and construction. However, current direct control methods are
impractical, and existing tools for programming robot remotely have focused on
users with significant robotic experience. Extending robot remote programming
to end users, i.e., users who are experts in a domain but novices in robotics,
requires tools that balance the rich features necessary for complex
teleoperation tasks with ease of use. The primary challenge to usability is
that novice users are unable to specify complete and robust task plans to allow
a robot to perform duties autonomously, particularly in highly variable
environments. Our solution is to allow operators to specify shorter sequences
of high-level commands, which we call task-level authoring, to create periods
of variable robot autonomy. This approach allows inexperienced users to create
robot behaviors in uncertain environments by interleaving exploration,
specification of behaviors, and execution as separate steps. End users are able
to break down the specification of tasks and adapt to the current needs of the
interaction and environments, combining the reactivity of direct control to
asynchronous operation. In this paper, we describe a prototype system
contextualized in light manufacturing and its empirical validation in a user
study where 18 participants with some programming experience were able to
perform a variety of complex telemanipulation tasks with little training. Our
results show that our approach allowed users to create flexible periods of
autonomy and solve rich manipulation tasks. Furthermore, participants
significantly preferred our system over comparative more direct interfaces,
demonstrating the potential of our approach.

every graph without an odd $K_t$-minor is $2f(t)$-colorable. Using this, the

a pure cooling process. Their cooling rate is adopted as cosmic chronometer to
constrain the age of several Galactic populations, including the disk, globular

to a slowing down of the cooling process in ~70% of the WDs in M13, caused by

experimentally, in a water tank, and never in an astrophysical setting. Here,
we measure this amplification for a nonlinear optics experiment in the

to fluctuations on scales larger than the survey window. In this work, we study
the impact of the survey geometry on the SSC and, subsequently, on cosmological
parameter inference. We devise a fast SSC approximation that accounts for the
survey geometry and compare its performance to the common approximation of
rescaling the results by the fraction of the sky covered by the survey,
$f_\mathrm{SKY}$, dubbed 'full-sky approximation'. To gauge the impact of our
new SSC recipe, dubbed 'partial-sky', we perform Fisher forecasts on the
parameters of the $(w_0,w_a)$-CDM model in a 3x2 points analysis, varying the
survey area, the geometry of the mask and the galaxy distribution inside our
redshift bins. The differences in the marginalised forecast errors, with the
full-sky approximation performing poorly for small survey areas but excellently
for stage-IV-like areas, are found to be absorbed by the marginalisation on
galaxy bias nuisance parameters. For large survey areas, the unmarginalised
errors are underestimated by about 10% for all probes considered. This is a
hint that, even for stage-IV-like surveys, the partial-sky method introduced in

framework to find violations of Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) properties.
  Our framework takes as input a sequential program written in C/C++, and an
LTL property. It finds violations, or counterexample traces, of the LTL
property in stateful software systems; however, it does not achieve
verification. Our work substantially extends directed greybox fuzzing to
witness arbitrarily complex event orderings. We note that existing directed
greybox fuzzing approaches are limited to witnessing reaching a location or
witnessing simple event orderings like use-after-free. At the same time,
compared to model checkers, our approach finds the counterexamples faster,
thereby finding more counterexamples within a given time budget.
  Our LTL-Fuzzer tool, built on top of the AFL fuzzer, is shown to be effective
in detecting bugs in well-known protocol implementations, such as OpenSSL and
Telnet. We use LTL-Fuzzer to reproduce known vulnerabilities (CVEs), to find 15

challenging because the obtained sensing errors generally tend to diverge with
decreasing temperature. Using a continuous-variable system as a thermometer, we
propose non-Markovian quantum thermometry to measure the temperature of a
quantum reservoir. A mechanism to make the sensing error $\delta T$ scale with
the temperature $T$ as the Landau bound $\delta T\simeq T$ in the

quantum criticality of the total thermometer-reservoir system that causes this
enhanced sensitivity. Efficiently avoiding the error-divergence problem, our

coherence tomography (OCT) has enabled the evaluation of novel optic nerve head
parameters, namely the depth and curvature of the lamina cribrosa (LC).
Together with the Bruch's membrane opening minimum-rim-width, these seem to be
promising optic nerve head parameters for diagnosis and monitoring of retinal
diseases such as glaucoma. Nonetheless, these optical coherence tomography
derived biomarkers are mostly extracted through manual segmentation, which is
time-consuming and prone to bias, thus limiting their usability in clinical
practice. The automatic segmentation of optic nerve head in OCT scans could
further improve the current clinical management of glaucoma and other diseases.
  This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in automatic segmentation
of the ONH in OCT. PubMed and Scopus were used to perform a systematic review.
Additional works from other databases (IEEE, Google Scholar and ARVO IOVS) were
also included, resulting in a total of 27 reviewed studies.
  For each algorithm, the methods, the size and type of dataset used for

show that deep learning-based algorithms provide the highest accuracy,

repetitive surgical subtasks due to its ability to learn complex behaviours in

fewer patient-related complications. However, current DRL methods do not

for the automation of surgical subtasks via DRL training. We validate our
approach in a virtual scene that replicates a tissue retraction task commonly
occurring in multiple phases of an MIS. Furthermore, to evaluate the safe

indicate that a formal analysis guarantees safety with high confidence such
that the robotic instruments operate within the safe workspace and avoid

ever-increasing user demands, there is a lack of studies dealing with
congestion control. This paper enhances the performance of multi-beam high
throughput geostationary satellite systems under congestion, where the users'
quality of service (QoS) demands cannot be fully satisfied with limited
resources. In particular, we propose congestion control strategies, relying on
simple power control schemes. We formulate a multi-objective optimization
framework balancing the system sum-rate and the number of users satisfying
their QoS requirements. Next, we propose two novel approaches that effectively
handle the proposed multi-objective optimization problem. The former is a
model-based approach that relies on the weighted sum method to enrich the
number of satisfied users by solving a series of the sum-rate optimization
problems in an iterative manner. The latter is a data-driven approach that
offers a low-cost solution by utilizing supervised learning and exploiting the
optimization structures as continuous mappings. The proposed general framework
is evaluated for different linear precoding techniques, for which the low
computational complexity algorithms are designed. Numerical results manifest
that our proposed framework effectively handles the congestion issue and brings
superior improvements of rate satisfaction to many users than previous works.
Furthermore, the proposed algorithms show low run-time and make them realistic
for practical systems.

economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating
five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be
economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social
context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a
collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of
narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to
the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the
complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language

transform the simulated straight loop to a semi-torus loop and forward-model
their spectrometer and imaging emissions, mimicking observations of Hinode/EIS
and SDO/AIA. We find that the oscillation amplitudes of the intensity are
different at different slit positions, but are roughly the same in different
spectral lines or channels. X-t diagrams of both the Doppler velocity and the
Doppler width show periodic signals. We also find that the background emission
dramatically decreases the Doppler velocity, making the estimated kinetic
energy two orders of magnitude smaller than the real value. Our results show
that background subtraction can help recover the real oscillation velocity.
These results are helpful for further understanding transverse oscillations in
coronal loops and their observational signatures. However, they cast doubt on
the spectroscopically estimated energy content of transverse waves using the
Doppler velocity.

Typically, these systems achieve fault tolerance and the ability to recover

recovery. However, owing to the statistical probability of partial failures
occurring in these distributed environments and the variability of workloads
upon which jobs are expected to operate, static configurations will often not

  In this paper we present Khaos, a new approach which utilizes the parallel

borrows from the principles of Chaos Engineering: establish the steady-state

long-ranging fields, such as gravity, electromagnetism, and Yang-Mills. They
appear in the formalism once the analytic behaviour of fields near infinity is
specified and have received a renewed interest in the last years after a
possible connection with the information-loss paradox has been conjectured.
  One of the various methods used to study the asymptotic symmetries of field
theories relies on the Hamiltonian formalism and was introduced in the seminal
work of Henneaux and Troessaert, who successfully applied it to the case of
gravity and electrodynamics. The main advantage of this approach is that the
study of the asymptotic symmetries ensues from clear-cut first principles.
  After an extensive review of how the Hamiltonian approach to study asymptotic
symmetries of gauge theories works, we apply these methods to two specific
situations of physical interest. First, we deal with the non-abelian Yang-Mills
case and we show that the above principles lead to trivial asymptotic
symmetries (nothing else than the Poincar\'e group) and, as a consequence, to a
vanishing total colour charge. This is a new and somewhat unexpected result. It
implies that no globally colour-charged states exist in classical non-abelian
Yang-Mills theory.
  The second situation considered is a scalar field minimally-coupled to an
abelian gauge field, which can be used to study, at the same time, two specific
cases: scalar electrodynamics and the abelian Higgs model. We show that the
situation in scalar electrodynamics amply depends on whether the scalar field
is massive or massless, insofar as, in the latter case, one cannot canonically
implement asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, we illustrate that, in the
abelian Higgs model, the asymptotic canonical symmetries reduce to the
Poincar\'e group in an unproblematic fashion.

the weak security defences that the majority of IoT devices have, it is
critical that a blockchain-based solution targeting the IoT is not only capable
of addressing the many challenges IoT is facing, but also does not introduce

This paper aims at addressing the above needs by providing a comprehensive and
coherent review of the available blockchain solutions to determine their
ability to meet the requirements and tackle the challenges of the IoT, using
the smart home as the reference domain. Key architectural aspects of blockchain
solutions are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of
common IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and
assure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of
transactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out
identified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not
sufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with
blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On
the other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying
degrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles
specific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a
challenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the
underlying consensus protocols performance and fault tolerance is also
considered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements of our

  Overparameterized Machine Learning",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of
scientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of
the most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of
overparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with
respect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly
fitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such
interpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental
overfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear
models to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize
extremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double
descent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often
improve over the best underparameterized model in test performance.
  Understanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory
and foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear
model. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent
analyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical
learning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double
descent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of
overparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these
recent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We
emphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield
of modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.

have been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to
suffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a
different GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged
addressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural

by this, we propose PointSpectrum, a spectral method that incorporates a set

websites has, without doubt, created a dangerous concoction. Thus, it is not a
surprise that the threat posed by untrustworthy websites has emerged as a
central concern on the public agenda in many countries, including Czechia and
Slovakia. However, combating this harmful phenomenon has proven to be
difficult, with approaches primarily focusing on tackling consequences instead
of prevention, as websites are routinely seen as quasi-sovereign organisms.
Websites, however, rely upon a host of service providers, which, in a way, hold
substantial power over them. Notwithstanding the apparent power hold by such
tech stack layers, scholarship on this topic remains largely limited. This
article contributes to this small body of knowledge by providing a
first-of-its-kind systematic mapping of the back-end infrastructural support
that makes up the tech stacks of Czech and Slovak untrustworthy websites. Our
approach is based on collecting and analyzing data on top-level domain
operators, domain name Registrars, email providers, web hosting providers, and
utilized website tracking technologies of 150 Czech and Slovak untrustworthy
websites. Our findings show that the Czech and Slovak untrustworthy website
landscape relies on a vast number of back-end services spread across multiple
countries, but in key tech stack layers is nevertheless still heavily dominated
by locally based companies. Finally, given our findings, we discuss various
possible avenues of utilizing the numeral tech stack layers in combating online
disinformation.

from measurements of $X_{\rm max}$ distributions by fitting them with Monte
Carlo (MC) predictions for different primary species of nuclei in each energy

results obtained from both data sets suggest that the mass composition of
UHECRs is dominated by protons and He nuclei ($\gtrsim 70\%$) which present a
modulation of their abundances as a function of primary energy, but keeping
their sum roughly constant. We performed an indirect comparison between the two
data sets measured by the two experiments and found a good degree of
compatibility in some energy bins around and above the \textit{ankle} ($\lg E

""aging effects"" as the longitudinal 360{\deg} information is not obtained
simultaneously. Especially during times of increased solar activity, the
evolution of the magnetic field may yield large uncertainties. A significant
source of uncertainty is the Sun's magnetic field on the side of the Sun that
is not visible to the observer. Various methods have been used to complete the
picture: synoptic charts, flux-transport models, and far side helioseismology.
In this study, we present a new method to estimate the far-side open flux
within coronal holes using STEREO EUV observations. First, we correlate the
structure of the photospheric magnetic field as observed with the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO) with
features in the transition region. From the 304A intensity distribution, which
we found to be specific to coronal holes, we derive an empirical estimate for
the open flux. Then we use a large sample of 313 SDO coronal hole observations
to verify this relation. Finally, we perform a cross-instrument calibration
from SDO to STEREO data to enable the estimation of the open flux at solar
longitudes not visible from Earth. We find that the properties of strong,
unipolar magnetic elements in the photosphere, which determine the coronal
hole's open flux, can be approximated by open fields in the transition region.
We find that structures below a threshold of 78% (STEREO) or 94% (SDO) of the
solar disk median intensity as seen in 304A filtergrams are reasonably well
correlated with the mean magnetic flux density of coronal holes (cc = 0.59).
Using the area covered by these structures (A_of) and the area of the coronal
hole (A_ch), we model the open magnetic flux of a coronal hole as |Phi_ch| =
0.25 A_ch exp(0.032 A_of) with an estimated uncertainty of 40 to 60%.

Especially vulnerabilities that compromise the confidentiality of sensitive

property, stating that the untrusted targets must not be influenced by the

address this issue, there are approaches to quantify the information flow

high computational complexity of this quantification, approximations are
needed, which introduce mispredictions. To tackle those limitations, we
reformulate the approximations. Further, we propose a tool QFlow with a higher

with the intermittent supply. This paper proposes resource management schemes
of the limited number of channels and spreading factors (SFs) with the
objective of improving the LoRa gateway energy efficiency. First, the problem
of grid power consumption minimization while satisfying the system's quality of
service demands is formulated. Specifically, both scenarios the uncorrelated
and time-correlated channels are investigated. The optimal resource management
problem is solved by decoupling the formulated problem into two sub-problems:
channel and SF assignment problem and energy management problem. Since the
optimal solution is obtained with high complexity, online resource management
heuristic algorithms that minimize the grid energy consumption are proposed.
Finally, taking into account the channel and energy correlation, adaptable
resource management schemes based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), are
developed. Simulations results show that the proposed resource management
schemes offer efficient use of renewable energy in LoRa wireless networks.

Specially, an adaptive mechanism is incorporated into the anomaly detection
model for the training and prediction of the model. Simultaneously, a unified

effects of the applied and internal stresses. The latter are split into two
contributions, misfit stresses and compatibility stresses between the elastic
$\gamma'$ phase and the elasto-plastic $\gamma$ phase, which are estimated
within a simplified composite approach. Internal stresses may induce slip
activity and/or be relaxed by it, which results in a complex sequence of slip
activation events in the different channels under increasing applied stress.
The consideration of these effects leads to a prediction of the nature and
distribution of the active slip systems within the channels in [001] tension,
compression and during low cycle fatigue. The resulting microstructural
behaviour and its consequences regarding the anisotropic nature of the

  with Unsupervised Opinion Extraction","11 pages, Findings of EMNLP'2021, 7th-11th November 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Aspect-level sentiment classification (ALSC) aims at identifying the
sentiment polarity of a specified aspect in a sentence. ALSC is a practical
setting in aspect-based sentiment analysis due to no opinion term labeling
needed, but it fails to interpret why a sentiment polarity is derived for the
aspect. To address this problem, recent works fine-tune pre-trained Transformer
encoders for ALSC to extract an aspect-centric dependency tree that can locate
the opinion words. However, the induced opinion words only provide an intuitive
cue far below human-level interpretability. Besides, the pre-trained encoder
tends to internalize an aspect's intrinsic sentiment, causing sentiment bias
and thus affecting model performance. In this paper, we propose a span-based
anti-bias aspect representation learning framework. It first eliminates the
sentiment bias in the aspect embedding by adversarial learning against aspects'
prior sentiment. Then, it aligns the distilled opinion candidates with the
aspect by span-based dependency modeling to highlight the interpretable opinion
terms. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks,
with the capability of unsupervised opinion extraction.

Simultaneously, there has
been a proliferation of programming languages and program optimization tools
for quantum computing. Existing quantum compilers use intermediate
representations (IRs) where quantum programs are described as circuits. Such
IRs fail to leverage existing work on compiler optimizations. In such IRs, it
is non-trivial to statically check for physical constraints such as the
no-cloning theorem, which states that qubits cannot be copied. We introduce
QSSA, a novel quantum IR based on static single assignment (SSA) that enables
decades of research in compiler optimizations to be applied to quantum
compilation. QSSA models quantum operations as being side-effect-free. The
inputs and outputs of the operation are in one-to-one correspondence; qubits
cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, our IR supports a static analysis
pass that verifies no-cloning at compile-time. The quantum circuit is fully
encoded within the def-use chain of the IR, allowing us to leverage existing
optimization passes on SSA representations such as redundancy elimination and
dead-code elimination. Running our QSSA-based compiler on the QASMBench and IBM
Quantum Challenge datasets, we show that our optimizations perform comparably
to IBM's Qiskit quantum compiler infrastructure. QSSA allows us to represent,
analyze, and transform quantum programs using the robust theory of SSA
representations, bringing quantum compilation into the realm of well-understood
theory and practice.

are computationally very expensive to perform layout optimization of wind
farms, and, thus, data-driven reduced order models can represent an efficient
alternative for simulating wind farms. In this work, we use real-world light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of wind-turbine wakes to construct
predictive surrogate models using machine learning. Specifically, we first
demonstrate the use of deep autoencoders to find a low-dimensional
\emph{latent} space that gives a computationally tractable approximation of the
wake LiDAR measurements. Then, we learn the mapping between the parameter space
and the (latent space) wake flow-fields using a deep neural network.
Additionally, we also demonstrate the use of a probabilistic machine learning
technique, namely, Gaussian process modeling, to learn the
parameter-space-latent-space mapping in addition to the epistemic and aleatoric
uncertainty in the data. Finally, to cope with training large datasets, we
demonstrate the use of variational Gaussian process models that provide a
tractable alternative to the conventional Gaussian process models for large
datasets. Furthermore, we introduce the use of active learning to adaptively
build and improve a conventional Gaussian process model predictive capability.
Overall, we find that our approach provides accurate approximations of the

providing a measure of task-specific quality. By augmenting training images
with k-space artefacts, we propose a novel CNN architecture to decouple sources
of uncertainty related to the task and different k-space artefacts in a
self-supervised manner. This enables the prediction of separate uncertainties
for different types of data degradation. While the uncertainty predictions
reflect the presence and severity of artefacts, the network provides more

informative measures of uncertainty on both simulated artefacts and problematic
real-world images identified by human raters, both qualitatively and
quantitatively in the form of error bars on volume measurements. Relating
artefact uncertainty to segmentation Dice scores, we observe that our
uncertainty predictions provide a better estimate of MRI quality from the point

(PREs) that transiently enhance the energy reaching the divertor target plates.
To shed light into their appearance, characteristics and energy reaching the
divertor targets, a comparative study between two tokamaks $-$ Alcator C-Mod
and ASDEX Upgrade $-$ is carried out. It is found that PREs appear only in a
subset of I-mode discharges, mainly when the plasma is close to the H-mode
transition. Also, the nature of the triggering instability is discussed by
comparing measurements close to the separatrix in both devices. The PRE
relative energy loss from the confined region increases with decreasing
pedestal top collisionality $\nu_{\mathrm{ped}}^*$. In addition, the relative
electron temperature drop at the pedestal top, which is related to the
conductive energy loss, rises with decreasing $\nu_{\mathrm{ped}}^*$. Finally,
the peak parallel energy fluence due to the PRE measured on the divertor in
both devices is compared to the model introduced in [1] for type-I ELMs. The
model is shown to provide an upper boundary for PRE energy fluence data, while
a lower boundary is found by dividing the model by three. These two boundaries
are used to make projections to future devices such as DEMO and ARC.

(TM) tasks, it still remains unclear whether they truly understand language or
measure the semantic similarity of texts by exploiting statistical bias in

the length divergence bias. We find the length divergence heuristic widely
exists in prevalent TM datasets, providing direct cues for prediction. To
determine whether TM models have adopted such heuristic, we introduce an
adversarial evaluation scheme which invalidates the heuristic. In this
adversarial setting, all TM models perform worse, indicating they have indeed
adopted this heuristic. Through a well-designed probing experiment, we
empirically validate that the bias of TM models can be attributed in part to
extracting the text length information during training. To alleviate the length
divergence bias, we propose an adversarial training method. The results
demonstrate we successfully improve the robustness and generalization ability

traditional periodic photonic crystals (PPCs) and of large thickness. The
underlying physical principles remain elusive, leaving the question of
thickness limit to achieve RGB bands unaddressed. Here, we present the first
detailed work to explore the thickness limit issue based on both theoretical
and experimental investigation. A set of heuristically derived design
principles are used to uncover that the break of translational symmetry, thus
introducing heterostructure photonic crystals (HPCs), is essential to reduce
the total optical path difference (OPD) to ~ 3200nm (the theoretical limit)
while still exhibiting high-quality RGB bands. A systematic experiment based on
a 12-layer heterostructure construction was performed and well confirmed the
theoretical predictions. The associated three-peak properties are successfully
used to realize quantum dot fluorescent enhancement phenomena. Furthermore, the
HPC exhibits unusually stability against solvent stimulus, in strong contrast
to typical behaviors reported in PPCs. Our work for the first time proposes and
verifies important rational rules for designing ultrathin HPCs toward RGB

of non-monetary incentives for trading surplus electricity, despite their
potentially important role. This paper presents the first discrete choice
experiment conducted with prosumers (i.e. proactive households actively
managing their electricity production and consumption) in the Netherlands.
Electricity trading preferences are analyzed regarding economic, environmental,
social and technological parameters, based on survey data (N = 74). The
dimensions most valued by prosumers are the environmental and, to a lesser
extent, economic dimensions, highlighting the key motivating roles of
environmental factors. Furthermore, a majority of prosumers stated they would
provide surplus electricity for free or for non-monetary compensations,
especially to energy-poor households. These observed trends were more
pronounced among members of energy cooperatives. This suggests that
peer-to-peer energy trading can advance a socially just energy transition.
Regarding policy recommendations, these findings point to the need for
communicating environmental and economic benefits when marketing P2P

potentials, i.e., $V(\phi)\propto \phi^{-\alpha}$ (inverse power-law (IPL)
model), $V(\phi)\propto \coth^{\alpha}{\phi}$ (L-model) and $V(\phi)\propto
\cosh(\alpha\phi)$ (Oscillatory tracker model), where the latter two models are
based on the $\alpha$-attractors originated from the study of inflation. These
models, which reduce to the $\Lambda$CDM model with $\alpha \to 0$, are studied
and compared with the recent observations, including the Pantheon sample of
type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements
extracted from 6dFGS, BOSS and eBOSS, as well as the temperature and
polarization anisotropy power spectra data of cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMB) from Planck 2018 results. The observational constraints from
the combining sample (SNe Ia + BAO + CMB) indicate that none of the three
$\phi$CDM models exclude the $\Lambda$CDM model at $68.3\%$ confidence level.
We find that the CMB anisotropy data have obvious advantages in constraining
the dark energy models compared with other cosmological probes, which is
particularly evident in the L-model. Furthermore, we apply the Bayesian
evidence to compare the $\phi$CDM models and the $\Lambda$CDM model with the
analysis of the combining sample. The concordance $\Lambda$CDM model is still
the most supported one. In addition, among the three $\phi$CDM models, the IPL
model is the most competitive one, while the L-model/Oscillatory tacker model

Salesman Problem (TSP) instances having a large integrality gap. The method is
based on the solution of an integer programming problem, called IH-OPT, that
takes as input a fractional solution of the Subtour Elimination Problem (SEP)
on a TSP instance and computes a TSP instance having an integrality gap larger
than or equal to the integrality gap of the first instance. The decision
variables of IH-OPT are the entries of the TSP cost matrix, and the constraints
are defined by the intersection of the metric cone with an exponential number
of inequalities, one for each possible TSP tour. Given the very large number of
constraints, we have implemented a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving IH-OPT.
Then, by sampling cost vectors over the metric polytope and by solving the
corresponding SEP, we can generate random fractional vertices of the SEP
polytope. If we solve the IH-OPT problem for every sampled vertex using our
branch-and-cut algorithm, we can select the generated TSP instance (i.e., cost
vector), yielding the longest runtime for Concorde, the state-of-the-art TSP
solver. Our computational results show that our method is very effective in
producing challenging instances. As a by-product, we release the Hard-TSPLIB, a
library of 41 small metric TSP instances which have a large integrality gap and
are challenging in terms of runtime for Concorde.

standardize SNe Ia luminosity and is commonly parameterized as a step function.
This functional form implicitly assumes two-populations of SNe Ia. In the
literature, multiple environmental indicators have been considered, finding
different, sometimes incompatible, step function amplitudes. We compare these
indicators in the context of a two-populations model, based on their ability to
distinguish the two populations. We show that local H$\alpha$-based specific

for instance, host galaxy morphology. We show that tracer accuracy can explain
the discrepancy between the observed SNe Ia step amplitudes found in the
literature. Using lsSFR or global mass to distinguish the two populations can
explain all other observations, though lsSFR is favoured. As lsSFR is strongly
connected to age, our results favour a prompt and delayed population model. In
any case, there exists two populations that differ in standardized magnitude by

reveals similar complex structures consisting in part of oblique waves
collocated with the streak. The origin of these structures is identified by
their correspondence to POD modes predicted using a stochastic turbulence model
(STM). These predicted POD modes are dominated by the optimally growing
structures on the streak, which the STM predicts correctly to be of sinuous
oblique wave structure. This close correspondence between the roll-streak
structure and the associated fluctuations in DNS, RNL and the STM implies that
the self-sustaining mechanism operating in DNS is essentially the same as that
in RNL, which has been previously associated with optimal perturbation growth
on the streak.

ultra-sensitive flux-to-voltage convertors widely applied for biomagnetism and
geophysics; they are working as the magnetic-field-effect transistors (MFETs)
for their flux-modulated current-voltage characteristics. However, unlike
semiconductor FETs, dc SQUIDs lack general analytical models and expressions to
interpret the inner dynamics and outside current-voltage characteristics. This
work presents a frequency-phase-locking (FPL) model and the analytical
expression to reveal the how the current-voltage characteristics are formed
inside dc SQUIDs, and how the characteristics are quantitively decided by the
circuit parameters. The application of the analytical expression for the
calculations of current-voltage characteristics is demonstrated; the results
are compared with the numerical simulations. It is shown that a dc-SQUID is an
FPL system inside and a current-modified nonlinear resistor outside; its
current-voltage characteristics formed by FPL mechanism are the projections of
three network impedances driven by Josephson currents. Based on the FPL model
and the analytical expression, dc SQUIDs can be simply treated as nonlinear
resistors in practical applications; their performance can be directly
predicted and evaluated according to three network impedances.

isoscalar monopole strength, below the giant resonance, in various nuclei. In
light $\alpha$-conjugate nuclei, these low-energy resonances were recently
interpreted as cluster vibration modes. However, the nature of these
excitations in neutron-rich nuclei remain elusive.
  Purpose : The present work provides a systematic analysis of the low-energy
monopole strength in isotopic chains, from Neon to Germanium, in order to
monitor and understand its nature and conditions of emergence.
  Methods : We perform covariant quasiparticle random phase approximation
(QRPA) calculations, formulated within the finite amplitude method (FAM), on
top of constrained relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) reference states.
  Results : Neutron excess leads to the appearance of low-energy excitations
according to a systematic pattern reflecting the single-particle features of
the underlying RHB reference state. With the onset of deformation, these
low-energy resonances get split and give rise to more complex patterns, with
possible mixing with the giant resonance. At lower energy, cluster-like
excitations found in $N=Z$ systems survive in neutron-rich nuclei, with valence
neutrons arranging in molecular-like orbitals. Finally, at very low energy,
pair excitations are also found in superfluid nuclei, but remain negligible in
most of the cases.
  Conclusions : The low-energy part of the monopole strength exhibits various
modes, from cluster vibrations ($\sim$ 5-10 MeV) to components of the giant
resonance downshifted by the onset of deformation, including soft modes ($\sim$
10-15 MeV) as well as pair excitation ($<$ 5 MeV), with possible mixing,
depending on neutron-excess, deformation, and pairing energy.

sparsity problem by extensively collecting points of interest for each RoI in a
pyramid manner. Secondly, we propose RoI-grid Attention, a new operation that
can encode richer information from sparse points by incorporating conventional
attention-based and graph-based point operators into a unified formulation.
Thirdly, we propose the Density-Aware Radius Prediction (DARP) module, which
can adapt to different point density levels by dynamically adjusting the
focusing range of RoIs. Combining the three components, our pyramid RoI head is
robust to the sparse and imbalanced circumstances, and can be applied upon
various 3D backbones to consistently boost the detection performance. Extensive
experiments show that Pyramid R-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D
detection models by a large margin on both the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open
dataset.

Symbolic Computation in Software Science, SCSS 2021.
  Symbolic Computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects
(terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic objects, etc.).
Powerful algorithms have been developed during the past decades for the major
subareas of symbolic computation: computer algebra and computational logic.
These algorithms and methods are successfully applied in various fields,
including software science, which covers a broad range of topics about software
construction and analysis.
  Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and machine learning algorithms
are widely used nowadays in various domains and, in particular, combined with
symbolic computation. Several approaches mix artificial intelligence and
symbolic methods and tools deployed over large corpora to create what is known
as cognitive systems. Cognitive computing focuses on building systems that
interact with humans naturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale.
  The purpose of SCSS is to promote research on theoretical and practical
aspects of symbolic computation in software science, combined with modern
artificial intelligence techniques. These proceedings contain the keynote paper
by Bruno Buchberger and ten contributed papers. Besides, the conference program
included three invited talks, nine short and work-in-progress papers, and a
special session on computer algebra and computational logic. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the symposium was held completely online. It was organized
by the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) of the Johannes
Kepler University Linz on September 8--10, 2021.

(MU-MIMO) promises unprecedented data rates for next-generation wireless
systems. To be practically viable, mmWave massive MU-MIMO basestations (BSs)
must rely on low-resolution data converters which leaves them vulnerable to
jammer interference. This paper proposes beam-slicing, a method that mitigates
the impact of a permanently transmitting jammer during uplink transmission for
BSs equipped with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).
Beam-slicing is a localized analog spatial transform that focuses the jammer
energy onto few ADCs, so that the transmitted data can be recovered based on
the outputs of the interference-free ADCs. We demonstrate the efficacy of
beam-slicing in combination with two digital jammer-mitigating data detectors:
SNIPS and CHOPS. Soft-Nulling of Interferers with Partitions in Space (SNIPS)
combines beam-slicing with a soft-nulling data detector that exploits knowledge
of the ADC contamination; projeCtion onto ortHOgonal complement with Partitions
in Space (CHOPS) combines beam-slicing with a linear projection that removes
all signal components co-linear to an estimate of the jammer channel. Our
results show that beam-slicing enables SNIPS and CHOPS to successfully serve
65% of the user equipments (UEs) for scenarios in which their antenna-domain
counterparts that lack beam-slicing are only able to serve 2% of the UEs.

cosmological experiments, and as it's impossible to perform spectroscopy for
every galaxy being observed, photometric redshift (photo-z) estimations are
still of particular interest. Here, we investigate different deep learning
methods for obtaining photo-z estimates directly from images, comparing these
with traditional machine learning algorithms which make use of magnitudes
retrieved through photometry. As well as testing a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and inception-module CNN, we introduce a novel mixed-input model which
allows for both images and magnitude data to be used in the same model as a way
of further improving the estimated redshifts. We also perform benchmarking as a
way of demonstrating the performance and scalability of the different
algorithms. The data used in the study comes entirely from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) from which 1 million galaxies were used, each having 5-filter
(ugriz) images with complete photometry and a spectroscopic redshift which was
taken as the ground truth. The mixed-input inception CNN achieved a mean
squared error (MSE)=0.009, which was a significant improvement (30%) over the
traditional Random Forest (RF), and the model performed even better at lower
redshifts achieving a MSE=0.0007 (a 50% improvement over the RF) in the range
of z<0.3. This method could be hugely beneficial to upcoming surveys such as
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) which
will require vast numbers of photo-z estimates produced as quickly and

features would enable the devising of quantum technologies based on dissipative
systems. In turn, quantum coherence can be characterized in terms of the
language of multiple quantum coherences (MQCs) originally developed in
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), nowadays applied to the detection
of quantum chaos, and to the study of criticality in many-body quantum systems.
Here we show the usefulness of MQCs for probing equilibrium phase transitions
in non-Hermitian systems. To do so, we investigate the connection of quantum
coherences and critical points for several paradigmatic non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians. For a non-Hermitian two-level system, MQCs witness the
parity-symmetry breaking phase transition from the unbroken to the broken
phase. Furthermore, for the non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model, MQCs
capture the Yang-Lee phase transition in which the ground state energy acquires
a nonzero imaginary component. For the disordered Hatano-Nelson (HN) model with
periodic boundary conditions, MQCs testify the emergence of mobility edges in
the spectrum of this model. In addition, MQCs signal the topological phase
transition exhibited by the complex energy spectra of the disorder-free HN
model. Finally, we comment on experimentally probing phase transitions in NMR
systems realizing non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our results have applications to
non-Hermitian quantum sensing, quantum thermodynamics, and in the study of the
non-Hermitian skin effect.

four NS-NS merger systems based on hydrodynamical simulations which handle
neutrino effects in an elaborate way by including neutrino equilibration with
matter in optically thick regions and re-absorption in optically thin regions.
We find that the neutron richness of the dynamical ejecta is significantly
affected by the neutrinos emitted by the post-merger remnant, in particular
when compared to a case neglecting all neutrino interactions. Our
nucleosynthesis results show that a solar-like distribution of r- process
elements with mass numbers $A \gtrsim 90$ is produced, including a significant
enrichment in Sr and a reduced production of actinides compared to simulations
without inclusion of the nucleonic weak processes. The composition of the
dynamically ejected matter as well as the corresponding rate of radioactive
decay heating are found to be rather independent of the system mass asymmetry
and the adopted equation of state. This approximate degeneracy in abundance
pattern and heating rates can be favourable for extracting the ejecta
properties from kilonova observations, at least if the dynamical component
dominates the overall ejecta. Part II of this work will study the light curve

  Measurements and Evaluation (PERFORMANCE) 2021",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In various contexts of networking research, end-host path selection has
recently regained momentum as a design principle. While such path selection has
the potential to increase performance and security of networks, there is a
prominent concern that it could also lead to network instability (i.e.,
flow-volume oscillation) if paths are selected in a greedy, load-adaptive
fashion. However, the extent and the impact vectors of instability caused by
path selection are rarely concretized or quantified, which is essential to
discuss the merits and drawbacks of end-host path selection.
  In this work, we investigate the effect of end-host path selection on various
metrics of networks both qualitatively and quantitatively. To achieve general
and fundamental insights, we leverage the recently introduced axiomatic
perspective on congestion control and adapt it to accommodate joint algorithms
for path selection and congestion control, i.e., multi-path congestion-control
protocols. Using this approach, we identify equilibria of the multi-path
congestion-control dynamics and analytically characterize these equilibria with
respect to important metrics of interest in networks (the 'axioms') such as
efficiency, fairness, and loss avoidance. Moreover, we analyze how these
axiomatic ratings for a general network change compared to a scenario without
path selection, thereby obtaining an interpretable and quantititative
formalization of the performance impact of end-host path-selection. Finally, we
show that there is a fundamental trade-off in multi-path congestion-control
protocol design between efficiency, stability, and loss avoidance on one side
and fairness and responsiveness on the other side.

powerful, but it is in practice limited by a potentially very serious issue: in
general many thimbles can contribute to the computation of the functional
integrals. Semiclassical arguments would suggest that the fundamental thimble
could be sufficient to get the correct answer, but this hypothesis has been
proven not to hold true in general. A first example of this failure has been
put forward in the context of the Thirring model: the dominant thimble
approximation is valid only in given regions of the parameter space of the
theory. Since then a complete solution of this (simple) model in thimble
regularisation has been missing. In this paper we show that a full solution

capability to promptly scale service based on user demand. When scaling, the
main objective is to maximize as much as possible service performance.
Moreover, resources in the Cloud are usually so abundant, that they can be
assumed infinite from the service point of view: an application provider can
have as many servers it wills, as long it pays for it. This model has some
limitations. First, energy efficiency is not among the first criteria for
scaling decisions, which has raised concerns about the environmental effects of
today's wild computations in the Cloud. Moreover, it is not viable for Edge
Computing (EC), a paradigm in which computational resources are distributed up
to the very edge of the network, i.e., co-located with base stations or access
points. In edge nodes, resources are limited, which imposes different
parsimonious scaling strategies to be adopted. In this work, we design a

criteria: coverage probability and interval width (or margin of error). In this
work we assess the performance of four common proportion interval estimators:
the Wald, Clopper- Pearson, Wilson and Agresti-Coull, in the context of
rare-event probabilities. We define the precision of the interval estimate in
terms of a relative margin of error which ensures consistency with the
magnitude of the proportion. Thus, confidence interval performance is assessed
in terms of achieving a desired coverage probability whilst satisfying the
specified relative margin of error. We show that when interval performance is
considered using both coverage probability and relative margin of error, all
four interval estimators perform somewhat similarly for a given sample size and
confidence level. We identify relative margin of error values that result in
satisfactory coverage whilst being conservative in terms of sample size
requirements, and hence suggest a range of values that can be adopted in
practice. The proposed relative margin of error scheme is evaluated
analytically, by simulation, and by application to a number of recent studies

accurately the ground-state properties of spherical and deformed finite nuclei
all across the mass table obtained with Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov (HFB)
calculations. However, these forces produce a rather soft equation of state
(EoS) in neutron matter, which leads to predict maximum masses of neutron stars
well below the observed value of two solar masses. To remove this limitation,
we built new Gogny parametrizations by modifying the density dependence of the
symmetry energy predicted by the force in such a way that they can be applied
to the neutron star domain and can also reproduce the properties of finite
nuclei as good as their predecessors. These new parametrizations allow us to
obtain stiffer EoS's based on the Gogny interactions, which predict maximum
masses of neutron stars around two solar masses. Moreover, other global
properties of the star, such as the moment of inertia and the tidal
deformability, are in harmony with those obtained with other well tested EoSs
based on the SLy4 Skyrme force or the Barcelona--Catania--Paris--Madrid (BCPM)
energy density functional. Properties of the core-crust transition predicted by
these Gogny EoSs are also analyzed. Using these new Gogny forces, the EoS in
the inner crust is obtained with the Wigner--Seitz approximation in the
Variational Wigner--Kirkwood approach along with the Strutinsky integral
method, which allows one to estimate in a perturbative way the proton shell and
pairing corrections. For the outer crust, the EoS is determined basically by
the nuclear masses, which are taken from the experiments, wherever they are
available, or by HFB calculations performed with these new forces if the
experimental masses are not known.

facilitates causal discovery, i.e. distinguishing cause and effect, by either
the independence of cause and residual or a likelihood ratio test. Our method
which estimates post-nonlinear models can better explain a variety of
real-world cause-effect pairs than a simple additive noise model. Though it
remains difficult to exploit this benefit regarding all pairs from the

vulnerable code in syntax and semantics make it difficult to extract vulnerable
features with regular deep learning models, especially in analyzing a large
program. Moreover, the fact that real-world vulnerable codes contain a lot of
redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities will further aggravate the
above problem. To mitigate such challenges, we define a novel code
representation named Slice Property Graph (SPG), and then propose VulSPG, a new
vulnerability detection approach using the improved R-GCN model with triple
attention mechanism to identify potential vulnerabilities in SPG. Our approach
has at least two advantages over other methods. First, our proposed SPG can
reflect the rich semantics and explicit structural information that may be
relevance to vulnerabilities, while eliminating as much irrelevant information
as possible to reduce the complexity of graph. Second, VulSPG incorporates
triple attention mechanism in R-GCNs to achieve more effective learning of
vulnerability patterns from SPG. We have extensively evaluated VulSPG on two
large-scale datasets with programs from SARD and real-world projects.
Experimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of VulSPG.

When significant effect heterogeneity exists, the population average causal
effect might be uninformative for an individual. Due to the fundamental problem
of causality, individual causal effects (ICEs) cannot be retrieved from
cross-sectional data. However, in crossover studies, it is accepted that ICEs
can be estimated under the assumptions of no carryover effects and time
invariance of potential outcomes. A generic potential-outcome formulation with
appropriate statistical assumptions to identify ICEs is lacking for other
longitudinal data with time-varying exposures. We present a general framework
for causal effect heterogeneity in which individual-specific effect
modification is parameterized with a latent variable, the receptiveness factor.
If the exposure varies over time, then the repeated measurements contain
information on an individual's level of this receptiveness factor. Therefore,
we study the conditional distribution of the ICE given all an individual's
factual information. This novel conditional random variable is called the
cross-world causal effect (CWCE). For known causal structures and time-varying
exposures, the variability of the CWCE reduces with an increasing number of
repeated measurements. The CWCE becomes identifiable from observational data
under the causal assumption of cross-world similarity of individual-effect
modification (i.e. there exists an exposure strategy whose effect is affected
by all latent causes). We illustrate the theory with examples in which the
cause-effect relations can be parameterized as generalized linear mixed
assignments.

propagation in atmospheric and other large-scale data assimilation systems, we
consider the problem for state dynamics governed by the continuity and related
hyperbolic partial differential equations. This loss of variance is often
attributed to reduced-rank representations of the covariance matrix, as in
ensemble methods for example, or else to the use of dissipative numerical
methods. Through a combination of analytical work and numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that significant variance loss, as well as gain, typically occurs
during covariance propagation, even at full rank. The cause of this unusual
behavior is a discontinuous change in the continuum covariance dynamics as
correlation lengths become small, for instance in the vicinity of sharp
gradients in the velocity field. This discontinuity in the covariance dynamics
arises from hyperbolicity: the diagonal of the kernel of the covariance
operator is a characteristic surface for advective dynamics. Our numerical
experiments demonstrate that standard numerical methods for evolving the state
are not adequate for propagating the covariance, because they do not capture
the discontinuity in the continuum covariance dynamics as correlations lengths
tend to zero. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate in the context
of mass conservation that this leads to significant, spurious variance loss in
regions of mass convergence and gain in regions of mass divergence. The results
suggest that developing local covariance propagation methods designed
specifically to capture covariance evolution near the diagonal may prove a
useful alternative to current methods of covariance propagation.

friction-induced instability phenomenon leading to the inversion of an
unbalanced spinning disk, being reminiscent to (but different from) the
well-known inversion of the tippetop. A reduced model of the tippedisk, in the
form of a three-dimensional ordinary differential equation, has been derived
recently, followed by a preliminary local stability analysis of stationary
spinning solutions. In the current paper, a global analysis of the reduced
system is pursued using the framework of singular perturbation theory. It is
shown how the presence of friction leads to slow-fast dynamics and the creation
of a two-dimensional slow manifold. Furthermore, it is revealed that a
bifurcation scenario involving a homoclinic bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation
leads to an explanation of the inversion phenomenon. In particular, a
closed-form condition for the critical spinning speed for the inversion
phenomenon is derived. Hence, the tippedisk forms an excellent
mathematical-mechanical problem for the analysis of global bifurcations in
singularly perturbed dynamics.

federated learning (FL) to train separate GANs locally at each organisation,
using their unique data silo and then combining the GANs into a single central

then used to generate the synthetic patients data-set. We performed an
evaluation of these synthetic patients with statistical measures and through a
structured review by a group of medical professionals. It was shown that there
was no significant reduction in the quality of the synthetic EHR when we moved
between training a single central model and training on separate data silos

true for both the statistical evaluation (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of

considered to be an attack and is subject to further analysis. Raw traffic is
also passed on to the machine learning classifier for examination and

on the combination of projectile ion and target material, the scattering
spectra can exhibit contributions resulting from multiple scattering processes

These events cause a pronounced continuum located toward lower scattering

Using only the one-best tokenisation ignores tokeniser uncertainty over

  In this paper, we argue that instead, language models should be evaluated on
their marginal likelihood over tokenisations. We compare different estimators
for the marginal likelihood based on sampling, and show that it is feasible to
estimate the marginal likelihood with a manageable number of samples. We then
evaluate pretrained English and German language models on both the

perplexity can be significantly better than the one best, especially on

user signals are scattered by the environment object and reflected by an
intelligent reflective surface (IRS) before they arrive at the AP. We exploit
the sparsity of both the structured user signals and the unstructured

communication and environment sensing scheme, in which the two processes, i.e.,
multi-user information detection and environment object detection, interweave
with each other thanks to their intrinsic mutual dependence. The proposed
algorithm is sliding-window based and also graph based, which can keep on
sensing the environment as long as there are illuminating user signals. The
trade-off relationship between the key system parameters is analyzed, and the
simulation result validates the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed

Here it is extended to the discretization of full Hilbert complexes with
possibly nontrivial harmonic fields, and the properties of the resulting CONGA
Hodge Laplacian operator are investigated.
  By using block-diagonal mass matrices which may be locally inverted, this
framework possesses a canonical sequence of dual commuting projection operators
which are local, and it naturally yields local discrete coderivative operators,
in contrast to conforming FEEC discretizations. The resulting CONGA Hodge
Laplacian operator is also local, and its kernel consists of the same discrete
harmonic fields as the underlying conforming operator, provided that a
symmetric stabilization term is added to handle the space nonconformities.
  Under the assumption that the underlying conforming subcomplex admits a
bounded cochain projection, and that the conforming projections are stable with
moment-preserving properties, a priori convergence results are established for
both the CONGA Hodge Laplace source and eigenvalue problems. Our theory is
illustrated with a spectral element method, and numerical experiments are
performed which corroborate our results. Applications to spline finite elements

GW detectors. We demonstrate that, with the precise control of the returned
laser phase noise, the noise amplification in the science band can be
efficiently suppressed based on the updated single arm locking. Not only our
method allows the suppression of the peaks, the high gain, low pulling rate, it
can also serve for full year, without the potential risk of locking failure due
to the arm length mismatch. We finally discuss the unified demonstration of the
updated single arm locking, where both the local and the returned laser phase
noises can be tuned to generate the expected arm-locking sensor actually. Our
work could provide a powerful method for the arm locking in the future

depend on $p,n$, it was previously shown that the functionals
$\text{tr}(AR(z))$, for $R(z) = (\frac{1}{n}XX^T- zI_p)^{-1}$ and $A\in

O(1/\sqrt n)$, where $\tilde R(z)$ is a deterministic matrix depending only on
$z$ and on the means and covariances of the column vectors $x_1,\ldots, x_n$
(that do not have to be identically distributed). This estimation is key to
providing accurate fluctuation rates of functionals of $X$ of interest (mostly

a semi-metric $d_s$ defined on the set $\mathcal D_n(\mathbb H)$ of diagonal

of particle trapping by altering their trajectories with tortuous paths and
induced local flow instability. The structures are tested for pressure drop and
particle filtering efficiency over a wide range of airflow rates. We have also

natural language processing due to the emergence of large-scale Knowledge
Graphs (KGs). Recently Neural Machine Translation based approaches are gaining
momentum that translates natural language queries to structured query languages
thereby solving the KGQA task. However, most of these methods struggle with
out-of-vocabulary words where test entities and relations are not seen during
training time. In this work, we propose a modular two-stage neural architecture
to solve the KGQA task.
  The first stage generates a sketch of the target SPARQL called SPARQL
silhouette for the input question. This comprises of (1) Noise simulator to
facilitate out-of-vocabulary words and to reduce vocabulary size (2) seq2seq
model for text to SPARQL silhouette generation. The second stage is a Neural
Graph Search Module. SPARQL silhouette generated in the first stage is
distilled in the second stage by substituting precise relation in the predicted
structure. We simulate ideal and realistic scenarios by designing a noise
simulator. Experimental results show that the quality of generated SPARQL
silhouette in the first stage is outstanding for the ideal scenarios but for
realistic scenarios (i.e. noisy linker), the quality of the resulting SPARQL
silhouette drops drastically. However, our neural graph search module recovers
it considerably. We show that our method can achieve reasonable performance
improving the state-of-art by a margin of 3.72% F1 for the LC-QuAD-1 dataset.
We believe, our proposed approach is novel and will lead to dynamic KGQA
solutions that are suited for practical applications.

institutes and companies to fabricate intricate parts and functionally graded
materials. However, the porosity of the as-built part deteriorates the
mechanical property and even hinders the further application of metal additive
manufacturing. Particularly, the mechanisms of keyhole pores associated with
the keyhole fluctuation are not fully understood. To reveal the mechanisms of
the keyhole pores formation, we adopt a multiphysics thermal-fluid flow model
incorporating heat transfer, liquid flow, metal evaporation, Marangoni effect,
and Darcy's law to simulate the keyhole pore formation process, and the results
are validated with the in-situ X-ray images. The simulation results present the
instant bubble formation due to the keyhole instability and motion of the
instant bubble when it pins on the solidification front. Moreover, the unevenly
distributed recoil pressure on the keyhole surface is an important factor for
keyhole collapse and penetration. Furthermore, comparing the keyhole pore
formation under different laser scanning speeds shows that the keyhole pore is
sensitive to the manufacturing parameters. The keyhole fluctuation features and
energy absorptivity variation on the rear keyhole wall could be metrics to
evaluate the likelihood of the keyhole pore formation. Additionally, the
simulation under a low ambient pressure shows the feasibility of improving the
keyhole stability to reduce and even avoid the formation of keyhole pores.

  Events",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  As relational event models are an increasingly popular model for studying
relational structures, the reliability of large-scale event data collection
becomes more and more important. Automated or human-coded events often suffer
from non-negligible false-discovery rates in event identification. And most
sensor data is primarily based on actors' spatial proximity for predefined time
windows; hence, the observed events could relate either to a social
relationship or random co-location. Both examples imply spurious events that
may bias estimates and inference. We propose the Relational Event Model for
Spurious Events (REMSE), an extension to existing approaches for interaction
data. The model provides a flexible solution for modeling data while
controlling for spurious events. Estimation of our model is carried out in an
empirical Bayesian approach via data augmentation. Based on a simulation study,
we investigate the properties of the estimation procedure. To demonstrate its
usefulness in two distinct applications, we employ this model to combat events
from the Syrian civil war and student co-location data. Results from the
simulation and the applications identify the REMSE as a suitable approach to
modeling relational event data in the presence of spurious events.

products are becoming increasingly more diversified and personalized.
Traditional product design methods can no longer satisfy the market needs due
to their strong subjectivity, small survey scope, poor real-time data, and lack
of visual display, which calls for the development of big data driven product
design methodology. Big data in the product lifecycle contains valuable
information for guiding product design, such as customer preferences, market
demands, product evaluation, and visual display: online product reviews reflect
customer evaluations and requirements; product images contain information of
shape,color, and texture which can inspire designers to get initial design
schemes more quickly or even directly generate new product images. How to
efficiently collect product design related data and exploit them effectively
during the whole product design process is thus critical to modern product
design. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive survey on big data driven
product design. It will help researchers and practitioners to comprehend the
latest development of relevant studies and applications centered on how big
data can be processed, analyzed, and exploited in aiding product design. We
first introduce several representative traditional product design methods and
highlight their limitations. Then we discuss current and potential applications
of textual data, image data, audio data, and video data in product design
cycles. Finally, major deficiencies of existing data driven product design
studies and future research directions are summarized. We believe that this
study can draw increasing attention to modern data driven product design.
