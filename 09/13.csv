at the intersection of neuroscience, robotics, and computer science for high
school students. A four-day microseminar, titled Swarming Powered by
Neuroscience (SPN), was conducted virtually through a combination of
presentations and interactive computer game simulations, delivered by subject
matter experts in neuroscience, mathematics, multi-agent swarm robotics, and
education. The objective of this research was to determine if taking an
interdisciplinary approach to high school education would enhance the students
learning experiences in fields such as neuroscience, robotics, or computer
science. This study found an improvement in student engagement for neuroscience
by 16.6%, while interest in robotics and computer science improved respectively
by 2.7% and 1.8%. The curriculum materials, developed for the SPN microseminar,
can be used by high school teachers to further evaluate interdisciplinary
instructions across life and physical sciences and computer science.

al. [2020], we propose an algorithm with three desirable properties. (P1) Its
regret after $K$ episodes scales as $K \max \{ \varepsilon_{\text{mis}},
\varepsilon_{\text{tol}} \}$, where $\varepsilon_{\text{mis}}$ is the degree of
misspecification and $\varepsilon_{\text{tol}}$ is a user-specified error
tolerance. (P2) Its space and per-episode time complexities remain bounded as
$K \rightarrow \infty$. (P3) It does not require $\varepsilon_{\text{mis}}$ as
input. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm satisfying all three
properties. For concrete choices of $\varepsilon_{\text{tol}}$, we also improve
existing regret bounds (up to log factors) while achieving either (P2) or (P3)
(existing algorithms satisfy neither). At a high level, our algorithm
generalizes (to MLMDPs) and refines the Sup-Lin-UCB algorithm, which Takemura
et al. [2021] recently showed satisfies (P3) for contextual bandits. We also
provide an intuitive interpretation of their result, which informs the design
of our algorithm.

paradigm that enables collaborative training among geographically distributed
and heterogeneous devices without gathering their data. Extending FL beyond the
supervised learning models, federated reinforcement learning (FRL) was proposed
to handle sequential decision-making problems in edge computing systems.
However, the existing FRL algorithms directly combine model-free RL with FL,
thus often leading to high sample complexity and lacking theoretical
guarantees. To address the challenges, we propose a novel FRL algorithm that
effectively incorporates model-based RL and ensemble knowledge distillation
into FL for the first time. Specifically, we utilise FL and knowledge
distillation to create an ensemble of dynamics models for clients, and then
train the policy by solely using the ensemble model without interacting with
the environment. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the monotonic
improvement of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed. The extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our algorithm obtains much higher sample efficiency
compared to classic model-free FRL algorithms in the challenging continuous
control benchmark environments under edge computing settings. The results also
highlight the significant impact of heterogeneous client data and local model
update steps on the performance of FRL, validating the insights obtained from
our theoretical analysis.

monodispersive gold nanorods and confirm that the shape and size of aggregate
depend on the amount of BSA in DMEM as well as on the concentration of CTAB in
the stock solution of the gold nanorods suspension. The higher concentration of
the BSA in DMEM and lower concentration of CTAB of monodispersive gold nanorod
suspension causes greater redshift. We tuned the well defined plasmonic
absorption resonance peaks of the aggregates of gold nanorods up to the second
biological therapeutic window. We studied the stability of the synthesised
aggregates of gold nanorods for up to one week and found that the aggregates
were stable for atleast one week. A photothermal study of these aggregates was
also carried out using high power broadband near-infrared light source.
Aggregates were also photothermally stable which warrants their repeated use
for such applications. The photothermal conversion efficiency of the these
stable gold nanorod aggregates were higher than its monodispersive form of the

claiming they are state-of-the-art by showing they outperform previous methods

better at OOD detection than others on a standardized set of 16 (ID, OOD)
pairs. We give possible explanations for these inconsistencies with simple toy
datasets where whether one method outperforms another depends on the structure
of the ID and OOD datasets in question. Finally, we show that a method
outperforming another on a certain (ID, OOD) pair may not do so in a low-data
regime. In the low-data regime, we propose a distance-based method, Pairwise
OOD detection (POD), which is based on Siamese networks and improves over
Mahalanobis by sidestepping the expensive covariance estimation step. Our
results suggest that the OOD detection problem may be too broad, and we should
consider more specific structures for leverage.

However, the robustness of GNN models remains a challenge. As a result, they
are not reliable enough to be deployed in critical applications. Recent studies
demonstrate that GNNs could be easily fooled with adversarial perturbations,
especially structural perturbations. Such vulnerability is attributed to the
excessive dependence on the structure information to make predictions. To
achieve better robustness, it is desirable to build the prediction of GNNs with
more comprehensive features. Graph data, in most cases, has two views of
information, namely structure information and feature information. In this
paper, we propose CoG, a simple yet effective co-training framework to combine
these two views for the purpose of robustness. CoG trains sub-models from the
feature view and the structure view independently and allows them to distill
knowledge from each other by adding their most confident unlabeled data into
the training set. The orthogonality of these two views diversifies the
sub-models, thus enhancing the robustness of their ensemble. We evaluate our
framework on three popular datasets, and results show that CoG significantly
improves the robustness of graph models against adversarial attacks without
sacrificing their performance on clean data. We also show that CoG still
achieves good robustness when both node features and graph structures are
perturbed.

verify its collected sample mass requirement (> 60g of material). The

was received shortly following the TAG event, intended to ensure mechanism
health prior to moving forward with the SMM activity. These images displayed
sample leakage, prompting discussion for alternative paths forward. Risk of
continued sample loss and a desire to retain as much material as possible lead
the team to pursue an accelerated sample stow schedule and forgo the planned

reaction wheel momentum data from identical TAGSAM movements prior to and

Conservation of momentum was used to isolate the sample mass from this inertia

intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen
metric space. To this end, hyperspherical face recognition, as a promising line
of research, has attracted increasing attention and gradually become a major
focus in face recognition research. As one of the earliest works in
hyperspherical face recognition, SphereFace explicitly proposed to learn face
embeddings with large inter-class angular margin. However, SphereFace still
suffers from severe training instability which limits its application in
practice. In order to address this problem, we introduce a unified framework to
understand large angular margin in hyperspherical face recognition. Under this
framework, we extend the study of SphereFace and propose an improved variant
with substantially better training stability -- SphereFace-R. Specifically, we
propose two novel ways to implement the multiplicative margin, and study
SphereFace-R under three different feature normalization schemes (no feature
normalization, hard feature normalization and soft feature normalization). We
also propose an implementation strategy -- ""characteristic gradient detachment""
-- to stabilize training. Extensive experiments on SphereFace-R show that it is
consistently better than or competitive with state-of-the-art methods.

robotic applications. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art methods use
separate neural networks for different tasks like object detection or room
layout estimation. Such a scheme has two limitations: 1) Storing and running
several networks for different tasks are expensive for typical robotic
platforms. 2) The intrinsic structure of separate outputs are ignored and
potentially violated. To this end, we propose the first transformer
architecture that predicts 3D objects and layouts simultaneously, using point
cloud inputs. Unlike existing methods that either estimate layout keypoints or
edges, we directly parameterize room layout as a set of quads. As such, the
proposed architecture is termed as P(oint)Q(uad)-Transformer. Along with the
novel quad representation, we propose a tailored physical constraint loss
function that discourages object-layout interference. The quantitative and
qualitative evaluations on the public benchmark ScanNet show that the proposed
PQ-Transformer succeeds to jointly parse 3D objects and layouts, running at a
quasi-real-time (8.91 FPS) rate without efficiency-oriented optimization.
Moreover, the new physical constraint loss can improve strong baselines, and
the F1-score of the room layout is significantly promoted from 37.9% to 57.9%.

imply that causal diamonds in the very early universe were entirely filled with
a single equilibrated system with finite entropy. A universe where this
condition persists forever has no localized excitations. Our own universe
appears to be headed toward such a state. Within a few hundred times its
current age it will approach a state where our local group of galaxies sit in
empty de Sitter space. Eventually, the local group collapse into a black hole,
which evaporates. Localized excitations in de Sitter space are low entropy
constrained states of the vacuum ensemble. The origin of these constraints must
be in the early universe: the apparent horizon must expand after some initial
period, in a constrained state that is the origin of all localized excitations
in the universe. We argue that in global FRW coordinates, this corresponds to
slow roll inflation that ends in a dilute gas of tiny black holes, with mass
determined by the inflationary scale. We then review arguments that these black
holes can account for the Hot Big Bang, baryogenesis, a distinctive pattern of
CMB fluctuations, and possibly primordial black hole dark matter consisting of
larger black holes that survive until the matter dominated era. The more

While most (if not all) Type I Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) are
characterised by spreads in the abundances of light chemical elements (e.g. Li,
N, O, Na, Mg, Al), it is not yet well established whether similar spreads may
exist in s-process elements as well. Aims. We investigated the possible
difference in Ba abundance between the primordial (1P) and polluted (2P) stars
in the Galactic globular cluster (GGC) 47 Tuc (NGC 104). For this, we obtained
homogeneous abundances of Fe, Na, and Ba in a sample of 261 red giant branch
(RGB) stars which is the largest sample used for Na and Ba abundance analysis
in any GGC so far. Methods. Abundances of Na and Ba were determined using
archival GIRAFFE/VLT spectra and 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)
abundance analysis methodology. Results. Contrary to the finding of Gratton et
al. (2013), we did not detect any significant Ba-Na correlation or 2P-1P Ba
abundance difference in the sample of 261 RGB stars in 47 Tuc. This
corroborates the result of D'Orazi et al. (2010) who found no statistically
significant Ba-Na correlation in 110 RGB stars in this GGC. The average
barium-to-iron ratio obtained in the sample of 261 RGB stars, $\langle{\rm
Ba/Fe}_{\rm 1D~NLTE}\rangle = -0.01\pm0.06$, agrees well with those determined
in Galactic field stars at this metallicity and may therefore represent the
abundance of primordial proto-cluster gas that has not been altered during the
subsequent chemical evolution of the cluster.

  Tasks","Changing the material of the paper. I will resubmitted again after
  correction",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework for
classification tasks where information on existing subclasses is available and
taken into consideration. In classification tasks with a small number of
classes or binary detection (two classes) the amount of information transferred
from the teacher to the student network is restricted, thus limiting the
utility of knowledge distillation. Performance can be improved by leveraging
information about possible subclasses within the available classes in the
classification task. To that end, we propose the so-called Subclass Knowledge
Distillation (SKD) framework, which is the process of transferring the
subclasses' prediction knowledge from a large teacher model into a smaller
student one. Through SKD, additional meaningful information which is not in the
teacher's class logits but exists in subclasses (e.g., similarities inside
classes) will be conveyed to the student and boost its performance.
Mathematically, we measure how many extra information bits the teacher can
provide for the student via SKD framework. The framework developed is evaluated
in clinical application, namely colorectal polyp binary classification. In this
application, clinician-provided annotations are used to define subclasses based
on the annotation label's variability in a curriculum style of learning. A
lightweight, low complexity student trained with the proposed framework
achieves an F1-score of 85.05%, an improvement of 2.14% and 1.49% gain over the
student that trains without and with conventional knowledge distillation,
respectively. These results show that the extra subclasses' knowledge (i.e.,
0.4656 label bits per training sample in our experiment) can provide more
information about the teacher generalization, and therefore SKD can benefit
from using more information to increase the student performance.

calculations based on density functional theory to systematically investigate
the effects of structural distortions due to cation size mismatch on the
configurational disorder of the cation sublattice and the valence band
structure in this class of materials. We find that larger size mismatch between
the group-II and the group-IV cations results in stronger lattice distortions
from the ideal hexagonal ratio, which in turn inhibits the propensity of these
materials towards octet-rule violating cation disorder. We also demonstrate
that the formation energy of a single cation antisite pair, which is fast and
simple to calculate, is a strong indicator of a material's propensity towards
disorder. Furthermore, the breaking of in-plane symmetry leads to a splitting
of the top three valence bands at $\Gamma$, which is also directly related to
the magnitude of structural distortions. Our work demonstrates that the

Green's function framework to investigate the surface NLO properties of
topological materials. The Green's function framework can naturally incorporate
many-body effects and can be easily extended to high-order NLO responses. Using
Td-WTe2 as an example, we reveal that the surface can behave disparately from
the bulk under light illumination. Remarkably, the shift and circular currents
on the surface can flow in opposite directions to those in the bulk interior.
Moreover, the light-induced spin current on the surface can be orders of
magnitude stronger than its bulk counterpart. We also study the responses under
inhomogeneous field and higher-order NLO effect, which are all distinct on the
surface. These anomalous surface NLO responses suggest that light can be a
valuable tool for probing the surface states of topological materials. On the
other hand, the surface effects shall be prudently considered when
investigating the optical properties of topological materials, especially if
the material is of nanoscale and/or the light penetration depth is small.

contact, the answer to this question boils down to the classic first-passage
time problem: find the time it takes the two molecules to meet. However, this
is not always the case as molecules switch stochastically between reactive and
non-reactive states. The reaction is then said to be ""gated"" by the internal
states of the molecules involved which could have a dramatic influence on
kinetics. A unified, continuous-time, approach to gated reactions on networks
was presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 018301, 2021]. Here, we build on this
recent advancement and develop an analogous discrete-time version of the
theory. Similar to continuous-time, we employ a renewal approach to show that
the gated reaction time can always be expressed in terms of the corresponding
ungated first-passage and return times; which yields formulas for the
generating function of the gated reaction-time distribution and its
corresponding mean and variance. In cases where the mean reaction time
diverges, we show that the long-time asymptotics of the gated problem is
inherited from its ungated counterpart. However, when molecules spend most of
their time non-reactive, an interim regime of slower power-law decay emerges
prior to the terminal asymptotics. The discretization of time also gives rise
to resonances and anti-resonances, which were absent from the continuous time
picture. These features are illustrated using two case studies that also
demonstrate how the general approach presented herein greatly simplifies the
analysis of gated reactions.

systems. However, these policies are often unpredictable and can induce highly
variable behavior when evaluated with only slightly different initial
conditions. Training considerations constrain DRL algorithm designs in that
most algorithms must use stochastic policies during training. The resulting
policy used during deployment, however, can and frequently is a deterministic
one that uses the Maximum Likelihood Action (MLA) at each step. In this work,
we show that a direct random search is very effective at fine-tuning DRL
policies by directly optimizing them using deterministic rollouts. We
illustrate this across a large collection of reinforcement learning
environments, using a wide variety of policies obtained from different
algorithms. Our results show that this method yields more consistent and higher
performing agents on the environments we tested. Furthermore, we demonstrate
how this method can be used to extend our previous work on shrinking the
dimensionality of the reachable state space of closed-loop systems run under
Deep Neural Network (DNN) policies.

accounting for the severity and prolonged duration of an array of epidemics,
ranging from COVID-19 to diphtheria and pertussis. To study the effectiveness
of different immunity level-based vaccination schemes in mitigating the impact
of waning immunity, we construct epidemiological models that mimic the latter's
effect. The total susceptible population is divided into an arbitrarily large
number of discrete compartments with varying levels of disease immunity. We
then vaccinate various compartments within this framework, comparing the value
of $R_0$ and the equilibria locations for our systems to determine an optimal
immunization scheme under natural constraints. Relying on perturbative
analysis, we establish a number of results concerning the location, existence,
and uniqueness of the system's endemic equilibria, as well as results on
disease-free equilibria. In addition, we numerically simulate the dynamics
associated with our model in the case of pertussis in Canada, fitting our model
to available time-series data. Our analytical results are applicable to a wide
range of systems composed of arbitrarily many ODEs.

utilization and privacy protection. Most existing federated learning approaches
focus on the supervised setting, which means all the data stored in each client
has labels. However, in real-world applications, the client data are impossible
to be fully labeled. Thus, how to exploit the unlabeled data should be a new
challenge for federated learning. Although a few studies are attempting to
overcome this challenge, they may suffer from information leakage or misleading
information usage problems. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel federated semi-supervised learning method named FedTriNet, which consists
of two learning phases. In the first phase, we pre-train FedTriNet using
labeled data with FedAvg. In the second phase, we aim to make most of the
unlabeled data to help model learning. In particular, we propose to use three
networks and a dynamic quality control mechanism to generate high-quality
pseudo labels for unlabeled data, which are added to the training set. Finally,
FedTriNet uses the new training set to retrain the model. Experimental results
on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed FedTriNet
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both IID and Non-IID settings.

models with decentralized data. Extensive works have studied the performance of
the global model; however, it is still unclear how the training process affects
the final test accuracy. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that FL
executions differ significantly from traditional ML with heterogeneous data
characteristics across clients, involving more hyperparameters. In this work,
we show that the final test accuracy of FL is dramatically affected by the
early phase of the training process, i.e., FL exhibits critical learning
periods, in which small gradient errors can have irrecoverable impact on the
final test accuracy. To further explain this phenomenon, we generalize the
trace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to FL and define a new notion
called FedFIM, a quantity reflecting the local curvature of each clients from
the beginning of the training in FL. Our findings suggest that the {\em initial
learning phase} plays a critical role in understanding the FL performance. This
is in contrast to many existing works which generally do not connect the final
accuracy of FL to the early phase training. Finally, seizing critical learning
periods in FL is of independent interest and could be useful for other problems
such as the choices of hyperparameters such as the number of client selected
per round, batch size, and more, so as to improve the performance of FL
training and testing.

image processing tasks. However, they still have serious problems maintaining
the balance between conditioning the output on the input and creating the
output with the desired distribution based on the corresponding ground truth.
The traditional cGANs, similar to most conventional GANs, suffer from vanishing
gradients, which backpropagate from the discriminator to the generator.
Moreover, the traditional cGANs are sensitive to architectural changes due to
previously mentioned gradient problems. Therefore, balancing the architecture
of the cGANs is almost impossible. Recently MSG-GAN has been proposed to
stabilize the performance of the GANs by applying multiple connections between
the generator and discriminator. In this work, we propose a method called
MSGDD-cGAN, which first stabilizes the performance of the cGANs using
multi-connections gradients flow. Secondly, the proposed network architecture
balances the correlation of the output to input and the fitness of the output
on the target distribution. This balance is generated by using the proposed
dual discrimination procedure. We tested our model by segmentation of fetal
ultrasound images. Our model shows a 3.18% increase in the F1 score comparing

compare it with existing time varying homogenization theory as well as other
existing center manifold based studies, and present conditions on the flows
under which our new approximations give a substantial improvement to these
existing theories. A recent study \cite{ding2020ergodicity} has shown that
Gaussian random shear flows induce a deterministic effective diffusivity at
long times, and explicitly calculated the invariant measure. Here, with our
established asymptotic expansions, we not only concisely demonstrate those
prior conclusions for Gaussian random shear flows, but also generalize the
conclusions regarding determinism to a much broader class of random
(non-Gaussian) shear flows. Such results are important ergodicity-like results
in that they assure an experimentalist need only perform a single realization
of a random flow to observe the ensemble moment predictions at long time.
Monte-Carlo simulations are presented illustrating how the highly random
behavior converges to the deterministic limit at long time. Counterintuitively,
we present a case demonstrating that the random flow may not induce larger
dispersion than its deterministic counterpart, and in turn present rigorous
conditions under which a random renewing flow induces a stronger effective

a pair $x,y$ of vertices of $G$, return a path $P$ connecting $x$ to $y$, whose
length is within factor $\alpha$ of the length of the shortest $x$-$y$ path, in
time $\tilde O(|E(P)|)$, where $\alpha$ is the approximation factor of the

  APSP is one of the most basic and extensively studied dynamic graph problems.
A long line of work culminated in the algorithm of [Chechik, FOCS 2018] with
near optimal guarantees for the oblivious-adversary setting. Unfortunately,
adaptive-adversary setting is still poorly understood. For unweighted graphs,
the algorithm of [Henzinger, Krinninger and Nanongkai, FOCS '13, SICOMP '16]
achieves a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation with total update time $\tilde
O(mn/\epsilon)$; the best current total update time of $n^{2.5+O(\epsilon)}$ is
achieved by the deterministic algorithm of [Chuzhoy, Saranurak, SODA'21], with
$2^{O(1/\epsilon)}$-multiplicative and $2^{O(\log^{3/4}n/\epsilon)}$-additive

weights, the fastest current adaptive-update algorithm has total update time
$O(n^{3}\log L/\epsilon)$, achieving a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. Here, L is
the ratio of longest to shortest edge lengths.
  Our main result is a deterministic algorithm for decremental APSP in

performs joint probabilistic data association, and estimation of the
time-varying MPC parameters and the mean number of false alarm measurements, by

it significantly outperforms them for medium or low SNR MPCs. Results using

Edge/Fog computing, a promising extension of Cloud at the IoT-proximate

operational differences of Edge/Fog infrastructure resist employing Cloud-based
service regulations directly to these environments. As a result, many research

Considering simulation as a key to this constraint, various software has been
developed that can imitate the physical behaviour of Edge/Fog computing
environments. Nevertheless, the existing simulators often fail to support
advanced service management features because of their monolithic architecture,
lack of actual dataset, and limited scope for a periodic update. To overcome
these issues, we have developed multiple simulation models for service

coefficient methods are utilized in developing high order compact (HOC)

of concave regularization may lead to estimators with refined convergence rates
and oracle properties as the signal strengthens. Although folded concave
penalized $M$-estimation with strongly convex loss functions have been well
studied, the extant literature on quantile regression is relatively silent. The
main difficulty is that the quantile loss is piecewise linear: it is non-smooth
and has curvature concentrated at a single point. To overcome the lack of
smoothness and strong convexity, we propose and study a convolution-type
smoothed quantile regression with iteratively reweighted
$\ell_1$-regularization. The resulting smoothed empirical loss is twice
continuously differentiable and (provably) locally strongly convex with high
probability. We show that the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$-penalized

optimal rate of convergence, and moreover, the oracle rate and the strong
oracle property under an almost necessary and sufficient minimum signal

Heterophily has been considered as a main cause and numerous works have been
put forward to address it. In this paper, we first show that not all cases of
heterophily are harmful for GNNs with aggregation operation. Then, we propose
new metrics based on a similarity matrix which considers the influence of both
graph structure and input features on GNNs. The metrics demonstrate advantages

sparse representation from magnitude-only measurements. To this end, we study
two complementary formulations and develop efficient parallel algorithms by
extending the successive convex approximation framework using a smooth
majorization. The first algorithm is termed compact-SCAphase and is preferable
in the case of less diverse mixture models. It employs a compact formulation
that avoids the use of auxiliary variables. The proposed algorithm is highly
scalable and has reduced parameter tuning cost. The second algorithm, referred
to as SCAphase, uses auxiliary variables and is favorable in the case of highly
diverse mixture models. It also renders simple incorporation of additional side
constraints. The performance of both methods is evaluated when applied to blind
sparse channel estimation from subband magnitude measurements in a
multi-antenna random access network. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed techniques compared to state-of-the-art methods.

$n$-dimensional Euclidean space which are singular along a smooth submanifold

direct integral asymptotic analysis with global geometric weights, based on
stability and semilinearity of the equation. This completes the missing case in
a previous work we did in collaboration with Ao, Fontelos, Gonz\'{a}lez and
Wei, where complete singular metrics of dimensions $0<k<(n-2s)/2$ were
constructed. Moreover the dimension $(n-2s)/2$ is maximal for the conformal
factor to be a distributional solution. Even so, we conjecture that there exist
complete metrics with prescribed singularities of strictly higher dimensions.
We also provide a complete study of the model problem -- the fractional
Lane--Emden equation posed in the punctured ball with Serrin's critical
exponent and homogeneous Dirichlet condition, for all $s\in(0,1)$. First, we
construct the profile, show that it is radially symmetric, and build multiple
solutions in a bounded domain with any prescribed closed singular set.
Secondly, we prove a Liouville-type result, asserting the non-existence of
exterior solutions of the model equation without any assumption on its
asymptotic behavior. Finally, we develop new methods to prove that the singular
behavior of the profile is unique. In sharp contrast to known techniques in the
literature, our method is based on the striking connection between the
non-local equation and its associated first order ODE. A local continuation
argument is then utilized. This gives an alternative proof to the recent work
of Wei and Wu based on adapting the classical proof in the extension, and it
seems to be the first time that a genuinely local ODE is used to study a
non-local elliptic problem.

that any measurement pattern whose underlying graph admits a Pauli flow can be

systems. This is not (only) an academic point: Fairness-related harms emerge
when there is a mismatch in the measurement process between the thing we
purport to be measuring and the thing we actually measure. However, the
measurement process -- where social, cultural, and political values are
implicitly encoded in sociotechnical systems -- is almost always obscured.
Furthermore, this obscured process is where important governance decisions are
encoded: governance about which systems are fair, which individuals belong in
which categories, and so on. We can then use the language of measurement, and
the tools of construct validity and reliability, to uncover hidden governance
decisions. In particular, we highlight two types of construct validity, content
validity and consequential validity, that are useful to elicit and characterize
the feedback loops between the measurement, social construction, and
enforcement of social categories. We then explore the constructs of fairness,
robustness, and responsibility in the context of governance in and for
responsible AI. Together, these perspectives help us unpack how measurement
acts as a hidden governance process in sociotechnical systems. Understanding
measurement as governance supports a richer understanding of the governance
processes already happening in AI -- responsible or otherwise -- revealing
paths to more effective interventions.

that allows multiple clients to jointly train a model without sharing their
private data. Recently, many studies have shown that FL is vulnerable to
membership inference attacks (MIAs) that can distinguish the training members
of the given model from the non-members. However, existing MIAs ignore the
source of a training member, i.e., the information of which client owns the
training member, while it is essential to explore source privacy in FL beyond
membership privacy of examples from all clients. The leakage of source
information can lead to severe privacy issues. For example, identification of
the hospital contributing to the training of an FL model for COVID-19 pandemic
can render the owner of a data record from this hospital more prone to
discrimination if the hospital is in a high risk region. In this paper, we
propose a new inference attack called source inference attack (SIA), which can
derive an optimal estimation of the source of a training member. Specifically,
we innovatively adopt the Bayesian perspective to demonstrate that an
honest-but-curious server can launch an SIA to steal non-trivial source
information of the training members without violating the FL protocol. The
server leverages the prediction loss of local models on the training members to
achieve the attack effectively and non-intrusively. We conduct extensive
experiments on one synthetic and five real datasets to evaluate the key factors
in an SIA, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed source inference
attack.

plan and execute a combination of single robot behaviors, group primitives such

objectives such as target search and group coverage. Most such missions are
designed manually by teams of robotics experts. Recent work in automated
approaches to learning swarm behavior has been limited to individual primitives
with sparse work on learning complete missions. This paper presents a
systematic approach to learn tactical mission-specific policies that compose
primitives in a swarm to accomplish the mission efficiently using neural
networks with special input and output encoding. To learn swarm tactics in an
adversarial environment, we employ a combination of 1) map-to-graph
abstraction, 2) input/output encoding via Pareto filtering of points of
interest and clustering of robots, and 3) learning via neuroevolution and
policy gradient approaches. We illustrate this combination as critical to
providing tractable learning, especially given the computational cost of
simulating swarm missions of this scale and complexity. Successful mission

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in clinical management
of liver diseases. Compared to MRI, CT images of liver are more abundant and
readily available. However, MRI can provide richer quantitative information of
the liver compared to CT. Thus, it is desirable to achieve unsupervised domain
adaptation for transferring the learned knowledge from the source domain
containing labeled CT images to the target domain containing unlabeled MR
images. In this work, we report a novel unsupervised domain adaptation
framework for cross-modality liver segmentation via joint adversarial learning
and self-learning. We propose joint semantic-aware and shape-entropy-aware
adversarial learning with post-situ identification manner to implicitly align
the distribution of task-related features extracted from the target domain with
those from the source domain. In proposed framework, a network is trained with
the above two adversarial losses in an unsupervised manner, and then a mean
completer of pseudo-label generation is employed to produce pseudo-labels to
train the next network (desired model). Additionally, semantic-aware
adversarial learning and two self-learning methods, including pixel-adaptive
mask refinement and student-to-partner learning, are proposed to train the
desired model. To improve the robustness of the desired model, a low-signal
augmentation function is proposed to transform MRI images as the input of the
desired model to handle hard samples. Using the public data sets, our
experiments demonstrated the proposed unsupervised domain adaptation framework
reached four supervised learning methods with a Dice score 0.912 plus or minus
0.037 (mean plus or minus standard deviation).

computation-intensive vision detection tasks with massive video data, which is
crucial for safety in the edge-enabled industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
Multiple video streams compete for limited communication resources on the link
between edge devices and camera networks, resulting in considerable
communication congestion. It postpones the completion time and degrades the
accuracy of vision detection tasks. Thus, achieving high accuracy of vision
detection tasks under the communication constraints and vision task deadline
constraints is challenging. Previous works focus on single camera configuration
to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and processing time of detection tasks
by setting video quality parameters. In this paper, an adaptive camera network
self-configuration method (CANS) of video surveillance is proposed to cope with
multiple video streams of heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) demands for
edge-enabled IIoT. Moreover, it adapts to video content and network dynamics.
Specifically, the tradeoff between two key performance metrics, \emph{i.e.,}
accuracy and latency, is formulated as an NP-hard optimization problem with
latency constraints. Simulation on real-world surveillance datasets
demonstrates that the proposed CANS method achieves low end-to-end latency (13
ms on average) with high accuracy (92\% on average) with network dynamics. The
results validate the effectiveness of the CANS.

energy management and demand-response applications in the advanced metering
infrastructure(AMI). A key challenge in developing distributed ML applications
for AMI is to preserve user privacy while allowing active end-users
participation. This paper addresses this challenge and proposes a
privacy-preserving federated learning framework for ML applications in the AMI.
We consider each smart meter as a federated edge device hosting an ML
application that exchanges information with a central aggregator or a data
concentrator, periodically. Instead of transferring the raw data sensed by the
smart meters, the ML model weights are transferred to the aggregator to
preserve privacy. The aggregator processes these parameters to devise a robust
ML model that can be substituted at each edge device. We also discuss
strategies to enhance privacy and improve communication efficiency while
sharing the ML model parameters, suited for relatively slow network connections
in the AMI. We demonstrate the proposed framework on a use case federated ML
(FML) application that improves short-term load forecasting (STLF). We use a
long short-term memory(LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) model for STLF. In
our architecture, we assume that there is an aggregator connected to a group of
smart meters. The aggregator uses the learned model gradients received from the
federated smart meters to generate an aggregate, robust RNN model which
improves the forecasting accuracy for individual and aggregated STLF. Our
results indicate that with FML, forecasting accuracy is increased while
preserving the data privacy of the end-users.

sets of sheared arcades forms helical structures of the filament with numerous
magnetic dips, and cooling and condensation of plasma trapped inside the
helical structures supply mass to the filament. Although each of these
processes, namely, magnetic reconnection and coronal condensation have been
separately reported, observations that show the whole process of filament
formation are rare. In this Letter, we present the formation of a sigmoid via
reconnection between two sets of coronal loops, and the subsequent formation of
a filament through cooling and condensation of plasma inside the newly formed
sigmoid. On 2014 August 27, a set of loops in the active region 12151
reconnected with another set of loops that are located to the east. A longer
twisted sigmoidal structure and a set of shorter lower-lying loops then formed.
The observations coincide well with the tether-cutting model. The newly formed
sigmoid remains stable and does not erupt as a coronal mass ejection. From the
eastern endpoint, signatures of injection of material into the sigmoid (as
brightenings) are detected, which closely outline the features of increasing
emission measure at these locations. This may indicate the chromospheric
evaporation caused by reconnection, supplying heated plasma into the sigmoid.
In the sigmoid, thermal instability occurs, and rapid cooling and condensation
of plasma take place, forming a filament. The condensations then flow
bi-directionally to the filament endpoints. Our results provide a clear
observational evidence of the filament formation via magnetic reconnection and
coronal condensation.

Not suggesting the non-popular items lead to fewer products dominating the

the literature, several fair algorithms have been proposed which mainly focused
on improving the accuracy of the recommendation system. However, a typical
accuracy measure is biased towards popular items, i.e., it promotes better

a metric that measures the popularity bias as the difference in error on

electroweak production of $\hpm$ is dominant for most of the parameter space.
Subsequent bosonic decay of the charged and neutral Higgses give rise to the
same sign trilepton signal. With a thorough phenomenological analysis, we
demonstrate that the same sign trilepton signal can be an excellent
complementary search to explore the high $\tb$ regions.

that end, we present AutoSoC, a framework for co-designing algorithms as well
as hardware accelerator systems for end-to-end learning-based aerial autonomous

remarkable progress in leveraging complicated networks and attention
mechanisms, most of them neglect the inter-image relations and an important
prior: spatial consistency and semantic consistency of attributes under
surveillance scenarios. The spatial locations of the same attribute should be
consistent between different pedestrian images, \eg, the ``hat"" attribute and
the ``boots"" attribute are always located at the top and bottom of the picture
respectively. In addition, the inherent semantic feature of the ``hat""
attribute should be consistent, whether it is a baseball cap, beret, or helmet.
To fully exploit inter-image relations and aggregate human prior in the model

framework that consists of two complementary regularizations to achieve spatial
and semantic consistency for each attribute. Specifically, we first propose a
spatial consistency regularization to focus on reliable and stable
attribute-related regions. Based on the precise attribute locations, we further
propose a semantic consistency regularization to extract intrinsic and

as a proximity measure in the iterative scheme, has recently been re-developed
for minimizing convex composite problems without the global Lipschitz gradient
continuity assumption. This makes the BPG appealing for a wide range of
applications, and hence it has received growing attention in recent years.
However, most existing convergence results are only obtained under the
assumption that the involved subproblems are solved exactly, which is not
realistic in many applications. For the BPG to be implementable and practical,
in this paper, we develop an inexact version of the BPG (denoted by iBPG) by
employing a novel two-point-type inexact stopping condition for solving the
subproblems. The iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ and the convergence
of the sequence are also established for our iBPG under some proper conditions.
Moreover, we develop an inertial variant of our iBPG (denoted by v-iBPG) and
establish the iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/k^{\gamma})$, where
$\gamma\geq1$ is a restricted relative smoothness exponent. When the smooth
part in the objective has a Lipschitz continuous gradient and the kernel
function is strongly convex, we have $\gamma=2$ and thus the v-iBPG improves
the iteration complexity of the iBPG from $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$, in accordance with the existing results on the
accelerated BPG. Finally, some preliminary numerical experiments for solving a
relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem are conducted to show the

optomechanics, which can be equivalent to an effective DM manipulated by the
photon number. Besides, the phonon mode of the optomechanical system is coupled
to a squeezed vacuum reservoir with a phase matching, resulting in that the
thermal noise caused by the environment can be suppressed completely. We show
that squeezing of the phonon mode triggered by a single photon can be
transferred to the spin ensemble totally, and pairwise entanglement of the spin
ensemble can be realized if and only if there is spin squeezing. Importantly,
when considering the impact of the environment, our system can obtain a better
squeezing degree than the optimal squeezing that can be achieved in the
traditional DM. Meanwhile, the spin squeezing generated in our system is immune
to the thermal noise. This work offers an effective way to generate spin
squeezing with a single photon and to reduce decoherence in an open system,
which will have promising applications in quantum information processing.

the arm with the highest mean reward) with prescribed confidence. For this
problem, we propose Fed-SEL, a simple communication-efficient algorithm that
builds on successive elimination techniques and involves local sampling steps
at the clients. To study the performance of Fed-SEL, we introduce a notion of
arm-heterogeneity that captures the level of dissimilarity between

analysis reveals the benefits of arm-heterogeneity in reducing both the sample-

show that for certain heterogeneous problem instances, Fed-SEL outputs the

key implication: unlike federated supervised learning where recent work has
shown that statistical heterogeneity can lead to poor performance, one can
provably reap the benefits of both local computation and heterogeneity for

investigate the dynamic process of wave propagation and energy transport with
Alfven waves. We considered axisymmetric and stationary magnetosphere and
perturbed the background magnetosphere to obtain the linear wave equation for
the Alfven wave mode. The numerical results show that the energy of Alfven
waves monotonically increases as the waves propagate outwardly along the
rotating curved magnetic field line around the ergosphere, where energy seems
not to be conserved, in the case of energy extraction from the black string by
the Blandford--Znajek mechanism. The apparent breakdown of energy conservation
suggests the existence of an additional wave induced by the Alfven wave.
Considering the additional fast magnetosonic wave induced by the Alfven wave,
the energy conservation is recovered. Similar relativistic phenomena, such as
the amplification of Alfven waves and induction of fast magnetosonic waves, are
expected around a spinning black hole.

this paper, we study ethnic bias and how it varies across languages by
analyzing and mitigating ethnic bias in monolingual BERT for English, German,
Spanish, Korean, Turkish, and Chinese. To observe and quantify ethnic bias, we
develop a novel metric called Categorical Bias score. Then we propose two
methods for mitigation; first using a multilingual model, and second using
contextual word alignment of two monolingual models. We compare our proposed
methods with monolingual BERT and show that these methods effectively alleviate
the ethnic bias. Which of the two methods works better depends on the amount of
NLP resources available for that language. We additionally experiment with
Arabic and Greek to verify that our proposed methods work for a wider variety
of languages.

randomly oriented Peierls distortion among unit cells in the averaged rock-salt

to a local structure change from the rhombohedral to the cubic geometry within

discussed. Our work provides new microscopic insights into contributions of the

intelligent transportation systems. Due to the external environments, such as

poor continuity, and different sizes in length and width. However, most of the
existing studies pay less attention to crack data under different situations.
Meanwhile, recent algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) have promoted the development of cutting-edge models for crack
detection. Nevertheless, they usually focus on complex models for good
performance, but ignore detection efficiency in practical applications. In this
article, to address the first issue, we collected two new databases (i.e.
Rain365 and Sun520) captured in rainy and sunny days respectively, which enrich
the data of the open source community. For the second issue, we reconsider how
to improve detection efficiency with excellent performance, and then propose
our lightweight encoder-decoder architecture termed CarNet. Specifically, we
introduce a novel olive-shaped structure for the encoder network, a
light-weight multi-scale block and a new up-sampling method in the decoder
network. Numerous experiments show that our model can better balance detection
performance and efficiency compared with previous models. Especially, on the
Sun520 dataset, our CarNet significantly advances the state-of-the-art
performance with ODS F-score from 0.488 to 0.514. Meanwhile, it does so with an
improved detection speed (104 frame per second) which is orders of magnitude
faster than some recent DCNNs-based algorithms specially designed for crack
detection.

composition of the dunes were compared to inferred provenances from the thermal
infrared response of surface constituent materials. We use a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) technique to estimate the bulk amount of mineralogy contributed by
each inferred provenance to the dune field composition. An average thermal
inertia value of 238+/-17 Jm-2K-1s-0.5 was found for the dunes corresponding to
a surface composed of an average effective grain size of ~391+/-172 um. This
effective particle size suggests the presence of mostly medium sand-sized
materials mixed with fine and coarse grain sands. The dunes are likely
comprised of a weakly indurated surface mixed with unconsolidated materials.
Compositional analysis specifies that the dunes are comprised of a mixture of
feldspar, olivine, pyroxene, and relatively low bulk-silica content. Dune
materials were likely derived from physical weathering, especially eolian
erosion, predominantly from the crater ejecta unit at the crater, mixed with a
small amount from the crater floor and crater rim and wall lithologies -
indicating the dune materials were likely sourced locally.

leverages three layers of planners and a variable walking height controller to
enable bipedal robots to safely explore height-constrained environments. A

to capture the robot's coupled dynamics of planar walking and vertical walking
height. This reduced-order model is utilized to optimize for long-term and
short-term safe trajectory plans. A variable walking height controller is
leveraged to enable the bipedal robot to maintain stable periodic walking gaits
while following the planned trajectory. The entire framework is tested and
experimentally validated using a bipedal robot Cassie. This demonstrates
reliable autonomy to drive the robot to safely avoid obstacles while walking to

(EiBI) gravity theory on the NS mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, and
tidal deformability. The results are compared to recent observation constraints
extracted from the analysis of NS observation data. The NS core equation of
state (EoS) is calculated using the relativistic mean-field model with the G3
parameter set. In the hyperon sector, the SU(3) and hyperon potential depths
are used to determine the hyperon coupling constants. For the inner and outer
crusts, we use the crust EoS from Miyatsu et al. (2013). We also maintain the
sound speed to not exceed $c$/$\sqrt{3}$ at high densities. We have found that,
in general, the NS mass significantly depends on the value of $\kappa$, and the
radius $R$ is sensitive to the value of $\Lambda_c$. Moreover, as $\Lambda_c$
is equal to zero or less than the accepted bound of the cosmological constant,
the NS within the EiBI theory is compatible with observation constraints,
including $2.0 M_\odot$ mass, canonical radius $R_{1.4 M_{\odot}}$, moment of
inertia, and tidal deformation. Our investigation also reveals that the $2.6
M_\odot$ mass compact object and current observational constraint of canonical
radius $R_{1.4 M_{\odot}}$ can simultaneously be satisfied only when the
$\Lambda_c$ value is unphysically too large and negative. Therefore, within the
spesific EoS employed in this work, we conclude that the secondary object with
$2.6 M_\odot$ observed in the GW190814 event is not likely a static (or a
slow-rotating) NS within the EiBI gravity theory.

  Vision. 2021 (ICCV 2021)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

galactic formation. In the Milky Way, individual element abundances show tight
correlations with age, which vary in slope across ([Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe]). Here,
we step from characterising abundances as measures of age, to understanding how
abundances trace properties of stellar birth-environment in the disk over time.
Using measurements from $\sim$27,000 APOGEE stars (R=22,500, SNR$>$200), we
build simple local linear models to predict a sample of elements (X = Si, O,
Ca, Ti, Ni, Al, Mn, Cr) using (Fe, Mg) abundances alone, as fiducial tracers of
supernovae production channels. Given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], we predict these
elements, [X/H], to about double the uncertainty of their measurements. The
intrinsic dispersion, after subtracting measurement errors in quadrature is
$\approx 0.015-0.04$~dex. The residuals of the prediction (measurement $-$
model) for each element demonstrate that each element has an individual link to
birth properties at fixed (Fe, Mg). Residuals from primarily massive-star
supernovae (i.e. Si, O, Al) partially correlate with guiding radius. Residuals
from primarily supernovae Ia (i.e. Mn, Ni) partially correlate with age. A
fraction of the intrinsic scatter that persists at fixed (Fe, Mg), however,
after accounting for correlations, does not appear to further discriminate
between birth properties that can be traced with present-day measurements.
Presumably, this is because the residuals are also, in part, a measure of the
typical (in)-homogeneity of the disk's stellar birth environments, previously
inferred only using open-cluster systems. Our study implies at fixed birth
radius and time, there is a median scatter of $\approx 0.01-0.015$ dex in
elements generated in supernovae sources.

extremely high data rate communications, while URLLC services aim to provide

formulated to maximize the data rate of eMBB users while satisfying the latency

scheduling. To solve this problem, we first introduce an eMBB user clustering
mechanism to balance the system performance and computational complexity.
Thereafter, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, namely the
scheduling problem of user selection and power allocation. We introduce a
Gale-Shapley (GS) theory to solve with the user selection problem, and a
successive convex approximation (SCA) and a difference of convex (D.C.)
programming to deal with the power allocation problem. Finally, an iterative
algorithm is utilized to find the global solution with low computational
complexity. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed

in excursion sets of smooth random fields in two dimensions. Using the contour
Minkowski tensor, $\W_1$, as our basic tool we first examine geometrical
properties of single structures. For simple closed curves in two dimensions we
show that $\W_1$ is proportional to the identity matrix if the curve has
$m$-fold symmetry, with $m\ge 3$. Then we elaborate on how $\W_1$ maps any
arbitrary shaped simple closed curve to an ellipse that is unique up to
translations of its centroid. We also carry out a comparison of the shape
parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, defined using $\W_1$, with the filamentarity
parameter defined using two scalar Minkowski functionals - area and contour
length. We show that they contain complementary shape information, with $\W_1$
containing additional information of orientation of structures. Next, we apply
our method to boundaries of excursion sets of random fields and examine what
statistical isotropy means for the geometry of the excursion sets. Focusing on
Gaussian isotropic fields, and using a semi-numerical approach we quantify the
effect of finite sampling of the field on the geometry of the excursion sets.
In doing so we obtain an analytic expression for $\alpha$ which takes into
account the effect of finite sampling. Finally we derive an analytic expression
for the ensemble expectation of $\W_1$ for Gaussian anisotropic random fields.
Our results provide insights that are useful for designing tests of statistical
isotropy using cosmological data.

efficiency and effectiveness in dealing with higher-order tensor data. However,
existing tensor completion methods using TT decomposition have two obvious
drawbacks. One is that they only consider mode weights according to the degree

an effective optimization algorithm, called as tensor completion by parallel
weighted matrix factorization via tensor train (TWMac-TT), is proposed. In
addition, we specifically consider the recovery quality of edge elements from
adjacent blocks. Different from traditional reshaping and ket augmentation, we
utilize a new tensor augmentation technique called overlapping ket
augmentation, which can further avoid blocking artifacts. We then conduct
extensive performance evaluations on synthetic data and several real image data

a popular algorithm for solving Multi-Objective Problems (MOPs). The main
component of MOEA/D is to decompose a MOP into easier sub-problems using a set
of weight vectors. The choice of the number of weight vectors significantly
impacts the performance of MOEA/D. However, the right choice for this number
varies, given different MOPs and search stages.
  Here we adaptively change the number of vectors by removing unnecessary
vectors and adding new ones in empty areas of the objective space.
  Our MOEA/D variant uses the Consolidation Ratio to decide when to change the
number of vectors, and then it decides where to add or remove these weighted
vectors.
  We investigate the effects of this adaptive MOEA/D against MOEA/D with a
poorly chosen set of vectors, a MOEA/D with fine-tuned vectors and MOEA/D-AWA
on the DTLZ and ZDT benchmark functions. We analyse the algorithms in terms of
hypervolume, IGD and entropy performance.
  Our results show that the proposed method is equivalent to MOEA/D with
fine-tuned vectors and superior to MOEA/D with poorly defined vectors. Thus,
our adaptive mechanism mitigates problems related to the choice of the number
of weight vectors in MOEA/D, increasing the final performance of MOEA/D by
filling empty areas of the objective space while avoiding premature stagnation
of the search progress.

across diverse domains when deployed to real-world applications. Currently,
domain generalization (DG) is introduced to learn a universal representation

framework for Domain Generalization (HCDG) by integrating Extrinsic Consistency
and Intrinsic Consistency synergistically. Particularly, for the Extrinsic
Consistency, we leverage the knowledge across multiple source domains to
enforce data-level consistency. To better enhance such consistency, we design a
novel Amplitude Gaussian-mixing strategy into Fourier-based data augmentation
called DomainUp. For the Intrinsic Consistency, we perform task-level
consistency for the same instance under the dual-task scenario. We evaluate the
proposed HCDG framework on two medical image segmentation tasks, i.e., optic
cup/disc segmentation on fundus images and prostate MRI segmentation. Extensive
experimental results manifest the effectiveness and versatility of our HCDG

\emph{Label Reasoning Network(LRN)}, which sequentially reasons fine-grained

inductive reasoning between labels, which can effectively model, learn and

aspects of life. Surface Mount Technology (SMT) is the most common industrial
method for manufacturing electric devices in which electrical components are

the expansion of electronic devices affects our lives in a productive way,
failures or defects in the manufacturing procedure of those devices might also
be counterproductive and even harmful in some cases. It is therefore desired
and sometimes crucial to ensure zero-defect quality in electronic devices and
their production. While traditional Image Processing (IP) techniques are not
sufficient to produce a complete solution, other promising methods like Deep
Learning (DL) might also be challenging for PCB inspection, mainly because such
methods require big adequate datasets which are missing, not available or not
updated in the rapidly growing field of PCBs. Thus, PCB inspection is
conventionally performed manually by human experts. Unsupervised Learning (UL)
methods may potentially be suitable for PCB inspection, having learning
capabilities on the one hand, while not relying on large datasets on the other.
In this paper, we introduce ChangeChip, an automated and integrated change
detection system for defect detection in PCBs, from soldering defects to
missing or misaligned electronic elements, based on Computer Vision (CV) and
UL. We achieve good quality defect detection by applying an unsupervised change

the model size and computational cost limit the ability of their models on edge
devices and higher-resolution images. To this end, we propose a novel
spatial-separated curve rendering network(S$^2$CRNet) for efficient and
high-resolution image harmonization for the first time. In S$^2$CRNet, we
firstly extract the spatial-separated embeddings from the thumbnails of the
masked foreground and background individually. Then, we design a curve
rendering module(CRM), which learns and combines the spatial-specific knowledge
using linear layers to generate the parameters of the piece-wise curve mapping
in the foreground region. Finally, we directly render the original
high-resolution images using the learned color curve. Besides, we also make two
extensions of the proposed framework via the Cascaded-CRM and Semantic-CRM for
cascaded refinement and semantic guidance, respectively. Experiments show that
the proposed method reduces more than 90% parameters compared with previous
methods but still achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both synthesized

study, we demonstrate that adversarial training in the source domain can be

establish that adversarially trained detectors achieve improved detection
performance in target domains that are significantly shifted from source
domains. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that adversarially trained
detectors can be used to extract robust features that are in alignment with
human perception and worth transferring across domains while discarding
domain-specific non-robust features. In addition, we propose a method that
combines adversarial training and feature alignment to ensure the improved
alignment of robust features with the target domain. We conduct experiments on

on large domain shifts from real to artistic images. Compared to the baseline
models, the adversarially trained detectors improve the mean average precision

Effect, focussing on its influence on the emergence of extreme events in the
system. First we find that under Allee effect the regular periodic dynamics
changes to chaotic. Further, we find that the system exhibits unbounded growth
in the vegetation population after a critical value of the Allee parameter. The
most significant finding is the observation of a critical Allee parameter
beyond which the probability of obtaining extreme events becomes non-zero for
all three population densities. Though the emergence of extreme events in the
predator population is not affected much by the Allee effect, the prey
population shows a sharp increase in the probability of obtaining extreme
events after a threshold value of the Allee parameter, and the vegetation
population also yields extreme events for sufficiently strong Allee effect.
Lastly we consider the influence of additive noise on extreme events. First, we
find that noise tames the unbounded vegetation growth induced by Allee effect.
More interestingly, we demonstrate that stochasticity drastically diminishes
the probability of extreme events in all three populations. In fact for
sufficiently high noise, we do not observe any more extreme events in the
system. This suggests that noise can mitigate extreme events, and has
potentially important bearing on the observability of extreme events in
naturally occurring systems.

Vertices give birth at a constant rate (growth), each edge may be removed
independently (fragmentation of the tree) and clusters (or trees) are frozen
with a rate proportional to their sizes (isolation of connected component). A
phase transition occurs when the isolation is able to stop the growth
fragmentation process and cause extinction. When the process survives, the
number of clusters increases exponentially and we prove that the normalized
empirical measure of clusters a.s. converges to a limit law on recursive trees.
We exploit the branching structure associated with the size of clusters, which
is inherited from the splitting property of random recursive trees. This work
is motivated by the control of epidemics and contact tracing where clusters
correspond to trees of infected individuals that can be identified and
isolated. We complement this work by providing results on the Malthusian
exponent to describe the effect of control policies on epidemics.

distributions spanning a broad range of the scattering size parameter domain.
We conclude that the behavior of the phase function at the side- and
back-scattering regions provides information on the size regime, the position
and magnitude of the maximum of the DLP curve are strongly dependent on
particle size, the negative polarization branch is mainly produced by particles
with size parameters in the approx. 6 to 20 range, and the deltaL is strongly
dependent on particle size at all measured phase angles except for the exact
backward direction. From a direct comparison of the experimental data with
computations for spherical particles, it becomes clear that the use of the
spherical model for simulating the phase function and DLP curves of irregular
dust produces dramatic errors in the retrieved composition and size of the
scattering particles: The experimental phase functions are reproduced by
assuming unrealistically high values of the imaginary part of the refractive
index. The spherical model does not reproduce the bell-shaped DLP curve of dust
particles with sizes in the resonance and/or geometric optics size domain.
Thus, the use of the Mie model for analyzing polarimetric observations might
prevent locating dust particles with sizes of the order of or larger than the
wavelength of the incident light.

developed for automating these components in separation, joint optimization of
these components remains challenging due to the largely increased search
dimension and the variant input types of each component. In parallel to this,
the common practice of searching for the optimal architecture first and then
retraining it before deployment in NAS often suffers from low performance
correlation between the searching and retraining stages. An end-to-end solution
that integrates the AutoML components and returns a ready-to-use model at the
end of the search is desirable. In view of these, we propose DHA, which
achieves joint optimization of Data augmentation policy, Hyper-parameter and
Architecture. Specifically, end-to-end NAS is achieved in a differentiable
manner by optimizing a compressed lower-dimensional feature space, while DA
policy and HPO are regarded as dynamic schedulers, which adapt themselves to
the update of network parameters and network architecture at the same time.
Experiments show that DHA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on various

efficiently and jointly optimize DA policy, NAS, and HPO in an end-to-end

assessment of multiple desirable criteria, e.g., fluency, coherency, coverage,

tasks, we observe that the human evaluation scores on these multiple criteria
are often not correlated. For example, there is a very low correlation between
human scores on fluency and data coverage for the task of structured data to
text generation. This suggests that the current recipe of proposing new
automatic evaluation metrics for NLG by showing that they correlate well with
scores assigned by humans for a single criteria (overall quality) alone is
inadequate. Indeed, our extensive study involving 25 automatic evaluation
metrics across 6 different tasks and 18 different evaluation criteria shows
that there is no single metric which correlates well with human scores on all
desirable criteria, for most NLG tasks. Given this situation, we propose
CheckLists for better design and evaluation of automatic metrics. We design
templates which target a specific criteria (e.g., coverage) and perturb the
output such that the quality gets affected only along this specific criteria
(e.g., the coverage drops). We show that existing evaluation metrics are not
robust against even such simple perturbations and disagree with scores assigned
by humans to the perturbed output. The proposed templates thus allow for a
fine-grained assessment of automatic evaluation metrics exposing their
limitations and will facilitate better design, analysis and evaluation of such

default a pure-language task, which aims to satisfy human need for daily
communication on open-ended topics by producing related and informative
responses. In this paper, we point out that hidden images, named as visual
impressions (VIs), can be explored from the text-only data to enhance dialogue
understanding and help generate better responses. Besides, the semantic
dependency between an dialogue post and its response is complicated, e.g., few
word alignments and some topic transitions. Therefore, the visual impressions
of them are not shared, and it is more reasonable to integrate the response
visual impressions (RVIs) into the decoder, rather than the post visual
impressions (PVIs). However, both the response and its RVIs are not given
directly in the test process. To handle the above issues, we propose a
framework to explicitly construct VIs based on pure-language dialogue datasets
and utilize them for better dialogue understanding and generation.
Specifically, we obtain a group of images (PVIs) for each post based on a
pre-trained word-image mapping model. These PVIs are used in a co-attention
encoder to get a post representation with both visual and textual information.
Since the RVIs are not provided directly during testing, we design a cascade
decoder that consists of two sub-decoders. The first sub-decoder predicts the
content words in response, and applies the word-image mapping model to get
those RVIs. Then, the second sub-decoder generates the response based on the
post and RVIs. Experimental results on two open-domain dialogue datasets show
that our proposed approach achieves superior performance over competitive

split into two parts, which run on a mobile device and an edge server
respectively. The feature generated by the mobile device is transmitted through
the wireless channel to the edge server. To reduce the transmission overhead of

the medium around the supernova explosion. Various cones along prominent

  We find that the increase in thermal X-ray emission predates the increase in
the low-energy gamma-ray brightness by several years. The increase of the
gamma-ray brightness at lower energies is followed by a smooth increase at the
highest energies. The gamma-ray spectrum at the highest energies appears soft
during the brightening but hardens as more material in the equatorial ring gets
shocked. The X-ray and gamma-ray brightness remain almost constant once the SNR
blast-wave passed the region of peak-density in the equatorial plane.

Therefore, utilizing interaction data of auxiliary behavior data draws a lot of
attention in the E-commerce recommender systems. However, all existing models
ignore two kinds of intrinsic heterogeneity which are helpful to capture the
difference of user preferences and the difference of item attributes. First
(intra-heterogeneity), each user has multiple social identities with otherness,
and these different identities can result in quite different interaction
preferences. Second (inter-heterogeneity), each item can transfer an
item-specific percentage of score from low-level behavior to high-level
behavior for the gradual relationship among multiple behaviors. Thus, the lack
of consideration of these heterogeneities damages recommendation rank
performance. To model the above heterogeneities, we propose a novel method
named intra- and inter-heterogeneity recommendation model (ARGO). Specifically,
we embed each user into multiple vectors representing the user's identities,
and the maximum of identity scores indicates the interaction preference.
Besides, we regard the item-specific transition percentage as trainable
transition probability between different behaviors. Extensive experiments on
two real-world datasets show that ARGO performs much better than the

core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), resulting in a $\sim$10-second long burst of
ALPs. These particles subsequently undergo conversion into gamma-rays in
external magnetic fields to produce a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a
characteristic spectrum peaking in the 30--100-MeV energy range. At the same
time, CCSNe are invoked as progenitors of {\it ordinary} long GRBs, rendering
it relevant to conduct a comprehensive search for ALP spectral signatures using
the observations of long GRB with the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope
(LAT). We perform a data-driven sensitivity analysis to determine CCSN
distances for which a detection of an ALP signal is possible with the LAT's
low-energy (LLE) technique which, in contrast to the standard LAT analysis,
allows for a a larger effective area for energies down to 30~MeV. Assuming an
ALP mass $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$~eV and ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} =
5.3\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$, values considered and deduced in ALP searches
from SN1987A, we find that the distance limit ranges from $\sim\!0.5$ to
$\sim\!10$~Mpc, depending on the sky location and the CCSN progenitor mass.
Furthermore, we select a candidate sample of twenty-four GRBs and carry out a
model comparison analysis in which we consider different GRB spectral models
with and without an ALP signal component. We find that the inclusion of an ALP
contribution does not result in any statistically significant improvement of
the fits to the data. We discuss the statistical method used in our analysis
and the underlying physical assumptions, the feasibility of setting upper
limits on the ALP-photon coupling, and give an outlook on future telescopes in
the context of ALP searches.

this challenge, we used a classifier to instruct the MCMC-based models where

reliable classifier. Next, we proposed a two-step approach, ""Predict and

leveraged the classifier to compute the learned prior for the candidate

confidence level imposed on the constraint. Furthermore, we prove that this
approach can also be used to compute a set of optimal solutions for the chance
constrained minimum spanning tree problem. In order to deal with potentially
exponentially many trade-offs in the multi-objective formulation, we propose
and analyze improved convex multi-objective approaches. Experimental
investigations on instances of the NP-hard stochastic minimum weight dominating

dependencies that relate to outcome changes. Identifying the minimum subset of
feature changes needed to action an output change in the decision is an
interesting challenge for counterfactual explainers. The DisCERN algorithm
introduced in this paper is a case-based counter-factual explainer. Here
counterfactuals are formed by replacing feature values from a nearest unlike

adopted feature relevance-based explainers (i.e. LIME, SHAP), can inform
DisCERN to identify the minimum subset of ""actionable features"". We demonstrate
our DisCERN algorithm on five datasets in a comparative study with the widely
used optimisation-based counterfactual approach DiCE. Our results demonstrate
that DisCERN is an effective strategy to minimise actionable changes necessary

factor is known to successfully capture the electron correlation effects. Thus,
the efficient optimization of the many-body wave function including the Jastrow
correlation factor is of great importance. For this purpose, the
transcorrelated $+$ variational Monte Carlo (TC$+$VMC) method is one of the
promising methods, where the one-electron orbitals in the Slater determinant
and the Jastrow factor are self-consistently optimized in the TC and VMC
methods, respectively. In particular, the TC method is based on
similarity-transformation of the Hamitonian by the jastrow factor, which
enables efficient optimization of the one-electron orbitals under the effective
interactions. In this study, by test calculation of a helium atom, we find that
the total energy is systematically improved by using better Jastrow functions,
which can be naturally understood by considering a role of the Jastrow factor
and the effective potential introduced by the similarity-transformation. We
also find that one can partially receive a benefit of the orbital optimization
even by one-shot TC$+$VMC, where the Jastrow parameters are optimized at the
Hartree-Fock$+$VMC level, while a quality of the many-body wave function is
inferior to that for self-consistent TC$+$VMC. A difference between TC and
biorthogonal TC is also discussed. Our study provides important knowledge for
optimizing many-body wave function including the Jastrow correlation factor,

We focus on settings wherein monetary transfers are not available and each
agent's private valuation is a submodular function with binary marginals, i.e.,
the agents' valuations are matroid-rank functions. In this setup, we establish
a notable dichotomy between two of the most well-studied fairness notions in
discrete fair division; specifically, between envy-freeness up to one good
(EF1) and maximin shares (MMS).
  First, we show that a Pareto-efficient mechanism of Babaioff et al. (2021) is
group strategy-proof for finding EF1 allocations, under matroid-rank
valuations. The group strategy-proofness guarantee strengthens the result of
Babaioff et al. (2021), that establishes truthfulness (individually for each
agent) in the same context. Our result also generalizes a work of Halpern et
al. (2020), from binary additive valuations to the matroid-rank case.
  Next, we establish that an analogous positive result cannot be achieved for
MMS, even when considering truthfulness on an individual level. Specifically,
we prove that, for matroid-rank valuations, there does not exist a truthful
mechanism that is index oblivious, Pareto efficient, and maximin fair.
  For establishing our results, we develop a characterization of truthful
mechanisms for matroid-rank functions. This characterization in fact holds for
a broader class of valuations (specifically, holds for binary XOS functions)

continue to hone in on AI's inherent vulnerabilities. Designed and trained from
certain statistical distributions of data, AI's deep neural networks (DNNs)
remain vulnerable to deceptive inputs that violate a DNN's statistical,
predictive assumptions. Before being fed into a neural network, however, most
existing adversarial examples cannot maintain malicious functionality when
applied to an affine transformation. For practical purposes, maintaining that
malicious functionality serves as an important measure of the robustness of
adversarial attacks. To help DNNs learn to defend themselves more thoroughly
against attacks, we propose an affine-invariant adversarial attack, which can
consistently produce more robust adversarial examples over affine
transformations. For efficiency, we propose to disentangle current
affine-transformation strategies from the Euclidean geometry coordinate plane
with its geometric translations, rotations and dilations; we reformulate the
latter two in polar coordinates. Afterwards, we construct an affine-invariant
gradient estimator by convolving the gradient at the original image with
derived kernels, which can be integrated with any gradient-based attack
methods. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, including some experiments under
physical condition, demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
affine invariance of adversarial examples and, as a byproduct, improve the
transferability of adversarial examples, compared with alternative

  The BGK model is solved by an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method,

we have used a meshfree method based on a least-square approximation for the

of the gadolinium ions predicts a spin configuration that is periodic at the
level of the smallest repeating unit cell. The quantum version of the model is
treated via a truncated Holstein-Primakoff transformation with axes defined by
the classical spin configuration, and the magnon excitation bands are
calculated. The model predicts a transition in the field range of $1.9$ --
$2.1\mathrm{T}$, sensitive to the direction of the applied field, which is
caused by one or more magnon modes becoming soft as the field is decreased. In
general the soft modes occur at incommensurate wavevectors and therefore break
the periodicity of the spin configuration below the transition. One exception
occurs when the field aligns with one of the principle crystal axes, in which
case periodicity of the spin configuration is found to be maintained on a
larger crystallographic cubic cell even below the transition. This simple case
is studied in more detail. Comparisons are drawn with existing experimental
data, and further experimental tests of the model are suggested.

vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Compared to adversarial attacks on images,
perturbations to skeletons are typically bounded to a lower dimension of
approximately 100 per frame. This lower-dimensional setting makes it more
difficult to generate imperceptible perturbations. Existing attacks resolve
this by exploiting the temporal structure of the skeleton motion so that the
perturbation dimension increases to thousands. In this paper, we show that
adversarial attacks can be performed on skeleton-based action recognition
models, even in a significantly low-dimensional setting without any temporal
manipulation. Specifically, we restrict the perturbations to the lengths of the
skeleton's bones, which allows an adversary to manipulate only approximately 30
effective dimensions. We conducted experiments on the NTU RGB+D and HDM05
datasets and demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully deceived models
with sometimes greater than 90% success rate by small perturbations.
Furthermore, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: in our low-dimensional
setting, the adversarial training with the bone length attack shares a similar
property with data augmentation, and it not only improves the adversarial
robustness but also improves the classification accuracy on the original data.
This is an interesting counterexample of the trade-off between adversarial
robustness and clean accuracy, which has been widely observed in studies on
adversarial training in the high-dimensional regime.

a differential equation linking $T_0$ with the physical distance between the
lineages, we arrive at simple and reasonably accurate approximation schemes for
both cases. Furthermore, our analysis enables us to address the question of
whether the genealogical process of the model ""comes down from infinity"", which
has been partly answered before in [2].

assumptions about how a given behavioral description - an event log -
translates into a process model and were not learned from actual models which
introduce biases in the solutions. In this paper, we explore the problem of
supervised learning of a process discovery technique D. We introduce a
technique for training an ML-based model D using graph convolutional neural
networks; D translates a given input event log into a sound Petri net. We show
that training D on synthetically generated pairs of input logs and output
models allows D to translate previously unseen synthetic and several real-life
event logs into sound, arbitrarily structured models of comparable accuracy and
simplicity as existing state of the art techniques for discovering imperative
process models. We analyze the limitations of the proposed technique and

astrophysical channels such as, e.g., isolated binary evolution and dynamical
formation or, alternatively, have a primordial origin. Increasingly large
gravitational-wave catalogs of binary black-hole mergers have allowed for the
first model selection studies between different theoretical predictions to
constrain some of their model uncertainties and branching ratios. In this work,
we show how one could add an additional and independent constraint to model
selection by using the stochastic gravitational-wave background. In contrast to
model selection analyses that have discriminating power only up to the
gravitational-wave detector horizons (currently at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$ for
LIGO-Virgo), the stochastic gravitational-wave background accounts for the
redshift integration of all gravitational-wave signals in the Universe. As a
working example, we consider the branching ratio results from a model selection
study that includes potential contribution from astrophysical and primordial
channels. We renormalize the relative contribution of each channel to the
detected event rate to compute the total stochastic gravitational-wave
background energy density. The predicted amplitude lies below the current
observational upper limits of GWTC-2 by LIGO-Virgo, indicating that the results
of the model selection analysis are not ruled out by current background limits.
Furthermore, given the set of population models and inferred branching ratios,
we find that, even though the predicted background will not be detectable by
current generation gravitational-wave detectors, it will be accessible by
third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and space-based
detectors such as LISA.

significant DH, MI reveals two populations of particles organised in clusters
having either filamentous or compact globular structures that exhibit different
mobility and relaxation properties. In a model polymer melt, MI provides
clearer evidence of JG secondary relaxation and sharper insight into its DH. It
is found that both DH and MI between the orientation and the displacement of
the bonds reach (local) maxima at the time scales of the primary and JG
secondary relaxation. This suggests that, in (macro)molecular systems, the
mechanistic explanation of both DH and relaxation must involve

models and understanding the solar influence on Earth's climate. Direct solar
irradiance measurements are only available since 1978. Reconstructions of past
variability typically rely on sunspot data. These provide only indirect
information on the facular and network regions, which are decisive contributors
to irradiance variability on timescales of the solar cycle and longer. Our
ultimate goal is to reconstruct past solar irradiance variations using
historical full-disc Ca II K observations to describe the facular contribution
independently of sunspot observations. Here, we develop the method and test it
extensively by using modern CCD-based Ca II K observations and carry out
initial tests on two photographic archives. We employ carefully reduced and
calibrated Ca II K images from 13 datasets, such as those from the Meudon, Mt
Wilson, and Rome observatories. We convert them to unsigned magnetograms and
then use them as input to the adapted SATIRE model to reconstruct TSI
variations over the period 1978-2019, for which direct irradiance measurements
are available. The reconstructed TSI from the analysed Ca II K archives agrees
well with direct TSI measurements and existing reconstructions. The model also
returns good results on data taken with different bandpasses and images with
low spatial resolution. Historical Ca II K archives suffer from numerous
inconsistencies, but we show that these archives can still be used to
reconstruct TSI with reasonable accuracy provided the observations are
accurately processed. By using the unsigned magnetograms of the Sun
reconstructed from high-quality Ca II K observations as input into the SATIRE
model, we can reconstruct solar irradiance variations nearly as accurately as
from directly recorded magnetograms.

spatial $\mathcal{L}^2$ norm in the static patch implies that $\mathcal{S}$ is
well defined for each mode. We find that $\mathcal{S}$ for this mixed state is
independent of the effective mass of the scalar field, and matches that of
Higuchi and Yamamoto, where, a spatial density matrix was used to calculate the
horizon entanglement entropy. Using a cut-off in the angular modes we show that
$\mathcal{S} \propto A_{c}$, where $A_c$ is the area of the de Sitter
cosmological horizon. Our analysis can be carried over to the black hole and
cosmological horizon in Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetime, which also has
finite spatial $\mathcal{L}^2$ norm in the static regions. Although the
explicit form of the modes is not known in this case, we use appropriate
boundary conditions for a massless minimally coupled scalar field to find the

Cepheids. The retrieved distribution of the individual ages confirms that a
brighter Mass-Luminosity relation produces older ages and that First Overtone
pulsators are found to be concentrated towards older ages with respect to the
Fundamental ones at a fixed Mass-Luminosity relation. Moreover, the inclusion
of a metallicity term in the Period-Age and Period-Age-Color relations slightly
modifies the predicted ages. In particular, the age distribution of the
selected sample of Galactic Cepheids is found to be shifted towards slightly
older values, when the F-mode canonical relations are considered, with respect
to the case at a fixed solar chemical composition. A marginally opposite
dependence can be found in the noncanonical F-mode and canonical FO-mode cases.

tests increases greatly the cost and slows down the production. It requires the
manufacture of a prototype of the product. The use of existing development
tools does not always provide the required characteristics. To solve this

problem, but will also help to move to cloud production and the development of
the Industry 4.0 direction. Thus, a new problem arises - how to create digital
twins of products from polymer composite materials. The analysis makes it
possible to conclude that the traditional methods of mathematical physics are
not suitable for the solution of this problem, since the twins obtained with
their help do not have any properties of adaptability. To solve the problem, it
is proposed to use deep neural networks one of the most powerful methods of

task in analyzing these data is to understand, characterize and utilize the
correlations in them in order to conduct valid inference. Yet explicit
regression analysis of correlations has been so far limited to longitudinal
data, a special form of correlated data, while implicit analysis via
mixed-effects models lacks generality as a full inferential tool. This paper
proposes a novel regression approach for modelling the correlation structure,
leveraging a new generalized z-transformation. This transformation maps
correlation matrices that are constrained to be positive definite to vectors
with un-restricted support, and is order-invariant. Building on these two
properties, we develop a regression model to relate the transformed parameters
to any covariates. We show that coupled with a mean and a variance regression
model, the use of maximum likelihood leads to asymptotically normal parameter
estimates, and crucially enables statistical inference for all the parameters.
The performance of our framework is demonstrated in extensive simulation. More
importantly, we illustrate the use of our model with the analysis of the
classroom data, a highly unbalanced multilevel clustered data with within-class
and within-school correlations, and the analysis of the malaria immune response
data in Benin, a longitudinal data with time-dependent covariates in addition

the past as records can, e.g., exhibit predominantly Gaussian noise, telegraph

an optical spin noise measurement at very low probe laser power. Here we show
that such random-time quantum measurements can similarly to the first two cases
be analyzed in terms of higher-order temporal correlations of the detector
output $z(t)$ and be related to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system.
Our analysis in terms of up to fourth-order spectra (quantum polyspectra) shows
that this new type of spectra reveals the same valuable information as
previously studied higher-order spectra in case of usual continuous quantum
measurements. Surprisingly, broad-band system dynamics is revealed even for
deliberately low average measurement rates. Many applications are envisioned in
high-resolution spectroscopy, single-photon microscopy, circuit quantum

  The framework development was originally motivated to cover the needs at Rare

learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault
recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is
learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not
abruptly exclude a failing unit. Experiments on a robotic manipulator show
promising results and directions for future work are discussed.

faulty/malicious clients, which are often modeled as Byzantine clients. To this
end, previous work either makes use of auxiliary data at parameter server to
verify the received gradients (e.g., by computing validation error rate) or
leverages statistic-based methods (e.g. median and Krum) to identify and remove
malicious gradients from Byzantine clients. In this paper, we remark that
auxiliary data may not always be available in practice and focus on the
statistic-based approach. However, recent work on model poisoning attacks has
shown that well-crafted attacks can circumvent most of median- and
distance-based statistical defense methods, making malicious gradients
indistinguishable from honest ones. To tackle this challenge, we show that the
element-wise sign of gradient vector can provide valuable insight in detecting
model poisoning attacks. Based on our theoretical analysis of the
\textit{Little is Enough} attack, we propose a novel approach called
\textit{SignGuard} to enable Byzantine-robust federated learning through
collaborative malicious gradient filtering. More precisely, the received
gradients are first processed to generate relevant magnitude, sign, and
similarity statistics, which are then collaboratively utilized by multiple
filters to eliminate malicious gradients before final aggregation. Finally,
extensive experiments of image and text classification tasks are conducted
under recently proposed attacks and defense strategies. The numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. The

proposed to estimate the function-on-function linear quantile regression model.
A partial quantile covariance function is first used to extract the functional
partial quantile regression basis functions. The extracted basis functions are
then used to obtain the functional partial quantile regression components and
estimate the final model. In our proposal, the functional forms of the
discretely observed random variables are first constructed via a
finite-dimensional basis function expansion method. The functional partial
quantile regression constructed using the functional random variables is
approximated via the partial quantile regression constructed using the basis
expansion coefficients. The proposed method uses an iterative procedure to
extract the partial quantile regression components. A Bayesian information
criterion is used to determine the optimum number of retained components. The
proposed functional partial quantile regression model allows for more than one
functional predictor in the model. However, the true form of the proposed model
is unspecified, as the relevant predictors for the model are unknown in
practice. Thus, a forward variable selection procedure is used to determine the
significant predictors for the proposed model. Moreover, a case-sampling-based
bootstrap procedure is used to construct pointwise prediction intervals for the
functional response. The predictive performance of the proposed method is
evaluated using several Monte Carlo experiments under different data generation
processes and error distributions. Through an empirical data example, air

proposed with outstanding estimation accuracy and inference latency. However,
there exists no study that systematically evaluates the quality of these

establish a new benchmark for CardEst, which contains a new complex real-world

most representative CardEst methods into an open-source database system
PostgreSQL, and comprehensively evaluate their true effectiveness in improving
query plan quality, and other important aspects affecting their applicability,
ranging from inference latency, model size, and training time, to update
efficiency and accuracy. We obtain a number of key findings for the CardEst
methods, under different data and query settings. Furthermore, we find that the
widely used estimation accuracy metric(Q-Error) cannot distinguish the
importance of different sub-plan queries during query optimization and thus
cannot truly reflect the query plan quality generated by CardEst methods.
Therefore, we propose a new metric P-Error to evaluate the performance of
CardEst methods, which overcomes the limitation of Q-Error and is able to
reflect the overall end-to-end performance of CardEst methods. We have made all

used in almost all computing systems are designed without having modern
applications' overwhelming data demand in mind. As a result, accessing, moving,
and processing large amounts of data faces important challenges in today's
systems, making data a first-class concern and a prime performance and energy
bottleneck in such systems. This thesis studies the root cause of inefficiency
in modern computing systems when handling modern applications' data demand, and
aims to fundamentally address such inefficiencies, with a focus on two
directions. First, we design SIMDRAM, an end-to-end processing-using-DRAM
framework that aids the widespread adoption of processing-using-DRAM, a
data-centric computation paradigm that improves the overall performance and
efficiency of the system when computing large amounts of data by minimizing the
cost of data movement and enabling computation where the data resides. Second,
we introduce the Virtual Block Interface (VBI), a novel virtual memory
framework that 1) eliminates the inefficiencies of the conventional virtual
memory frameworks when handling the high memory demand in modern applications,
and 2) is built from the ground up to understand, convey, and exploit data
properties, to create opportunities for performance and efficiency
improvements.

investigations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. In a preliminary study we
construct model atmospheres for RSGs which include a wind, and use these models
to compute synthetic spectra from the optical to the mid-infrared. The
inclusion of a wind has two important effects. Firstly, higher mass-loss rates
result in stronger absorption in the TiO bands, causing the star to appear as a
later spectral type despite its effective temperature remaining constant. This
explains the observed relation between spectral type, evolutionary stage and
mid-IR excess, as well as the mismatch between temperatures derived from the
optical and infrared. Secondly, the wind mimics many observed characteristics

Schmidt-Kennicutt law. While theoretical estimates of the column density of the
H I layer have been proposed for static photodissociation regions (PDRs),
Herschel and well-resolved ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) observations
have revealed dynamical effects in star forming regions, caused by the process
of photoevaporation. We extend the analytic study of the H/H2 transition to
include the effects of the propagation of the ionization front, in particular
in the presence of photoevaporation at the walls of blister H II regions, and
we find its consequences on the total atomic hydrogen column density at the
surface of clouds in the presence of an ultraviolet field, and on the
properties of the H/H2 transition. We solved semi-analytically the differential
equation giving the H2 column density profile by taking into account H2
formation on grains, H2 photodissociation, and the ionization front propagation
dynamics modeled as advection of the gas through the ionization front. Taking
this advection into account reduces the width of the atomic region compared to
static models. The atomic region may disappear if the ionization front velocity
exceeds a certain value, leading the H/H2 transition and the ionization front
to merge. For both dissociated and merged configurations, we provide analytical
expressions to determine the total H I column density. Our results take the
metallicity into account. Finally, we compared our results to observations of

varieties and conformations as well as with respect to the type and number of
potentially important elementary reaction steps (including decomposition

microswimming in viscoelastic fluids, which typically rely on asymptotically
small dimensionless parameters. We then summarise recent progress on the

applications. Recently, fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has
been shown the remarkable ability to fully characterize the global correlation.
Considering the global correlation and the nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) of
RSIs, this paper introduces the FCTN decomposition to the whole RSI and its NSS
groups, and proposes a novel nonlocal patch-based FCTN (NL-FCTN) decomposition
for RSI inpainting. Different from other nonlocal patch-based methods, the
NL-FCTN decomposition-based method, which increases tensor order by stacking
similar small-sized patches to NSS groups, cleverly leverages the remarkable
ability of FCTN decomposition to deal with higher-order tensors. Besides, we
propose an efficient proximal alternating minimization-based algorithm to solve
the proposed NL-FCTN decomposition-based model with a theoretical convergence
guarantee. Extensive experiments on RSIs demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves the state-of-the-art inpainting performance in all compared methods.

pipeline for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
(sTIL%) in H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer tissue. The
sTIL% score is a prognostic and predictive biomarker for many solid tumor
types. However, due to the high labeling efforts and high intra- and
interobserver variability within and between expert annotators, this biomarker
is currently not used in routine clinical decision making. WeakSTIL compresses
tiles of a WSI using a feature extractor pre-trained with self-supervised
learning on unlabeled histopathology data and learns to predict precise sTIL%
scores for each tile in the tumor bed by using a multiple instance learning
regressor that only requires a weak WSI-level label. By requiring only a weak
label, we overcome the large annotation efforts required to train currently
existing TIL detection methods. We show that WeakSTIL is at least as good as
other TIL detection methods when predicting the WSI-level sTIL% score, reaching
a coefficient of determination of $0.45\pm0.15$ when compared to scores
generated by an expert pathologist, and an AUC of $0.89\pm0.05$ when treating
it as the clinically interesting sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task.
Additionally, we show that the intermediate tile-level predictions of WeakSTIL
are highly interpretable, which suggests that WeakSTIL pays attention to latent
features related to the number of TILs and the tissue type. In the future,
WeakSTIL may be used to provide consistent and interpretable sTIL% predictions
to stratify breast cancer patients into targeted therapy arms.

widely-used approaches to seismic forecasting. However most studies of ETAS use
point estimates for the model parameters, which ignores the inherent
uncertainty that arises from estimating these from historical earthquake
catalogs, resulting in misleadingly optimistic forecasts. In contrast, Bayesian
statistics allows parameter uncertainty to be explicitly represented, and fed
into the forecast distribution. Despite its growing popularity in seismology,
the application of Bayesian statistics to the ETAS model has been limited by
the complex nature of the resulting posterior distribution which makes it
infeasible to apply on catalogs containing more than a few hundred earthquakes.
To combat this, we develop a new framework for estimating the ETAS model in a
fully Bayesian manner, which can be efficiently scaled up to large catalogs
containing thousands of earthquakes. We also provide easy-to-use software which
implements our method.

about the uncertain state of the network is provided by a traffic information

select routes minimizing their individual expected travel time under their

exact inference of the prior exists. We then provide an iterative algorithm
that finds such a scheme in a finite number of steps. We show that schemes
designed by our algorithm are robust, in the sense that they can still identify
the prior after a small enough perturbation. We also investigate the case where
the population is divided among multiple priors, and give conditions under
which the fraction associated to each prior can be identified. Several examples

network/graph topology are coupled with changes in the node/vertex dynamics,
can give rise to rich and complex dynamical behavior. Even though adaptivity
can improve the modelling of collective phenomena, it often complicates the
analysis of the corresponding mathematical models significantly. For
non-adaptive systems, a possible way to tackle this problem is by passing to
so-called continuum or mean-field limits, which describe the system in the
limit of infinitely many nodes. Although fully adaptive network dynamic models
have been used a lot in recent years in applications, we are still lacking a
detailed mathematical theory for large-scale adaptive network limits. For
example, continuum limits for static or temporal networks are already
established in the literature for certain models, yet the continuum limit of
fully adaptive networks has been open so far. In this paper we introduce and
rigorously justify continuum limits for sequences of adaptive Kuramoto-type
network models. The resulting integro-differential equations allow us to
incorporate a large class of co-evolving graphs with high density. Furthermore,
we use a very general measure-theoretical framework in our proof for
representing the (infinite) graph limits, thereby also providing a structural
basis to tackle even larger classes of graph limits. As an application of our
theory, we consider the continuum limit of an adaptive Kuramoto model directly
motivated from neuroscience and studied by Berner et al.~in recent years using
numerical techniques and formal stability analysis.

that learn to rank items so as to present an ordered list maximizing the
probability that it contains relevant item. The main challenge in the design of
learning-to-rank algorithms stems from the fact that queries often have
different meanings for different users. In absence of any contextual
information about the query, one often has to adhere to the {\it diversity}
principle, i.e., to return a list covering the various possible topics or
meanings of the query. To formalize this learning-to-rank problem, we propose a
natural model where (i) items are categorized into topics, (ii) users find
items relevant only if they match the topic of their query, and (iii) the
engine is not aware of the topic of an arriving query, nor of the frequency at
which queries related to various topics arrive, nor of the topic-dependent
click-through-rates of the items. For this problem, we devise LDR (Learning
Diverse Rankings), an algorithm that efficiently learns the optimal list based
on users' feedback only. We show that after $T$ queries, the regret of LDR
scales as $O((N-L)\log(T))$ where $N$ is the number of all items. We further
establish that this scaling cannot be improved, i.e., LDR is order optimal.
Finally, using numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world data, we
illustrate the superiority of LDR compared to existing learning-to-rank
algorithms.

techniques. Their effectiveness relies on the choice of a locally constructed
coarse space. Thus far, this construction was mostly achieved using
non-assembled matrices from discretized partial differential equations (PDEs).
Therefore, DD methods were mainly successful when solving systems stemming from
PDEs. In this paper, we present a fully algebraic multilevel DD method where
the coarse space can be constructed locally and efficiently without any

preconditioned matrix can be bounded by a user-prescribed number. Numerical
experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner on a range of

neural networks tailored to recognize specific features of quantum states by
combining unitary operations, measurements and feedforward promise to require
fewer measurements and to tolerate errors. Here, we realize a quantum
convolutional neural network (QCNN) on a 7-qubit superconducting quantum
processor to identify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of a spin
model characterized by a non-zero string order parameter. We benchmark the
performance of the QCNN based on approximate ground states of a family of

finite-fidelity gates itself, the QCNN recognizes the topological phase with
higher fidelity than direct measurements of the string order parameter for the

adversarial examples created for them but even those created for others. This
phenomenon poses a potential security risk in various black-box systems relying
on image classifiers. The reason behind such transferability of adversarial
examples is not yet fully understood and many studies have proposed training
methods to obtain classifiers with low transferability. In this study, we
address this problem from a novel perspective through investigating the
contribution of the network architecture to transferability. Specifically, we
propose an architecture searching framework that employs neuroevolution to
evolve network architectures and the gradient misalignment loss to encourage
networks to converge into dissimilar functions after training. Our experiments
show that the proposed framework successfully discovers architectures that
reduce transferability from four standard networks including ResNet and VGG,
while maintaining a good accuracy on unperturbed images. In addition, the
evolved networks trained with gradient misalignment exhibit significantly lower
transferability compared to standard networks trained with gradient
misalignment, which indicates that the network architecture plays an important
role in reducing transferability. This study demonstrates that designing or
exploring proper network architectures is a promising approach to tackle the
transferability issue and train adversarially robust image classifiers.

non-expert users to model their problems as constraint networks by classifying

former focuses on one constraint of the target network, while the latter can
learn a maximum number of constraints. Two bottlenecks of the acquisition
process where both these algorithms encounter problems are the large number of
queries required to reach convergence, and the high cpu times needed to
generate queries, especially near convergence. In this paper we propose
algorithmic and heuristic methods to deal with both these issues. We first
describe an algorithm, called MQuAcq, that blends the main idea of MultiAcq
into QuAcq resulting in a method that learns as many constraints as MultiAcq
does after a negative example, but with a lower complexity. A detailed
theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm is also presented. %We also
present a technique that boosts the performance of constraint acquisition by
reducing the number of queries significantly. Then we turn our attention to
query generation which is a significant but rather overlooked part of the
acquisition process. We describe %in detail how query generation in a typical
constraint acquisition system operates, and we propose heuristics for improving
its efficiency. Experiments from various domains demonstrate that our resulting
algorithm that integrates all the new techniques does not only generate
considerably fewer queries than QuAcq and MultiAcq, but it is also by far
faster than both of them, in average query generation time as well as in total
run time, and also largely alleviates the premature convergence problem.

tackle this issue, we propose r-GAT, a relational graph attention network to
learn multi-channel entity representations. Specifically, each channel
corresponds to a latent semantic aspect of an entity. This enables us to
aggregate neighborhood information for the current aspect using relation
features. We further propose a query-aware attention mechanism for subsequent

in the context of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) mobile communication networks. We
specifically address the JCAS challenges stemming from the full-duplex
operation and from the co-existence of multiple simultaneous beams for
communications and sensing purposes. To this end, we first formulate and solve
beamforming optimization problems for hybrid beamforming based multiuser
multiple-input and multiple-output JCAS systems. The cost function to be
maximized is the beamformed power at the sensing direction while constraining
the beamformed power at the communications directions, suppressing interuser
interference and cancelling full-duplexing related self-interference (SI). We
then also propose new transmitter and receiver beamforming solutions for purely
analog beamforming based JCAS systems that maximize the beamforming gain at the
sensing direction while controlling the beamformed power at the communications
direction(s), cancelling the SI as well as eliminating the potential reflection
from the communication direction and optimizing the combined radar pattern
(CRP). Both closed-form and numerical optimization based formulations are
provided. We analyze and evaluate the performance through extensive
simulations, and show that substantial gains and benefits in terms of radar
transmit gain, CRP, and SI suppression can be achieved with the proposed
beamforming methods.

scaling of either the generalized (R\'enyi) entropy or the correlation sum

value theory. Motivated by the lack of quantitative and systematic comparisons
of fractal dimension estimators in the literature, and also by new methods both
for estimating fractal dimensions and for performing delay embeddings, in this
paper we provide a detailed and quantitative comparison for estimating the
fractal dimension. We start with summarizing existing estimators and then
perform an evaluation of these estimators, comparing their performance and
precision using different data sets and taking into account the impact of
features like length, noise, embedding dimension, non-stationarity,
falsify-ability, among many others. Our analysis shows that for synthetic data
the correlation sum and extreme value theory perform equally well as best
estimators. Our results also challenge the widely established notion that the
correlation sum method cannot be applied to high dimensional data. For real
experimental data the entropy is better than the correlation sum, but the
extreme value theory is equally good to the entropy. It appears that overall
the more recent extreme value theory estimator is very powerful, but it also
has two downsides when it comes to real data. First, it over-estimates the
dimension values for short data lengths, and second, it will also yield
low-dimensional deterministic results even for inappropriate data like stock

semiconductors with charge transfer (CT)-type excitons to convert dark triplet
states into bright singlets via a reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process.
Here, we consider the role of the dielectric environment in a range of TADF
materials with varying changes in dipole moment upon optical excitation. In a
dipolar reference emitter, TXO-TPA, environmental reorganisation after
excitation in both solution and doped films triggers the formation of the full
CT product state. This lowers the singlet excitation energy by 0.3 eV and
minimises the singlet-triplet energy gap ({\Delta}EST). Using impulsive Raman
measurements, we observe the emergence of two (reactant-inactive) modes at 412
and 813 cm-1 as a vibrational fingerprint of the CT product. In contrast, the
dielectric environment plays a smaller role in the electronic excitations of a
less dipolar material, 4CzIPN. Quantum-chemical calculations corroborate the
appearance of these new product modes in TXO-TPA and show that the dynamic
environment fluctuations are large compared to {\Delta}EST. The analysis of the
energy-time trajectories and the corresponding free energy functions reveals
that the dielectric environment significantly reduces the activation energy for
rISC, thus increasing the rISC rate by up to three orders of magnitude when
compared to a vacuum environment.

maximum matching problem) is one of the most classical problems in computer
science. Despite a significant body of work dedicated to the study of this
problem in the data stream model, the state-of-the-art single-pass
semi-streaming algorithm for it is still a simple greedy algorithm that
computes a maximal matching, and this way obtains 1/2-approximation. Some
previous works described two/three-pass algorithms that improve over this
approximation ratio by using their second and third passes to improve the above
mentioned maximal matching. One contribution of this paper continuous this line
of work by presenting new three-pass semi-streaming algorithms that work along
these lines and obtain improved approximation ratios of 0.6111 and 0.5694 for
triangle-free and general graphs, respectively.
  Unfortunately, a recent work (Konrad and Naidu, 2021) shows that the strategy
of constructing a maximal matching in the first pass and then improving it in
further passes has limitations. Additionally, this technique is unlikely to get
us closer to single-pass semi-streaming algorithms obtaining a better than
1/2-approximation. Therefore, it is interesting to come up with algorithms that
do something else with their first pass (we term such algorithms
non-maximal-matching-first algorithms). No such algorithms are currently known
(to the best of our knowledge), and the main contribution of this paper is
describing such algorithms that obtain approximation ratios of 0.5384 and
0.5555 in two and three passes, respectively, for general graphs (the result
for three passes improves over the previous state-of-the-art, but is worse than
the result of this paper mentioned in the previous paragraph for general
graphs).

strong, interacting winds. These binaries may be actual particle accelerators,
making them variable gamma-ray sources due to changes in the wind collision
region along the orbit. However, only two of these massive stellar binary
systems have been identified as high-energy sources. The first and archetypical
system of this class is Eta Carinae, a bright gamma-ray source with orbital
variability peaking around its periastron passage. Aims. The origin of the high
energy emission in Eta Carinae is still unclear, with both lepto-hadronic and
hadronic scenarios being under discussion. Moreover, the gamma-ray emission
seemed to differ between the two periastrons previously observed with the Fermi
Large Area Telescope. Continuing observations might provide highly valuable
information for the understanding of the emission mechanisms in this system.
Methods. We have used almost 12 years of data from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope. We studied both low and high energy components, searching for
differences and similarities between both orbits, and made use of this large
dataset to search for emission from nearby colliding-wind binaries. Results. We
show how the energy component above 10 GeV of Eta Carinae peaks months before
the 2014 periastron, while the 2020 periastron is the brightest to date.
Additionally, upper limits are provided for the high-energy emission in other
particle-accelerating colliding-wind systems. Conclusions. Current gamma-ray
observations of Eta Carinae strongly suggest that the wind collision region of
this system is perturbed from orbit to orbit affecting particle transport
within the shock.

dwarf surveys sampling distinct orbital radii to fit a log-normal function to
the orbital separation distribution. This model, alongside the companion mass
ratio distribution given by Reggiani & Meyer (2013), is used to calculate the

Agents (CSAs) consist of multiple turns of interaction. While users initiate a
search session, ideally a CSA should sometimes take the lead in the
conversation by obtaining feedback from the user by offering query suggestions
or asking for query clarifications i.e. mixed initiative. This creates the
potential for more engaging conversational searches, but substantially
increases the complexity of modelling and evaluating such scenarios due to the
large interaction space coupled with the trade-offs between the costs and
benefits of the different interactions. In this paper, we present a model for
conversational search -- from which we instantiate different observed
conversational search strategies, where the agent elicits: (i) Feedback-First,
or (ii) Feedback-After. Using 49 TREC WebTrack Topics, we performed an analysis
comparing how well these different strategies combine with different mixed
initiative approaches: (i) Query Suggestions vs. (ii) Query Clarifications. Our
analysis reveals that there is no superior or dominant combination, instead it
shows that query clarifications are better when asked first, while query
suggestions are better when asked after presenting results. We also show that
the best strategy and approach depends on the trade-offs between the relative
costs between querying and giving feedback, the performance of the initial
query, the number of assessments per query, and the total amount of gain
required. While this work highlights the complexities and challenges involved
in analyzing CSAs, it provides the foundations for evaluating conversational
strategies and conversational search agents in batch/offline settings.

  1. The Point-to-Set Principle, which has recently been used to prove several
new theorems in fractal geometry, has resource-bounded instances. These
instances characterize the resource-bounded dimension of a set $X$ of languages
in terms of the relativized resource-bounded dimensions of the individual
elements of $X$, provided that the former resource bound is large enough to
parameterize the latter. Thus for example, the dimension of a class $X$ of
languages in EXP is characterized in terms of the relativized p-dimensions of
the individual elements of $X$.
  2. Every language that is $\leq^P_m$-reducible to a p-selective set has
p-dimension 0, and this fact holds relative to arbitrary oracles. Combined with
a resource-bounded instance of the Point-to-Set Principle, this implies that if
NP has positive dimension in EXP, then no quasipolynomial time selective
language is $\leq^P_m$-hard for NP.
  3. If the set of all disjoint pairs of NP languages has dimension 1 in the
set of all disjoint pairs of EXP languages, then NP has positive dimension in
EXP.

sequential Cauchy-Schwarz complexity, which is parametrized by two positive
integers $k,\ell$ and refines the notion of Cauchy-Schwarz complexity
introduced by Green and Tao. We prove that if a system of linear forms has
sequential Cauchy-Schwarz complexity at most $(k,\ell)$ then any average of
1-bounded functions over this system is controlled by the $2^{1-\ell}$-th power
of the Gowers $U^{k+1}$-norms of the functions. For $\ell=1$ this agrees with
Cauchy-Schwarz complexity, but for $\ell>1$ there are systems that have
sequential Cauchy-Schwarz complexity at most $(k,\ell)$ whereas their
Cauchy-Schwarz complexity is greater than $k$. Our main application illustrates
this with systems over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$ that are denoted by
$\Phi_{k,M}$ and can be viewed as $M$-dimensional arithmetic progressions of
length $k$. For each $M\geq 2$ we prove that $\Phi_{k,M}$ has sequential
Cauchy-Schwarz complexity at most $(k-2,|\Phi_{k,M}|)$ (where $|\Phi_{k,M}|$ is
the number of forms in the system), whereas the Cauchy-Schwarz complexity of
$\Phi_{k,M}$ can be greater than $k-2$. Thus we obtain polynomial
true-complexity bounds for $\Phi_{k,M}$ with exponent $2^{-|\Phi_{k,M}|}$. A
recent general theorem of Manners, proved independently with different methods,
implies a similar application but with different polynomial true-complexity
bounds, as explained in the paper. In separate work, we use our application to
give a new proof of the inverse theorem for Gowers norms on $\mathbb{F}_p^n$,
and related results concerning ergodic actions of $\mathbb{F}_p^{\omega}$.

principal amplitudes usually correspond to only a few valence excitations,
whereas all other cluster amplitudes are enslaved, and behave as auxiliary

the coupled cluster equations are solved only to determine the principal
amplitudes, which saves significant computation time. The auxiliary amplitudes,
on the other hand, are determined via regression. Few different regression
techniques have been introduced to express the auxiliary amplitudes as
functions of the principal amplitudes. The scheme has been applied to several

monocular or stereo odometry to fail. While tracking motion with extra cameras
should theoretically prevent failures, it leads to additional complexity and
computational burden. To overcome these challenges, we introduce two novel
methods to improve multi-camera feature tracking. First, instead of tracking
features separately in each camera, we track features continuously as they move
from one camera to another. This increases accuracy and achieves a more compact
factor graph representation. Second, we select a fixed budget of tracked
features across the cameras to reduce back-end optimization time. We have found
that using a smaller set of informative features can maintain the same tracking
accuracy. Our proposed method was extensively tested using a
hardware-synchronized device consisting of an IMU and four cameras (a front
stereo pair and two lateral) in scenarios including: an underground mine, large
open spaces, and building interiors with narrow stairs and corridors. Compared

tailored to study the impact of turbulence on the global modes of oscillation
in solar-like stars. This first paper aims at deriving a linear wave equation
that directly and consistently contains the turbulence as an input to the
model, and therefore naturally contains the information on the coupling between
the turbulence and the modes, through the stochasticity of the equations.
  Methods. We use a Lagrangian stochastic model of turbulence based on
Probability Density Function methods to describe the evolution of the
properties of individual fluid particles through stochastic differential
equations. We then transcribe these stochastic differential equations from a
Lagrangian frame to an Eulerian frame, more adapted to the analysis of stellar
oscillations. We combine this method with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics,
where all the mean fields appearing in the Lagrangian stochastic model are
estimated directly from the set of fluid particles themselves, through the use
of a weighting kernel function allowing to filter the particles present in any
given vicinity. The resulting stochastic differential equations on Eulerian
variables are then linearised.
  Results. We obtain a stochastic, linear wave equation governing the time
evolution of the relevant wave variables, while at the same time containing the
effect of turbulence. The wave equation generalises the classical, unperturbed
propagation of acoustic waves in a stratified medium to a form that, by
construction, accounts for the impact of turbulence on the mode in a consistent
way. The effect of turbulence consists in a non-homogeneous forcing term,
responsible for the stochastic driving of the mode, and a stochastic
perturbation to the homogeneous part of the wave equation, responsible for both
the damping of the mode and the modal surface effects.

each ensemble member evolvesindependently upon its own mesh and is interpolated
to a common mesh for the DA update. This paper outlines aframework to develop
time-dependent reference meshes using locations of observations and the metric
tensors (MTs)or monitor functions that define the spatial meshes of the

on the metric tensor (MT localization). We also explore how adaptive moving

concentrate near the location of observations, reducingthe error of observation
interpolation. This is especially beneficial when we have observations in
locations that wouldotherwise have a sparse spatial discretization. We
illustrate the utility of our results using discontinuous Galerkin(DG)
approximations of 1D and 2D inviscid Burgers equations. The numerical results
show that the MT localizationscheme compares favorably with standard
Gaspari-Cohn localization techniques. In problems where the observationsare

WiFi Doppler Frequency Shift (WiDFS), which can achieve single-target real-time
passive tracking using channel state information (CSI) collected from
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. We consider the typical system
setup including a transmitter with a single antenna and a receiver with three

the impact of transceiver asynchronization, we first apply CSI
cross-correlation between each RX antenna pair. We then combine them to
estimate a Doppler frequency shift (DFS) in a short-time window. After that, we
leverage the DFS estimate to separate dynamic human components from CSI
self-correlation terms of each antenna, thereby separately calculating
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and human reflection distance for tracking. In addition,
a hardware calibration algorithm is presented to refine the spacing between RX
antennas and eliminate the hardware-related phase differences between them. A

the gravitational redshift effects. In this paper, we exploit a simple
analytical description for the dipole asymmetry in the cross-correlation

prescription involves only one dimensional integrals, providing a faster way to
reproduce the results obtained by Saga et al. (2020). Using the analytical

gravitational redshift effect from upcoming galaxy surveys. The gravitational
redshift effect at small scales enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the
dipole, and in most of the cases considered, the S/N is found to reach a
maximum at $z\approx0.5$. We show that current and future surveys such as DESI
and SKA provide an idealistic data set, giving a large S/N of $10\sim 20$. Two
potential systematics arising from off-centered galaxies are also discussed
(transverse Doppler effect and diminution of the gravitational redshift
effect), and their impacts are found to be mitigated by a partial cancellation
between two competitive effects. Thus, the detection of the dipole signal at
small scales is directly linked to the gravitational redshift effect, and
should provide an alternative route to test gravity.

prohibits the performance of visual dialog models. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to Learn to Ground visual objects for visual dialog, which
employs a novel visual objects grounding mechanism where both prior and
posterior distributions over visual objects are used to facilitate visual
objects grounding. Specifically, a posterior distribution over visual objects
is inferred from both context (history and questions) and answers, and it
ensures the appropriate grounding of visual objects during the training
process. Meanwhile, a prior distribution, which is inferred from context only,
is used to approximate the posterior distribution so that appropriate visual
objects can be grounded even without answers during the inference process.
Experimental results on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate that our
approach improves the previous strong models in both generative and
discriminative settings by a significant margin.

and spectral efficiency, for the sake of alleviating networks from
content-related traffic. Coded caching originally introduced by Maddah-Ali and
Niesen significantly speeds up communication efficiency by transmitting
multicast messages simultaneously useful to multiple users. Most prior works on
coded caching are based on the assumption that each user may request all
content in the library. However, in many applications the users are interested
only in a limited set of content that depends on their location. Motivated by
these considerations, this paper formulates the coded caching problem for
location-based content with edge cache nodes. The considered problem includes a
content server with access to $N$ location-based files (e.g., High-Definition
maps), $K$ edge cache nodes located at different regions, and $K$ users (i.e.,
vehicles) each of which is in the serving region of one cache node and can
retrieve the cached content of this cache node with negligible cost. Depending
on the location, each user only requests a file from a location-dependent
subset of the library. The objective is to minimize the worst-case load. For
this novel coded caching problem, we propose a highly non-trivial converse
bound under uncoded cache placement, which shows that a simple achievable
scheme is optimal under uncoded cache placement. In addition, this achievable
scheme is also proved to be generally order optimal within a factor of $3$.
Finally, we extend the coded caching problem for location-based content to the
multiaccess coded caching topology originally proposed by Hachem et al., where
each user is connected to $L$ nearest cache nodes. When $L \geq 2$, we
characterize the exact optimality on the worst-case load.

structural phase stability of paramagnetic CaFeO$_3$ under pressure using a
fully self-consistent in charge density DFT+dynamical mean-field theory method.
We show that at ambient pressure CaFeO$_3$ is a negative charge-transfer
insulator characterized by strong localization of the Fe $3d$ electrons. It
crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/n$ crystal structure with a cooperative
breathing mode distortion of the lattice. While the Fe $3d$ Wannier occupations
and local moments are consistent with robust charge disproportionation of Fe
ions in the insulating $P2_1/n$ phase, the physical charge density difference
around the structurally distinct Fe A and Fe B ions with the ``contracted'' and
``expanded'' oxygen octahedra, respectively, is rather weak, $\sim$0.04. This
implies the importance of the Fe $3d$ and O $2p$ negative charge transfer and
supports the formation of a bond-disproportionated state characterized by the
Fe A $3d^{5-\delta}\underline{L}^{2-\delta}$ and Fe B $3d^5$ valence
configurations with $\delta \ll 1$, in agreement with strong hybridization
between the Fe $3d$ and O $2p$ states. Upon compression above $\sim$41 GPa
CaFeO$_3$ undergoes the insulator-to-metal phase transition (IMT) which is
accompanied by a structural transformation into the orthorhombic $Pbnm$ phase.
The phase transition is accompanied by suppression of the cooperative breathing
mode distortion of the lattice and, hence, results in the melting of bond
disproportionation of the Fe ions. Our analysis suggests that the IMT
transition is associated with orbital-dependent delocalization of the Fe $3d$
electrons and leads to a remarkable collapse of the local magnetic moments. Our
results imply the crucial importance of the interplay of electronic
correlations and structural effects to explain the properties of CaFeO$_3$.

science from distributed financial transactions to data science. This is a
consequence of their capability to avoid many shortcomings of relative
identifiers, such as limited scope and the need for central management.
However, the current identifiers in use are isolated entities which cannot
provide much information about the relationship between objects. As an example,
if one has both the identifiers of an object and its transformed version, no
information about how they are related can be obtained without resorting to
some kind of authority or additionally appended information. Moreover, given an
input object and an arbitrarily long sequence of costly steps, one cannot
currently predict the identifier of the outcome without actually processing the
entire sequence. The capability of predicting the resulting identifier and
avoiding redundant calculations is highly desirable in an efficient unmanaged
system. In this paper, we propose a new kind of unique identifier that is
calculated from the list of events that can produce an object, instead of
directly identifying it by content. This provides an identification scheme
regardless of the object's current existence, thus allowing to inexpensively
check for its content in a database and retrieve it when it has already been
calculated before. These identifiers are proposed in the context of abstract
algebra, where objects are represented by elements that can be operated
according to useful properties, such as associativity, order sensitivity when
desired, and reversibility, while simplicity of implementation and strong
guarantees are given by well known group theory results.

perform a systematic timing and spectral analysis to derive updated sensitivity
limits for both periodic signals and multi-temperature spectral components that
could be associated with radiation from hotspots on the neutron star surface.
Based on these limits, we then investigated for each target the allowed viewing
geometry that could explain the lack of pulsations. We estimate it is unlikely
($< 10^{-6}$) to attribute that we do not see pulsations to an unfavorable
viewing geometry for five considered sources. Alternatively, the carbon
atmosphere model, which assumes homogeneous temperature distribution on the
surface, describes the spectra equally well and provides a reasonable
interpretation for the absence of detected periodicities within current limits.
The unusual properties of CCOs with respect to other young neutron stars could
suggest a different evolutionary path, as that proposed for sources
experiencing episodes of significant fallback accretion after the supernova

recommendation systems with explicit feedback. For example, users tend to rate
items they like. However, when rating an item concerning a specific user, most
of the recommendation algorithms tend to rely too much on his/her rating
(feedback) history. This introduces implicit bias on the recommendation system,
which is referred to as user feedback-loop bias in this paper. We propose a
systematic and dynamic way to correct such bias and to obtain more diverse and
objective recommendations by utilizing temporal rating information.
Specifically, our method includes a deep-learning component to learn each
user's dynamic rating history embedding for the estimation of the probability
distribution of the items that the user rates sequentially. These estimated
dynamic exposure probabilities are then used as propensity scores to train an
inverse-propensity-scoring (IPS) rating predictor. We empirically validated the
existence of such user feedback-loop bias in real world recommendation systems
and compared the performance of our method with the baseline models that are
either without de-biasing or with propensity scores estimated by other methods.
The results show the superiority of our approach.

derive a weak coupling criterion for the even-parity spin-singlet
pseudospin-triplet pairing. It can generally mix with the on-site $s$-wave
pairing since both of them belong to the same symmetry representation
($A_{1g}$) and their mixture could naturally give rise to anisotropic
intra-band pairing gap functions with or without nodes. This may directly
explain why some of the iron-chalcogenide superconductors are fully gapped
(e.g.~FeSe thin film) and some have nodes (e.g.~LaFePO and LiFeP). We also find
that the anisotropy of gap functions can be enhanced when the principal
rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken in the normal state such as
nematicity, and the energetic stabilization of pseudospin-triplet pairings
indicates the coexistence of nematicity and superconductivity. This could be
applied to both bulk FeSe and magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)
where nematicity is observed in experiments. For example, our theory predicts
that MATBG may be a $(s+d)$-like nematic nodal superconductor, which is
consistent with the V-shaped quasi-particle density of states observed in

radiation to the ejected WD materials, causing a bump-like feature in the

$(Z_{Fe,\ast}/Z_{Fe,\odot})=-(0.81\pm0.01)+(0.32+0.03)\log(M_\ast/10^{10}M_\odot)$
across the mass range of $10^9\lesssim M_\ast/M_\odot\lesssim10^{11}$, being
$\approx6\times$ lower than seen locally at the same masses. The instantaneous
oxygen-to-iron ratio ($\alpha$-enhancement) inferred using the gas-phase oxygen
MZRs, is on average found to be [O/Fe]$\approx0.47$, being higher than the
local [O/Fe]$\approx0$. The observed changes in [O/Fe] and [Fe/H] are
reproduced in simple flow-through gas-regulator models with steady
star-formation histories (SFHs) that follow the evolving main sequence. Our
models show that the [O/Fe] is determined almost entirely by the instantaneous

locations of $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$ galaxies at z~2 in the [O/Fe]--metallicity

(OTFS) modulation and Orthogonal Short Time Fourier (OSTF) signaling. OTFS was
recently proposed as a new scheme for high Doppler scenarios and builds on
OSTF. We first show that the two schemes are unitarily equivalent in the
digital domain. However, OSTF defines the analog-digital interface with the
waveform domain. We then develop a critically sampled matrix-vector model for
the two systems and consider linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) filtering
at the receiver to suppress inter-symbol interference. Initial comparison of
capacity and (uncoded) probability of error reveals a surprising observation:
OTFS under-performs OSTF in capacity but over-performs in probability of error.
This result can be attributed to characteristics of the channel matrices
induced by the two systems. In particular, the diagonal entries of OTFS matrix
exhibit nearly identical magnitude, whereas those of the OSTF matrix exhibit
wild fluctuations induced by multipath randomness. It is observed that by
simply replacing the unitary matrix, relating OTFS to OSTF, by an arbitrary
unitary matrix results in performance nearly identical to OTFS. We then extend
our analysis to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and also
consider a more extreme scenario of relatively large delay and Doppler spreads.
Our results demonstrate the significance of using OSTF basis waveforms rather
than sinusoidal ones in OFDM in highly dynamic environments, and also highlight
the impact of the level of channel state information used at the receiver.

avoids the need for ground-truth HDR lighting which is not easily accessible.

different approximation schemes in $^{48}$Ca, we compare our results with
{\it{ab-initio}} coupled-cluster predictions available for C and O isotopes,
where two-body currents are included. Our integrated strenghts, obtained by
using one-body transition operators, are lower compared to the corresponding
{\it{ab-initio}} results. This indicates that, within our model, quenching
effects are mainly driven by the inclusion of two particle - two hole
configurations and that the role of a two-body contribution in the transition
operator is less important than in the coupled-cluster approach. By analyzing
heavier nuclei, $^{90}$ Zr and $^{132}$Sn, we confirm the same conclusions that
we have recently drawn for $^{48}$Ca: the inclusion of two particle - two hole
configurations is very effective in our model for providing strengths which are
significantly more quenched than in other theoretical models and, thus, in
better agreement with the experimental measurements. This occurs because two
particle - two hole configurations have a density which strongly increases with
the excitation energy. Their inclusion thus pushes a significant amount of the
strength to higher energies, compared to what happens in other theoretical
models, reducing in this way the cumulative sum of the strength up to
excitation energies around 20-30 MeV.

anomalies in neutrino physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and cosmic rays.

physics programmes to unveil BSM physics, we consider the possibility that the
latter could be tested with present data, but that systemic shortcomings of the
experiments and their search strategies may preclude their discovery for
several reasons, including: final states consisting in soft particles only,
associated production processes, QCD-like final states, close-by SM resonances,

community. We showcase the example of the CMS collaboration, which is the only
collaboration regularly releasing some of its data. We find it important to
stress that individuals using public data for their own research does not imply
competition with experimental efforts, but rather provides unique opportunities
to give guidance for further BSM searches by the collaborations. Wide access to

the critical Weinstein category, allowing us to characterize the essential
image of the endofunctor by a universal property. This localization has the
effect of replacing every Weinstein sector with one in which $P$ is invertible
in the wrapped Fukaya category and hence we view it as a symplectic analogue of
topological localization. We prove that this construction generalizes the
flexibilization operation introduced by Cieliebak-Eliashberg and Murphy and is
a variant of the `homologous recombination' construction of Abouzaid-Seidel. In
particular, we give an h-principle-free proof that flexibilization is
idempotent and independent of presentation, up to subcriticals and
stabilization. Moreover, we show that $P$-flexibilization is symmetric
monoidal, and hence gives rise to a new way of constructing commutative algebra
objects from symplectic geometry. Our constructions work more generally for any
finite collection of regular Lagrangian disks in $T^*D^n$, where the
corresponding endofunctor in particular nullifies those disks as objects in the

as an intermediary representation of the hybrid circuits to allow for granular
optimizations below the quantum-gate level. We define a translation from hybrid
circuits into diagrams that admit the graph-theoretical focused-gFlow property,
needed for the final extraction back into a circuit. We then derive a number of

rewriting the diagram guided by a Gauss elimination process. Then, after
extracting the circuit, we present a general procedure for detecting segments

form a unified POI dataset. Based on the evaluation conducted, the resulting

POI matches between different data sources outperformed all baseline approaches
with a matching accuracy of 97.6% with an average run time below 3 minutes when
matching over 12,000 POIs to result in 8,699 unique POIs, thereby demonstrating

under-resourced and largely ignored in the NLP literature. Creoles typically

what grammatical and lexical features are transferred to the creole is a
complex process. While creoles are generally stable, the prominence of some

Colloquial English. We evaluate these models on intrinsic and extrinsic tasks.
Motivated by the above literature, we compare standard language models with
distributionally robust ones and find that, somewhat surprisingly, the standard

investigate whether this is an effect of over-parameterization or relative
distributional stability, and find that the difference persists in the absence
of over-parameterization, and that drift is limited, confirming the relative

fluctuations become important. On the level of the lubrication approximation,
this leads to a quasi-linear fourth-order parabolic equation for the film
height $h$ driven by space-time white noise. The gradient flow structure of its
deterministic counterpart, the thin-film equation, which encodes the balance
between driving capillary and limiting viscous forces, provides the guidance
for the thermodynamically consistent introduction of fluctuations. We follow
this route on the level of a spatial discretization of the gradient flow
structure. Starting from an energetically conformal finite-element (FE)
discretization, we point out that the numerical mobility function introduced by
Gr\""un and Rumpf can be interpreted as a discretization of the metric tensor in
the sense of a mixed FE method with lumping. While this discretization was
devised in order to preserve the so-called entropy estimate, we use this to
show that the resulting high-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE)
preserves pathwise and pointwise strict positivity, at least in case of the
physically relevant mobility function arising from the no-slip boundary
condition. As a consequence, this discretization gives rise to a consistent
invariant measure, namely a discretization of the Brownian excursion (up to the
volume constraint), and thus features an entropic repulsion. The price to pay
over more naive discretizations is that when writing the SDE in It\^o's form,
which is the basis for the Euler-Mayurama time discretization, a correction
term appears. To conclude, we perform various numerical experiments to compare
the behavior of our discretization to that of the more naive finite difference
discretization of the equation.

(SPI) is the classification of structural heterogeneity, which is especially
difficult given the low signal-to-noise ratios of individual patterns and that
even identical objects can yield patterns that vary greatly when orientation is
taken into consideration. We propose two methods which explicitly account for
this orientation-induced variation and can robustly determine the structural
landscape of a sample ensemble. The first, termed common-line principal
component analysis (PCA) provides a rough classification which is essentially
parameter-free and can be run automatically on any SPI dataset. The second
method, utilizing variation auto-encoders (VAEs) can generate 3D structures of
the objects at any point in the structural landscape. We implement both these
methods in combination with the noise-tolerant expand-maximize-compress (EMC)
algorithm and demonstrate its utility by applying it to an experimental dataset
from gold nanoparticles with only a few thousand photons per pattern and
recover both discrete structural classes as well as continuous deformations.
These developments diverge from previous approaches of extracting reproducible
subsets of patterns from a dataset and open up the possibility to move beyond
studying homogeneous sample sets and study open questions on topics such as
nanocrystal growth and dynamics as well as phase transitions which have not

Galileon doublet are assumed to construct the scalar charged matter field. The
corresponding action is shown to be the repository of all the symmetries of the
system. The symmetric tensor gauge field introduced during localization of the
gauge symmetries is the empirical tensor gauge field known today. All the past
paradoxes are shown to dispel by the use of Galileon scalar field doublet in
place of the usual scalar field doublet as the basic building blocks of matter
action.

feature aggregation and extraction. Typical CNN design focuses on the conv
layers and activation functions, while leaving the pooling layers with fewer
options. We introduce the Learning Discrete Wavelet Pooling (LDW-Pooling) that
can be applied universally to replace standard pooling operations to better
extract features with improved accuracy and efficiency. Motivated from the
wavelet theory, we adopt the low-pass (L) and high-pass (H) filters
horizontally and vertically for pooling on a 2D feature map. Feature signals
are decomposed into four (LL, LH, HL, HH) subbands to retain features better
and avoid information dropping. The wavelet transform ensures features after
pooling can be fully preserved and recovered. We next adopt an energy-based
attention learning to fine-select crucial and representative features.
LDW-Pooling is effective and efficient when compared with other
state-of-the-art pooling techniques such as WaveletPooling and LiftPooling.
Extensive experimental validation shows that LDW-Pooling can be applied to a
wide range of standard CNN architectures and consistently outperform standard
(max, mean, mixed, and stochastic) pooling operations.

quantization of energy levels in a system with the simpler, less restrictive

With this new postulate, the models of blackbody radiation is shown to be
consistent with the experiments. We also show, that the threshold condition
contributes to a localized vacuum energy which leads us to conclude that the
uncertainty principle is a statistical effect. These conditions also naturally
leads to the prediction that massive particles transition to an ordered state
at low temperatures. In addition, we show that thermodynamic laws must be
modified to include two heat baths with temperatures: $T$ for dissipative
energy levels and $T_{V}$ ($\gg T$) for localized vacuum energy. In total, we
show that our threshold postulate agrees with experimental observations of
blackbody radiation, the uncertainty principle and quantum statistics without

recently discovered that the complex balanced equilibria of the parent network

with similar structure and incidence independence properties. We identified
decomposition classes that can be characterized by their sets of common

classes occur in some biological and chemical models. Finally, a sufficient

ixpeobssim to simulate IXPE observations of the Sgr A MC complex. We use
Chandra maps and spectra to model the diffuse emission in the Galactic center

We create synthetic polarization products of the unpolarized emission. We
combine them with a test dataset from a simulation of a 2 Ms long IXPE
observation to retrieve the intrinsic polarization degree of the MCs. We find
that for the MC considered here, the MDP increases by 1-15% with respect to the
case in which a cloud is observed on-axis. We successfully retrieve the
intrinsic polarization degree in the 4.0-8.0 keV band and line-of-sight
distance of one of them taken as an example, G0.11-0.11, by correcting the
observed (i.e., for a 2 Ms-long simulation) polarization degree map using
either a synthetic dilution map or a Stokes intensity map of the unpolarized

is derived from the reconstructed polarization degree with an uncertainty of 7

balanced-scorecard based framework to evaluate the IS agility through four
perspectives: business contribution, user orientation, operation excellence and
innovation and competitiveness. The proposed framework, called IS Agility BSC,
propose a three layer structure for each of the four perspectives: mission, key
success factors, and agility evaluation criteria. According to this conceptual
model, enterprise information systems agility is measured according to 14
agility key success factors, over the four BSC Perspectives, using 42 agility
evaluation criteria that are identified based on literature survey methodology.
This paper explores agility in the broader context of the enterprise

increase student success rates. Despite the potential for predictive analytics,
two major barriers exist to their adoption in higher education: (a) the lack of
democratization in deployment, and (b) the potential to exacerbate
inequalities. Education researchers and policymakers encounter numerous
challenges in deploying predictive modeling in practice. These challenges
present in different steps of modeling including data preparation, model
development, and evaluation. Nevertheless, each of these steps can introduce
additional bias to the system if not appropriately performed. Most large-scale
and nationally representative education data sets suffer from a significant
number of incomplete responses from the research participants. While many
education-related studies addressed the challenges of missing data, little is
known about the impact of handling missing values on the fairness of predictive
outcomes in practice. In this paper, we set out to first assess the disparities
in predictive modeling outcomes for college-student success, then investigate
the impact of imputation techniques on the model performance and fairness using
a commonly used set of metrics. We conduct a prospective evaluation to provide
a less biased estimation of future performance and fairness than an evaluation
of historical data. Our comprehensive analysis of a real large-scale education
dataset reveals key insights on modeling disparities and how imputation
techniques impact the fairness of the student-success predictive outcome under
different testing scenarios. Our results indicate that imputation introduces
bias if the testing set follows the historical distribution. However, if the
injustice in society is addressed and consequently the upcoming batch of
observations is equalized, the model would be less biased.

graded-channel triple-metal double-gate Junctionless Field Effect Transistor
with hetero dielectric gate oxide stack consisting of SiO$_2$ and HfO$_2$ is
derived. The model illustrates higher drive current and better performance
against hazardous SCEs and HCEs in below 30 nm regime. Parabolic approximation
method is used here to construct channel potentials and electric fields by
solving 2-D Poisson's equation with applicable boundary conditions. The basic
central and surface potentials as well as central and surface electric fields
are being illustrated, Threshold voltage, DIBL, sub-threshold swing (SS) and a
compact current model have also been deduced. These parameters clearly show the
benefits of proposed graded-channel triple-metal double-gate structure with
hetero-dielectric gate oxide stack. The device has reliability in low power
applications because of its better Ion and Ioff control. Finally, the
analytical model is validated with self-consistent numerical calculations to
illustrate better performance of among available junctionless devices.

  of the Geometric Dispersion",,,"10.1063/5.0061238",,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Geometric dispersion in integrated microresonators plays a major role in
nonlinear optics applications, especially at short wavelengths, to compensate
the natural material normal dispersion. Tailoring of geometric confinement
allows for anomalous dispersion, which in particular enables the formation of
microcombs which can be tuned into the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime.
Due to processes like soliton-induced dispersive wave generation, broadband DKS
combs are particularly sensitive to higher-order dispersion, which in turn is
sensitive to the ring dimensions at the nanometer-level. For microrings
exhibiting a rectangular cross section, the ring width and thickness are the
two main control parameters to achieve the targeted dispersion. The former can
be easily varied through parameter variation within the lithography mask, yet
the latter is defined by the film thickness during growth of the starting
material stack, and can show a significant variation (few percent of the total
thickness) over a single wafer. In this letter, we demonstrate that controlled
dry-etching allows for fine tuning of the device layer (silicon nitride)
thickness at the wafer level, allowing multi-project wafers targeting different
wavelength bands, and post-fabrication trimming in air-clad ring devices. We
demonstrate that such dry etching does not significantly affect either the
silicon nitride surface roughness or the optical quality of the devices,
thereby enabling fine tuning of the dispersion and the spectral shape of the
resulting DKS states.

Any positive definite ternary quadratic form over the rational numbers fails to
represent infinitely many positive integers. For any ternary quadratic form
(positive definite or indefinite), our method constructs certain congruence
classes whose elements, up to a square factor, are the only elements not
represented over the rational numbers by that form. In the case of a positive
definite ternary form, we show that these classes are non-empty.
  This shows that the minimum number of variables in a positive definite
quadratic form representing all positive integers is four. Our proof is very
elementary and only uses quadratic reciprocity of Gauss.

in general rough sets and soft computing. But these are often intrusive by
definition, and amount to making unjustified assumptions about the data. The
contamination problem is also about recognizing the domains of discourses
involved in this, specifying errors and reducing data intrusion relative to
them. In this research, weak quasi rough inclusion functions (wqRIFs) are
generalized to general granular operator spaces with scope for limiting
contamination. New algebraic operations are defined over collections of such
functions, and are studied by the present author. It is shown by her that the
algebras formed by the generalized wqRIFs are ordered hemirings with additional
operators. By contrast, the generalized rough inclusion functions lack similar
structure. This potentially contributes to improving the selection (possibly
automatic) of such functions, training methods, and reducing contamination (and
data intrusion) in applications. The underlying framework and associated
concepts are explained in some detail, as they are relatively new.

arbitrary function $\cal F$ of materially conserved Clebsch potentials. The
extension consists in adding potential vorticity $q$ to the list of fields on
which a new arbitrary function $\cal G$ depends. If ${\cal G}=q{\cal A}(s)$,
where ${\cal A}(s)$ is an arbitrary function of specific entropy $s$, then the
symmetry is trivial and gives rise to a trivial conservation law. Otherwise,
the symmetry is non-trivial and an associated non-trivial conservation law
exists. Moreover, the notions of trivial and non-trivial Casimir invariants are
defined. All non-trivial symmetries that become hidden following a reduction of
phase space are associated with non-trivial Casimir invariants of a
non-canonical Hamiltonian formulation for fluids, while all trivial
conservation laws are associated with trivial Casimir invariants.

framework by following the human information-processing model, introduce a
mutual-reinforcement-based method for incorporating human knowledge about which

  Ocelli",,,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The chiton Acanthopleura granulata uses aragonitic lenses embedded in its
shell to focus light onto photoreceptors. Because aragonite is biaxially
birefringent, the microstructure of the lens greatly impacts the optical
performance. In addition, the chiton lives in the intertidal, so lenses
experience two environments with different refractive indices: air and water.
Using EBSD, we find that the lens is polycrystalline and contains curved grain
boundaries. A combination of large, twinned grains and nanotwins ensure that
the aragonitic <001> axis is consistent across the lens. However, the
orientation of the <001> axis relative to the shell varies between lenses. Ray
tracing simulations predict the optical performance of lenses of various
microstructures in wet and dry environments. Though twinning helps to limit
birefringence-induced aberrations, variations in the orientation of the <001>
axis between lenses lead to variations in focal lengths between lenses and
cause image doubling in some lenses. As such, the birefringence of aragonite
does not help the lens to transmit focused images in both air and water.
