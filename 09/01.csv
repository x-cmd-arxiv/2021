  network","18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, Appendix",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modeling the neuronal processes underlying short-term working memory remains
the focus of many theoretical studies in neuroscience. Here we propose a
mathematical model of spiking neuron network (SNN) demonstrating how a piece of
information can be maintained as a robust activity pattern for several seconds
then completely disappear if no other stimuli come. Such short-term memory
traces are preserved due to the activation of astrocytes accompanying the SNN.
The astrocytes exhibit calcium transients at a time scale of seconds. These
transients further modulate the efficiency of synaptic transmission and, hence,
the firing rate of neighboring neurons at diverse timescales through
gliotransmitter release. We show how such transients continuously encode
frequencies of neuronal discharges and provide robust short-term storage of
analogous information. This kind of short-term memory can keep operative
information for seconds, then completely forget it to avoid overlapping with
forthcoming patterns. The SNN is inter-connected with the astrocytic layer by
local inter-cellular diffusive connections. The astrocytes are activated only
when the neighboring neurons fire quite synchronously, e.g. when an information
pattern is loaded. For illustration, we took greyscale photos of people's faces
where the grey level encoded the level of applied current stimulating the
neurons. The astrocyte feedback modulates (facilitates) synaptic transmission
by varying the frequency of neuronal firing. We show how arbitrary patterns can
be loaded, then stored for a certain interval of time, and retrieved if the
appropriate clue pattern is applied to the input.

focused on the coding properties of individual neurons, recent developments in
recording technologies have resulted in an increasing emphasis on the dynamics
of neural populations. This has given rise to a wide variety of models for
analyzing population activity in relation to experimental variables, but direct
testing of many neural population hypotheses requires intervening in the system
based on current neural state, necessitating models capable of inferring neural
state online. Existing approaches, primarily based on dynamical systems,
require strong parametric assumptions that are easily violated in the
noise-dominated regime and do not scale well to the thousands of data channels
in modern experiments. To address this problem, we propose a method that
combines fast, stable dimensionality reduction with a soft tiling of the
resulting neural manifold, allowing dynamics to be approximated as a
probability flow between tiles. This method can be fit efficiently using online
expectation maximization, scales to tens of thousands of tiles, and outperforms
existing methods when dynamics are noise-dominated or feature multi-modal
transition probabilities. The resulting model can be trained at kiloHertz data
rates, produces accurate approximations of neural dynamics within minutes, and
generates predictions on submillisecond time scales. It retains predictive
performance throughout many time steps into the future and is fast enough to
serve as a component of closed-loop causal experiments.

magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos, which produces
intermittent magnetic field structures, for varying scales of turbulent driving
($l_{\rm f}$) to generate synthetic observations of the polarized emission. We
focus on how the inferred diffuse polarized emission for different $l_{\rm f}$
is affected due to smoothing by a finite telescope resolution. The mean
fractional polarization $\langle p\rangle$ vary as $\langle p \rangle \propto
l_{\rm f}^{1/2}$ with $\langle p \rangle > 20\%$ for $l_{\rm f} \gtrsim
60$\,kpc, at frequencies $\nu > 4\,{\rm GHz}$. Faraday depolarization at $\nu <
3$\,GHz leads to deviation from this relation, and in combination with beam
depolarization, filamentary polarized structures are completely erased,
reducing $\langle p \rangle$ to below 5\% level at $\nu \lesssim1$\,GHz.
Smoothing on scales up to $30$\,kpc reduces $\langle p \rangle$ above $4$\,GHz
by at most a factor of 2 compared to that expected at $1$\,kpc resolution of
the simulations, especially for $l_{\rm f} \gtrsim 100$\,kpc, while at $\nu <

breaking of about one hundred wires (over a total of $\approx 12000$). This

optical and electronic microscopes and on a detailed recording of all breaking
accidents. We present a simple empirical model which relates the number of
broken wires to their exposure time to atmospheric humidity and to their
mechanical tension, which is necessary for mechanical stability in the presence
of electrostatic fields of several kV/cm. Finally we discuss how wire breakings
can be avoided or at least strongly reduced by operating in controlled
atmosphere during the mounting stages of the wires within the drift chamber and
by choosing a $25\,\%$ thicker wire diameter, which has very small effects on
the detector resolution and efficiency and can be obtained by using a safer

and closely related to other solar phenomena like UV bursts or coronal jets.
Our aim is to address the current lack of inverted models and diagnostics of
surges as well as characterizing their plasma properties. We have analyzed
different surges related to UV bursts observed with the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) on 2016 April. The mid- and low-chromosphere of the
surges are examined by getting their representative Mg II h&k line profiles
through the k-means algorithm and performing inversions on them using the STiC
code. We have studied the far-UV spectra focusing on the O IV 1399.8 and 1401.2
\r{A} lines, carrying out density diagnostics to determine the transition
region properties of these ejections. We have also used experiments performed
with the Bifrost code for comparisons. Thanks to k-means, we reduce the number
of Mg II h&k profiles to invert by a factor 43.2. The inversions of the
representative profiles show that the mid- and low-chromosphere of the surges
have temperatures mainly around T $=6$ kK at $ -6.0 \le \log_{10}(\tau) \le
-3.2$. For the electronic number density, $n_e$, and line-of-sight velocity,
$V_{\mathrm{LOS}}$, the most reliable results from the inversions are within $
-6.0 \le \log_{10}(\tau) \le -4.8$, with $n_e$ ranging from $\sim1.6 \times
10^{11}$ up to $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $V_{\mathrm{LOS}}$ of a few km
s$^{-1}$. We find, for the first time, observational evidence of enhanced O IV
emission within the surges, indicating that these phenomena have a considerable
impact on the transition region even in the weakest far-UV lines. The O IV
emitting layers show electron number densities from $2.5\times 10^{10}$ to
$10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. The simulations provide theoretical support in terms of
the topology and of the location of the O IV emission of the surges.

best RGBD trackers are extensions of the state-of-the-art deep RGB trackers.
They are trained with RGB data and the depth channel is used as a sidekick for
subtleties such as occlusion detection. This can be explained by the fact that
there are no sufficiently large RGBD datasets to 1) train deep depth trackers

essential. This work introduces a new RGBD tracking dataset - Depth-Track -
that has twice as many sequences (200) and scene types (40) than in the largest

  We find that different methods for aligning irregularly sampled sparse data

with known properties. For the case of sickle cell disease, we find that three
clusters is a reasonable choice, and these appear to correspond to (1) a low
pain group with occasionally acute pain, (2) a group which experiences moderate
mean pain that fluctuates often from low to high, and (3) a group that
experiences persistent high levels of pain.
  Our results may help physicians and patients better understand and manage
patients' pain levels over time, and we expect that the methods we develop will
apply to a wide range of other data sources in medicine and beyond.

including both unsupervised/supervised information was proposed, and a dynamic

loss and supervised loss at different training stages. We conducted extensive

optically chiral molecules, especially for biomolecules. It is thus of great
importance that these parameters be estimated precisely so that the molecules
with desired functionalities can be designed. In order to surpass the limits of
classical measurements, we need to probe the system with quantum light. We
develop quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) for precision estimates of the
circular dichroism and the optical rotary dispersion for a variety of input
quantum states of light. The Cramer-Rao bounds, for all four chirality
parameters are obtained, from QFIM for (a) single photon input states with a
specific linear polarization and for (b) NOON states having two photons with
both either left polarized or right polarized. The QFIM bounds, using quantum
light, are compared with bounds obtained for classical light beams i.e., beams
in coherent states. Quite generally, both the single photon state and the NOON
state exhibit superior precision in the estimation of absorption and phase
shift in relation to a coherent source of comparable intensity, especially in
the weak absorption regime. In particular, the NOON state naturally offers the
best precision among the three. We compare QFIM bounds with the error
sensitivity bounds, as the latter are relatively easier to measure whereas the
QFIM bounds require full state tomography. We also outline an empirical scheme
for estimating the measurement sensitivities by projective measurements with
single-photon detectors.

Subsequently, a cable crossings repair heuristic is introduced in order to fix

provide ultrashort X-ray pulses with a duration typically in the order of
femtoseconds. Recently, they have approached and entered the attosecond regime,
which holds new promises for single-molecule imaging and studying nonlinear and
ultrafast phenomena such as localized electron dynamics. The technological
evolution of XFELs toward well-controllable light sources for precise metrology
of ultrafast processes has been, however, hampered by the diagnostic
capabilities for characterizing X-ray pulses at the attosecond frontier. In
this regard, the spectroscopic technique of photoelectron angular streaking has
successfully proven how to non-destructively retrieve the exact time-energy
structure of XFEL pulses on a single-shot basis. By using artificial
intelligence techniques, in particular convolutional neural networks, we here
show how this technique can be leveraged from its proof-of-principle stage
toward routine diagnostics even at high-repetition-rate XFELs, thus enhancing
and refining their scientific accessibility in all related disciplines.

than applying the model to sequential log entries directly, as most current

still allowing for directional filtering. The resulting neural architectures
are inherently rotationally invariant. With only a few small filters, they can

significantly more challenging. To tackle this problem, we perform an extensive
experimental study of state-of-art quantization techniques on three diverse GAN
architectures, namely StyleGAN, Self-Attention GAN, and CycleGAN. As a result,
we discovered practical recipes that allowed us to successfully quantize these
models for inference with 4/8-bit weights and 8-bit activations while
preserving the quality of the original full-precision models.

algorithmic effects, and confirmation bias. In this paper, we propose an
automated technique for extracting and characterizing such regions. Starting
with a two-dimensional plot -- e.g., the values of the correlation integral,
calculated using the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm over a range of scales --
we create an ensemble of intervals by considering all possible combinations of
endpoints, generating a distribution of slopes from least-squares fits weighted
by the length of the fitting line and the inverse square of the fit error. The
mode of this distribution gives an estimate of the slope of the scaling region
(if it exists). The endpoints of the intervals that correspond to the mode
provide an estimate for the extent of that region. When there is no scaling
region, the distributions will be wide and the resulting error estimates for
the slope will be large. We demonstrate this method for computations of
dimension and Lyapunov exponent for several dynamical systems, and show that it
can be useful in selecting values for the parameters in time-delay
reconstructions.

EthClipper malware queries a distributed database of pre-mined accounts in

We design and implement a EthClipper malware, which we test on Trezor, Ledger,

which self-propulsion is described by colored noise, to access these inertial

mean-squared displacement and velocity autocorrelation function for several
settings ranging from a free particle to various external influences, like a
linear or harmonic potential and coupling to another particle via a harmonic
spring. Taking into account the particular role of the initial particle
velocity in a nonstationary setup, we observe all dynamical exponents between
zero and four. After the typical intertial time, determined by the particle's
mass, the results inherently revert to the behavior of an overdamped particle
with the exception of the harmonically confined systems, in which the overall
displacement is enhanced by inertia. We further consider an underdamped model
for an active particle with a time-dependent mass, which critically affects the
displacement in the intermediate time-regime. Most strikingly, for a
sufficiently large rate of mass accumulation, the particle's motion is
completely governed by inertial effects as it remains superdiffusive for all

models to perform well by only using a biased subset of the input, without
considering the remainder features. For instance, models are able to make a
classification decision by only using the hypothesis, without learning the true
relationship between it and the premise. These structural biases lead
discriminative models to learn unintended superficial features and to
generalize poorly out of the training distribution. In this work, we
reformulate the NLI task as a generative task, where a model is conditioned on
the biased subset of the input and the label and generates the remaining subset
of the input. We show that by imposing a uniform prior, we obtain a provably
unbiased model. Through synthetic experiments, we find that this approach is
highly robust to large amounts of bias. We then demonstrate empirically on two
types of natural bias that this approach leads to fully unbiased models in
practice. However, we find that generative models are difficult to train and
they generally perform worse than discriminative baselines. We highlight the
difficulty of the generative modeling task in the context of NLI as a cause for
this worse performance. Finally, by fine-tuning the generative model with a
discriminative objective, we reduce the performance gap between the generative
model and the discriminative baseline, while allowing for a small amount of

believed that these marginal Fermi liquids (MFLs) are described by weakly
coupled field theories at low energies. In this Letter, we point out a
possibility in which higher-loop processes qualitatively change the picture
through UV-IR mixing, in which the size of the FS enters as a relevant scale.
The UV-IR mixing effect enhances the coupling at low energies, such that the
basin of attraction for the weakly coupled fixed point of a $(2+1)$-dimensional
MFL shrinks to a measure-zero set in the low-energy limit. This UV-IR mixing is
caused by gapless virtual Cooper pairs that spread over the entire FS through
marginal long-range interactions. Our finding signals a possible breakdown of

Early results reveal a possible gravitationally-caused residual deformation not

$H_0$. In order to obtain an accurate estimate of $H_0$ from a sample of time
delay strong lenses, however, it is necessary to have a very good knowledge of
the mass structure of the lens galaxies. Strong lensing data on their own are
not sufficient to break the degeneracy between $H_0$ and the lens model
parameters, on a single object basis.
  Aims. The goal of this study is to determine whether it is possible to break
the $H_0$-lens structure degeneracy with the statistical combination of a large
sample of time-delay lenses, relying purely on strong lensing data (that is,
with no stellar kinematics information).
  Methods. I simulated a set of 100 lenses with doubly imaged quasars and
related time delay measurements. I fitted these data with a Bayesian
hierarchical method and a flexible model for the lens population, emulating the
lens modelling step.
  Results. The sample of 100 lenses, on its own, provides a measurement of
$H_0$ with $3\%$ precision, but with a $-4\%$ bias. However, the addition of
prior information on the lens structural parameters from a large sample of
lenses with no time delays, such as that considered in Paper I, allows for a
$1\%$-level inference. Moreover, the 100 lenses allow for a $0.03$~dex
calibration of galaxy stellar masses, regardless of the level of prior
knowledge of the Hubble constant.
  Conclusions. Breaking the $H_0$-lens model degeneracy with lensing data alone
is possible, but $1\%$ measurements of $H_0$ require either a number of time
delay lenses much larger than 100, or the knowledge of the structural parameter
distribution of the lens population from a separate sample of lenses.

We focus on haloes of mass $10^{10-14} M_\odot$ from the 50-Mpc (TNG50) and
100-Mpc (TNG100) boxes, and compare them to dark matter-only (DMO) analogues
and other simulations e.g. NIHAO and Eagle. We further quantify the prediction
uncertainty by varying the baryonic feedback models in a series of smaller 25
Mpc $h^{-1}$ boxes. We find that: (i) galaxy formation results in rounder
haloes compared to the DMO simulations, in qualitative agreement with past
hydrodynamic models. Haloes of mass $\approx 2\times 10^{12} M_\odot$ are most
spherical, with an average minor-to-major axis ratio of $\left< s \right>
\approx 0.75$ in the inner halo, an increase of 40 per cent compared to their
DMO counterparts. No significant change in halo shape is found for low-mass
$10^{10} M_\odot$ haloes; (ii) stronger feedback, e.g. increasing galactic wind
speed, reduces the impact of baryons; (iii) the inner halo shape correlates
with the stellar mass fraction, which can explain the dependence of halo shapes
on different feedback models; (iv) the fiducial and weaker feedback models are
most consistent with observational estimates of the Milky Way halo shape. Yet,
at fixed halo mass, very diverse and possibly unrealistic feedback models all
predict inner halo shapes that are closer to one another than to the DMO

statistically distinguish between different baryonic prescriptions due to large

lines and show large diversity as well as different line profiles. After
carefully and consistently performing a series of data reduction tasks

spectroscopic population study of 16 optical/UV TDEs. We report a time lag
between the peaks of the optical light-curves and the peak luminosity of
H$\alpha$ spanning between 7 - 45 days. If interpreted as light-echoes, these
lags correspond to distances of 2 - 12 x 10$^{16}$ cm, one to two orders of
magnitudes larger than the estimated blackbody radii (R$_{\rm BB}$) of the same
TDEs and we discuss the possible origin of this surprisingly large discrepancy.
We also report time lags for the peak luminosity of He I $\lambda$5876 line;
smaller than the ones of H$\alpha$ for H TDEs and similar or larger for N III
Bowen TDEs. We report that N III Bowen TDEs have lower H$\alpha$ velocity
widths compared to the rest of the TDEs in our sample and we also find that a
strong X-ray to optical ratio might imply weakening of the line widths.
Furthermore, we study the evolution of line luminosities and ratios with
respect to their radii (R$_{\rm BB}$) and temperatures (T$_{\rm BB}$). We find
a linear relationship between H$\alpha$ luminosity and the R$_{\rm BB}$ and
potentially an inverse power-law relation with T$_{\rm BB}$ leading to weaker
H$\alpha$ emission for T$_{\rm BB}$ $\geq$ 25000 K. The He II/He I ratio
becomes large at the same temperatures possibly pointing to an ionization
effect. The He II/H$\alpha$ ratio becomes larger as the photospheric radius
recedes, implying a stratified photosphere where Helium lies deeper than
Hydrogen. We suggest that the large diversity of the spectroscopic features
seen in TDEs along with their X-ray properties, can potentially be attributed
to viewing angle effects.

existence of a very large population of low-mass haloes. This population is
absent in models in which the dark matter particle is warm (WDM). These
alternatives can, in principle, be distinguished observationally because halos
along the line-of-sight can perturb galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses.
Furthermore, the WDM particle mass could be deduced because the cut-off in
their halo mass function depends on the mass of the particle. We systematically
explore the detectability of low-mass haloes in WDM models by simulating and
fitting mock lensed images. Contrary to previous studies, we find that halos
are harder to detect when they are either behind or in front of the lens.
Furthermore, we find that the perturbing effect of haloes increases with their
concentration: detectable haloes are systematically high-concentration haloes,
and accounting for the scatter in the mass-concentration relation boosts the
expected number of detections by as much as an order of magnitude. Haloes have
lower concentration for lower particle masses and this further suppresses the
number of detectable haloes beyond the reduction arising from the lower halo
abundances alone. Taking these effects into account can make lensing
constraints on the value of the mass function cut-off at least an order of
magnitude more stringent than previously appreciated.

gating mechanisms to mitigate exploding and vanishing gradients when learning
long-term dependencies. For this reason, LSTMs and other gated RNNs are widely
adopted, being the standard de facto for many sequence modeling tasks. Although
the memory cell inside the LSTM contains essential information, it is not
allowed to influence the gating mechanism directly. In this work, we improve
the gate potential by including information coming from the internal cell
state. The proposed modification, named Working Memory Connection, consists in
adding a learnable nonlinear projection of the cell content into the network
gates. This modification can fit into the classical LSTM gates without any
assumption on the underlying task, being particularly effective when dealing
with longer sequences. Previous research effort in this direction, which goes
back to the early 2000s, could not bring a consistent improvement over vanilla
LSTM. As part of this paper, we identify a key issue tied to previous
connections that heavily limits their effectiveness, hence preventing a
successful integration of the knowledge coming from the internal cell state. We
show through extensive experimental evaluation that Working Memory Connections
constantly improve the performance of LSTMs on a variety of tasks. Numerical
results suggest that the cell state contains useful information that is worth
including in the gate structure.

interval $\Delta t_{\alpha B} \omega_p \sim c/(v_{fl}\sqrt{\alpha_B})$, where
$\alpha_B$ is the magnetic equipartition parameter determined by the non-linear
saturation of the instabilities, $v_{fl}$ is the initial flow speed, and
$\omega_p$ is the plasma frequency. For the $\alpha_B$ measured in our
simulations, $\Delta t_{\alpha B}$ is close to $10 \times$ the instability
growth time. We show that as long as the plasma slab length $L > v_{fl} \Delta
t_{\alpha B}$, the plasma flow is expected to slow down by a factor close to
$1/\sqrt{3}$.

shared his vision regarding nanotechnology in the talk ""There is plenty of room
at the bottom"". Later, towards the end of the 20-th century, the interest in
storage solutions based on DNA molecules was increased as a result of the human
genome project which in turn led to a significant progress in sequencing and
assembly methods. DNA storage enjoys major advantages over the well-established
magnetic and optical storage solutions. As opposed to magnetic solutions, DNA
storage does not require electrical supply to maintain data integrity and is
superior to other storage solutions in both density and durability. Given the
trends in cost decreases of DNA synthesis and sequencing, it is now
acknowledged that within the next 10-15 years DNA storage may become a highly
competitive archiving technology and probably later the main such technology.
With that said, the current implementations of DNA based storage systems are
very limited and are not fully optimized to address the unique pattern of
errors which characterize the synthesis and sequencing processes. In this work,
we propose a robust, efficient and scalable solution to implement DNA-based
storage systems. Our method deploys Deep Neural Networks (DNN) which
reconstruct a sequence of letters based on imperfect cluster of copies
generated by the synthesis and sequencing processes. A tailor-made
Error-Correcting Code (ECC) is utilized to combat patterns of errors which
occur during this process. Since our reconstruction method is adapted to
imperfect clusters, our method overcomes the time bottleneck of the noisy DNA
copies clustering process by allowing the use of a rapid and scalable
pseudo-clustering instead. Our architecture combines between convolutions and
transformers blocks and is trained using synthetic data modelled after real

transverse or longitudinal studies of the fatality counts. However, the
fatality counts depend both on disease clinical severity and transmissibility,
as more infected also lead to more deaths. Moreover, fatality counts (and
related measures such as Case Fatality Rate) are dynamic quantities, as they
appear with a delay to infections, while different geographic regions generally
belong to different points on the epidemics curve. Instead, we use
epidemiological modeling to propose a disease severity measure, which accounts
for the underlying disease dynamics. The measure corresponds to the ratio of
population averaged mortality and recovery rates (m/r). It is independent of
the disease transmission dynamics (i.e., the basic reproduction number) and has
a direct mechanistic interpretation. We use this measure to assess demographic,
medical, meteorological and environmental factors associated with the disease
severity. For this, we employ an ecological regression study design and analyze
different US states during the first disease outbreak. Principal Component
Analysis, followed by univariate and multivariate analyses based on machine
learning techniques, is used for selecting important predictors. Without using
prior knowledge from clinical studies, we recover significant predictors known
to influence disease severity, in particular age, chronic diseases, and racial
factors. Additionally, we identify long-term pollution exposure and population
density as not widely recognized (though for the pollution previously
hypothesized) predictors of the disease severity. Overall, the proposed measure
is useful for inferring severity determinants of COVID-19 and other infectious
diseases, and the obtained results may aid a better understanding of COVID-19

sources of CP violation in baryogenesis models with quasi-degenerate neutrinos.
In this approach an expansion of the resummed propagator around the poles is
plugged into a quantum field theory model of neutrino oscillations and a source
term for the time evolution of the lepton asymmetry is built directly from the
probabilities of lepton number violating processes involving only stable
particles. This allows for a transparent consideration of unitarity
requirements. The source term has contributions that can be identified with CP
violation from mixing, oscillations and interference between both. For the
highly degenerate case, i.e. when the mass difference between two neutrinos is
similar or smaller than their decay widths, we find that in general the mixing
and oscillation terms contribute with opposite signs to the generation of
lepton asymmetry and the contribution of the interference term is typically
very relevant and crucial to ensure unitarity is satisfied. Moreover, the
expressions we obtain are finite in the double degenerate limit of equal masses
and couplings. The calculations are done in a simple scalar toy model.

across the superconducting transition of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using resonant

contrast with what is found in both conventional ($s$-wave) and

increase in sound attenuation for compressional strains, and not for shear

distinct, accidentally-degenerate superconducting order parameters that are not

unravelling the free energy of prototypical ions adsorbed at the aqueous

an analytical framework based on Stokes equation and a modified
Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We observed concentration-dependent scaling laws,
together with dramatic differences in osmotic transport between the two
interfaces, including diffusio-osmotic flow and current reversal on hBN, but
not on graphene. We could rationalize the results for the three osmotic

ferromagnetic coupling of Mn-depleted SLs with Mn-doped QLs, seen in

coefficient model (STVC) is an important tool for discovering nonstationary and
interpretable response-covariate associations over both space and time.
However, it is difficult to apply STVC for large-scale spatiotemporal analyses
due to its high computational cost. To address this challenge, we summarize the
spatiotemporally varying coefficients using a third-order tensor structure and
propose to reformulate the spatiotemporally varying coefficient model as a
special low-rank tensor regression problem. The low-rank decomposition can
effectively model the global patterns of the large data sets with a
substantially reduced number of parameters. To further incorporate the local
spatiotemporal dependencies, we use Gaussian process (GP) priors on the spatial
and temporal factor matrices. We refer to the overall framework as Bayesian
Kernelized Tensor Regression (BKTR). For model inference, we develop an
efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which uses Gibbs sampling
to update factor matrices and slice sampling to update kernel hyperparameters.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets,
and our results confirm the superior performance and efficiency of BKTR for
model estimation and parameter inference.

and the number of neutrino species, and its abundance serves as a sensitive
test for the conditions in the early universe. The comparison of observed
deuterium abundances with predicted ones requires reliable knowledge of the
relevant thermonuclear reaction rates, and their corresponding uncertainties.
Recent observations reported the primordial deuterium abundance with percent
accuracy, but some theoretical predictions based on BBN are at tension with the

systematic literature reviews (SLR) as a means to summarize evidence from
different studies and bring to light the state of the art of a given research

punctual solutions for some of them. However, two main problems still remain:
the high time-/effort-consumption nature of SLR and the lack of an effective
impact of SLR results in the industry, as initially expected for SLR. Aims: The
main goal of this paper is to introduce a new view - which we name
Sustainability of SLR - on how to deal with SLR aiming at reducing those
problems. Method: We analyzed six reference studies published in the last
decade to identify, group, and analyze the SLR problems and their
interconnections. Based on such analysis, we proposed the view of
Sustainability of SLR that intends to address these problems. Results: The
proposed view encompasses three dimensions (social, economic, and technical)
that could become SLR more sustainable in the sense that the four major
problems and 31 barriers (i.e., possible causes for those problems) that we
identified could be mitigated. Conclusions: The view of Sustainability of SLR
intends to change the researchers' mindset to mitigate the inherent SLR
problems and, as a consequence, achieve sustainable SLR, i.e., those that
consume less time/effort to be conducted and updated with useful results for
the industry.

rapidly compute highly eccentric self-forced inspirals for the first time. Upon
evaluating our approximate NIT results via comparison with full self-force
inspirals, we couple our accurate and streamlined inspiral data to potential
waveform generation schemes. We find that, although high eccentricity strains
the NIT method, NIT inspirals are consistent with full self-force inspirals for
EMRIs. However, our NIT implementation (at 1st post-adiabatic order) is not
able to achieve LISA-motivated accuracy goals for highly eccentric IMRIs. Our
most sophisticated waveforms are devised through a new technique that
efficiently connects NIT orbital parameters to Teukolsky amplitudes and phases.
We compare these sophisticated Teukolsky waveforms to those with synthesized
(summing over harmonics) amplitudes based on a kludge. We find that, assuming
identical worldlines (so that dephasing is negligible), kludge waveforms
compare favorably to Teukolsky waveforms for non-spinning bodies.

and extend the results of earlier contrast studies taking advantage of the high
resolution data delivered by the balloon-borne solar observatory Sunrise during
its science flights in 2009 and 2013. In addition to the high quality of the
Sunrise data, access to the UV wavelengths makes these data unique in this kind
of study. In the first two parts of this thesis, we find that the contrast
variation with the magnetic field strength agrees qualitatively with radiative
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the quiet Sun. In particular, at a continuum
wavelength around 500\,nm, the contrast does not decrease at large field
strengths, indicative of having resolved these features. In addition, the
contrast at all wavelengths in the quiet-Sun network is found to be higher than
in solar plage, and the difference decreases with atmospheric height in
accordance with empirical models of flux tubes. In the last part of this

temperatures typically higher than 2000K. Atmospheric studies of these planets
have shown that their transmission spectra are rich in metal lines, with some
of these metals being ionised due to the extreme temperatures. Here, we use two
transit observations of WASP-76b obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph to
study the atmosphere of this planet using high-resolution transmission
spectroscopy. Taking advantage of the two channels and the coverage of the red
and near-infrared wavelength ranges by CARMENES, we focus our analysis on the
study of the CaII infrared triplet (IRT) at 8500A and the HeI triplet at
10830A. We present the discovery of the CaII IRT at 7$\sigma$ in the atmosphere
of WASP-76b using the cross-correlation technique, which is consistent with
previous detections of the CaII H&K lines in the same planet, and with the
atmospheric studies of other ultra-hot Jupiters reported to date. The low mass
density of the planet, and our calculations of the XUV irradiation received by
the exoplanet, show that this planet is a potential candidate to have a HeI
evaporating envelope and, therefore, we performed further investigations
focussed on this aspect. The transmission spectrum around the HeI triplet shows
a broad and red-shifted absorption signal in both transit observations.
However, due to the strong telluric contamination around the HeI lines and the
relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, we are not able to
unambiguously conclude if the absorption is due to the presence of helium in
the atmosphere of WASP-76b, and we consider the result to be only an upper
limit. Finally, we revisit the transmission spectrum around other lines such as
NaI, LiI, H$\alpha$, and KI. The upper limits reported here for these lines are
consistent with previous studies.

a data-driven reduced order modeling method that capitalizes on this fact by
finding the coordinates of this manifold and finding an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) describing the dynamics in this coordinate system. The manifold
coordinates are discovered using an undercomplete autoencoder -- a neural
network (NN) that reduces then expands dimension. Then the ODE, in these

these methods only require snapshots of data to learn a model, and the data can
be widely and/or unevenly spaced. We apply this framework to the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky for different domain sizes that exhibit chaotic dynamics.
With this system, we find that dimension reduction improves performance
relative to predictions in the ambient space, where artifacts arise. Then, with
the low-dimensional model, we vary the training data spacing and find excellent
short- and long-time statistical recreation of the true dynamics for widely

employ substantially more queries with substantially fewer known relevant items
per query. Given the sparsity of these relevance labels, the MS MARCO
leaderboards track improvements with mean reciprocal rank (MRR). In essence, a
relevant item is treated as the ""right answer"", with rankers scored on their
ability to place this item high in the ranking. In working with these sparse
labels, we have observed that the top items returned by a ranker often appear
superior to judged relevant items. To test this observation, we employed
crowdsourced workers to make preference judgments between the top item returned
by a modern neural ranking stack and a judged relevant item. The results
support our observation. If we imagine a perfect ranker under MRR, with a score
of 1 on all queries, our preference judgments indicate that a searcher would
prefer the top result from a modern neural ranking stack more frequently than
the top result from the imaginary perfect ranker, making our neural ranker
""better than perfect"". To understand the implications for the leaderboard, we
pooled the top document from available runs near the top of the passage ranking
leaderboard for over 500 queries. We employed crowdsourced workers to make
preference judgments over these pools and re-evaluated the runs. Our results
support our concerns that current MS MARCO datasets may no longer be able to
recognize genuine improvements in rankers. In future, if rankers are measured
against a single ""right answer"", this answer should be the best answer or most
preferred answer, and maintained with ongoing judgments.

maps the asymptotic region of $AdS_3$ to the region $\phi\to\infty$, where the
twist interaction in the $CFT_2$ turns off. The $AdS_3$ backgrounds in question
have $R_{AdS}<\ell_s$, and so lie on the string side of the string/black hole

infrared regulator also explicitly breaks these symmetries so the edge mode in
the regulated theory is really a $d$-dimensional pseudo-Goldstone boson.
Symmetry considerations determine the leading terms in the effective action,
whose coefficients are controlled by the infrared cutoff. Computations in this
model reproduce the abelian infrared divergences in $d=2$, and capture the
re-summed (infrared finite) soft exchange in higher dimensions. The model also
reproduces the leading soft theorems in gauge and gravitational theories in all

Goldstone mode that has local $d$-dimensional dynamics: the effective action
expressed in terms of the Goldstone mode is non-local for $d>2$. We also

also studied the difference character embeddings make in adding them to the

understanding of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (BHs).
However, at high redshifts ($z>3$), X-ray observations report BHADs
significantly ($\sim 10$ times) lower than those predicted by cosmological
simulations. It is therefore paramount to constrain the high-$z$ BHAD using
independent methods other than direct X-ray detections. The recently
established relation between star formation rate and BH accretion rate among
bulge-dominated galaxies provides such a chance, as it enables an estimate of
the BHAD from the star-formation histories (SFHs) of lower-redshift objects.
Using the CANDELS Lyman-$\alpha$ Emission At Reionization (CLEAR) survey, we
model the SFHs for a sample of 108 bulge-dominated galaxies at $z=$0.7-1.5, and
further estimate the BHAD contributed by their high-$z$ progenitors. The
predicted BHAD at $z\approx 4$-5 is consistent with the simulation-predicted
values, but higher than the X-ray measurements (by $\approx$3-10 times at
$z=$4-5). Our result suggests that the current X-ray surveys could be missing
many heavily obscured Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high
redshifts. However, this BHAD estimation assumes that the high-$z$ progenitors
of our $z=$0.7-1.5 sample remain bulge-dominated where star formation is
correlated with BH cold-gas accretion. Alternatively, our prediction could
signify a stark decline in the fraction of bulges in high-$z$ galaxies (with an
associated drop in BH accretion). JWST and Origins will resolve the discrepancy
between our predicted BHAD and the X-ray results by constraining Compton-thick
AGN and bulge evolution at high redshifts.

development life cycle, essential to the success of large-scale software
projects. When multiple developers make concurrent changes around the same
lines of code, a merge conflict may occur. Such conflicts stall pull requests
and continuous integration pipelines for hours to several days, seriously
hurting developer productivity. To address this problem, we introduce
MergeBERT, a novel neural program merge framework based on token-level
three-way differencing and a transformer encoder model. By exploiting the
restricted nature of merge conflict resolutions, we reformulate the task of
generating the resolution sequence as a classification task over a set of
primitive merge patterns extracted from real-world merge commit data. Our model
achieves 63-68% accuracy for merge resolution synthesis, yielding nearly a 3x
performance improvement over existing semi-structured, and 2x improvement over
neural program merge tools. Finally, we demonstrate that MergeBERT is
sufficiently flexible to work with source code files in Java, JavaScript,
TypeScript, and C# programming languages. To measure the practical use of
MergeBERT, we conduct a user study to evaluate MergeBERT suggestions with 25
developers from large OSS projects on 122 real-world conflicts they
encountered. Results suggest that in practice, MergeBERT resolutions would be
accepted at a higher rate than estimated by automatic metrics for precision and
accuracy. Additionally, we use participant feedback to identify future avenues
for improvement of MergeBERT.

noisy-intermediate-scale quantum device towards fault-tolerant quantum
computing. However, most of the error corrections ever demonstrated rely on
post-selection of events or post-correction of states, based on measurement
results repeatedly recorded during circuit execution. On the other hand,
real-time error correction is supposed to be performed through classical
feedforward of the measurement results to data qubits. It provides unavoidable
latency from conditional electronics that would limit the scalability of the
next-generation quantum processors. Here we propose a new approach to real-time
error correction that is free from measurement and realized by using
multi-controlled gates based on higher-dimensional state space. Specifically,
we provide a series of novel decompositions of a Toffoli gate by using the
lowest three energy levels of a transmon that significantly reduce the number
of two-qubit gates and discuss their essential features, such as extendability
to an arbitrary number of control qubits, the necessity of exclusively
controlled NOT gates, and usefulness of their incomplete variants. Combined
with the recently demonstrated schemes of fast two-qubit gates and
all-microwave qubit reset, it would substantially shorten the time required for
error correction and resetting ancilla qubits compared to a measurement-based
approach and provide an error correction rate of $\gtrsim1$~MHz with high
accuracy for three-qubit bit- and phase-flip errors.

the type of computations involved in neural networks. In this work, we explore
ways to improve quantized CNNs using PDE-based perspective and analysis. First,
we harness the total variation (TV) approach to apply edge-aware smoothing to
the feature maps throughout the network. This aims to reduce outliers in the
distribution of values and promote piece-wise constant maps, which are more
suitable for quantization. Secondly, we consider symmetric and stable variants
of common CNNs for image classification, and Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) for graph node-classification. We demonstrate through several
experiments that the property of forward stability preserves the action of a
network under different quantization rates. As a result, stable quantized
networks behave similarly to their non-quantized counterparts even though they
rely on fewer parameters. We also find that at times, stability even aids in
improving accuracy. These properties are of particular interest for sensitive,
resource-constrained, low-power or real-time applications like autonomous
driving.

consideration, and I have found that slender c-axis ice needles provide an
exceptionally good starting point for this series of investigations. A sharp
needle tip exposes a single basal surface that often simplifies subsequent
morphological development, and the absence of a nearby substrate allows for the
exploration of a broad range of supersaturations with well-controlled boundary

to graph and relational data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many
applications. GNNs compute node representations by taking into account the
topology of the node's ego-network and the features of the ego-network's nodes.
When the nodes do not have high-quality features, GNNs learn an embedding layer
to compute node embeddings and use them as input features. However, the size of
the embedding layer is linear to the product of the number of nodes in the
graph and the dimensionality of the embedding and does not scale to big data
and graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes. To reduce the memory associated
with this embedding layer, hashing-based approaches, commonly used in
applications like NLP and recommender systems, can potentially be used.
However, a direct application of these ideas fails to exploit the fact that in
many real-world graphs, nodes that are topologically close will tend to be
related to each other (homophily) and as such their representations will be
similar.
  In this work, we present approaches that take advantage of the nodes'
position in the graph to dramatically reduce the memory required, with minimal
if any degradation in the quality of the resulting GNN model. Our approaches
decompose a node's embedding into two components: a position-specific component
and a node-specific component. The position-specific component models homophily
and the node-specific component models the node-to-node variation. Extensive
experiments using different datasets and GNN models show that our methods are
able to reduce the memory requirements by 88% to 97% while achieving, in nearly
all cases, better classification accuracy than other competing approaches,
including the full embeddings.

both accelerometer and audio signals.
  The acceleration signals are captured by a smartphone firmly attached to the
patient's bed, using its integrated accelerometer.
  The audio signals are captured simultaneously by the same smartphone using an
external microphone.
  We have compiled a manually-annotated dataset containing such
simultaneously-captured acceleration and audio signals for approximately 6000
cough and 68000 non-cough events from 14 adult male patients in a tuberculosis
clinic.
  LR, SVM and MLP are evaluated as baseline classifiers and compared with deep
architectures such as CNN, LSTM, and Resnet50 using a leave-one-out
cross-validation scheme.
  We find that the studied classifiers can use either acceleration or audio
signals to distinguish between coughing and other activities including
sneezing, throat-clearing, and movement on the bed with high accuracy.
  However, in all cases, the deep neural networks outperform the shallow
classifiers by a clear margin and the Resnet50 offers the best performance by
achieving an AUC exceeding 0.98 and 0.99 for acceleration and audio signals
respectively.
  While audio-based classification consistently offers a better performance
than acceleration-based classification, we observe that the difference is very
small for the best systems.
  Since the acceleration signal requires less processing power, and since the
need to record audio is sidestepped and thus privacy is inherently secured, and
since the recording device is attached to the bed and not worn, an
accelerometer-based highly accurate non-invasive cough detector may represent a
more convenient and readily accepted method in long-term cough monitoring.

process characterizing neuronal activity across organisms, the dynamics of
information in online social media is far less understood. Statistical laws of
information avalanches are found in previous studies to be not robust across
systems, and radically different processes are used to represent plausible
driving mechanisms for information propagation. Here, we analyze almost 1
billion time-stamped events collected from a multitude of online platforms --
including Telegram, Twitter and Weibo -- over observation windows longer than
10 years to show that the propagation of information in social media is a
universal and critical process. Universality arises from the observation of
identical macroscopic patterns across platforms, irrespective of the details of
the specific system at hand. Critical behavior is deduced from the power-law
distributions, and corresponding hyperscaling relations, characterizing size
and duration of avalanches of information. Neuronal activity may be modeled as
a simple contagion process, where only a single exposure to activity may be
sufficient for its diffusion. On the contrary, statistical testing on our data
indicates that a mixture of simple and complex contagion, where involvement of
an individual requires exposure from multiple acquaintances, characterizes the
propagation of information in social media. We show that the complexity of the
process is correlated with the semantic content of the information that is
propagated. Conversational topics about music, movies and TV shows tend to
propagate as simple contagion processes, whereas controversial discussions on

However, the occurrence of virulent biotypes can alter plant physiology and
impair the use of this management strategy. Soybean aphids can alter soybean
physiology primarily by two mechanisms, feeding facilitation and the obviation
of resistance, favoring subsequent colonization by additional conspecifics. We
developed a non-local, differential equation population model, to explore the

virulent and avirulent aphids. We then use demographic parameters from
laboratory experiments to perform numerical simulations via the model. These
simulations successfully mimic various aphid dynamics observed in the field.
Our model showed an increase in colonization of virulent aphids increases the
likelihood that aphid-resistance is suppressed, subsequently increasing the
survival of avirulent aphids, producing an indirect, positive interaction
between the biotypes. These results suggest the potential for a ""within plant""

new large-scale dataset, FinQA, with Question-Answering pairs over Financial
reports, written by financial experts. We also annotate the gold reasoning
programs to ensure full explainability. We further introduce baselines and
conduct comprehensive experiments in our dataset. The results demonstrate that
popular, large, pre-trained models fall far short of expert humans in acquiring
finance knowledge and in complex multi-step numerical reasoning on that
knowledge. Our dataset -- the first of its kind -- should therefore enable
significant, new community research into complex application domains. The

  Cell Lineage Model","to be published in Physical Review E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.104.034405",,"q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Identifying the mechanism of intercellular feedback regulation is critical
for the basic understanding of tissue growth control in organisms. In this
paper, we analyze a tissue growth model consisting of a single lineage of two
cell types regulated by negative feedback signalling molecules that undergo
spatial diffusion. By deriving the fixed points for the uniform steady states
and carrying out linear stability analysis, phase diagrams are obtained
analytically for arbitrary parameters of the model. Two different generic
growth modes are found: blow-up growth and final-state controlled growth which
are governed by the non-trivial fixed point and the trivial fixed point
respectively, and can be sensitively switched by varying the negative feedback
regulation on the proliferation of the stem cells. Analytic expressions for the
characteristic time scales for these two growth modes are also derived.
Remarkably, the trivial and non-trivial uniform steady states can coexist and a
sharp transition occurs in the bistable regime as the relevant parameters are
varied. Furthermore, the bi-stable growth properties allows for the external
control to switch between these two growth modes. In addition, the condition
for an early accelerated growth followed by a retarded growth can be derived.
These analytical results are further verified by numerical simulations and
provide insights on the growth behavior of the tissue. Our results are also
discussed in the light of possible realistic biological experiments and tissue
growth control strategy. Furthermore, by external feedback control of the
concentration of regulatory molecules, it is possible to achieve a desired
growth mode, as demonstrated with an analysis of boosted growth, catch-up
growth and the design for the target of a linear growth dynamic.

adversarial noises. Most of the existing works focus on learning local visible
noises in an adversarial ""patch"" fashion. However, the 2D patch attached to a
3D object tends to suffer from an inevitable reduction in attack performance as
the viewpoint changes. To remedy this issue, this work proposes the Coated
Adversarial Camouflage (CAC) to attack the detectors in arbitrary viewpoints.
Unlike the patch trained in the 2D space, our camouflage generated by a
conceptually different training framework consists of 3D rendering and dense
proposals attack. Specifically, we make the camouflage perform 3D spatial
transformations according to the pose changes of the object. Based on the
multi-view rendering results, the top-n proposals of the region proposal
network are fixed, and all the classifications in the fixed dense proposals are
attacked simultaneously to output errors. In addition, we build a virtual 3D
scene to fairly and reproducibly evaluate different attacks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAC over the existing attacks, and
it shows impressive performance both in the virtual scene and the real world.
This poses a potential threat to the security-critical computer vision systems.

from the polynomial approximation of activation functions by using theories of

popularity recently to satisfy the ever-increasing requirements of indoor
Location-based Services (LBS). In this context, Inertial Measurement Unit
(IMU)-based localization is of interest as it provides a scalable solution
independent of any proprietary sensors/modules. Existing IMU-based
methodologies, however, are mainly developed based on statistical heading and
step length estimation techniques that suffer from cumulative error issues and
have extensive computational time requirements limiting their application for
real-time indoor positioning. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose
the Online Dynamic Window (ODW)-assisted two-stage Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) localization framework. Three ODWs are proposed, where the first model
uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-inspired Dynamic Window (DW) approach,
which significantly reduces the required computational time. The second
framework is developed based on a Signal Processing Dynamic Windowing (SP-DW)
approach to further reduce the required processing time of the two-stage
LSTM-based model. The third ODW, referred to as the SP-NLP, combines the first
two windowing mechanisms to further improve the overall achieved accuracy.
Compared to the traditional LSTM-based positioning approaches, which suffer
from either high tensor computation requirements or low accuracy, the proposed
ODW-assisted models can perform indoor localization in a near-real time fashion
with high accuracy. Performances of the proposed ODW-assisted models are
evaluated based on a real Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) dataset. The results
illustrate potentials of the proposed ODW-assisted techniques in achieving high
classification accuracy with significantly reduced computational time, making
them applicable for near real-time implementations.

local violation of $\cal P$ and $\cal CP$ symmetries of the strong interaction
amidst a strong electro-magnetic field generated in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. Experimental manifestation of the CME involves a separation of
positively and negatively charged hadrons along the direction of the magnetic
field. Previous measurements of the CME-sensitive charge-separation observables
remain inconclusive because of large background contributions. In order to
better control the influence of signal and backgrounds, the STAR Collaboration
performed a blind analysis of a large data sample of approximately 3.8 billion
isobar collisions of $^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and
$^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. Prior to the
blind analysis, the CME signatures are predefined as a significant excess of
the CME-sensitive observables in Ru+Ru collisions over those in Zr+Zr
collisions, owing to a larger magnetic field in the former. A precision down to
0.4% is achieved, as anticipated, in the relative magnitudes of the pertinent
observables between the two isobar systems. Observed differences in the
multiplicity and flow harmonics at the matching centrality indicate that the
magnitude of the CME background is different between the two species. No CME
signature that satisfies the predefined criteria has been observed in isobar
collisions in this blind analysis.

counter phishing attacks. Although much effort has been investigated in 2FA,
most 2FA systems are still vulnerable to carefully designed phishing attacks,
and some even request special hardware, which limits their wide deployment.
Recently, real-time phishing (RTP) has made the situation even worse because an
adversary can effortlessly establish a phishing website replicating a target
website without any background of the web page design technique. Traditional
2FA can be easily bypassed by such RTP attacks. In this work, we propose a
novel 2FA system to counter RTP attacks. The main idea is to request a user to
take a photo of the web browser with the domain name in the address bar as the
2nd authentication factor. The web server side extracts the domain name
information based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and then determines
if the user is visiting this website or a fake one, thus defeating the RTP
attacks where an adversary must set up a fake website with a different domain.
We prototyped our system and evaluated its performance in various environments.
The results showed that PhotoAuth is an effective technique with good
scalability. We also showed that compared to other 2FA systems, PhotoAuth has
several advantages, especially no special hardware or software support is
needed on the client side except a phone, making it readily deployable.

represent events (e.g., words) as subspaces. Then we employ a density matrix to
encapsulate all the information over these subspaces and use density matrices
to measure the divergence between query and candidate answers for finding
top-\textit{k} the most relevant results. In this process, we propose using
pattern mining to identify compounds for improving accuracy and using
dimensionality reduction for reducing complexity. Finally, empirical
experiments demonstrate the performance superiority of our approaches over the
state-of-the-art approaches.

this demonstration, we present a novel reinforcement learning-based tool called
MORTAL. Specifically, given multi-model data containing different data models
and a set of queries, it could automatically design a relational schema to
store these data while having a great query performance. To demonstrate it
clearly, we are centered around the following modules: generating initial state
based on loaded multi-model data, influencing learning process by setting
parameters, controlling generated relational schema through providing semantic
constraints, improving the query performance of relational schema by specifying
queries, and a highly interactive interface for showing query performance and
storage consumption when users adjust the generated relational schema.

whose structural or attributed patterns deviate significantly from the majority

neglect the relation structure information among data points and therefore

propose an end-to-end model of Deep Dual Support Vector Data description based
Autoencoder (Dual-SVDAE) for anomaly detection on attributed networks, which
considers both the structure and attribute for attributed networks.
Specifically, Dual-SVDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute
autoencoder to learn the latent representation of the node in the structure
space and attribute space respectively. Then, a dual-hypersphere learning
mechanism is imposed on them to learn two hyperspheres of normal nodes from the
structure and attribute perspectives respectively. Moreover, to achieve joint
learning between the structure and attribute of the network, we fuse the
structure embedding and attribute embedding as the final input of the feature
decoder to generate the node attribute. Finally, abnormal nodes can be detected
by measuring the distance of nodes to the learned center of each hypersphere in
the latent structure space and attribute space respectively. Extensive
experiments on the real-world attributed networks show that Dual-SVDAE
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

in the field of databases. To address this problem, researchers have proposed
multi-model databases to support multiple data models in a uniform platform
with a single unified query language. However, since relational databases are
predominant in the current market, it is expensive to replace them with others.
Besides, due to the theories and technologies of RDBMSs having been enhanced
over decades, it is hard to use few years to develop a multi-model database
that can be compared with existing RDBMSs in handling security, query
optimization, transaction management, etc. In this paper, we reconsider
employing relational databases to store and query multi-model data.
Unfortunately, the mismatch between the complexity of multi-model data
structure and the simplicity of flat relational tables makes this difficult.
Against this challenge, we utilize the reinforcement learning (RL) method to
learn a relational schema by interacting with an RDBMS. Instead of using the
classic Q-learning algorithm, we propose a variant Q-learning algorithm, called
\textit{Double Q-tables}, to reduce the dimension of the original Q-table and
improve learning efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach could
learn a relational schema outperforming the existing multi-model storage schema

using the relationship between extinction, which is proportional to $E(B-V)$,
and the equivalent width (EW) of the interstellar Na I D absorption lines. When
measuring [Na/Fe], we also considered corrections for non-local thermodynamic

low-resolution spectra is better than 0.3 dex for stars with [Fe/H] $>$ $-$3.0.

that of typical disk and halo stars. As there is a high fraction of
carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars among the Na-extreme stars, they may have a
non-GC origin, perhaps due to mass-transfer events from evolved binary

were collected to measure LRTC, including the averaged correlation,
anti-correlation, the ratio of correlation and anticorrelation, the mean
coherent and incoherent duration, and the ratio between the coherent and
incoherent time. TCM was first evaluated with simulations and then with the
large Human Connectome Project data. Evaluation results showed that TCM metrics
can successfully differentiate signals with different temporal coherence
regardless of the parameters used to reconstruct the phase space. In human
brain, TCM metrics except the ratio of the coherent/incoherent time showed high
test-retest reproducibility; TCM metrics are related to age, sex, and total
cognitive scores. In summary, TCM provides a first-of-its-kind tool to assess
LRTC and the imbalance between coherence and incoherence; TCM properties are

this assumption is unrealistic because these devices usually have varying
sampling rates and different system configurations. In addition, the underlying
distribution of the device data can change dynamically over time, which is
known as concept drift. Concept drift makes the learning process complicated
because of the inconsistency between existing and upcoming data. Traditional
concept drift handling techniques such as chunk based and ensemble
learning-based methods are not suitable in the federated learning frameworks
due to the heterogeneity of local devices. We propose a novel approach,
FedConD, to detect and deal with the concept drift on local devices and
minimize the effect on the performance of models in asynchronous FL. The drift
detection strategy is based on an adaptive mechanism which uses the historical
performance of the local models. The drift adaptation is realized by adjusting
the regularization parameter of objective function on each local device.
Additionally, we design a communication strategy on the server side to select
local updates in a prudent fashion and speed up model convergence. Experimental
evaluations on three evolving data streams and two image datasets show that

of arrival (DOA) measurement has been made a real renaissance due to the
high-resolution achieved. Thus, there is no doubt about DOA estimation using
massive MIMO. The purpose of this paper is to describe its basic principles and
key techniques, to present the performance analysis, and to appreciate its
engineering applications. It is anticipated that there are still many
challenges in DOA estimation using massive receive MIMO, such as high circuit
cost, high energy consumption and high complexity of the algorithm
implementation. New researches and breakthroughs are illustrated to deal with
those problems. Then, a new architecture, hybrid analog and digital (HAD)
massive receive MIMO with low-resolution ADCs, is presented to strike a good
balance among circuit cost, complexity and performance. Then, a novel
three-dimensional (3D) angle of arrival (AOA) localization method based on
geometrical center is proposed to compute the position of a passive emitter
using single base station equipped with an ultra-massive MIMO system. And, it
can achieve the Cramer-Rao low bound (CRLB). Here, the performance loss is also
analyzed to quantify the minimum number of bits. DOA estimation will play a key
role in lots of applications, such as directional modulation, beamforming
tracking and alignment for 5G/6G.

  method based on ERA method",,,"10.1093/mnras/stac2166",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weak gravitational lensing flexions are a kind of weak lensing distortion
which are defined as the spin 1 and spin 3 combinations of the third order
derivatives of gravitational lensing potential. Since the shear has spin 2
combination of the second order derivative, the flexion signal gives a partly
independent information from shear signal and is more sensitive to the local
mass distribution than shear signal. Thus its measurement is expected to play
important roles in observational cosmology. However, since the weakness of the
flexion signal as well as the complicatedness of its intrinsic noise made its
accurate observation very difficult. We propose a new method of measuring the
flexion signal using ERA method which is a method to measure weak lensing shear
without any approximation. We find two particular combinations of the flexions
which provide the quantities with only lensing information and free of
intrinsic noise when taken average. It is confirmed by simple numerical
simulation that the statistical average of these combinations do not in fact
depend on the strength of the intrinsic distortion.

in exoplanetary atmospheres. For instance, in 2020, Ehrenreich et al. reported
transmission spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph yielding an anomalously
large Doppler blueshift from the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b. Interpretations of
these observations invoke toy model depictions of gas-phase iron condensation
in lower-temperature regions of the planet's atmosphere. In this work, we
forward model the atmosphere of WASP-76b with double-gray general circulation
models (GCMs) and ray-striking radiative transfer to diagnose the planet's
high-resolution transmission spectrum. We confirm that a physical mechanism
driving strong east-west asymmetries across the terminator must exist to
reproduce large Doppler blueshifts in WASP-76b's transmission spectrum. We
identify low atmospheric drag and a deep radiative-convective boundary as
necessary components of our GCM to produce this asymmetry (the latter is
consistent with existing Spitzer phase curves). However, we cannot reproduce
either the magnitude or the time-dependence of the WASP-76b Doppler signature
with gas-phase iron condensation alone. Instead, we find that high-altitude,
optically thick clouds composed of $\rm Al_2O_3$, Fe, or $\rm Mg_2SiO_4$
provide reasonable fits to the Ehrenreich et al. observations -- with marginal
contributions from condensation. This fit is further improved by allowing a
small orbital eccentricity ($e \approx 0.017$), consistent with prior WASP-76b
orbital constraints. We additionally validate our forward-modeled spectra by
reproducing lines of nearly all species detected in WASP-76b by Tabernero et
al. 2021. Our procedure's success in diagnosing phase-resolved Doppler shifts
demonstrates the benefits of physical, self-consistent, three-dimensional

cooperative edge inference, where a group of distributed low-end edge devices
transmit the extracted features of local samples to a powerful edge server for

capability of a single device, it substantially increases the communication
overhead and may incur excessive latency. To enable low-latency cooperative
inference, we propose a learning-based communication scheme that optimizes
local feature extraction and distributed feature encoding in a task-oriented
manner, i.e., to remove data redundancy and transmit information that is
essential for the downstream inference task rather than reconstructing the data
samples at the edge server. Specifically, we leverage an information bottleneck
(IB) principle to extract the task-relevant feature at each edge device and
adopt a distributed information bottleneck (DIB) framework to formalize a
single-letter characterization of the optimal rate-relevance tradeoff for
distributed feature encoding. To admit flexible control of the communication
overhead, we extend the DIB framework to a distributed deterministic
information bottleneck (DDIB) objective that explicitly incorporates the
representational costs of the encoded features. As the IB-based objectives are
computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional data, we adopt variational
approximations to make the optimization problems tractable. To compensate the
potential performance loss due to the variational approximations, we also
develop a selective retransmission (SR) mechanism to identify the redundancy in
the encoded features of multiple edge devices to attain additional
communication overhead reduction. Extensive experiments evidence that the

to improve the performance of classifiers, especially in low-resource
scenarios. Whilst lots of creative text augmentation methods have been
designed, they augment the text in a non-selective manner, which means the less
important or noisy words have the same chances to be augmented as the
informative words, and thereby limits the performance of augmentation. In this
work, we systematically summarize three kinds of role keywords, which have
different functions for text classification, and design effective methods to
extract them from the text. Based on these extracted role keywords, we propose
STA (Selective Text Augmentation) to selectively augment the text, where the
informative, class-indicating words are emphasized but the irrelevant or noisy
words are diminished. Extensive experiments on four English and Chinese text

outperform the non-selective text augmentation methods.

trying to automate many components of the pipeline. However, one key component
of the pipeline--problem definition--is still left mostly unexplored in terms
of automation. Usually, it requires extensive efforts from domain experts to
identify, define and formulate important problems in an area. However,
automatically discovering research or application problems for an area is
beneficial since it helps to identify valid and potentially important problems
hidden in data that are unknown to domain experts, expand the scope of tasks
that we can do in an area, and even inspire completely new findings.
  This paper describes Problem Learning, which aims at learning to discover and
define valid and ethical problems from data or from the machine's interaction
with the environment. We formalize problem learning as the identification of
valid and ethical problems in a problem space and introduce several possible
approaches to problem learning. In a broader sense, problem learning is an
approach towards the free will of intelligent machines. Currently, machines are
still limited to solving the problems defined by humans, without the ability or
flexibility to freely explore various possible problems that are even unknown
to humans. Though many machine learning techniques have been developed and
integrated into intelligent systems, they still focus on the means rather than
the purpose in that machines are still solving human defined problems. However,
proposing good problems is sometimes even more important than solving problems,
because a good problem can help to inspire new ideas and gain deeper
understandings. The paper also discusses the ethical implications of problem
learning under the background of Responsible AI.

spacecraft is within a pre-specified radius of the landing zone and at a
pre-specified altitude i.e., the base of an inverted cone with the tip at the

of dynamic tides on apsidal motion has long been debated, because the
contribution could not be quantified due to the lack of high quality
observations. KIC 4544587 with tidally excited oscillations has been observed
by \textit{Kepler} high-precision photometric data based on long time baseline
and short-cadence schema. In this paper, we compute the rate of apsidal motion
that arises from the dynamic tides as $19.05\pm 1.70$ mrad yr$^{-1}$ via
tracking the orbital phase shifts of tidally excited oscillations. We also
calculate the procession rate of the orbit due to the Newtonian and general
relativistic contribution as $21.49 \pm 2.8$ and $2.4 \pm 0.06$ mrad yr$^{-1}$,
respectively. The sum of these three factors is in excellent agreement with the
total observational rate of apsidal motion $42.97 \pm 0.18$ mrad yr$^{-1}$
measured by eclipse timing variations. The tidal effect accounts for about 44\%
of the overall observed apsidal motion and is comparable to that of the
Newtonian term. Dynamic tides have a significant contribution to the apsidal

transform the raw time series data into a time series of topics, and use this

via the topics across arbitrary time scales, and enable details on demand by
linking the topic visualization with the original earthquake data. We show,

the past years. Against the backdrop of more affordable 3D LiDAR sensors,
research on 3D LiDAR SLAM is becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, the
re-localization problem with a point cloud map is the foundation for other SLAM
applications. In this paper, a template matching framework is proposed to
re-localize a robot globally in a 3D LiDAR map. This presents two main
challenges. First, most global descriptors for point cloud can only be used for
place detection under a small local area. Therefore, in order to re-localize
globally in the map, point clouds and descriptors(templates) are densely
collected using a reconstructed mesh model at an offline stage by a physical
simulation engine to expand the functional distance of point cloud descriptors.
Second, the increased number of collected templates makes the matching stage
too slow to meet the real-time requirement, for which a cascade matching method
is presented for better efficiency. In the experiments, the proposed framework
achieves 0.2-meter accuracy at about 10Hz matching speed using pure python
implementation with 100k templates, which is effective and efficient for SLAM
applications.

  Re-sampling on Imbalance Classification","25 pages, 12 figures; revision v1",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In predictive tasks, real-world datasets often present different degrees of
imbalanced (i.e., long-tailed or skewed) distributions. While the majority (the
head) classes have sufficient samples, the minority (the tail) classes can be
under-represented by a rather limited number of samples. Data pre-processing
has been shown to be very effective in dealing with such problems. On one hand,
data re-sampling is a common approach to tackling class imbalance. On the other
hand, dimension reduction, which reduces the feature space, is a conventional
technique for reducing noise and inconsistencies in a dataset. However, the
possible synergy between feature selection and data re-sampling for
high-performance imbalance classification has rarely been investigated before.
To address this issue, we carry out a comprehensive empirical study on the
joint influence of feature selection and re-sampling on two-class imbalance
classification. Specifically, we study the performance of two opposite
pipelines for imbalance classification by applying feature selection before or
after data re-sampling. We conduct a large number of experiments, with a total
of 9225 tests, on 52 publicly available datasets, using 9 feature selection
methods, 6 re-sampling approaches for class imbalance learning, and 3
well-known classification algorithms. Experimental results show that there is
no constant winner between the two pipelines; thus both of them should be
considered to derive the best performing model for imbalance classification. We
find that the performance of an imbalance classification model not only depends
on the classifier adopted and the ratio between the number of majority and
minority samples, but also depends on the ratio between the number of samples
and features. Overall, this study should provide new reference value for
researchers and practitioners in imbalance learning.

In decentralised open markets consists of multiple vendors and multiple

Because, in these markets, negotiations among vendors and buyers take place
over multiple conflicting issues such as price, scalability, robustness, delay,
etc. As a result, optimising the resource allocation in such open markets
becomes directly dependent on two key decisions, which are; incorporating a
different kind of buyers' preferences, and fairness based vendor elicitation
strategy. Towards this end, in this work, we propose a three-step resource
allocation approach that employs a reverse-auction paradigm. At the first step,
priority label is attached to each bidding vendor based on the proposed
priority mechanism. Then, at the second step, the preference score is
calculated for all the different kinds of preferences of the buyers. Finally,
at the third step, based on the priority label of the vendor and the preference
score winner is determined. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with two
state-of-the-art resource pricing and allocation strategies. The experimental
results show that the proposed approach outperforms the other two resource
allocation approaches in terms of the independent utilities of buyers and the
overall utility of the open market.

as follows: light reflecting in equal angles, light refracting through
different mediums, and light traveling the path of least time in an arbitrary

from realistic, uncropped images. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art models
typically add a re-id branch upon two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN. Owing
to the ROI-Align operation, this pipeline yields promising accuracy as re-id
features are explicitly aligned with the corresponding object regions, but in
the meantime, it introduces high computational overhead due to dense object
anchors. In this work, we present an anchor-free approach to efficiently
tackling this challenging task, by introducing the following dedicated designs.
First, we select an anchor-free detector (i.e., FCOS) as the prototype of our
framework. Due to the lack of dense object anchors, it exhibits significantly
higher efficiency compared with existing person search models. Second, when
directly accommodating this anchor-free detector for person search, there exist
several major challenges in learning robust re-id features, which we summarize
as the misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task).
To address these issues, we propose an aligned feature aggregation module to
generate more discriminative and robust feature embeddings. Accordingly, we
name our model as Feature-Aligned Person Search Network (AlignPS). Third, by
investigating the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free models, we
further augment AlignPS with an ROI-Align head, which significantly improves
the robustness of re-id features while still keeping our model highly
efficient. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging benchmarks (i.e.,
CUHK-SYSU and PRW) demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art or
competitive performance, while displaying higher efficiency. All the source

  Quantization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative data-free quantization emerges as a practical compression approach
that quantizes deep neural networks to low bit-width without accessing the real
data. This approach generates data utilizing batch normalization (BN)
statistics of the full-precision networks to quantize the networks. However, it
always faces the serious challenges of accuracy degradation in practice. We
first give a theoretical analysis that the diversity of synthetic samples is
crucial for the data-free quantization, while in existing approaches, the
synthetic data completely constrained by BN statistics experimentally exhibit
severe homogenization at distribution and sample levels. This paper presents a
generic Diverse Sample Generation (DSG) scheme for the generative data-free
quantization, to mitigate detrimental homogenization. We first slack the
statistics alignment for features in the BN layer to relax the distribution
constraint. Then, we strengthen the loss impact of the specific BN layers for
different samples and inhibit the correlation among samples in the generation
process, to diversify samples from the statistical and spatial perspectives,
respectively. Comprehensive experiments show that for large-scale image
classification tasks, our DSG can consistently quantization performance on
different neural architectures, especially under ultra-low bit-width. And data
diversification caused by our DSG brings a general gain to various
quantization-aware training and post-training quantization approaches,
demonstrating its generality and effectiveness.

spectroscopy suggested that an additional strong nearest neighbor attraction in
the Hubbard model might be significant to describe the properties of doped
cuprates more accurately. The stripe-ordered patterns, formed by the
inhomogeneous distribution of spin, charge and pairing correlations in the
CuO$_{2}$ planes, is a known feature of doped cuprates. In this work, the
effect of the nearest neighbor attraction and the stripe phase are examined by
using the constrained path quantum Monte Carlo method within the repulsive
Hubbard model on two-dimensional square lattice. The ground state spin
correlations along and cross the stripe regions, and the $d$-wave pairing
correlation are calculated. It is found that the spin-spin correlation is the
highest when the interstripe region is fairly close to half-filling, and
$d$-wave superconducting correlation on neighboring sites could be enhanced in
the presence of stripe pattern and strong nearest neighbor attraction, which
reveals their crucial roles on superconductivity in the doped cuprates.

  in copper vacuum arcs: insight from particle-in-cell/direct simulation Monte
  Carlo methods","15 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Metal vapour vacuum arcs are capable to generate multiply charged metallic
ions, which are widely used in fields such as ion deposition, ion thrusters,
and ion sources, etc. According to the stationary model of cathode spot, those
ions are generated by electron-impact single ionization in a step-wise manner,
which is M -> M+ -> M2+ -> ... mainly. This paper is designed to study
quantitatively the role of double ionization M -> M2+ in the breakdown
initiation of copper vacuum arcs. A direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) scheme
of double ionization is proposed and incorporated into a 2D particle-in-cell
(PIC) method. The super-particles of Cu2+ ions generated from different
channels are labelled independently in the PIC-DSMC modelling of vacuum arc
breakdown. The cathode erosion rate based on PIC modelling is about 40{\mu}g/C
in arc burning regime, which agrees well with previous experiments. The
temporal discharge behaviours such as arc current, arc voltage, and ionization
degree of arc plasma, are influenced with or without double ionization
negligibly. However, additional Cu2+ ions are generated near the cathode in
breakdown initiation from the double ionization channel, with a lower kinetic
energy on average. Therefore, the results on spatial distribution and energy
spectra of Cu2+ ions are different with or without double ionization. This
paper provides a quantitative research method to evaluate the role of multiply
ionization in vacuum arcs.

low-loss fiber allows the generation of high pulse energy up to 15.4 {\mu}J at
atmospheric CO2 pressure. The Raman laser exhibits good long-term stability and
low relative intensity noise (RIN) of less than 4%. We also investigate the
pressure-dependent overlap of the Raman laser line with the absorption band of

which is generally learned by comparing positive and negative pairs. The
Contrastive Loss (CL) is the key in contrastive learning that has received more
attention recently and we find it is well suited for top-k recommendations.
However, it is a problem that CL treats the importance of the positive and
negative samples as the same. On the one hand, CL faces the imbalance problem
of one positive sample and many negative samples. On the other hand, positive
items are so few in sparser datasets that their importance should be
emphasized. Moreover, the other important issue is that the sparse positive
items are still not sufficiently utilized in recommendations. So we propose a
new data augmentation method by using multiple positive items (or samples)
simultaneously with the CL loss function. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Sample
based Contrastive Loss (MSCL) function which solves the two problems by
balancing the importance of positive and negative samples and data
augmentation. And based on the graph convolution network (GCN) method,
experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MSCL. The
proposed MSCL is simple and can be applied in many methods. We will release our
code on GitHub upon the acceptance.

states, i.e. hard and soft states, in which the physical properties of the
accretion flow and of the jet are known to change. Recently, the JED-SAD
paradigm has been proposed for black hole X-ray binaries, aimed to address the
accretion-ejection interplay in these systems. According to this model, the
accretion flow is composed by an outer standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SAD) and
an inner hot Jet Emitting Disk (JED). The JED produces both the hard X-ray
emission, effectively playing the role of the hot corona, and the radio jets.
In this paper, we use the JED-SAD model to describe the evolution of the
accretion flow in the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 during its hard and
hard-intermediate states. Contrarily to the previous applications of this
model, the Compton reflection component has been taken into account. We use
eight broadband X-rays spectra, including NuSTAR, NICER and Swift data,
providing a total spectral coverage of 0.8-190 keV. The data were directly
fitted with the JED-SAD model. Our results suggest that the optically thick
disk (i.e. the SAD) does not extend down to the ISCO in any of the considered
epochs. In particular, as the system evolves towards the hard/intermediate
state, we find that the inner radius decreases from $\sim$60 R$_{\rm G}$ in the
first observation down to $\sim$30 R$_{\rm G}$ in the last one. This trend is
accompanied by an increase of the mass-accretion rate. In all hard-intermediate
state observations, two reflection components, characterized by different
values of ionization, are required to adequately explain the data. These
components likely originate from different regions of the SAD. We show that a
flared outer disk could, in principle, explain the double reflection component.

$R$ and $StarFC(R)$ the set of all star operations of finite type on $R$. Then
$R$ is said to be star regular if $|Star(T)|\leq |Star(R)|$ for every overring
$T$ of $R$. In this paper we introduce the notion of finitely star regular
domain as an integral domain $R$ such that $|StarFC(T)|\leq |StarFC(R)|$ for
each overring $T$ of $R$. First, we show that the notions of star regular and
finitely star regular domains are completely different and do not imply each
other. Next, we extend/generalize well-known results on star regularity in
Noetherian and Pr\""ufer contexts to finitely star regularity. Also we handle
the finite star regular domains issued from classical pullback constructions to
construct finitely star regular domains that are not star regular and enriches
the literature with a such class of domains.

  The Reeb space of a smooth function is the quotient space of the manifold of
the domain induced from the following equivalence relation; two points in the
manifold are equivalent if and only if they are points of a same connected
component of some preimage. They are in considerable cases graphs (Reeb
graphs).
  Reeb spaces with preimages represent the manifolds well and are important
tools in geometry. Recently they play important roles in applications of

construct smooth functions with prescribed Reeb graphs and preimages. Studies
on construction respecting preimages were essentially started by the author.

method for visually explaining video understanding networks, it is challenging
because of the unique spatiotemporal dependencies existing in video inputs and
the special 3D convolutional or recurrent structures of video understanding
networks. However, most existing attribution methods focus on explaining
networks taking a single image as input and a few works specifically devised
for video attribution come short of dealing with diversified structures of

enhance the method by constraining the smoothness of its attribution results in
both spatial and temporal dimensions. In order to assess the effectiveness of
different video attribution methods without relying on manual judgement, we
introduce reliable objective metrics which are checked by a newly proposed

a result, we discuss that observed stellar velocity dispersion profiles in the

extrasolar planets. Its design allows unprecedented radial velocity precision

present the first standalone detection of an extrasolar planet by blind radial
velocity search using ESPRESSO and aim at showing the power of the instrument
in characterizing planetary signals at different periodicities in long time
spans. We use 41 ESPRESSO measurements of HD\,22496 within a time span of 895
days with a median photon noise of 18 cm/s. A radial velocity analysis is
performed to test the presence of planets in the system and to account for the
stellar activity of this K5-K7 main sequence star. For benchmarking and
comparison, we attempt the detection with 43 archive HARPS measurements and
compare the results yielded by the two datasets. We also use four TESS sectors
to search for transits. We find radial velocity variations compatible with a
close-in planet with an orbital period of $P=5.09071\pm0.00026$ days when
simultaneously accounting for the effects of stellar activity at longer time
scales ($P_{\rm rot}=34.99^{+0.58}_{-0.53}$ days). We characterize the physical
and orbital properties of the planet and find a minimum mass of
$5.57^{+0.73}_{-0.68}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$, right in the dichotomic regime
between rocky and gaseous planets. Although not transiting according to TESS
data, if aligned with the stellar spin axis, the absolute mass of the planet
must be below 16 $\mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$. We find no significant evidence for
additional signals with semi-amplitudes above 56 cm/s at 95% confidence. With a
modest set of radial velocity measurements, ESPRESSO is capable of detecting
and characterizing low-mass planets and constrain the presence of planets in
the habitable zone of K-dwarfs down to the rocky-mass regime.

asset trading platforms. Beyond centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized
exchanges (DEXs) are introduced to allow users to trade cryptocurrency without
transferring the custody of their digital assets to the middlemen, thus
eliminating the security and privacy issues of traditional CEX. Uniswap, as the
most prominent cryptocurrency DEX, is continuing to attract scammers, with
fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take
the first step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first
collect all the transactions related to Uniswap V2 exchange and investigate the
landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives.
Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap based
on a guilt-by-association heuristic and a machine-learning powered technique.
We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on Uniswap, which suggests that
roughly 50% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam
tokens and liquidity pools are created specialized for the ""rug pull"" scams,
and some scam tokens have embedded tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts.
We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help carry out the
scams in league with the scam token/pool creators. The scammers have gained a
profit of at least \$16 million from 39,762 potential victims. Our observations
in this paper suggest the urgency to identify and stop scams in the
decentralized finance ecosystem, and our approach can act as a whistleblower
that identifies scam tokens at their early stages.

adipocytes) treated with PMS (5 ug/mL, 30 min) showed cytoplasmic granules with
bright blue fluorescence, which correspond to lipid droplets labeled by the
lipophilic methyl-phenazine. After formaldehyde fixation blue-fluorescing
droplets could be stained with oil red O. Interestingly, PMS-treated 3T3-L1
adipocytes observed under UV excitation 24 h after labeling showed large lipid
droplets with a weak green emission within a diffuse pale blue-fluorescing
cytoplasm, whereas a strong green emission was observed in small lipid
droplets. This fluorescence change from blue to green indicates that
reoxidation of methyl-phenazine to PMS can occur. Regarding cell uptake and
labeling mechanisms, QSAR models predict that the hydrophilic PMS is not
significantly membrane-permeant, so most PMS reduction is expected to be
extracellular and associated with a plasma membrane NAD(P)H reductase. Once
formed, the lipophilic and blue-fluorescing methyl-phenazine enters live cells
and mainly accumulates in lipid droplets. Overall, the results reported here
indicate that PMS is an excellent fluorescent probe to investigate labeling and
redox dynamics of lipid droplets in cultured cells.

traffic jams in large cities is of crucial importance for urban planning and
traffic management. Many studies have already considered the emergence of
traffic jams from the point of view of phase transitions, but mostly in simple
geometries such as highways for example, or in the framework of percolation
where an external parameter is driving the transition. More generally,
empirical evidence and characterization for a congestion transition in complex
road networks is scarce, and here we use traffic measures for Paris (France)
during the period 2014-2018 for testing the existence of a jamming transition
at the urban level. In particular, we show that the correlation function of
delays due to congestion is a power law (with exponent $\eta\approx 0.4$)
combined with an exponential cut-off $\xi$. This correlation length $\xi$ is
shown to diverge during rush hours, pointing to a jamming transition in urban
traffic. We also discuss the spatial structure of congestion and identify a
core of congested links that participate in most traffic jams and whose
structure is specific during rush hours. Finally, we show that the spatial
structure of congestion is consistent with a reaction-diffusion picture
proposed previously.

recording, the obtained audio signal includes undesired sound from the other
sources, which is often called cross-talk or bleeding sound. For many audio
applications including onstage sound reinforcement and sound editing after a
live performance, it is important to reduce the bleeding sound in each recorded
signal. However, since microphones are spatially apart from each other in this
situation, typical phase-aware blind source separation (BSS) methods cannot be
used. We propose a phase-insensitive method for blind bleeding-sound reduction.
This method is based on time-channel nonnegative matrix factorization, which is
a BSS method using only amplitude spectrograms. With the proposed method, we
introduce the gamma-distribution-based prior for leakage levels of bleeding
sounds. Its optimization can be interpreted as maximum a posteriori estimation.
The experimental results of music bleeding-sound reduction indicate that the

graph neural network (GNN) models, deep graph matching methods have made great
progresses in the task of matching semantic features. However, these methods
usually rely on heuristically generated graph patterns, which may introduce
unreliable relationships to hurt the matching performance. In this paper, we
propose a joint \emph{graph learning and matching} network, named GLAM, to
explore reliable graph structures for boosting graph matching. GLAM adopts a
pure attention-based framework for both graph learning and graph matching.
Specifically, it employs two types of attention mechanisms, self-attention and
cross-attention for the task. The self-attention discovers the relationships
between features and to further update feature representations over the learnt
structures; and the cross-attention computes cross-graph correlations between
the two feature sets to be matched for feature reconstruction. Moreover, the
final matching solution is directly derived from the output of the
cross-attention layer, without employing a specific matching decision module.
The proposed method is evaluated on three popular visual matching benchmarks
(Pascal VOC, Willow Object and SPair-71k), and it outperforms previous
state-of-the-art graph matching methods by significant margins on all
benchmarks. Furthermore, the graph patterns learnt by our model are validated
to be able to remarkably enhance previous deep graph matching methods by
replacing their handcrafted graph structures with the learnt ones.

agreement with the above constraints, after discussing the properties of cold
matter, we review thermal properties for thermodynamic conditions relevant for
core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We find that the
latter are strongly influenced by the density dependence of the nucleon
effective mass. The selected bunch of models is used to investigate the EoS
dependence of hot star properties, where entropy per baryon and electron
fraction profiles are inspired from proto-neutron star evolution. The
$\Gamma$-law analytical thermal EoS used in many simulations is found not to
describe well these thermal properties of the EoS. However, it may offer a fair
description of the structure of hot stars whenever thermal effects on the
baryonic part are small, as shown here for proto-neutron stars starting from
several seconds after bounce.

polarity inconsistency resulted from separately tagging tokens in the former

variety of different decision problems. In the current paper, we improve on the
UCluster method by adding the option of training the model in a scalable and
distributed fashion, and thereby extending its utility to learn from
arbitrarily large data sets. UCluster combines a graph-based neural network
called ABCnet with a clustering step, using a combined loss function in the
training phase. The original code is publicly available in TensorFlow v1.14 and
has previously been trained on a single GPU. It shows a clustering accuracy of
81% when applied to the problem of multi-class classification of simulated jet
events. Our implementation adds the distributed training functionality by
utilising the Horovod distributed training framework, which necessitated a
migration of the code to TensorFlow v2. Together with using parquet files for
splitting data up between different compute nodes, the distributed training
makes the model scalable to any amount of input data, something that will be
essential for use with real LHC data sets. We find that the model is well
suited for distributed training, with the training time decreasing in direct
relation to the number of GPU's used. However, further improvements by a more
exhaustive and possibly distributed hyper-parameter search is required in order

simultaneous observations with FAST, the Chilbolton and Effelsberg LOFAR
international stations, and NenuFAR represent a five-fold increase in the
spectral coverage of this object, with the detections at 1250 MHz (FAST) and 57

exceptionally steep spectral index of $-3.5^{+0.2}_{-1.5}$, with a turnover
below $\sim$95 MHz. In conjunction with observations of this pulsar with the
GBT and the LOFAR Core, we show that the intrinsic profile width increases
drastically towards higher frequencies, contrary to the predictions of
conventional radius-to-frequency mapping. We examine polarimetric data from
FAST and the LOFAR Core and conclude that its polar cap radio emission is
produced at an absolute height of several hundreds of kilometres around 1.5
GHz, similar to other rotation-powered pulsars across the population. Its beam
is significantly underfilled at lower frequencies, or it narrows because of the
disappearance of conal outriders. Finally, the results for PSR J0250+5854 and
other slowly spinning rotation-powered pulsars are contrasted with the
radio-detected magnetars. We conclude that magnetars have intrinsically wider
radio beams than the slow rotation-powered pulsars, and that consequently the
latter's lower beaming fraction is what makes objects such as PSR J0250+5854 so
scarce.

codes in terms of, at most, two relevant constant dimension codes naturally
associated to them. We do this first for general flag codes and then
particularize to those arising as orbits under the action of arbitrary
subgroups of the general linear group. We provide two different systematic
orbital constructions of flag codes attaining both maximum distance and size.
To this end, we use the action of Singer groups and take advantage of the good
relation between these groups and Desarguesian spreads, as well as the fact
that they act transitively on lines and hyperplanes.

multilingual NLP tasks and enabled zero-shot or few-shot transfer from
high-resource languages to low resource ones. However, due to significant
typological differences and contradictions between some languages, such models
usually perform poorly on many languages and cross-lingual settings, which
shows the difficulty of learning a single model to handle massive diverse
languages well at the same time. To alleviate this issue, we present a new
multilingual pre-training pipeline. We propose to generate language
representation from multilingual pre-trained models and conduct linguistic
analysis to show that language representation similarity reflect linguistic
similarity from multiple perspectives, including language family, geographical
sprachbund, lexicostatistics and syntax. Then we cluster all the target
languages into multiple groups and name each group as a representation
sprachbund. Thus, languages in the same representation sprachbund are supposed
to boost each other in both pre-training and fine-tuning as they share rich
linguistic similarity. We pre-train one multilingual model for each
representation sprachbund. Experiments are conducted on cross-lingual
benchmarks and significant improvements are achieved compared to strong
baselines.

in studying a quantum system, and ramping dynamics has been widely used in
preparing a quantum state and probing physical properties. Here, we present a
novel method of probing quantum many-body correlation by ramping dynamics. We
ramp a Hamiltonian parameter to the same target value from different initial
values and with different velocities, and we show that the first-order
correction on the finite ramping velocity is universal and path-independent,
revealing a novel quantum many-body correlation function of the equilibrium
phases at the target values. We term this method as the non-adiabatic linear
response since this is the leading order correction beyond the adiabatic limit.
We demonstrate this method experimentally by studying the Bose-Hubbard model
with ultracold atoms in three-dimensional optical lattices. Unlike the
conventional linear response that reveals whether the quasi-particle dispersion
of a quantum phase is gapped or gapless, this probe is more sensitive to
whether the quasi-particle lifetime is long enough such that the quantum phase
possesses a well-defined quasi-particle description. In the Bose-Hubbard model,
this non-adiabatic linear response is significant in the quantum critical
regime where well-defined quasi-particles are absent. And in contrast, this
response is vanishingly small in both superfluid and Mott insulators which
possess well-defined quasi-particles. Because our proposal uses the most common
experimental protocol, we envision that our method can find broad applications
in probing various quantum systems.

finite Rashba coupling. We use this property to show that a heterostructure
composed of a helical Luttinger liquid, contacted to two metallic leads and
supplemented by top gates, can be used as a tunable thermal valve. By relying
on bosonization techniques and scattering of plasmonic modes, we investigate
the performance of this valve with respect to electron-electron interactions,
temperature, and properties of the gates. The maximal modulation of the thermal
conductance that the proposed device can achieve is, for experimentally
relevant parameters, around $7 \%$. Such variation can be both positive or
negative. Moreover, a modification in the geometry of the gate can lead to
particular temperature dependencies related to interference effects. We also

In this paper, we consider the counterpart of their result for critical LQG and
SLE, i.e., for the case when $\gamma^2=\kappa=16/\kappa=4$. We prove that as
one sends $\kappa \downarrow 4$ in the subcritical setting, the space-filling

collapse into a single continuum random tree, and we observe that upon applying
an appropriate affine transform to the encoding Brownian motions before taking
the limit, we get convergence to a pair of independent Brownian motions
$(A,B)$. The Brownian motion $A$ encodes the LQG distance from the CLE loops to
the boundary of the disk, while the Brownian motion $B$ encodes the boundary

elements were produced in the early Universe by two different sources: a
frequent s-process source hosted by rotating massive stars, and a rare
r-process source hosted most likely by neutron star mergers. The two sources
produce barium with different isotopic compositions. Aims. We aim to
investigate the lines of barium in two halo stars, HD 6268 and HD 4306. The
spectra present an exquisite quality, both in terms of resolution (R > 100'000)
and signal-to-noise (400). Due to hyperfine splitting (hfs) effects, barium
lines are expected to show slightly different profiles depending on the barium
isotopic fraction. Methods. We applied a standard local thermodynamic
equilibrium synthesis of the barium lines. We compared the synthetic results
assuming an s-process isotopic pattern or an r-process isotopic pattern for the
two barium lines for each star that exhibited hfs. We also applied a
methodology, less dependent on the accuracy of the theoretical Ba hfs
structure, that transforms the lines of HD 4306 into those we would observe if
its atmospheric parameter values (i.e. Teff, log g, micro- and
macro-turbulence, Vsin i, and Ba abundance) were the same as those of HD 6268.
Results. With both methods, our results show that the barium lines with hfs
effects of HD 4306 are in agreement with an s-process composition and the lines
in HD 6268 have a different profile, which is most likely linked to the
presence of an r-process isotopic pattern. Conclusions. Two lines of barium of
HD 6268 and HD 4306 seem to confirm the theoretical expectation that both
r-process events and also s-process contribution by rotating massive stars have
polluted the ancient halo of our Galaxy.

this work, we rationally synthesize molecular moieties with versatile

$\pi$-conjugation. The charge transfer agents were synthesized through the
stepwise nucleophilic substitution of either one (monosubstituted series) or
two chlorine (disubstituted series) atoms of cyanuric chloride by aniline

The correlation between the optical properties of these molecular probes and
their functionality was investigated by experiments and quantum chemical
calculations. While the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated charge
transfer agents were dominated by the aniline segments, the triazine warrants
the ability to nondestructively attach to the surface of SWNTs. This study is

self-interference, which is then transmitted back to the CO for the signal
down-conversion and SIC via the optical domain signal adjustment and balanced

symbolic automata which are used to encode complex event patterns; and b)
prediction suffix trees which can provide a succinct probabilistic description

state-of-the-art methods and show its advantage in terms of accuracy and

models, have the ability to capture long-term dependencies in a stream by
remembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our
experimental results demonstrate the benefits, in terms of accuracy, of being
able to capture such long-term dependencies. This is achieved by increasing the
order of our model beyond what is possible with full-order Markov models that
need to perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible past sequences of a

superconducting technology. Before technology mapping, additional buffer and
splitter cells need to be inserted into AQFP circuits to fulfill two special
constraints: (1) Input signals to a logic gate need to arrive at the same time,
thus shorter paths need to be delayed with buffers. (2) The output signal of a
logic gate has to be actively branched with splitters if it drives multiple
fanouts. Buffers and splitters largely increase the area and delay in AQFP
circuits. Na\""ive buffer and splitter insertion and light-weight optimization
using retiming techniques have been used in related works, and it is not clear
how much space there is for further optimization. In this paper, we develop (a)
a linear-time algorithm to insert buffers and splitters irredundantly, and (b)
optimization methods by scheduling and by moving groups of gates, called
chunks, together. Experimental results show a reduction of up to 39% on buffer
and splitter cost. Moreover, as the technology is still developing and
assumptions on the physical constraints are not clear yet, we also discuss the
impacts of different assumptions with experimental results to motivate future
research on AQFP register design.

monitoring critical infrastructures. An important use case is the discovery of
leaks and inflows in pipe networks using a swarm of floating sensor nodes.
While passively drifting along, the devices must track their individual
positions so critical points can later be located. Since pipelines are often
situated in inaccessible places, large portions of the network can be shielded
from radio and satellite signals, rendering conventional positioning systems
ineffective.
  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for assigning location estimates
to recorded measurements once the sensor node leaves the inaccessible area and
transmits them via a gateway. The solution is range-free and makes use of a
priori information about the target pipeline network. We further describe two
extended variants of our algorithm which use data of encounters with other
sensor nodes to improve accuracy. Finally, we evaluate all variants with
respect to various network topologies and different numbers of mobile nodes in
a simulation. The results show that our algorithm localizes measurements with
an average accuracy between 4.81% and 7.58%, depending on the variability of
flow speed and the sparsity of reference points.

Post-structuralist Discourse Analysis (PDA) of Covid-19 phenomenon (inspired by
Laclau and Mouffe's Discourse Theory) by using Intelligent Data Mining for
Persian Society. The examined big data is five million tweets from 160,000
users of the Persian Twitter network to compare two discourses. Besides
analyzing the tweet texts individually, a social network graph database has
been created based on retweets relationships. We use the VoteRank algorithm to
introduce and rank people whose posts become word of mouth, provided that the
total information spreading scope is maximized over the network. These users
are also clustered according to their word usage pattern (the Gaussian Mixture
Model is used). The constructed discourse of influential spreaders is compared
to the most active users. This analysis is done based on Covid-related posts
over eight episodes. Also, by relying on the statistical content analysis and
polarity of tweet words, discourse analysis is done for the whole mentioned
subpopulations, especially for the top individuals. The most important result
of this research is that the Twitter subjects' discourse construction is
government-based rather than community-based. The analyzed Iranian society does
not consider itself responsible for the Covid-19 wicked problem, does not
believe in participation, and expects the government to solve all problems. The
most active and most influential users' similarity is that political, national,
and critical discourse construction is the predominant one. In addition to the
advantages of its research methodology, it is necessary to pay attention to the
study's limitations. Suggestion for future encounters of Iranian society with
similar crises is given.

crashes and inconsistent look-and-feel when running at specific Android
versions. Existing works incur plenty of false positive and false negative
issue-detection rules by conducting trivial data-flow analysis while failing to
model the XML tree hierarchies of the Android configuration files. Besides,
little is known about how the changes in an Android framework can induce such
compatibility issues. To bridge such gaps, we conducted a systematic study by
analyzing 196 real-world issues collected from 43 popular apps. We identified
common patterns of Android framework code changes that induce such
configuration compatibility issues. Based on the findings, we propose
\textsc{ConfDroid} that can automatically extract rules for detecting
configuration compatibility issues. The intuition is to perform symbolic
execution based on a model learned from the common code change patterns.
Experiment results show that ConfDroid can successfully extract 282 valid
issue-detection rules with a precision of 91.9%. Among them, 65 extracted rules
can manifest issues that cannot be detected by the rules of state-of-the-art
baselines. More importantly, 11 out of them have led to the detection of 107

social media postings annotated with their underlying opinions. The qualitative
study dynamically constructs the set of opinions, simultaneous with labeling
the postings. Next, we use keywords to collect a large dataset from three

introduce an iterative data exploration procedure to augment the dataset. It
alternates between a data sampler -- which balances exploration and
exploitation of unlabeled data -- the automatic labeling of the sampled data,
the manual inspection by the qualitative mapping team, and, finally, the
retraining of the automatic opinion classifiers. We present both qualitative

dataset and constructs a more encompassing dataset. Next, we present detailed

technologically relevant platforms to develop promising applications in the
fields of optoelectronics and photonics. Most of these applications require
low-contaminated high-mobility graphene (i.e., approaching 10 000 $cm^2 V^{-1}
s^{-1}$) at room temperature) to reduce device losses and implement compact
device design. To date, these mobility values are only obtained when suspending
or encapsulating graphene. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, facile, and scalable
cleaning process, that yields high-mobility graphene directly on the most
common technologically relevant substrate: silicon dioxide on silicon
(SiO$_2$/Si). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and spatially-resolved X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate that this approach is instrumental
to rapidly eliminate most of the polymeric residues which remain on graphene
after transfer and fabrication and that have adverse effects on its electrical
properties. Raman measurements show a significant reduction of graphene doping
and strain. Transport measurements of 50 Hall bars (HBs) yield hole mobility
${\mu}_h$ up to 9000 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$ and electron mobility ${\mu}_e$ up to
8000 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$, with average values ${\mu}_h$ 7500 $cm^2 V^{-1}

ultraclean graphene reach values nearly double of that measured in graphene HBs
processed with acetone cleaning, which is the method widely adopted in the
field. Notably, these mobility values are obtained over large-scale and without

giving the basis to describe the instantaneous energy of the arms. To calculate

find that the convection changes from a dominantly Y$_{GSM}$direction, but
opposite in the two hemispheres, to a flow oriented more toward the plasma
sheet, as the north-south component of the convection increases when
reconnection enhances in the near Earth tail. This result is consistent with
recent observations of the convection in the ionosphere, which suggest that the
nightside convection pattern becomes more north-south symmetric when tail
reconnection increases. This is also supported by simultaneous auroral
observations from the two hemispheres, which shows that conjugate auroral

forgetting problem in class-incremental learning. With the absence of old task
images, they often assume that old knowledge is well preserved if the
classifier produces similar output on new images. In this paper, we find that
their effectiveness largely depends on the nature of old classes: they work
well on classes that are easily distinguishable between each other but may fail
on more fine-grained ones, e.g., boy and girl. In spirit, such methods project
new data onto the feature space spanned by the weight vectors in the fully

be similar on fine-grained old classes, and as a consequence the new classifier
will gradually lose the discriminative ability on these classes. To address
this issue, we propose a memory-free generative replay strategy to preserve the
fine-grained old classes characteristics by generating representative old

process (i-process) of nucleosynthesis. We previously showed that the ingestion
of protons in the convective helium-burning region of a low-mass
low-metallicity star can explain the surface abundance distribution observed in
CEMP r/s stars relatively well. Such an i-process requires detailed reaction
network calculations involving hundreds of nuclei for which reaction rates have
not yet been determined experimentally. We investigate the nuclear physics
uncertainties affecting the i-process during the AGB phase of low-metallicity
low-mass stars by propagating the theoretical uncertainties in the radiative
neutron capture cross sections, as well as the 13C(a,n)16O reaction rate, and
estimating their impact on the surface-abundance distribution.
  It is found that considering systematic uncertainties on the various nuclear
ingredients affecting the radiative neutron capture rates, surface elemental
abundances are typically predicted within +/-0.4 dex. The 56 < Z < 59 region of
the spectroscopically relevant heavy-s elements of Ba-La-Ce-Pr as well as the
r-dominated Eu element remain relatively unaffected by nuclear uncertainties.
In contrast, the inclusion of the direct capture contribution impacts the rates
in the neutron-rich A~45, 100, 160, and 200 regions, and the i-process
production of the Z~45 and 65-70 elements. Uncertainties in the photon strength
function also impact the overabundance factors by typically 0.2-0.4 dex.
Nuclear level densities tend to affect abundance predictions mainly in the
Z=74-79 regions. The uncertainties associated with the neutron-producing
reaction 13C(a,n)16O and the unknown beta-decay rates are found to have a low
impact on the overall surface enrichment

through the loading, enabling monitoring of the loading itself and the spatial
uniformity of the Gd concentration over the 35 days it took to reach the top of
the detector. During the subsequent commissioning the recirculation rate was
increased to 120 m$^3$/h, resulting in a constant and uniform distribution of
Gd throughout the detector and water transparency equivalent to that of
previous pure-water operation periods. Using an Am-Be neutron calibration
source the mean neutron capture time was measured to be $115\pm1$ $\mu$s, which
corresponds to a Gd concentration of $111\pm2$ ppm, as expected for this level
of Gd loading. This paper describes changes made to the water circulation

the localization of a single quasiparticle of the fractional quantum Hall state
at filling factor $\nu=n/(2n+1)$ has a striking {\it quantitative}
correspondence to the localization of a single electron in the $(n+1)$th Landau

localization in integer quantum Hall effect, this leads to predictions in the
fractional quantum Hall regime regarding the existence of extended states at a
critical energy, and the nature of the divergence of the localization length as

paraphrase generation based on the assumption that the probabilities of
generating two sentences with the same meaning given the same context should be
the same. Inspired by this fundamental idea, we propose a pipelined system
which consists of paraphrase candidate generation based on contextual language
models, candidate filtering using scoring functions, and paraphrase model
training based on the selected candidates. The proposed paradigm offers merits
over existing paraphrase generation methods: (1) using the context regularizer
on meanings, the model is able to generate massive amounts of high-quality
paraphrase pairs; and (2) using human-interpretable scoring functions to select
paraphrase pairs from candidates, the proposed framework provides a channel for
developers to intervene with the data generation process, leading to a more
controllable model. Experimental results across different tasks and datasets
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed model in both supervised and

cell interactions are complex and difficult to measure individually in
experiments, mathematical modelling plays an increasingly important role to
unravel the mechanisms governing segregation. The analysis of these theoretical
models focuses mainly on the asymptotic behavior at large times, in a steady
regime and for large numbers of cells. Most famously, cell-segregation models
based on the minimization of the total surface energy, a mechanism also driving
the demixing of immiscible fluids, are known to exhibit asymptotically a
particular algebraic scaling behavior. However, it is not clear, whether the
asymptotic regime of the numerical models is relevant at the spatio-temporal
scales of actual biological processes and in-vitro experiments. By developing a
mapping between cell-based models and experimental settings, we are able to
directly compare previous experimental data to numerical simulations of cell
segregation quantitatively. We demonstrate that the experiments are reproduced
by the transitory regime of the models rather than the asymptotic one. Our work
puts a new perspective on previous model-driven conclusions on cell segregation
mechanisms.

primary objectives of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The detection sensitivity is
slated to increase significantly as the number of well-timed millisecond
pulsars will increase by more than an order of magnitude with the advent of
next-generation radio telescopes. Currently, the Bayesian analysis pipeline
using parallel tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo has been applied in multiple
studies for CB-SMBH searches, but it may be challenged by the high
dimensionality of the parameter space for future large-scale PTAs. One solution
is to reduce the dimensionality by maximizing or marginalizing over
uninformative parameters semi-analytically, but it is not clear whether this
approach can be extended to more complex signal models without making overly
simplified assumptions. Recently, the method of diffusive nested (DNest)
sampling shown the capability of coping with high dimensionality and

to search for continuous GWs in simulated pulsar timing residuals and find that
it performs well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency for a PTA

songs and places, to users based on the sequential patterns of their historical
records. Most existing sequential recommender models consider the next item
prediction task as the training signal. Unfortunately, there are two essential
challenges for these methods: (1) the long-term preference is difficult to
capture, and (2) the supervision signal is too sparse to effectively train a
model. In this paper, we propose a novel sequential recommendation framework to
overcome these challenges based on a memory augmented multi-instance
contrastive predictive coding scheme, denoted as MMInfoRec. The basic
contrastive predictive coding (CPC) serves as encoders of sequences and items.
The memory module is designed to augment the auto-regressive prediction in CPC
to enable a flexible and general representation of the encoded preference,
which can improve the ability to capture the long-term preference. For
effective training of the MMInfoRec model, a novel multi-instance noise
contrastive estimation (MINCE) loss is proposed, using multiple positive
samples, which offers effective exploitation of samples inside a mini-batch.
The proposed MMInfoRec framework falls into the contrastive learning style,
within which, however, a further finetuning step is not required given that its
contrastive training task is well aligned with the target recommendation task.
With extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, MMInfoRec can outperform
the state-of-the-art baselines.

Even though the problem of minimizing the overall video delivery delay is
NP-hard, the Collaborative Caching Algorithm (CCA) that we present can
efficiently compute a solution close to the optimal, where the degree of
sub-optimality depends on the worst case video-to-cache size ratio. The
algorithm is naturally amenable to distributed implementation that requires
zero explicit coordination between the SBSs, and runs in $O(N + K \log K)$
time, where $N$ is the number of SBSs (caches) and $K$ the maximum number of
videos. We extend CCA to an online setting where the video popularities are not
known a priori but are estimated over time through a limited amount of periodic
information sharing between SBSs. We demonstrate that our algorithm closely
approaches the optimal integral caching solution as the cache size increases.
Moreover, via simulations carried out on real video access traces, we show that
our algorithm effectively uses the SBS caches to reduce the video delivery
delay and conserve the remote server's bandwidth, and that it outperforms two
other reference caching methods adapted to our system setting.

equation converges to the stationary solution of averaged equation under the
compact-open topology as the time scale goes to zero--in other words, there
exists a unique recurrent solution to the original equation in a neighborhood
of the stationary solution of averaged equation when the time scale is small.
Finally, we establish the global averaging principle in weak sense, i.e. we
show that the attractor of original system tends to that of the averaged
equation in probability measure space as the time scale goes to zero. For
illustration of our results, we give two applications, including stochastic

plateau when the magnetic fields are applied in $ab$-plane. Heat capacity is
performed along both $ab$-plane and $c$-axis, and features the characteristic
dome for triangular magnetic lattice compounds as a function of magnetic
fields. Due to the change of the interlayer and intralayer distance of
Yb$^{3+}$, the dome shifts to low fields from KYbSe$_2$ to RbYbSe$_2$. All
these results indicate the $A$YbSe$_2$ family presents unique frustrated
magnetism close to the possible QSL and noncolinear spin states.

Using mock DMs and realistic lightcone galaxy catalogs derived from the

  hadron accelerator",,,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crossing the transition energy is always a delicate process, representing a
potential source of strong perturbations of the dynamics of charged particle
beams in a hadron circular accelerator. Since the first generation of multi-GeV
rings, intense studies have been devoted to understanding the possible harmful
mechanisms involved in transition crossing and to devise mitigation measures.
Nowadays, several circular particle accelerators are successfully operating
across transition and this process is well mastered. In a completely different
context, stable resonances of the traverse phase space have been proposed as
new means of manipulating charged particle beams. While the original aim of
such a proposal was multi-turn extraction from the CERN Proton Synchrotron to
the Super Proton Synchrotron, many more applications have been proposed and
studied in detail. In this paper, the two topics, i.e. transition crossing and
stable resonances, have been brought together with the goal of providing a
novel and non-adiabatic approach to perform a clean transition crossing. The
idea presented here is that by judiciously using sextupoles and octupoles it is
possible to generate stable islands of the horizontal phase space. These
islands represent a second closed orbit whose properties can be selected
independently of those of the standard, i.e. central, closed orbit. This
provides a means of performing a non-adiabatic change of the transition energy
experienced by the charged particles by displacing the beam between the two
closed orbits.

acoustic and simulation parameters used to train the models are extensively

of the field of building acoustics. Estimation errors from the learned neural
models are compared to those obtained with classical formulas that require
knowledge of the room's geometry and reverberation times. Extensive comparisons
made on a variety of simulated test sets highlight different conditions under
which the learned models can overcome the well-known limitations of the diffuse
sound field hypothesis underlying these formulas. Results obtained on real RIRs
measured in an acoustically configurable room show that at 1~kHz and above, the

regenerates the observations inversely from the fusion result. The proposed
network can effectively fuse not only the homogeneous but also the

cosmological distances makes it likely that some will be strongly lensed by
intervening matter along the line of sight. Detection of lensed FRB repeaters,
which account for a noteworthy fraction of the total population, will allow not
only an accurate measurement of the lensing time delay, but also follow-up
high-resolution observations to pinpoint the location of the lensed images.
Recent works proposed to use such strongly-lensed FRBs to derive constraints on
the current expansion rate $ H_{0} $ as well as on cosmic curvature. Here we
study the prospects for placing constraints on departures from general
relativity via such systems. Using an ensemble of simulated events, we focus on
the gravitational slip parameter $\gamma_{\rm PN}$ in screened modified gravity
models and show that FRB time-delay measurements can yield constraints as tight
as $ \left| \gamma_{\rm PN}-1\right| \lesssim 0.04\times(\Lambda/100\rm

interventions. Here we consider a framework borrowed from biology that involves
multiple interventions from different contexts (observations and experiments)
in a single analysis. The method is called perturbation graphs. In gene
regulatory networks, the induced change in one gene is measured on all other
genes in the analysis, thereby assessing possible causal relations. This is
repeated for each gene in the analysis. A perturbation graph leads to the
correct set of causes (not necessarily direct causes). Subsequent pruning of
paths in the graph (called transitive reduction) should reveal direct causes.
We show that transitive reduction will not in general lead to the correct
underlying graph. There is however a close relation with another method, called
invariant causal prediction. Invariant causal prediction can be considered as a
generalisation of the perturbation graph method where including additional
variables (and so conditioning on those variables) does reveal direct causes,
and thereby replacing transitive reduction. We explain the basic ideas of
perturbation graphs, transitive reduction and invariant causal prediction and
investigate their connections. We conclude that perturbation graphs provide a
promising new tool for experimental designs in psychology, and combined with
invariant prediction make it possible to reveal direct causes instead of causal
paths. As an illustration we apply the perturbation graphs and invariant causal
prediction to a data set about attitudes on meat consumption.

approach for uncertain Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) multibody systems with

consist in building the nonlinear model of the whole structure and linearizing
it around equilibrium after a numerical trimming, do not allow to isolate
parametric variations with the LFT form. Although additional techniques, such
as polynomial fitting or symbolic linearization, can provide an LFT model, they
may be time-consuming or miss worst-case configurations. The proposed approach
relies on the trimming and linearization of the equations at the substructure
level, before assembly of the multibody structure, which allows to only perform
operations that preserve the LFT form throughout the linearization process.
Since the physical origin of the parameters is retained, the linearized LFT-LPV
model of the structure exactly covers all plants, in a single parametric model,
without introducing conservatism or fitting errors. An application to the
LFT-LPV modeling of a robotic arm is proposed; in its nominal configuration,
the model obtained with the proposed approach matches the model provided by the
software Simscape Multibody, but it is enhanced with parametric variations with
the LFT form; a robust LPV synthesis is performed using Matlab robust control
toolbox to illustrate the capacity of the proposed approach for control design.

CD* test are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and are shown to have the
correct size and satisfactory power for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors.
In contrast, it is found that JR's test tends to over-reject in the case of
panels with non-Gaussian errors, and have low power against spatial network
alternatives. The use of the CD* test is illustrated with two empirical

network dynamic behaviour. Nevertheless, beyond topological symmetry, one
should consider the fact that real-world networks are exposed to fluctuations
or errors, as well as mistaken insertions or removals. Therefore, the resulting
approximate symmetries remain hidden to standard symmetry analysis - fully
accomplished by discrete algebra software. There have been a number of attempts
to deal with approximate symmetries. In the present work we provide an
alternative notion of these weaker symmetries, which we call
`quasi-symmetries'. Differently from other definitions, quasi-symmetries remain
free to impose any invariance of a particular network property and they are
obtained from the phase differences at the steady-state configuration of an
oscillatory dynamical model: the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. The analysis of
quasi-symmetries unveils otherwise hidden real-world networks attributes. On
the one hand, we provide a benchmark to determine whether a network has a more
complex pattern than that of a random network with regard to quasi-symmetries,
namely, if it is structured into separate quasi-symmetric groups of nodes. On
the other hand, we define the `dual-network', a weighted network (and its
corresponding binnarized counterpart) that effectively encodes all the
information of quasi-symmetries in the original network. The latter is a
powerful instrument for obtaining worthwhile insights about node centrality
(obtaining the nodes that are unique from that act as imitators with respect to
the others) and community detection ( quasi-symmetric groups of nodes).

agents collaborate to achieve one task, is typical in human-AI collaboration.
For effective collaboration, humans want to have an effective plan, but in
realistic situations, they might have difficulty calculating the best plan due
to cognitive limitations. In this case, guidance from an agent that has many
computational resources may be useful. However, if an agent guides the human
behavior explicitly, the human may feel that they have lost autonomy and are
being controlled by the agent. We therefore investigated implicit guidance
offered by means of an agent's behavior. With this type of guidance, the agent
acts in a way that makes it easy for the human to find an effective plan for a
collaborative task, and the human can then improve the plan. Since the human
improves their plan voluntarily, he or she maintains autonomy. We modeled a
collaborative agent with implicit guidance by integrating the Bayesian Theory
of Mind into existing collaborative-planning algorithms and demonstrated
through a behavioral experiment that implicit guidance is effective for
enabling humans to maintain a balance between improving their plans and

activity $\chi$ of the system. From constant density simulations, we observe
that the hot and cold dumbbells phase separate at high activity ratio ($\chi >
5.80$). The critical activity of dumbbells is higher compared to that of a
mixture of hot and cold Lennard-Jones monomers ($\chi > 3.44$). The extent of
phase separation is greater for high density. As activity increases, the cold
dumbbells cohere to form a large cluster indicating increased phase separation
which is quantified by an order parameter. On phase separation, the effective
volume of the hot dumbbells increases which leads to the increase in their
entropy which is calculated by two-phase thermodynamic(2PT) method. Also, the
phase separation pushes the cold dumbbells to form a dense cluster which
develops crystalline order with pre-dominantly FCC and HCP packing, but the
individual dumbbells have random orientations. The high kinetic pressure of hot
dumbbells is balanced by the virial pressure of cold dumbbells. The simulation

Existing outlier tests generally implement leave-one-out analyses, but these do
not account for the fact that the event being left out was by definition an
extreme member of the population. This results in a bias in the evaluation of
outliers. We correct for this bias by introducing a coarse-graining framework
to investigate whether these extremal events are true outliers or whether they
are consistent with the rest of the observed population. Our method enables us
to study extremal events while testing for population model misspecification.
We show that this ameliorates biases present in the leave-one-out analyses

results from the second LIGO--Virgo transient catalog, we find qualitative
agreement with the conclusions of Abbott et al, ApJL 913 L7 (2021). GW190814 is

to explore how X-ray spectro-polarimetry can be used to derive the basic
geometrical properties of the absorbing and reflecting matter. In particular,
the expected polarisation of the radiation reflected off the disc and the
putative outflow is calculated. We use \textit{NuSTAR} data collected after the
flux drop to derive the parameters of the system from hard X-ray spectroscopy.
The spectroscopic parameters are then used to derive the expected polarimetric
signal, using results from a MonteCarlo radiative transfer code both in the
case of neutral and fully ionised matter. From the spectral analysis, we find
that the continuum emission becomes softer with increasing flux, and that in
all flux levels the obscuring matter is highly ionised. This analysis, on the
other hand, confirms that spectroscopy alone is unable to put constraints on
the geometry of the reflectors. Simulations show that X-ray polarimetric
observations, like those that will be provided soon by the Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), will help to determine the geometrical parameters
which are left unconstrained by the spectroscopic analysis.

comets, asteroids, and micrometeoroids. So far, the source of the volatiles
sampled by the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) plume
has remained undetermined. We show here that the source could not be volcanic
outgassing and the composition is best explained by cometary impacts. Ruling
out a volcanic source means that volatiles in the top 1-3 meters of the Cabeus

billion years ago; Gya).

Direct numerical simulations of separation hysteresis induced by variation of

that the reversed-flow singularity of Smith (Proceedings of the Royal Society

temporal behaviour of an off-axis observed GRB afterglow can be used to reveal
the lateral jet structure, and statistical model fits can put constraints on
the various model free-parameters. Amongst these parameters is the inclination
of the system to the line of sight. Along with the GW detection, the afterglow
modelling provides the best constraint on the inclination to the line-of-sight
and can improve the estimates of cosmological parameters e.g. the Hubble

producing higher loads in the lumbar spine. Even though recent biomechanical
studies challenge these assumptions, conclusive evidence is still lacking. This
study therefore aimed at comparing lumbar loads among different lifting styles
using a comprehensive state-of-the-art motion capture-driven musculoskeletal
modeling approach. Thirty healthy pain-free individuals were enrolled in this
study and asked to repetitively lift a 15 kg-box by applying 1) a freestyle, 2)
a squat and 3) a stoop lifting technique. Whole-body kinematics were recorded
using an optical motion capture system and used to drive a full-body
musculoskeletal model including a detailed thoracolumbar spine. Compressive,
shear and total loads were calculated based on a static optimization approach
and expressed as factor body weight (BW). In addition, lumbar lordosis angles
and total lifting time were calculated. All parameters were compared among the
lifting styles using a repeated measures design. For all lumbar segments, stoop
lifting showed significantly lower compressive and total loads (-0.3 to -1.0BW)
when compared to freestyle and squat lifting. Stoop lifting produced higher
shear loads (+0.1 to +0.8BW) in the segments T12/L1 to L4/L5, but lower loads
in L5/S1 (-0.2 to -0.4BW). Peak compressive and total loads during squat
lifting occurred approximately 30% earlier in the lifting cycle compared to
stoop lifting. Stoop lifting showed larger lumbar lordosis range of motion
(35.9+/-10.1{\deg}) than freestyle (24.2+/-7.3{\deg}) and squat
(25.1+/-8.2{\deg}) lifting. Lifting time differed significantly with freestyle
being executed the fastest (4.6+/-0.7s), followed by squat (4.9+/-0.7s) and

interactions of DOX and its partitioning into liposomal membranes. To get a
rational insight into this aspect and determine promising lipid compositions,
we use numerical simulations, which provide unique information on DOX-membrane

classical molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to
elucidate the mechanism of penetration of a protonated Doxorubicin molecule

further investigations of optimal formulations for lipid-based carriers, such

dynamics as well as the spread of infectious diseases. To characterize the
dynamics of their growth or spread, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ has
received considerable attention. In the context of infectious diseases, it is
usually defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by an
infectious case in a completely susceptible population. Typically $R_0>1$
indicates that an outbreak is expected to continue and to grow exponentially,
while $R_0<1$ usually indicates that an outbreak is expected to terminate after
some time.
  In this work, we show that fluctuations of the dynamics in time can lead to a
continuation of outbreaks even when the expected number of secondary cases from
a single case is below $1$. Such fluctuations are usually neglected in
modelling of infectious diseases by a set of ordinary differential equations,
such as the classic SIR model. We showcase three examples: 1) extinction
following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, 2) extinction switching randomly
between two values and 3) mixing of two populations with different $R_0$
values. We corroborate our analytical findings with computer simulations.

strengths cannot be directly obtained from radar sensing. We first propose the
concept of SS-OTFS modulation, where the key novelty is the angular domain
discretization enabled by the spatial-spreading/de-spreading. This
discretization gives rise to simple and insightful effective models for both
radar sensing and communication, which result in simplified designs for the
related estimation and detection problems. In particular, we design simple beam
tracking, angle estimation, and power allocation schemes for radar sensing, by
utilizing the special structure of the effective radar sensing matrix.
Meanwhile, we provide a detailed analysis on the pair-wise error probability
(PEP) for communication, which unveils the key conditions for both precoding
and power allocation designs. Based on those conditions, we design a
symbol-wise precoding scheme for communication based only on the delay,
Doppler, and angle estimates from radar sensing, without the a priori knowledge
of the communication channel fading coefficients, and also introduce the power
allocation for communication. Furthermore, we notice that radar sensing and
communication requires different power allocations. Therefore, we discuss the
performances of both the radar sensing and communication with different power
allocations and show that the power allocation should be designed leaning
towards radar sensing in practical scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed
ISAC transmission framework is verified by our numerical results, which also
agree with our analysis and discussions.

becomes a crucial concern in the design of long-span bridges. This paper
investigates the nonlinear interaction between the gust-induced and
motion-induced forces acting on bridge decks using the Vortex Particle Method
(VPM) as a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. This nonlinear
interaction is complex and intractable by the conventional linear
semi-analytical models that employ the superposition principle. To excite such
interaction, a sinusoidally oscillating bridge deck is subjected to sinusoidal
vertical gusts. Two distinct aspects are studied: The influence of large-scale
sinusoidal vertical gusts on the shear layer of a moving body and the nonlinear
dependence of the aerodynamic forces on the effective angle of attack. For the
latter, the resultant aerodynamic forces based on a linear semi-analytical and
a CFD model are compared for the same effective angle of attack due to
sinusoidal gust and motion. The methodology is first employed to verify the
linear behavior of a flat plate and then study the nonlinear behavior of two
bridge decks. The results show that the linear superposition principle holds
for streamlined bridge decks with minimal shear layer instability. However,
this principle may not be valid for bluff bridge decks due to strong separation
vortices that dictate the shear layer, which induces nonlinearity in the
aerodynamic forces manifested through amplitude difference in the first
harmonic and emergence of higher-order harmonics. The outcome of this study
aims to provide a deeper understanding of the complex nonlinear fluid-structure
interaction occurring for bluff bodies subjected to motion and free-stream
gusts.

  Shapes",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The manual annotation for large-scale point clouds costs a lot of time and is
usually unavailable in harsh real-world scenarios. Inspired by the great
success of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in both vision and
language tasks, we argue that pre-training is one potential solution for
obtaining a scalable model to 3D point cloud downstream tasks as well. In this
paper, we, therefore, explore a new self-supervised learning method, called
Mixing and Disentangling (MD), for 3D point cloud representation learning. As
the name implies, we mix two input shapes and demand the model learning to
separate the inputs from the mixed shape. We leverage this reconstruction task
as the pretext optimization objective for self-supervised learning. There are
two primary advantages: 1) Compared to prevailing image datasets, eg, ImageNet,
point cloud datasets are de facto small. The mixing process can provide a much
larger online training sample pool. 2) On the other hand, the disentangling
process motivates the model to mine the geometric prior knowledge, eg, key
points. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed pretext task, we build one
baseline network, which is composed of one encoder and one decoder. During
pre-training, we mix two original shapes and obtain the geometry-aware
embedding from the encoder, then an instance-adaptive decoder is applied to
recover the original shapes from the embedding. Albeit simple, the pre-trained
encoder can capture the key points of an unseen point cloud and surpasses the
encoder trained from scratch on downstream tasks. The proposed method has
improved the empirical performance on both ModelNet-40 and ShapeNet-Part
datasets in terms of point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. We
further conduct ablation studies to explore the effect of each component and
verify the generalization of our proposed strategy by harnessing different
backbones.

distinction to energy efficiency, we define sufficiency as behavioral changes
to reduce useful energy without significantly reducing utility, for example by
adjusting thermostats. By reducing demand, sufficiency measures are a
potentially decisive but seldomly considered factor to support the
transformation towards a decarbonized energy system. Therefore, this paper
addresses the following question: What is the potential of sufficiency measures
and what is their impacts on the supply side of a 100% renewable energy system?
For this purpose, an extensive literature review is conducted to obtain
estimates for the effects of different sufficiency measures on final energy
demand in Germany. Afterwards, the impact of these measures on the supply side
and system costs is quantified using a bottom-up planning model of a renewable

a patch based classification approach and fuse this with a thresholding based
approach to segment the mostly darker crack pixels. The classifier assists in
suppressing noise from the background regions, which commonly are incorrectly
highlighted as cracks by standard thresholding methods. Then, the pseudo labels
can be used in an end-to-end approach when training a standard CNN for surface

difficult to apply to systems employing ML where there is no clear, pre-defined
specification against which to assess validity. This problem is exacerbated by
the ""opaque"" nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human
scrutiny. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue
by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help
users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work
explicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the
context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can
contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete
ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from
mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to
produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented
in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute
to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that XAI methods have a valuable role in
safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not
sufficient in themselves to assure safety.

  in Dataset Bias Mitigation Techniques","Findings of EMNLP, 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Existing techniques for mitigating dataset bias often leverage a biased model
to identify biased instances. The role of these biased instances is then
reduced during the training of the main model to enhance its robustness to
out-of-distribution data. A common core assumption of these techniques is that
the main model handles biased instances similarly to the biased model, in that
it will resort to biases whenever available. In this paper, we show that this
assumption does not hold in general. We carry out a critical investigation on
two well-known datasets in the domain, MNLI and FEVER, along with two biased
instance detection methods, partial-input and limited-capacity models. Our
experiments show that in around a third to a half of instances, the biased
model is unable to predict the main model's behavior, highlighted by the
significantly different parts of the input on which they base their decisions.
Based on a manual validation, we also show that this estimate is highly in line
with human interpretation. Our findings suggest that down-weighting of
instances detected by bias detection methods, which is a widely-practiced
procedure, is an unnecessary waste of training data. We release our code to
facilitate reproducibility and future research.

progressively important for various applications, yet at the high expense of
requiring large-scale data labelling. To overcome the problem of expensive data
labelling, domain adaptation techniques have been proposed that transfers
knowledge from fully labelled data (i.e., source domain) to unlabelled data
(i.e., target domain). The majority of video domain adaptation algorithms are
proposed for closed-set scenarios in which all the classes are shared among the
domains. In this work, we propose an open-set video domain adaptation approach
to mitigate the domain discrepancy between the source and target data, allowing
the target data to contain additional classes that do not belong to the source
domain. Different from previous works, which only focus on improving accuracy
for shared classes, we aim to jointly enhance the alignment of shared classes
and recognition of unknown samples. Towards this goal, class-conditional
extreme value theory is applied to enhance the unknown recognition.
Specifically, the entropy values of target samples are modelled as generalised
extreme value distributions, which allows separating unknown samples lying in
the tail of the distribution. To alleviate the negative transfer issue, weights
computed by the distance from the sample entropy to the threshold are leveraged
in adversarial learning in the sense that confident source and target samples
are aligned, and unconfident samples are pushed away. The proposed method has
been thoroughly evaluated on both small-scale and large-scale cross-domain
video datasets and achieved the state-of-the-art performance.

for training generative models to produce high quality synthetic data. While
WGAN-GP were initially developed to calculate the Wasserstein 1 distance
between generated and real data, recent works (e.g. [23]) have provided
empirical evidence that this does not occur, and have argued that WGAN-GP
perform well not in spite of this issue, but because of it. In this paper we
show for the first time that WGAN-GP compute the minimum of a different optimal
transport problem, the so-called congested transport [7]. Congested transport
determines the cost of moving one distribution to another under a transport
model that penalizes congestion. For WGAN-GP, we find that the congestion
penalty has a spatially varying component determined by the sampling strategy
used in [12] which acts like a local speed limit, making congestion cost less
in some regions than others. This aspect of the congested transport problem is
new, in that the congestion penalty turns out to be unbounded and depends on
the distributions to be transported, and so we provide the necessary
mathematical proofs for this setting. One facet of our discovery is a formula
connecting the gradient of solutions to the optimization problem in WGAN-GP to
the time averaged momentum of the optimal mass flow. This is in contrast to the
gradient of Kantorovich potentials for the Wasserstein 1 distance, which is
just the normalized direction of flow. Based on this and other considerations,
we speculate on how our results explain the observed performance of WGAN-GP.
Beyond applications to GANs, our theorems also point to the possibility of
approximately solving large scale congested transport problems using neural
network techniques.

resonant scattering. We compute the Hall conductivity in both tGNs for wide

squeeze and excitation block can enhance the transmission of the feature.
Finally, we integrate the two features into the SE-Densenet to identify the
spoofing attacks. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 data set show that
our model is effective for voice spoofing detection. In the logical access
scenario, our model improves the tandem decision cost function (t-DCF) and
equal error rate (EER) scores by 4% and 7%, respectively, compared with other

It is useful for audio-content analysis, speech recognition, audio-indexing,

segmentation-by-classification. This technique divides audio into small frames
and individually performs classification on these frames. In this paper, we
present a novel approach called You Only Hear Once (YOHO), which is inspired by
the YOLO algorithm popularly adopted in Computer Vision. We convert the
detection of acoustic boundaries into a regression problem instead of
frame-based classification. This is done by having separate output neurons to
detect the presence of an audio class and predict its start and end points. The
relative improvement for F-measure of YOHO, compared to the state-of-the-art
Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, ranged from 1% to 6% across multiple
datasets for audio segmentation and sound event detection. As the output of
YOHO is more end-to-end and has fewer neurons to predict, the speed of
inference is at least 6 times faster than segmentation-by-classification. In
addition, as this approach predicts acoustic boundaries directly, the
post-processing and smoothing is about 7 times faster.

extraction method via limited-budget synthetic data generation and knowledge
distillation. We investigate state-of-the-art models for sequential

given different types of synthetic data and their labels retrieved from a
black-box recommender, we extract the black-box model to a white-box model via
distillation. (2) Downstream attacks: we attack the black-box model with
adversarial samples generated by the white-box recommender. Experiments show
the effectiveness of our data-free model extraction and downstream attacks on

directly observable many-body correlators exist which preserve the quantized

geometric phase was identified as such an observable which can be used to

applications, high throughput machine learning (ML) inference servers have
become critical for online service applications. Such ML inference servers pose
two challenges: first, they must provide a bounded latency for each request to
support consistent service-level objective (SLO), and second, they can serve
multiple heterogeneous ML models in a system as certain tasks involve
invocation of multiple models and consolidating multiple models can improve
system utilization. To address the two requirements of ML inference servers,
this paper proposes a new ML inference scheduling framework for multi-model ML
inference servers. The paper first shows that with SLO constraints, current
GPUs are not fully utilized for ML inference tasks. To maximize the resource
efficiency of inference servers, a key mechanism proposed in this paper is to
exploit hardware support for spatial partitioning of GPU resources. With the
partitioning mechanism, a new abstraction layer of GPU resources is created
with configurable GPU resources. The scheduler assigns requests to virtual
GPUs, called gpu-lets, with the most effective amount of resources. The paper
also investigates a remedy for potential interference effects when two ML tasks
are running concurrently in a GPU. Our prototype implementation proves that
spatial partitioning enhances throughput by 102.6% on average while satisfying
SLOs.

promise for their ability to leverage patient clinical information and medical

models thus far have little clinical utility due to methodological flaws and
lack of appropriate validation. In this paper, we describe our methodology to
develop and validate multi-modal models for COVID-19 mortality prediction using

developed using retrospective data from Madrid, Spain (N=2547) and were
externally validated in patient cohorts from a community hospital in New
Jersey, USA (N=242) and an academic center in Seoul, Republic of Korea (N=336).
The models we developed performed differently across various clinical settings,
underscoring the need for a guided strategy when employing machine learning for
clinical decision-making. We demonstrated that using features from both the
structured electronic health records and chest X-ray imaging data resulted in
better 30-day-mortality prediction performance across all three datasets (areas

interval: 0.83-0.87), 0.76 (0.70-0.82), and 0.95 (0.92-0.98)). We discuss the
rationale for the decisions made at every step in developing the models and
have made our code available to the research community. We employed the best
machine learning practices for clinical model development. Our goal is to
create a toolkit that would assist investigators and organizations in building
multi-modal models for prediction, classification and/or optimization.

environment on applied electromagnetic fields in single small junctions as well
as arrays. We apply radio-frequency (RF) microwaves in the sub-gigahertz
frequency range on a one-dimensional array of small Josephson junctions
exhibiting distinct Coulomb blockade characteristics. We observed a gradual
lifting of Coulomb blockade with increase in the microwave power which we
interpret is due to photon-assisted tunneling of Cooper pairs in the classical
(multi-photon absorption) regime. We observe that, due to its high sensitivity
to microwave power, the array is well-suited for in situ microwave detection
applications in low temperature environments. A detailed analysis of the
characteristics in the classical (multi-photon absorption) limit reveals that
the microwave amplitude is rescaled (renormalized), which we attribute to the
difference in dc and ac voltage response of the array. We proceed to rigorously
consider the origin of the aforementioned renormalization effect by considering
the effect of the electromagnetic environment of the Josephson junction on
applied oscillating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate that its effect is
simply to renormalize the amplitude of oscillation in a predictable manner
traced to the physics of wave function renormalization (Lehmann weights)
consistent with circuit-QED. We also introduce Einstein's A and B coefficients
for small Josephson junctions, in a bid to relate the renormalization effect to
the modification of photon absorption and emission amplitudes. Such
renormalization implies that the sensitivity of the single junction and the
array to oscillating electromagnetic fields (e.g. microwaves) is modulated and
depends on the environmental impedance. The renormalization effect can be
exploited to configure `opaque', `translucent' or `transparent' quantum
circuits to microwaves.

neutrino experiment dedicated to the study of short-baseline oscillations, the
measurements of neutrino cross sections in liquid argon, and to the research
and development of this novel detector technology. Accurate and precise
measurements of calorimetry are essential to the event reconstruction and are
achieved by leveraging the TPC to measure deposited energy per unit length
along the particle trajectory, with mm resolution. We describe the non-uniform
calorimetric reconstruction performance in the detector, showing dependence on
the angle of the particle trajectory. Such non-uniform reconstruction directly
affects the performance of the particle identification algorithms which infer
particle type from calorimetric measurements. This work presents a new particle
identification method which accounts for and effectively addresses such
non-uniformity. The newly developed method shows improved performance compared
to previous algorithms, illustrated by a 94% proton selection efficiency and a
10% muon mis-identification rate, with a fairly loose selection of tracks
performed on beam data. The performance is further demonstrated by identifying
exclusive final states in $\nu_{\mu} CC$ interactions. While developed using
MicroBooNE data and simulation, this method is easily applicable to future
LArTPC experiments, such as SBND, ICARUS, and DUNE.

  Adversarial Networks for Incomplete Information Completion of Self-driving","10 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Autonomous driving is the key technology of intelligent logistics in
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In autonomous driving, the appearance of
incomplete point clouds losing geometric and semantic information is inevitable
owing to limitations of occlusion, sensor resolution, and viewing angle when
the Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is applied. The emergence of incomplete
point clouds, especially incomplete vehicle point clouds, would lead to the
reduction of the accuracy of autonomous driving vehicles in object detection,
traffic alert, and collision avoidance. Existing point cloud completion
networks, such as Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of
point cloud completion, without considering the efficiency of inference
process, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point
cloud repair in autonomous driving. To address the above problem, in this
paper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete
vehicle point cloud accurately and efficiently in autonomous driving. In the
proposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm combining incremental
sampling and one-time sampling is presented to improves the inference speed of
the PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the
performance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and an autonomous
driving scene is created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5
different sizes are set for three autonomous driving situations. The improved
PF-Net can achieve the speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when
compared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the
improved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in
autonomous driving.

expansion of space as growing entanglement between underlying degrees of

a successful empirical paradigm for early universe physics, is riddled with
ambiguities when one traces its quantum mechanical origins. We show, by
deriving a modified cosmological continuity equation, that by properly
accounting for new degrees of freedom being added to space by quantum
entanglement, inflation can naturally be driven by quantum mechanics without
having to resort to novel, unknown physics. While we explicitly focus on
inflation in our discussion, we expect this approach to have possible broad

quantized space-time. In this paper we formulate a simple model of the brain
and show that within the presented natural assumptions, the continuum has to
exist for at least some physical quantities.

induces more instability in black holes of large radii. Finally, we analyze the
phase transitions of Hawking temperature as well as heat capacity in terms of
entropy for different values of charge ($q$), horizon radius ($r_{+}$) and
coupling parameter ($\alpha$). We obtain that Hawking temperature changes its
phase from positive to negative for increasing values of $q$ and $r_{+}$ while
it shows opposite trend for higher values of $\alpha$. The heat capacity
changes its phase from negative to positive for large values of charge, horizon

past decade due to its real-world applications and research significance. While
supervised person Re-ID methods achieve superior performance over unsupervised

due to the prohibitive labelling cost. Therefore, unsupervised person Re-ID has
drawn increasing attention for its potential to address the scalability issue
in person Re-ID. Unsupervised person Re-ID is challenging primarily due to
lacking identity labels to supervise person feature learning. The corresponding
solutions are diverse and complex, with various merits and limitations.
Therefore, comprehensive surveys on this topic are essential to summarise
challenges and solutions to foster future research. Existing person Re-ID
surveys have focused on supervised methods from classifications and
applications but lack detailed discussion on how the person Re-ID solutions
address the underlying challenges. This survey review recent works on
unsupervised person Re-ID from the perspective of challenges and solutions.
Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of highly influential methods

learning discriminative person features with pseudo-supervision; 3) learning

application. Despite its societal importance, though, research progress in the
field remains rather poor. Crucially, existing methods that yield viable
performance necessitate the availability of laborious to obtain gloss sequence
groundtruth. In this paper, we attenuate this need, by introducing an
end-to-end SLT model that does not entail explicit use of glosses; the model
only needs text groundtruth. This is in stark contrast to existing end-to-end
models that use gloss sequence groundtruth, either in the form of a modality
that is recognized at an intermediate model stage, or in the form of a parallel
output process, jointly trained with the SLT model. Our approach constitutes a
Transformer network with a novel type of layers that combines: (i) local
winner-takes-all (LWTA) layers with stochastic winner sampling, instead of
conventional ReLU layers, (ii) stochastic weights with posterior distributions
estimated via variational inference, and (iii) a weight compression technique
at inference time that exploits estimated posterior variance to perform
massive, almost lossless compression. We demonstrate that our approach can
reach the currently best reported BLEU-4 score on the PHOENIX 2014T benchmark,
but without making use of glosses for model training, and with a memory
footprint reduced by more than 70%.

obtain the input values. Therefore, optimization networks are an obvious choice
