the scale variation in dense image prediction is still the key challenge. Few
effective multi-scale techniques are applied in transformer and there are two
main limitations in the current methods. On one hand, self-attention module in
vanilla transformer fails to sufficiently exploit the diversity of semantic
information because of its rigid mechanism. On the other hand, it is hard to
build attention and interaction among different levels due to the heavy
computational burden. To alleviate this problem, we first revisit multi-scale
problem in dense prediction, verifying the significance of diverse semantic
representation and multi-scale interaction, and exploring the adaptation of
transformer to pyramidal structure. Inspired by these findings, we propose a
novel Semantic-aware Decoupled Transformer Pyramid (SDTP) for dense image
prediction, consisting of Intra-level Semantic Promotion (ISP), Cross-level
Decoupled Interaction (CDI) and Attention Refinement Function (ARF). ISP
explores the semantic diversity in different receptive space. CDI builds the
global attention and interaction among different levels in decoupled space
which also solves the problem of heavy computation. Besides, ARF is further
added to refine the attention in transformer. Experimental results demonstrate
the validity and generality of the proposed method, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art by a significant margin in dense image prediction tasks.
Furthermore, the proposed components are all plug-and-play, which can be

employ numerical simulations to model near-surface bacterial motion and compute
hydrodynamic boundary effects. A common choice has been the method of images
for regularized Stokeslets (MIRS); however, the method requires discretization
sizes and regularization parameters that are not specified by any theory. To
determine appropriate regularization parameters for given discretization
choices in MIRS, we conducted dynamically similar macroscopic experiments and
fit the simulations to the data. In the experiments, we measured the torque on
cylinders and helices of different wavelengths as they rotated in a viscous
fluid at various distances to a boundary. We found that differences between
experiments and optimized simulations were less than 5\% when using surface
discretizations for cylinders and centerline discretizations for helices.
Having determined optimal regularization parameters, we used MIRS to simulate
an idealized free-swimming bacterium constructed of a cylindrical cell body and
a helical flagellum moving near a boundary. We assessed the swimming
performance of many bacterial morphologies by computing swimming speed, motor
rotation rate, Purcell's propulsive efficiency, energy cost per distance, and a
new metabolic energy cost defined to be the energy cost per body mass per
distance. All five measures predicted the same optimal flagellar wavelength
independently of body size and surface proximity. Although the measures
disagreed on the optimal body size, they all predicted that body size is an
important factor in the energy cost of bacterial motility near and far from a
surface.

the mass conservation, the summation of the volume fractions of the phases to
be unity, the consistency of reduction, and the boundedness of the order
parameters. Then, the density of the fluid mixture is updated from the
corrected order parameters. Finally, the velocity in the future time is
predicted by another NN with the same network structure, but the conservation
of momentum is included in the loss function to shrink the parameter space. The

different types of terrain for both safety (e.g., prefer dirt over mud) and

solutions to this preference-aware path planning problem use semantic
segmentation to classify terrain types from camera images, and then ascribe
costs to each type. Unfortunately, there are three key limitations of such
approaches -- they 1) require pre-enumeration of the discrete terrain types, 2)
are unable to handle hybrid terrain types (e.g., grassy dirt), and 3) require
expensive labelled data to train visual semantic segmentation. We introduce
Visual Representation Learning for Preference-Aware Path Planning (VRL-PAP), an
alternative approach that overcomes all three limitations: VRL-PAP leverages
unlabeled human demonstrations of navigation to autonomously generate triplets
for learning visual representations of terrain that are viewpoint invariant and
encode terrain types in a continuous representation space. The learned
representations are then used along with the same unlabeled human navigation
demonstrations to learn a mapping from the representation space to terrain
costs. At run time, VRL-PAP maps from images to representations and then
representations to costs to perform preference-aware path planning. We present
empirical results from challenging outdoor settings that demonstrate VRL-PAP 1)
is successfully able to pick paths that reflect demonstrated preferences, 2) is
comparable in execution to geometric navigation with a highly detailed manually
annotated map (without requiring such annotations), 3) is able to generalize to
novel terrain types with minimal additional unlabeled demonstrations.

to their simplicity. In massive data settings, however, DA algorithms are
prohibitively slow because they pass through the full data in any iteration,
imposing serious restrictions on their usage despite the advantages. Addressing
this problem, we develop a framework for extending any DA that exploits
asynchronous and distributed computing. The extended DA algorithm is indexed by
a parameter $r \in (0, 1)$ and is called Asynchronous and Distributed (AD) DA
with the original DA as its parent. Any ADDA starts by dividing the full data
into $k$ smaller disjoint subsets and storing them on $k$ processes, which
could be machines or processors. Every iteration of ADDA augments only an
$r$-fraction of the $k$ data subsets with some positive probability and leaves
the remaining $(1-r)$-fraction of the augmented data unchanged. The parameter
draws are obtained using the $r$-fraction of new and $(1-r)$-fraction of old
augmented data. For many choices of $k$ and $r$, the fractional updates of ADDA
lead to a significant speed-up over the parent DA in massive data settings, and
it reduces to the distributed version of its parent DA when $r=1$. We show that
the ADDA Markov chain is Harris ergodic with the desired stationary
distribution under mild conditions on the parent DA algorithm. We demonstrate
the numerical advantages of the ADDA in three representative examples
corresponding to different kinds of massive data settings encountered in
applications. In all these examples, our DA generalization is significantly
faster than its parent DA algorithm for all the choices of $k$ and $r$. We also
establish geometric ergodicity of the ADDA Markov chain for all three examples,
which in turn yields asymptotically valid standard errors for estimates of
desired posterior quantities.

  overlap with arXiv:2101.09962",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatially-coupled (SC) codes, known for their threshold saturation phenomenon
and low-latency windowed decoding algorithms, are ideal for streaming
applications and data storage systems. SC codes are constructed by partitioning
an underlying block code, followed by rearranging and concatenating the
partitioned components in a convolutional manner. The number of partitioned
components determines the memory of SC codes. In this paper, we investigate the
relation between the performance of SC codes and the density distribution of
partitioning matrices. While adopting higher memories results in improved SC
code performance, obtaining finite-length, high-performance SC codes with high
memory is known to be computationally challenging. We break this computational
bottleneck by developing a novel probabilistic framework that obtains (locally)
optimal density distributions via gradient descent. Starting from random
partitioning matrices abiding by the obtained distribution, we perform
low-complexity optimization algorithms that minimize the number of detrimental
objects to construct high-memory, high-performance quasi-cyclic SC codes. We
apply our framework to various objects of interests, from the simplest short
cycles, to more sophisticated objects such as concatenated cycles aiming at
finer-grained optimization. Simulation results show that codes obtained through
our proposed method notably outperform state-of-the-art SC codes with the same
constraint length and optimized SC codes with uniform partitioning. The
performance gain is shown to be universal over a variety of channels, from
canonical channels such as additive white Gaussian noise and binary symmetric
channels, to practical channels underlying flash memory and magnetic recording
systems.

degeneracy of the test with respect to these two factors remains a limitation
of abundance studies. Clusters will have different mean assembly times,
however, depending on the relative importance of initial fluctuation amplitude

concentration, shape or substructure may provide a new cosmological test that
breaks the main degeneracy in number counts. We review analytic predictions for

predictions using cosmological simulations. Given the overall sensitivity
expected, we estimate the cosmological parameter constraints that could be
derived from the cluster catalogues of forthcoming surveys such as Euclid, the

for different transitions or conformations of the molecules. In this paper, we
present a novel approach towards the study of electronic transitions based on
the visual analysis of a bivariate field, namely the electron density in the
hole and particle Natural Transition Orbital (NTO). The visual analysis focuses
on the continuous scatter plots (CSPs) of the bivariate field linked to their
spatial domain. The method supports selections in the CSP visualized as fiber
surfaces in the spatial domain, the grouping of atoms, and segmentation of the
density fields to peel the CSP. This peeling operator is central to the visual
analysis process and helps identify donors and acceptors. We study different
molecular systems, identifying local excitation and charge transfer excitations
to demonstrate the utility of the method.

turbine power production and impact the blade fatigue loads raises more
attention along with the rapid development of large-scale wind turbines. The
state-of-the-art correction methods require additional instruments such as
LiDAR to provide the ground truths and are not suitable for long-term operation
and large-scale implementation due to the high costs. In the present study, we
propose a framework that enables the effective and efficient detection and
correction of static and dynamic yaw errors by using only turbine SCADA data,
suitable for a low-cost regular inspection for large-scale wind farms in
onshore, coastal, and offshore sites. This framework includes a short-period
data collection of the turbine operating under multiple static yaw errors, a
data mining correction for the static yaw error, and ultra-short-term dynamic
yaw error forecasts with machine learning algorithms. Three regression
algorithms, i.e., linear, support vector machine, and random forest, and a
hybrid model based on the average prediction of the three, have been tested for
dynamic yaw error prediction and compared using the field measurement data from
a 2.5 MW turbine. For the data collected in the present study, the hybrid
method shows the best performance and can reduce total yaw error by up to 85%
(on average of 71%) compared to the cases without static and dynamic yaw error
corrections. In addition, we have tested the transferability of the proposed
method in the application of detecting other static and dynamic yaw errors.

a well-studied parameter space, lying at the interface of algebraic geometry,
commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and mathematical
physics. The foundational result is a classical theorem of Fogarty, stating
that $\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$ is a smooth variety of dimension $2n$. In recent
years there has been growing interest in a natural generalization of
$\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$, the nested Hilbert scheme $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n_1,n_2)}(S)$,
which parametrizes nested pairs of zero-dimensional subschemes $Z_1 \supseteq
Z_2$ of $S$ with $\mathrm{deg} (Z_i)=n_i$. In contrast to Fogarty's theorem,
$\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n_1,n_2)}(S)$ is almost always singular, and very little is
known about its singularities. In this paper we aim to advance the knowledge of
the geometry of these nested Hilbert schemes. Work by Fogarty in the 70's shows
that $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n,1)}(S)$ is a normal Cohen-Macaulay variety, and Song
more recently proved that it has rational singularities. In our main result, we
prove that the nested Hilbert scheme $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n,2)}(S)$ has rational
singularities. We employ an array of tools from commutative algebra to prove
this theorem. Using Gr\""obner bases, we establish a connection between
$\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n,2)}(S)$ and a certain variety of matrices with an action of
the general linear group. This variety of matrices plays a central role in our
work, and we analyze it by various algebraic techniques, including square-free
Gr\""obner degenerations, the Stanley-Reisner correspondence, and the
Kempf-Lascoux-Weyman technique of calculating syzygies. Along the way, we also
obtain results on classes of irreducible and reducible nested Hilbert schemes,
dimension of singular loci, and $F$-singularities in positive characteristic.

high-resolution generative adversarial network (GAN). Our contribution is
three-fold: (1) a single deep network framework is proposed to tackle missing
stain in MxIF; (2) the proposed 'N-to-N' strategy reduces theoretical four
years of computational time to 20 hours when covering all possible missing
stains scenarios, with up to five missing stains (e.g., '(N-1)-to-1',
'(N-2)-to-2'); and (3) this work is the first comprehensive experimental study

promising direction of advancing MxIF imaging with deep image synthesis.

a network of seismometers into individual earthquakes and play an important
role in earthquake monitoring. Dense seismic networks and improved phase
picking methods produce massive earthquake phase data sets, particularly for
earthquake swarms and aftershocks occurring closely in time and space, making
phase association a challenging problem. We present a new association method,
the Gaussian Mixture Model Association (GaMMA), that combines the Gaussian
mixture model for phase measurements (both time and amplitude), with earthquake
location, origin time, and magnitude estimation. We treat earthquake phase
association as an unsupervised clustering problem in a probabilistic framework,
where each earthquake corresponds to a cluster of P and S phases with
hyperbolic moveout of arrival times and a decay of amplitude with distance. We
use a multivariate Gaussian distribution to model the collection of phase picks
for an event, the mean of which is given by the predicted arrival time and
amplitude from the causative event. We carry out the pick assignment for each
earthquake and determine earthquake parameters (i.e., earthquake location,
origin time, and magnitude) under the maximum likelihood criterion using the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The GaMMA method does not require the
typical association steps of other algorithms, such as grid-search or
supervised training. The results on both synthetic test and the 2019 Ridgecrest
earthquake sequence show that GaMMA effectively associates phases from a
temporally and spatially dense earthquake sequence while producing useful
estimates of earthquake location and magnitude.

case when $f(t,X)=-\lambda\kappa t^{\kappa-1}X$ and $g(t,X)=\mu X$. The
solution is explicit and is mean-square stable when $\kappa\geq 2H$. It is
proved that if the parameter $2H\leq\kappa\le 3/2$ and $\frac{\sqrt{3/2}\cdot
e}{\sqrt{3/2}\cdot e+1} (\approx 0.77)\leq \theta\leq 1$ or $\kappa>3/2$ and
$1/2<\theta\le 1$, the stochastic theta method reproduces the mean-square
stability; and that if $0<\theta<\frac 12$, the numerical method does not
preserve this stability unconditionally. Secondly, we study the stability of
the solution and its stochastic theta scheme for nonlinear equations. Due to
the presence of long memory, even the problem of stability in the mean square
sense of the solution has not been well studied since the conventional
techniques powerful for stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian

are even able to generate samples with rare or unseen combinations of

constraint on each sub-channel for multi-cell wireless networks. To address
this problem, a distributed sub-optimal joint power and rate control algorithm
called JPRC is proposed, which is applicable to both non-orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency-division
multiple access (OFDMA) schemes. Employing JPRC, each user updates its transmit
power using only local information. Simulation results illustrate that the JPRC
algorithm can reach a performance close to that obtained by the optimal
solution via exhaustive search, with the NOMA scheme achieving a 59\%
improvement on the aggregate transmit power over the OFDMA counterpart. It is
also shown that the JPRC algorithm can outperform existing distributed power
control algorithms.

critical in that point of time. In this type of highly imbalanced
classification problems, which encompass complex features, deep learning (DL)
is much needed because of its strong detection capabilities. At the same time,
DL is observed in practice to favor majority over minority classes and
consequently suffer from inaccurate detection of the targeted early-stage
indications. In this work, we extend the study done by Kocaman et al., 2020,
showing that the final BN layer, when placed before the softmax output layer,
has a considerable impact in highly imbalanced image classification problems as
well as undermines the role of the softmax outputs as an uncertainty measure.
This current study addresses additional hypotheses and reports on the following
findings: (i) the performance gain after adding the final BN layer in highly
imbalanced settings could still be achieved after removing this additional BN
layer in inference; (ii) there is a certain threshold for the imbalance ratio
upon which the progress gained by the final BN layer reaches its peak; (iii)
the batch size also plays a role and affects the outcome of the final BN
application; (iv) the impact of the BN application is also reproducible on
other datasets and when utilizing much simpler neural architectures; (v) the
reported BN effect occurs only per a single majority class and multiple
minority classes i.e., no improvements are evident when there are two majority
classes; and finally, (vi) utilizing this BN layer with sigmoid activation has
almost no impact when dealing with a strongly imbalanced image classification
tasks.

the exciton binding energy is unambiguously determined with 2% uncertainty. The

dramatically impacted. Existing studies typically examine whether mobility in
specific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time and
relate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. In this paper, we
study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility
footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the delta Time Spent in Public Places
(Delta-TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US
county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
reduce the Delta-TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent
components of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find
counties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and
global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation
analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior
correlate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county
as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of
the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change
in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three
latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in
mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. We observe significant
correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various
population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19
cases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a

air vehicles. However, the low-Reynolds-number characteristics of such wings
have not been explored in the past. In this work, we numerically study laminar
separated flows over forward-swept wings with semi aspect ratios $sAR=0.5$ to 2
at a chord-based Reynolds number of 400. Forward-swept wings generate wakes
that are significantly different from those of backward-swept wings. For
low-aspect-ratio forward wings, the wakes remain steady due to the strong
downwash effects induced by the tip vortices. For larger aspect ratio, the
downwash effects weaken over the inboard regions of the wing, allowing unsteady
vortex shedding to occur. Further larger aspect ratio allows for the formation
of streamwise vortices for highly-swept wings, stabilizing the flow.
Forward-swept wings can generate enhanced lift at high angles of attack than
the unswept and backward-swept wings, with the cost of high drag. We show
through force element analysis that the increased lift of forward-swept wings
is attributed to the vortical structure that is maintained by the
tip-vortex-induced downwash over the outboard region of wing span. The current
findings offer a detailed understanding of the sweep effects on laminar
separated flows over forward-swept wings, and invite innovative designs of

through adversarial learning, yet still suffer from two limitations. First,
they mainly align marginal distribution by unsupervised cross-domain feature

can be exploited for conditional alignment; Second, they treat all classes as
equally important for transferring cross-domain knowledge and ignore that
different classes usually have different transferability. In this paper, we

object detection is proposed, which aligns both marginal and conditional
distributions between domains without introducing any extra hyperparameter.
Next, to consider the transferability of each object class, a metric for
class-wise transferability assessment is proposed, which is incorporated into
the JADF objective for domain adaptation. Further, an extended study from
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to unsupervised few-shot domain adaptation
(UFDA) is conducted, where only a few unlabeled training images are available
in unlabeled target domain. Extensive experiments validate that JADF is
effective in both the UDA and UFDA settings, achieving significant performance

sentences. In this work, we propose a novel model to enrich
distantly-supervised sentences with entity types. It consists of (1) a pairwise
type-enriched sentence encoding module injecting both context-free and -related
backgrounds to alleviate sentence-level wrong labeling, and (2) a hierarchical
type-sentence alignment module enriching a sentence with the triple fact's
basic attributes to support long-tail relations. Our model achieves new
state-of-the-art results in overall and long-tail performance on benchmarks.

Regularized Q-learning} (MARQ). Many MARL approaches leverage centralized
structures in order to exploit global state information or removing
communication constraints when the agents act in a decentralized manner.
Instead of learning redundant structures which is removed during agent
execution, we propose instead to leverage shared experiences of the agents to
regularize the individual policies in order to promote structured exploration.
We examine several different approaches to how MARQ can either explicitly or
implicitly regularize our policies in a multi-agent setting. MARQ aims to
address these limitations in the MARL context through applying regularization
constraints which can correct bias in off-policy out-of-distribution agent
experiences and promote diverse exploration. Our algorithm is evaluated on
several benchmark multi-agent environments and we show that MARQ consistently
outperforms several baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms; learning in
fewer steps and converging to higher returns.

projection (idempotent) valued dilation for any quantum measure over the
projection lattice for a von Neumann algebra that dose not contain type $I_{2}$
direct summand, such a dilation does not necessarily guarantee the preservation
of countable additivity of the quantum measure. So it remain an open question
whether every countably additive $B(X)$-valued quantum measure can be dilated
to a countably additive projection-valued measure.The main purpose of this
paper is to prove that such a dilation can be constructed if one of the
following two conditions is satisfied: (i) the underling Banach space $X =
\ell_{p}$ $(1\leq p < 2$) or it has Schur property, (ii) the quantum measure
has bounded $p$-variation for some $ 1\leq p < \infty $. All of these were
achieved by establishing a non-commutative version of a minimal dilation theory

dilation norm. In particular, the newly introduced $p$-variation norm on the

crucial to fairly evaluate the quality of the data provided by the data owners

Wang et al. [Federated Learning, 2020], is a measure for data value under the
framework of federated learning that satisfies many desired properties for data

completed federated Shapley value to improve the fairness of federated Shapley
value. The design depends on completing a matrix consisting of all the possible
contributions by different subsets of the data owners. It is shown under mild
conditions that this matrix is approximately low-rank by leveraging concepts

verify that the proposed measure does improve fairness in many circumstances.

cyclic codes that have found numerous applications in error correction and
notably in quantum information processing. A subclass of attractive BCH codes
is the narrow-sense BCH codes over the Galois field $\mathrm{GF}(q)$ with
length $q+1$, which are closely related to the action of the projective general
linear group of degree two on the projective line. This paper aims to study
some of the codes within this class and specifically narrow-sense antiprimitive
BCH codes (these codes are also linear complementary duals (LCD) codes that
have interesting practical recent applications in cryptography, among other
benefits). We shall use tools and combine arguments from algebraic coding
theory, combinatorial designs, and group theory (group actions, representation
theory of finite groups, etc.) to investigate narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH
Codes and extend results from the recent literature. Notably, the dimension,
the minimum distance of some $q$-ary BCH codes with length $q+1$, and their
duals are determined in this paper. The dual codes of the narrow-sense
antiprimitive BCH codes derived in this paper include almost MDS codes.
Furthermore, the classification of $\mathrm{PGL} (2, p^m)$-invariant codes over
$\mathrm{GF} (p^h)$ is completed.
  As an application of this result, the $p$-ranks of all incidence structures
invariant under the projective general linear group $\mathrm{ PGL }(2, p^m)$
are determined.
  Furthermore, infinite families of narrow-sense BCH codes admitting a
$3$-transitive automorphism group are obtained.
  Via these BCH codes, a coding-theory approach to constructing the Witt
spherical geometry designs is presented.
  The BCH codes proposed in this paper are good candidates for permutation
decoding, as they have a relatively large group of automorphisms.

ignore the high dependence between the large number of phase shifts and
estimate them separately, consequently, easily getting trapped into local
optima. To investigate the number and distribution of local optima, we conduct
a fitness landscape analysis on the sum rate maximization problems. Two
landscape features, the fitness distribution correlation and autocorrelation,
are employed to investigate the ruggedness of landscape. The investigation
results indicate that the landscape exhibits a rugged, multi-modal structure,
i.e., has many local peaks, particularly in the cases with large-scale RISs. To
handle the multi-modal landscape structure, we propose a novel niching genetic

population into several neighborhood species, thereby locating multiple local

however, lack proper reasoning abilities necessary to find counterevidence that
involves complex inference. Thus, we present a knowledge-enhanced NLI model
that aims to handle causality- and example-based inference by incorporating
knowledge graphs. Our NLI model outperforms baselines for NLI tasks, especially
for instances that require the targeted inference. In addition, this NLI model
further improves the counterevidence retrieval system, notably finding complex
counterevidence better.

a symmetry-preserving Schwinger-Dyson equations treatment of a vector-vector

simultaneously describes mesons and provides attractive correlations for
diquarks in the $\overline{3}$ representation. Employing this model, we compute
the spectrum and masses of all spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryons of negative

containing 1, 2 or 3 heavy quarks. In the process, we calculate masses of a
multitude of mesons and corresponding diquarks. Wherever possible, we make

the past decade. To match their increasing computational needs, several
Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) crossbar based accelerators have been proposed.
Recently, researchers have shown that apart from improved energy efficiency and
performance, such approximate hardware also possess intrinsic robustness for
defense against adversarial attacks. Prior works quantified this intrinsic
robustness for vanilla DNNs trained on unperturbed inputs. However, adversarial
training of DNNs is the benchmark technique for robustness, and sole reliance
on intrinsic robustness of the hardware may not be sufficient. In this work, we
explore the design of robust DNNs through the amalgamation of adversarial
training and intrinsic robustness of NVM crossbar-based analog hardware. First,
we study the noise stability of such networks on unperturbed inputs and observe
that internal activations of adversarially trained networks have lower
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and are sensitive to noise compared to vanilla
networks. As a result, they suffer on average 2x performance degradation due to
the approximate computations on analog hardware. Noise stability analyses show
the instability of adversarially trained DNNs. On the other hand, for
adversarial images generated using Square Black Box attacks, ResNet-10/20
adversarially trained on CIFAR-10/100 display a robustness gain of 20-30%. For
adversarial images generated using Projected-Gradient-Descent (PGD) White-Box
attacks, adversarially trained DNNs present a 5-10% gain in robust accuracy due
to underlying NVM crossbar when $\epsilon_{attack}$ is greater than
$\epsilon_{train}$. Our results indicate that implementing adversarially
trained networks on analog hardware requires careful calibration between
hardware non-idealities and $\epsilon_{train}$ for optimum robustness and
performance.

applications of long-distance quantum communication. However, the hot-atom SFWM
biphoton sources previously had far lower values of generation rate per
linewidth, i.e., spectral brightness, as compared with the sources of biphotons
generated by the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process. Here,
we report a hot-atom SFWM source of biphotons with a linewidth of 960 kHz and a
generation rate of 3.7$\times$ $10^5$ pairs/s. The high generation rate,
together with the narrow linewidth, results in a spectral brightness of
3.8$\times$ $10^5$ pairs/s/MHz, which is 17 times of the previous best result
with atomic vapors and also better than all known results with all kinds of
media. The all-copropagating scheme together with a large optical depth (OD) of
the atomic vapor is the key improvement, enabling the achieved spectral
brightness to be about one quarter of the ultimate limit. Furthermore, this
biphoton source had a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 2.7, which violated
the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for classical light by about 3.6 folds. Although
an increasing spectral brightness usually leads to a decreasing SBR, our
systematic study indicates that both of the present spectral brightness and SBR

quantization voltage level and phase shift used in the feedback loop of 1-bit

develop a quantization noise model for 1-bit spatial sigma-delta ADCs. Using
the developed noise model, we then present a two-step channel estimation
algorithm to estimate a multipath channel parameterized by the gains, angles of
arrival (AoAs), and angles of departure (AoDs). Specifically, in the first
step, the AoAs and path gains are estimated using uplink pilots, which excite
all the angles uniformly. Next, in the second step, the AoDs are estimated by
progressively refining uplink beams through a recursive bisection procedure.
For this algorithm, we propose a technique to select the quantization voltage
level and phase shift. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that with
the proposed parametric channel estimation algorithm, MIMO systems with 1-bit

language processing (NLP) settings. The main goal is to make models robust so
that similar inputs derive in semantically similar outcomes, which is not a
trivial problem since there is no objective measure of semantic similarity in
language. Previous works use an external pre-trained NLP model to tackle this
challenge, introducing an extra training stage with huge memory consumption
during training. However, the recent popular approach of contrastive learning
in language processing hints a convenient way of obtaining such similarity
restrictions. The main advantage of the contrastive learning approach is that
it aims for similar data points to be mapped close to each other and further
from different ones in the representation space. In this work, we propose
adversarial training with contrastive learning (ATCL) to adversarially train a

idea is to make linear perturbations in the embedding space of the input via
fast gradient methods (FGM) and train the model to keep the original and
perturbed representations close via contrastive learning. In NLP experiments,
we applied ATCL to language modeling and neural machine translation tasks. The
results show not only an improvement in the quantitative (perplexity and BLEU)

  Learning (poster)",,,"cs.LG physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The prediction of future climate scenarios under anthropogenic forcing is
critical to understand climate change and to assess the impact of potentially
counter-acting technologies. Machine learning and hybrid techniques for this
prediction rely on informative metrics that are sensitive to pertinent but
often subtle influences. For atmospheric dynamics, a critical part of the
climate system, no well established metric exists and visual inspection is
currently still often used in practice. However, this ""eyeball metric"" cannot
be used for machine learning where an algorithmic description is required.
Motivated by the success of intermediate neural network activations as basis
for learned metrics, e.g. in computer vision, we present a novel,
self-supervised representation learning approach specifically designed for
atmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on
a simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of
a randomly shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g. the components of the
wind field from reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network to learn
important intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers and from
these hence a discriminative metric can be obtained. We demonstrate this by
using AtmoDist to define a metric for GAN-based super resolution of vorticity
and divergence. Our upscaled data matches both visually and in terms of its
statistics a high resolution reference closely and it significantly outperform

extended sources from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations.
Our approach is based on an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that
uses a low number of convolutional layers to provide a scalable solution for
source detection. In addition, DECORAS performs source characterization in
terms of the position, effective radius and peak brightness of the detected
sources. We have trained and tested the network with images that are based on
realistic Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 20 cm. Also, these
images have not gone through any prior de-convolution step and are directly
related to the visibility data via a Fourier transform. We find that the source
catalog generated by DECORAS has a better overall completeness and purity, when
compared to a traditional source detection algorithm. DECORAS is complete at
the 7.5$\sigma$ level, and has an almost factor of two improvement in
reliability at 5.5$\sigma$. We find that DECORAS can recover the position of
the detected sources to within 0.61 $\pm$ 0.69 mas, and the effective radius
and peak surface brightness are recovered to within 20 per cent for 98 and 94
per cent of the sources, respectively. Overall, we find that DECORAS provides a
reliable source detection and characterization solution for future wide-field
VLBI surveys.

corresponds to finding the size of the largest subset of queries that `overlap'
on the data domain, a quantity we call the \emph{maximum overlap} of the
queries. It has previously been shown that a certain instance of this problem,
formulated in terms of determining the sensitivity of the queries, is NP-hard,
but also that it is possible to use graph-theoretic algorithms, such as finding
the maximum clique, to approximate query sensitivity. In this paper, we
consider a significant generalization of the aforementioned instance which
encompasses both a wider range of differentially private mechanisms and a
broader class of queries. We show that for a particular class of predicate
queries, determining if they are disjoint can be done in time polynomial in the
number of attributes. For this class, we show that the maximum overlap problem
remains NP-hard as a function of the number of queries. However, we show that
efficient approximate solutions exist by relating maximum overlap to the clique
and chromatic numbers of a certain graph determined by the queries. The link to
chromatic number allows us to use more efficient approximate algorithms, which
cannot be done for the clique number as it may underestimate the privacy
budget. Our approach is defined in the general setting of $f$-differential
privacy, which subsumes standard pure differential privacy and Gaussian
differential privacy. We prove the parallel composition theorem for
$f$-differential privacy. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real-world
data sets of queries. We show that the approach can scale to large domain sizes
(up to $10^{20000}$), and that its application can reduce the noise added to
query answers by up to 60\%.

stochastic Active Information Acquisition problem is equivalent to a
deterministic optimal control problem. However, the above-mentioned assumptions
regarding the target dynamic model are limiting. In real-world scenarios, the
target may be subject to disturbances whose models or statistical properties
are hard or impossible to obtain. Typical scenarios include abrupt maneuvers,
jumping disturbances due to interactions with the environment, anomalous
misbehaviors due to system faults/attacks, etc. Motivated by the above
considerations, in this paper we consider targets whose dynamic models are
subject to arbitrary unknown inputs whose models or statistical properties are
not assumed to be available. In particular, with the aid of an unknown input
decoupled filter, we formulate the sensor trajectory planning problem to track
evolution of the target state and analyse the resulting performance for both
the state and unknown input evolution tracking. Inspired by concepts of Reduced
Value Iteration, a suboptimal solution that expands a search tree via Forward
Value Iteration with informativeness-based pruning is proposed. Concrete
suboptimality performance guarantees for tracking both the state and the

and non-ideal Navier-Stokes equations using a decomposition of the
gravitational force into a near- and far-field component. These equations
involve the pair radial distribution function (similar to the two-point
correlation function), similarly to the interaction energy and equation of
state in liquids. Small-scale correlations lead to a non-ideal amplification of
the gravitational interaction energy, whose omission leads to a missing mass
problem, e.g., in galaxies and galaxy clusters. We also propose an extension of
the Friedmann equations in the non-ideal regime. We estimate the non-ideal
amplification factor of the gravitational interaction energy of the baryons to
lie between 5 and 20, potentially explaining the observed value of the Hubble
parameter. Within this framework, the acceleration of the expansion emerges
naturally because of the increasing number of sub-structures induced by
gravitational collapse, which increases their contribution to the total
gravitational energy. A simple estimate predicts a non-ideal deceleration
parameter qni~-1;this is potentially the first determination of the observed
value based on an intuitively physical argument. We suggest that correlations
and gravitational interactions could produce a transition to a viscous regime
that can lead to flat rotation curves. This transition could also explain the
dichotomy between (Keplerian) LSB elliptical galaxy and (non-Keplerian) spiral
galaxy rotation profiles. Overall, our results demonstrate that non-ideal
effects induced by inhomogeneities must be taken into account in order to
properly determine the gravitational dynamics of galaxies and the larger scale

pulsar transverse acceleration and the R$\rm{\ddot{o}}$mer delay. The effect is
relatively small and usually negligible. Only for pulsars in globular clusters,
it is possibly important. The maximum residual amplitude, which is from the
pulsar near the surface of the core of the cluster, is about tens nanoseconds,
and may hardly be identified for most of the globular clusters currently.
However, an intermediate-mass black hole in the centre of a cluster can
increase apparently the timing residual magnitudes. Particularly for the
pulsars in the innermost core region, their residual magnitudes may be
significant. The high-magnitude residuals, which above critical lines of each
cluster, are strong evidences for the presence of a black hole or dark remnants
of comparable total mass in the centre of the cluster. We also explored the
timing effects of line-of-sight accelerations for the pulsars. The distribution
of measured line-of-sight accelerations are simulated with a Monte Carlo
method. A two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are performed to reexamine
the consistency of distributions of the simulated and reported data for various
values of parameters of the clusters. It is shown that the structure parameters
of Terzan 5 can be well constrained by comparing the distribution of measured
line-of-sight accelerations with the distributions from Monte Carlo
simulations. We provide that the cluster has an upper limit on the central
black hole/dark remnant mass of $ \sim 6000 M_{\odot} $.

technology to tune the wireless propagation channels in real-time. However,
most of the current works assume single-RIS (S-RIS)-aided systems, which can be
limited in some application scenarios where a transmitter might need a
multi-RIS-aided channel to communicate with a receiver. In this paper, we
consider a double-RIS (D-RIS)-aided MIMO system and propose an alternating
least-squared-based channel estimation method by exploiting the Tucker2 tensor
structure of the received signals. Using the proposed method, the cascaded MIMO
channel parts can be estimated separately, up to trivial scaling factors.
Compared with the S-RIS systems, we show that if the RIS elements of a S-RIS
system are distributed carefully between the two RISs in a D-RIS system, the
training overhead can be reduced and the estimation accuracy can also be
increased. Therefore, D-RIS systems can be seen as an appealing approach to
further increase the coverage, capacity, and efficiency of future wireless

been studied by many authors, starting with the classical work by Fermi, Pasta,
and Ulam (FPU) in the middle of the last century. However, symmetry selection
rules for the energy transfer between nonlinear vibrational modes of different
symmetry, which lead to the possibility of excitation of some bushes of such
modes, were not revealed. Each bush determines an exact solution of nonlinear
dynamical equations of the considered system. The collection of modes of a
given bush does not change in time, while there is a continuous energy exchange
between these modes. Bushes of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are constructed
with the aid of group-theoretical methods and therefore they can exist for the
case of large amplitude atomic vibrations and for any type of interatomic
interactions. In most publications, bushes of NNMs or similar dynamical objects
in one-dimensional systems are investigated under periodic boundary conditions.
In this paper, we present a detailed study of the bushes of NNMs in monoatomic
chains for the case of fixed boundary conditions, which sheds light on a series
of new properties of the intermode interactions in such systems. We prove some
theorems that justify a method for constructing bushes of NNMs by continuation
of conventional normal modes to the case of large atomic oscillations. Our
study was carried out for FPU chains, for the chains with the Lennard-Jones
interatomic potential, as well as for the carbon chains (carbynes) in the
framework of the density functional theory. For one-dimensional bushes
(Rosenberg nonlinear normal modes), the amplitude-frequency diagrams are
presented and the possibility of their modulational instability is briefly
discussed. We also argue in favor of the fact that our methods and main results
are valid for any monoatomic chain.

nearly unity (linear correlation) for radio-loud Seyferts to significantly less
than unity for radio-quiet ones. This declining trend of coupling index also
holds from larger sources to compact ones; (2) the Seyferts with intermediate

linear jet-disk coupling, but it shallows from near to super Eddington
($\lambda\sim$ 0.3 to 10), and the former is more radio loud than the latter;
(3) the Seyfert 1s are slightly steeper than the Seyfert 2s, in the jet-disk

numerical simulations of their formation open the door to genetic
classification of these systems, where properties of a certain group (family)
of objects are tentatively related to their formation mechanisms and early
evolution. A short review of the structure and statistical trends of known
stellar hierarchies is given. Like binaries, they can be formed by the disk and
core fragmentation events happening sequentially or simultaneously and followed
by the evolution of masses and orbits driven by continuing accretion of gas and
dynamical interactions between stars. Several basic formation scenarios are
proposed and associated qualitatively with the architecture of real systems,
although quantitative predictions for these scenarios are still pending. The
general trend of increasing orbit alignment with decreasing system size points
to the critical role of the accretion-driven orbit migration, which also
explains the typically comparable masses of stars belonging to the same system.
The architecture of some hierarchies bears imprints of chaotic dynamical
interactions. Characteristic features of each family are illustrated by several
real systems.

vivid representations of relationships between variables. However, many of them
may be corrupted by experimental noise or inappropriate network inference
methods that inherently hamper the efficacy of network-based downstream
analysis. Consequently, it's necessary to develop systematic methods for
denoising networks, namely, improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of noisy
networks. In this paper, we have explored the properties of network signal and
noise and proposed a novel network denoising framework called Network
Refinement (NR) that adjusts the edge weights by applying a nonlinear graph
operator based on a diffusion process defined by random walk on the graph.
Specifically, this unified framework consists of two closely linked approaches
named NR-F and NR-B, which improve the SNR of noisy input networks from two
different perspectives: NR-F aims at enhancing signal strength, while NR-B aims
at weakening noise strength. Users can choose from which angle to improve the
SNR of the network according to the characteristics of the network itself. We
show that NR can significantly refine the quality of many networks by several
applications on simulated networks and typical real-world biological and social
networks.

Then, Monte-Carlo based optical simulation is deployed to obtain the

the other not. Then we use the sensor data of the former one as the input of

affect patients' social abilities. In recent years, many studies have employed
deep learning to diagnose this brain dysfunction through functional MRI (fMRI).
However, existing approaches solely focused on the abnormal brain functional
connections but ignored the impact of regional activities. Due to this biased
prior knowledge, previous diagnosis models suffered from inter-site measurement
heterogeneity and inter-individual phenotypic differences. To address this
issue, we propose a novel feature extraction method for fMRI that can learn a
personalized lower-resolution representation of the entire brain networking
regarding both the functional connections and regional activities.
Specifically, we abstract the brain imaging as a graph structure and
straightforwardly downsample it to substructures by hierarchical graph pooling.
To further recalibrate the distribution of the extracted features under
phenotypic information, we subsequently embed the sparse feature vectors into a
population graph, where the hidden inter-subject heterogeneity and homogeneity
are explicitly expressed as inter- and intra-community connectivity
differences, and utilize Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the node
embeddings. By these means, our framework can extract features directly and
efficiently from the entire fMRI and be aware of implicit inter-individual
variance. We have evaluated our framework on the ABIDE-I dataset with 10-fold
cross-validation. The present model has achieved a mean classification accuracy
of 87.62\% and a mean AUC of 0.92, better than the state-of-the-art methods.

code has been modified to enable inversion of the Stokes profiles with two

intermediate magnetic field strengths (e.g. plages), the new version provides
statistically significant values of filling fraction and magnetic field vector.
Not only does the fitting of the Stokes profile improve, but the inference of

e.g., ontologies and schemas, modeled as sets of entity types (etypes), e.g.,
person, where each etype is associated with a set of properties, e.g., age or
height, via an inheritance hierarchy. A huge literature exists on this topic. A
common approach is to model KBs as graphs decorated with labels and reduce the
problem of KB matching to that of matching these two elements, \textit{viz.},
labels and structure of the graph. However, labels of etypes are often
misplaced, e.g., they are more general or specific than the correct etype, as
defined by its properties. Structure-based matching may also lead to wrong
conclusions as the properties assigned to an etype in an inheritance hierarchy
do not depend on the order by which they are assigned and, therefore, on the
specific structure of the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel etype graph
matching approach, dealing with the two problems highlighted above, based on
two key ideas. The first is to implement matching as a classification task
where etypes are characterized by the associated properties. The second is we
propose two \textit{property-based} etype similarity metrics, which model the
roles that properties have in the definition of an etype. The experimental
results show the effectiveness of the algorithm, in particular for those etype
graphs with a high number of properties.

Symplectic gradient modules of the recently proposed symplecticity-preserving

LocSympNets are extended to symmetric locally-symplectic neural networks
SymLocSympNets, such that the inverse of SymLocSympNets is equal to the
feed-forward propagation of SymLocSympNets with the negative time step, which
is a general property of the flow of a dynamical system. LocSympNets and
SymLocSympNets are studied numerically considering learning linear and
nonlinear volume-preserving dynamics. We demonstrate learning of linear
traveling wave solutions to the semi-discretized advection equation, periodic
trajectories of the Euler equations of the motion of a free rigid body, and
quasi-periodic solutions of the charged particle motion in an electromagnetic
field. LocSympNets and SymLocSympNets can learn linear and nonlinear dynamics
to a high degree of accuracy even when random noise is added to the training
data. When learning a single trajectory of the rigid body dynamics
locally-symplectic neural networks can learn both quadratic invariants of the
system with absolute relative errors below 1%. In addition, SymLocSympNets
produce qualitatively good long-time predictions, when the learning of the
whole system from randomly sampled data is considered. LocSympNets and

algorithms used to non-invasively analyze lung physiology have undergone
rigorous validation in a clinical setting, and are often validated either using
mechanical devices, or with small clinical validation datasets using 2-8
patients. This work aims to improve this situation by first, establishing an
open, and clinically validated dataset comprising data from both mechanical
lungs and nearly 40,000 breaths from 18 intubated patients. Next, we use this
data to evaluate 15 different algorithms that use the ""single chamber"" model of
estimating respiratory compliance. We evaluate these algorithms under varying
clinical scenarios patients typically experience during hospitalization. In
particular, we explore algorithm performance under four different types of
patient ventilator asynchrony. We also analyze algorithms under varying
ventilation modes to benchmark algorithm performance and to determine if
ventilation mode has any impact on the algorithm. Our approach yields several
advances by 1) showing which specific algorithms work best clinically under

insights about single-chamber model algorithms. We hope that our paper,

independently verifies the most famous Four-Color Theorem: the case $h(G) = 4$
is equivalent to the Four-Color Theorem, that is, every planar graph is
$4$-colourable. In our novel approach, we use algebraic settings over a finite
field $\mathbb{Z}_p$. The algebraic setting, in essence, begins with the
complete graph with $h(G)$ vertices (which is a minor, $\mathcal{M}$, of the
given graph $G$) and iteratively extends to the simple graph $G$. This
conjecture has remained elusive, owing to a lack of understanding of the
interdependence, particularly the importance of Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, Lemma
3.3, and Lemma 3.6 in Section 3.

However, in such studies, the focus has been on debiasing techniques, while the
relations to be debiased are specified manually by the user. As manual
specification is itself susceptible to human cognitive bias, there is a need
for a system capable of quantifying and exposing biases, that can support more
informed decisions on what to debias. To address this gap in the literature, we
describe a framework for identifying biases present in knowledge graph
embeddings, based on numerical bias metrics. We illustrate the framework with
three different bias measures on the task of profession prediction, and it can
be flexibly extended to further bias definitions and applications. The
relations flagged as biased can then be handed to decision makers for judgement
upon subsequent debiasing.

crucial to the math-modeling process. A computerized game to exercise the
math-modeling process and optimization problem formulation is introduced. The
game is named The Formula 1 Championship, and models of the game were developed
in the computerized simulation platform MoNet. It resembles some situations in
which team managers must make crucial decisions to enhance their racing cars up
to the feasible, most advantageous conditions. This paper describes the game's
rules, limitations, and five Formula 1 circuit simulators used for the
championship development. We present several formulations of this situation in
the form of optimization problems. Administering the budget to reach the best
car adjustment to a set of circuits to win the respective races can be an
approach. Focusing on the best distribution of each Grand Prix's budget and
then deciding how to use the assigned money to improve the car is also the
right approach. In general, there may be a degree of conflict among these
approaches because they are different aspects of the same multi-scale
optimization problem. Therefore, we evaluate the impact of assigning the
highest priority to an element, or another, when formulating the optimization
problem. Studying the effectiveness of solving such optimization problems turns
out to be an exciting way of evaluating the advantages of focusing on one scale
or another. Another thread of this research directs to the meaning of the game
in the teaching-learning process. We believe applying the Formula 1 Game is an
effective way to discover opportunities in a complex-system situation and
formulate them to finally extract and concrete the related benefit to the

The analysis of applications and methods is conducted on a database of

application begins by generating high-fidelity data using generative networks
and then uses this novel data alongside the original high-fidelity data to
produce low-fidelity images. A machine-learning identifier identifies plants
and labels them as potentially diseased or not. A machine learning classifier
is then given the potentially diseased plant images and returns actual

neuroscience, and the classical static description of the receptive field has
had enormous success in explaining the fundamental mechanisms underlying visual
processing. Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to
probe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the
introduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics.
At its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive
fields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent.
Specifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that
supports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically
inspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\propto \sim 1 /\Delta M$). For example, when
the retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in
space to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with
discounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently
introduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using
retinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any
active visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive
fields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose
that elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive
fields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to
future post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would
otherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal
disruptions is transiently blunted.

safety research, little is known about their pattern and impacts in developing
countries. The widespread adoption of motorcycles in such regions in tandem
with the vulnerability of motorcyclists exacerbates the likelihood of severe
crashes. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the underlying
factors contributing to the severity of motorcycle-involved crashes through
employing crash data from March 2018 to March 2019 from Iran. Considering the
ordinal nature of three injury classes of property-damage-only (PDO), injury,
and fatal crashes in our data, an ordered logistic regression model is employed
to address the problem. The data statistics suggest that motorcycle is
responsible for 38% of injury and 15% of all fatal crashes in the dataset. The
results indicate that significant factors contributing to more severe crashes
include collision, road, temporal, and motorcycle rider characteristics. Among
all attributes, our model is most sensitive to the motorcycle-pedestrian
accident, which increases the probability of belonging a crash into injury and
fatal crashes by 0.289 and 0.019, respectively. Moreover, we discovered a
significant degree of correlation between young riders and riders without a
license. Finally, upon the insights obtained from the results, we propose
safety countermeasures, including 1) strict traffic rule enforcement upon
riders and pedestrians, 2) educational programs, and 3) road-specific
adjustment policies.

Universe has been recently created by the DES team. The distribution was found
to be slightly (be few percent) smoother, less clumpy than predicted by the
general relativity. This result was considered as a hint of some new physical
laws. In the present paper we offer a relatively simple model that could
explain the above result without resorting to any new physical laws. The model
deals with the dynamics of a system consisting of a large number of gravitating
neutral particles, whose mass is equal to the mass of hydrogen atoms. The
central point of the model is a partial inhibition of the gravitation for a
relatively small subsystem of the entire system. It would be sufficient for
this subsystem to constitute just about few percent of the total ensemble of
the particles for explaining the few percent more smooth distribution of dark
matter (observed by the DES team) compared to the prediction of the general
relativity. The most viable candidate for the dark matter particles in this
model is the second flavor of hydrogen atoms (SFHA) that has only S-states and
therefore does not couple to the electric dipole radiation or even to higher
multipole radiation, so that the SFHA is practically dark. The SFHA has the
experimental confirmation from atomic experiments, it does not go beyond the
Standard Model, it is based on the standard quantum mechanics, and it explains
the puzzling astrophysical observations of the redshifted line 21 cm from the
early Universe. Thus, our model explaining the DES result of a little too
smooth distribution of dark matter without resorting to any new physical laws
seems to be self-consistent.
