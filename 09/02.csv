jammed Keplerian gas in a coupled map lattice (CML) with a minimal set of
procedures for simulating diverse patterns in astronomical objects. The CML
shows that a spiral arm is a type of traffic jam, and its motion is governed by
both a gas inflow into and outflow from the jam. In particular, we present a
new approach to simply and directly evaluating the disappearance of spiral
arms, called ""light-in and heavy-out"". It is based on the gas flow rate
difference between the light inflow and heavy outflow leading to the
disappearance of traffic jams. Furthermore, we propose an approximate formula
for the remaining lifetime of spiral arms, which is immediately derived from
the ""light-in and heavy-out"" approach without calculating their pattern speeds
as in conventional differential rotation. The proposed formula is successfully
applied to the CML simulations.

also investigated: we find that it is non-negligible for the $C_{44}$ elastic

Its effect is not sufficient to explain the details of the anomalies found by

  model for mixed observed variables under NMAR missingness",,,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the analysis of observational data in social sciences and businesses, it
is difficult to obtain a ""(quasi) single-source dataset"" in which the variables
of interest are simultaneously observed. Instead, multiple-source datasets are
typically acquired for different individuals or units. Various methods have
been proposed to investigate the relationship between the variables in each
dataset, e.g., matching and latent variable modeling. It is necessary to
utilize these datasets as a single-source dataset with missing variables.
Existing methods assume that the datasets to be integrated are acquired from
the same population or that the sampling depends on covariates. This assumption
is referred to as missing at random (MAR) in terms of missingness. However, as
will been shown in application studies, it is likely that this assumption does
not hold in actual data analysis and the results obtained may be biased. We
propose a data fusion method that does not assume that datasets are homogenous.
We use a Gaussian process latent variable model for non-MAR missing data. This
model assumes that the variables of concern and the probability of being
missing depend on latent variables. A simulation study and real-world data
analysis show that the proposed method with a missing-data mechanism and the
latent Gaussian process yields valid estimates, whereas an existing method
provides severely biased estimates. This is the first study in which non-random
assignment to datasets is considered and resolved under resonable assumptions
in data fusion problem.

underestimated the number of slow rotators, revealing the importance of
studying those asteroids. For most slowly rotating asteroids (P > 12), no spin
and shape model is available because of observation selection effects. This
hampers determination of their thermal parameters and accurate sizes.
  We continue our campaign in minimising selection effects among main belt
asteroids. Our targets are slow rotators with low light-curve amplitudes. The
goal is to provide their scaled spin and shape models together with thermal
inertia, albedo, and surface roughness to complete the statistics. Rich
multi-apparition datasets of dense light curves are supplemented with data from
Kepler and TESS. In addition to data in the visible range, we also use thermal
data from infrared space observatories (IRAS, Akari and WISE) in a combined
optimisation process using the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model (CITPM).
This novel method has so far been applied to only a few targets, and in this
work we further validate the method.
  We present the models of 16 slow rotators. All provide good fits to both
thermal and visible data. The obtained sizes are on average accurate at the 5%
precision, with diameters in the range from 25 to 145 km. The rotation periods
of our targets range from 11 to 59 hours, and the thermal inertia covers a wide
range of values, from 2 to <400 SI units, not showing any correlation with the
period. With this work we increase the sample of slow rotators with reliable
spin and shape models and known thermal inertia by 40%. The thermal inertia
values of our sample do not display a previously suggested increasing trend
with rotation period, which might be due to their small skin depth.

Vizing from 1968 states that every $\Delta$-critical graph on $n$ vertices has
at least $(n(\Delta-1)+ 3)/2$ edges. We initiate the study of determining the
minimum number of edges of class 1 graphs $G$, in addition,
$\chi'(G+e)=\chi'(G)+1$ for every $e\in E(\overline{G})$. Such graphs have
intimate relation to $(P_3; k)$-co-critical graphs, where a non-complete graph

creation of interactive plots and visualizations. The tool loads with example
data to explore, and users upload their specific Unsub file to quickly populate
the pre-made plots with actual data. Graphs are interactive, live-updating, and
support zoom, click-and-drag, and hover. Filters are specified through sliders
to model scenarios and focus on areas of interest. A drop-down menu allows
users to change a journal's decision status, and graphs update automatically.
After evaluating journals, users can export the modified dataset to save their

achieve high performance. Unfortunately, new side-channels have often been
uncovered that exploit these enhanced designs. One area that has received
little attention from a security perspective is the processor's hard-ware
prefetcher, a critical component used to mitigate DRAM latency in today's
systems. Prefetchers, like branch predictors, hold critical state related to
the execution of the application, and have the potential to leak secret
information. But up to now, there has not been a demonstration of a generic
prefetcher side-channel that could be actively exploited in today's hardware.
  In this paper, we present AfterImage, a new side-channel that exploits the
Intel Instruction Pointer-based stride prefetcher. We observe that, when the
execution of the processor switches between different private domains, the
prefetcher trained by one domain can be triggered in another. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is the first to publicly demonstrate a methodology
that is both algorithm-agnostic and also able to leak kernel data into
userspace. AfterImage is different from previous works, as it leaks data on the
non-speculative path of execution. Because of this, a large class of work that
has focused on protecting transient, branch-outcome-based data will be unable
to block this side-channel. By reverse-engineering the IP-stride prefetcher in
modern Intel processors, we have successfully developed three variants of
AfterImage to leak control flow information across code regions, processes and
the user-kernel boundary. We find a high level of accuracy in leaking
information with our methodology (from 91%, up to 99%), and propose two
mitigation techniques to block this side-channel, one of which can be used on
hardware systems today.

the exotic smooth structures of $\mathbb{R}^4$. We will present three distinct
examples, discuss their associated matter models by solving the Einstein
equations, and determine their physical viability by examining the energy

models of matter distributions in extragalactic systems, to highlight the
viability of utilizing exotic smooth structures to understand the existence and

demonstrate using Raman spectroscopy that electron doping (n) results in
softening of frequency and broadening of linewidth of the in-plane vibrational
modes, leaving out-of-plane vibrational modes unaffected. Largest change is
observed for the in-plane Raman mode at $\sim$ 151 cm$^{-1} $, which also shows
doping induced Fano resonance with the Fano parameter 1/q = -0.17 at doping
concentration of $\sim 3.7\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2} $. A quantitative
understanding of our results is provided by first-principles density functional
theory (DFT), showing that the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of in-plane modes
is stronger than that of out-of-plane modes, and its variation with doping is
independent of the layer stacking. The origin of large EPC is traced to 1T to

like image and video recognition, segmentation and other image and video
related tasks.However, a critical challenge with these models is the lack of
explainability.This requirement of generating explainable predictions has
motivated the research community to perform various analysis on trained
models.In this study, we analyze the learned feature maps of trained models
using MNIST images for achieving more explainable predictions.Our study is
focused on deriving a set of primitive elements, here called visual concepts,
that can be used to generate any arbitrary sample from the data generating
distribution.We derive the primitive elements from the feature maps learned by
the model.We illustrate the idea by generating visual concepts from a
Variational Autoencoder trained using MNIST images.We augment the training data
of MNIST dataset by adding about 60,000 new images generated with visual
concepts chosen at random.With this we were able to reduce the reconstruction
loss (mean square error) from an initial value of 120 without augmentation to
60 with augmentation.Our approach is a first step towards the final goal of
achieving trained deep neural network models whose predictions, features in
hidden layers and the learned filters can be well explained.Such a model when
deployed in production can easily be modified to adapt to new data, whereas
existing deep learning models need a re training or fine tuning. This process
again needs a huge number of data samples that are not easy to generate unless
the model has good explainability.

ball suspended from a moving and maneuvering UAV and pop balloons anchored to
the ground, using suitable manipulators. The important tasks carried out to
address this challenge include the design and development of a hardware system
with efficient grabbing and popping mechanisms, considering the restrictions in
volume and payload, design of accurate target interception algorithms using
visual information suitable for outdoor environments, and development of a
software architecture for dynamic multi-agent aerial systems performing complex
dynamic missions. In this paper, a single degree of freedom manipulator
attached with an end-effector is designed for grabbing and popping, and robust
algorithms are developed for the interception of targets in an uncertain
environment. Vision-based guidance and tracking laws are proposed based on the
concept of pursuit engagement and artificial potential function. The software
architecture presented in this work proposes an Operation Management System
(OMS) architecture that allocates static and dynamic tasks collaboratively
among multiple UAVs to perform any given mission. An important aspect of this
work is that all the systems developed were designed to operate in completely
autonomous mode. A detailed description of the architecture along with
simulations of complete challenge in the Gazebo environment and field
experiment results are also included in this work. The proposed
hardware-software system is particularly useful for counter-UAV systems and can
also be modified in order to cater to several other applications.

  segmentation","Accepted at BMVC'21",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current unsupervised anomaly localization approaches rely on generative
models to learn the distribution of normal images, which is later used to
identify potential anomalous regions derived from errors on the reconstructed
images. However, a main limitation of nearly all prior literature is the need
of employing anomalous images to set a class-specific threshold to locate the
anomalies. This limits their usability in realistic scenarios, where only
normal data is typically accessible. Despite this major drawback, only a
handful of works have addressed this limitation, by integrating supervision on
attention maps during training. In this work, we propose a novel formulation
that does not require accessing images with abnormalities to define the
threshold. Furthermore, and in contrast to very recent work, the proposed
constraint is formulated in a more principled manner, leveraging well-known
knowledge in constrained optimization. In particular, the equality constraint
on the attention maps in prior work is replaced by an inequality constraint,
which allows more flexibility. In addition, to address the limitations of
penalty-based functions we employ an extension of the popular log-barrier
methods to handle the constraint. Comprehensive experiments on the popular
BRATS'19 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially
outperforms relevant literature, establishing new state-of-the-art results for
unsupervised lesion segmentation.

problems cannot be solved as described in the claim. Such theorems put limits
on what is possible to do concerning artificial intelligence, especially the
super-intelligent one. As such, these results serve as guidelines, reminders,
and warnings to AI safety, AI policy, and governance researchers. These might
enable solutions to some long-standing questions in the form of formalizing
theories in the framework of constraint satisfaction without committing to one
option. We strongly believe this to be the most prudent approach to long-term
AI safety initiatives. In this paper, we have categorized impossibility
theorems applicable to AI into five mechanism-based categories: deduction,
indistinguishability, induction, tradeoffs, and intractability. We found that
certain theorems are too specific or have implicit assumptions that limit
application. Also, we added new results (theorems) such as the unfairness of
explainability, the first explainability-related result in the induction
category. The remaining results deal with misalignment between the clones and
put a limit to the self-awareness of agents. We concluded that deductive
impossibilities deny 100%-guarantees for security. In the end, we give some
ideas that hold potential in explainability, controllability, value alignment,
ethics, and group decision-making. They can be deepened by further
investigation.

many-body calculations in nuclear physics on distributed-memory parallel
systems equipped with general-purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), we
modified a previously developed hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation of an
eigensolver written in FORTRAN 90 by using an OpenACC directives based
programming model. Such an approach requires making minimal changes to the
original code and enables a smooth migration of large-scale nuclear structure
simulations from a distributed-memory many-core CPU system to a distributed GPU
system. However, in order to make the OpenACC based eigensolver run efficiently
on GPUs, we need to take into account the architectural differences between a
many-core CPU and a GPU device. Consequently, the optimal way to insert OpenACC
directives may be different from the original way of inserting OpenMP
directives. We point out these differences in the implementation of sparse
matrix-matrix multiplications (SpMM), which constitutes the main cost of the
eigensolver, as well as other differences in the preconditioning step and dense
linear algebra operations. We compare the performance of the OpenACC based
implementation executed on multiple GPUs with the performance on
distributed-memory many-core CPUs, and demonstrate significant speedup achieved
on GPUs compared to the on-node performance of a many-core CPU. We also show
that the overall performance improvement of the eigensolver on multiple GPUs is
more modest due to the communication overhead among different MPI ranks.

was introduced in Apolin\'ario \emph{et al} (J. Stat. Phys. \textbf{186}, 15
(2022)). This partial differential equation, randomly stirred by a forcing term
which is smooth in space and delta-correlated in time, was shown to converge at
infinite time towards a state of finite variance, without the aid of viscosity.
Furthermore, the spatial profile of its solution gets rough, with the same
regularity as a fractional Gaussian field. We here focus on the temporal
behavior and derive explicit asymptotic predictions for the correlation
function in time of this solution and observe that their regularity is not
influenced by the spatial regularity of the problem, only by the correlation in
time of the stirring contribution. We also show that the correlation in time of
the solution depends on the position, contrary to its correlation in space at
fixed times. We then investigate the influence of a forcing which is correlated
in time on the spatial and time statistics of this equation. In this situation,
while for small correlation times the homogeneous spatial statistics of the
white-in-time case are recovered, for large correlation times homogeneity is
broken, and a concentration around the origin of the system is observed in the
velocity profiles. In other words, this fractional velocity field is a
representation in one-dimension, through a linear dynamical model, of the
self-similar velocity fields proposed by Kolmogorov in 1941, but only at fixed
times, for a delta-correlated forcing, in which case the spatial statistics is
homogeneous and rough, as expected of a turbulent velocity field. The
regularity in time of turbulence, however, is not captured by this model.

obtain various ground state phases, including plane wave, half quantum vortex,
elongated plane wave, and different stripe wave patterns for W-W interactions.
For finite Rabi coupling, an increase in SO coupling strength leads to the
transition from the fully miscible to the partially miscible state. We also
characterize different ground states in the coupling parameter space using the
root mean square sizes of the condensate. The spin density vector for the
ground state phases exhibits density, quadrupole and dipole like spin
polarizations. For the W-S interaction, in addition to that observed in the W-W

notice a wide variety of spin polarizations, such as density, dipole,
quadrupole, symbiotic, necklace, and stripe-like patterns for the W-S case. A
detailed investigation in the coupling parameter space indicates immiscible to

rate surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) and the gas surface density
($\Sigma_{gas}$) in disc galaxies. The relation has a power-law form
$\Sigma_{SFR} \propto \Sigma_{gas}^n$. Assuming that star formation results
from gravitational collapse of the interstellar medium, $\Sigma_{SFR}$ can be
determined by dividing $\Sigma_{gas}$ by the local free-fall time $t_{ff}$. The
formulation of $t_{ff}$ yields the relation between $\Sigma_{SFR}$ and
$\Sigma_{gas}$, assuming that a constant fraction ($\varepsilon_{SFE}$) of gas
is converted into stars every $t_{ff}$. This is done here for the first time
using Milgromian dynamics (MOND). Using linear stability analysis of a
uniformly rotating thin disc, it is possible to determine the size of a
collapsing perturbation within it. This lets us evaluate the sizes and masses
of clouds (and their $t_{ff}$) as a function of $\Sigma_{gas}$ and the rotation
curve. We analytically derive the relation $\Sigma_{SFR} \propto
\Sigma_{gas}^{n}$ both in Newtonian and Milgromian dynamics, finding that
$n=1.4$. The difference between the two cases is a change only to the constant
pre-factor, resulting in increased $\Sigma_{SFR}$ of up to 25\% using MOND in
the central regions of dwarf galaxies. Due to the enhanced role of disk
self-gravity, star formation extends out to larger galactocentric radii than in
Newtonian gravity, with the clouds being larger. In MOND, a nearly exact
representation of the present-day main sequence of galaxies is obtained if
$\epsilon_{SFE} = \text{constant} \approx 1.1\%$. We also show that empirically
found correction terms to the Kennicutt-Schmidt law are included in the here
presented relations. Furthermore, we determine that if star formation is
possible, then the temperature only affects $\Sigma_{SFR}$ by at most a factor
of $\sqrt{2}$.

Raman frequencies and linewidths for 11nm thick crystal show change around 178

enhanced electron-phonon interaction in the WSM phase. Further, the resistivity
at low-temperature shows an upturn below 20 K along with the maximum in the

resistivity below 20 K. The low temperature resistivity follows $\rho \propto
1/T$, changing to $\rho \propto T$ with increasing temperature supports
electron-electron interaction physics at electron-hole symmetric Weyl nodes
below 20 K. These observations will pave the way to unravel the properties of
WSM state in layered ultra-thin van der Waals materials.

which arises in the discretization of the Euler-Arnold differential equations
governing the motion of a generalized rigid body. We start by formulating the
problem as an optimization problem with orthogonal constraints and proving that
the objective function is convex. Then, using techniques from optimization on
Riemannian manifolds, the three feasible algorithms are designed. The first one
splits the orthogonal constraints using the Bregman method, whereas the other
two methods are of the steepest-descent type. The second method uses the
Cayley-transform to preserve the constraints and a Barzilai-Borwein step size,
while the third one involves geodesics, with the step size computed by Armijo's
rule. Finally, a set of numerical experiments are carried out to compare the
performance of the proposed algorithms, suggesting that the first algorithm has
the best performance in terms of accuracy and number of iterations. An
essential advantage of these iterative methods is that they work even when the
conditions for applicability of the direct methods available in the literature
are not satisfied.

accretes onto the star via funnel flows which follow the stellar field lines

Previous work has inferred different densities in the hot spot, but has not
been sensitive to the radial density distribution. Attempts have been made to
measure this with X-ray observations, but X-ray emission only traces a fraction
of the hot spot and also coronal emission. Here we report periodic ultraviolet
and optical light curves of the accreting star GM Aur that display a time lag
of about 1 day between their peaks. The periodicity arises as the source of the
ultraviolet and optical emission moves into and out of view as it rotates along
with the star. The time-lag indicates a difference in the spatial distribution
of ultraviolet and optical brightness over the stellar surface. Within the
framework of the magnetospheric accretion model, this indicates a radial
density gradient in a hot spot on the stellar surface since different density
parts of the hot spot are expected to emit radiation at different wavelengths.
These results are the first observational confirmation of the magnetospheric
accretion model's prediction of a density gradient in the hot spot and
demonstrate the insights gained from focusing on the wavelengths where the bulk
of the accretion energy can be observed.

the importance of orbits with initial conditions known to play a significant
role in supporting peanut-like structures in autonomous systems. These orbits
are the central family of periodic orbits (x1) and vertical perturbations of
it, orbits of its standard three-dimensional bifurcations at the region (x1v1
and x1v2), as well as orbits in their neighbourhood. The knowledge of the
regular or chaotic character of these orbits is essential as well, because it
allows us to estimate their contribution to the support of a rotating bar and,
more importantly, the dynamical mechanisms that make it possible. This is
calculated by means of the GALI2 index. We find that orbital patterns existing
in the autonomous case, persist for longer times in the more massive bar
models, and even more so in a model in which the central spheroid component of
our adopted galactic potential becomes rather insignificant. The
peanut-supporting orbits which we find, have a regular or, in most cases, a
weakly chaotic character. There are cases in which orbits starting close to
unstable periodic orbits in an autonomous model behave as regular and support
the bar when its mass increases with time. An approximation for the orbital
dynamics of our non-autonomous models at a certain time, can be considered that
of the corresponding frozen system around that time.

primary idea is to treat the unknown model-form error as a residual force and
estimate it using duel Bayesian filter based joint input-state estimation
algorithms. For improving the predictive capability of the underlying physics,
we first use machine learning algorithm to learn a mapping between the
estimated state and the input (model-form error) and then introduce it into the

discussing four different dynamical systems are discussed; results for which
indicate that the framework is applicable to a wide variety of systems and can

handle the spatial nonstationarity, local homogeneity, and outlier

model assumes the existence a few distinct regression models that are estimated
based on observations that exhibit similar response-predictor relationships. As
such, the proposed model not only accounts for nonstationarity in the spatial
trend, but also clusters observations into a few distinct and homogenous
groups. This provides an advantage on interpretation with a few stationary
sub-processes identified that capture the predominant relationships between
response and predictor variables. Moreover, the proposed method incorporates
robust procedures to handle contaminations from both regression outliers and
spatial outliers. By doing so, we robustly segment the spatial domain into
distinct local regions with similar regression coefficients, and sporadic
locations that are purely outliers. Rigorous statistical hypothesis testing
procedure has been designed to test the significance of such segmentation.
Experimental results on many synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the

and interact with their environment in order to minimize a Variational Free
Energy (VFE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. The
inference of a policy (future control sequence) according to the FEP is known
as Active Inference (AIF). The AIF literature describes multiple VFE objectives
for policy planning that lead to epistemic (information-seeking) behavior.
However, most objectives have limited modeling flexibility. This paper
approaches epistemic behavior from a constrained Bethe Free Energy (CBFE)
perspective. Crucially, variational optimization of the CBFE can be expressed
in terms of message passing on free-form generative models. The key intuition
behind the CBFE is that we impose a point-mass constraint on predicted
outcomes, which explicitly encodes the assumption that the agent will make
observations in the future. We interpret the CBFE objective in terms of its
constituent behavioral drives. We then illustrate resulting behavior of the
CBFE by planning and interacting with a simulated T-maze environment.
Simulations for the T-maze task illustrate how the CBFE agent exhibits an
epistemic drive, and actively plans ahead to account for the impact of
predicted outcomes. Compared to an EFE agent, the CBFE agent incurs expected
reward in significantly more environmental scenarios. We conclude that CBFE
optimization by message passing suggests a general mechanism for
epistemic-aware AIF in free-form generative models.

constructs adversarial examples during training. However, recent methods for
generating NLP adversarial examples involve combinatorial search and expensive
sentence encoders for constraining the generated instances. As a result, it
remains challenging to use vanilla adversarial training to improve NLP models'
performance, and the benefits are mainly uninvestigated. This paper proposes a
simple and improved vanilla adversarial training process for NLP models, which
we name Attacking to Training (A2T). The core part of A2T is a new and cheaper
word substitution attack optimized for vanilla adversarial training. We use A2T
to train BERT and RoBERTa models on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp, and SNLI
datasets. Our results empirically show that it is possible to train robust NLP
models using a much cheaper adversary. We demonstrate that vanilla adversarial
training with A2T can improve an NLP model's robustness to the attack it was
originally trained with and also defend the model against other types of word
substitution attacks. Furthermore, we show that A2T can improve NLP models'
standard accuracy, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. Code is

study whether fair representation can be used to guarantee fairness for unknown

fairness notions that cover the concepts of independence, separation, and
calibration. Against the backdrop of the fairness impossibility results, we
explore approximate fairness. We prove that, although fair representation might
not guarantee fairness for all prediction tasks, it does guarantee fairness for
an important subset of tasks -- the tasks for which the representation is
discriminative. Specifically, all seven group fairness notions are linearly
controlled by fairness and discriminativeness of the representation. When an
incompatibility exists between different fairness notions, fair and
discriminative representation hits the sweet spot that approximately satisfies
all notions. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose to learn both
fair and discriminative representations using pretext loss which
self-supervises learning, and Maximum Mean Discrepancy as a fair regularizer.
Experiments on tabular, image, and face datasets show that using the learned
representation, downstream predictions that we are unaware of when learning the
representation indeed become fairer for seven group fairness notions, and the
fairness guarantees computed from our theoretical results are all valid.

overdensities in the cosmic web, are one promising and simple statistic for
constraining cosmological parameters. The physical origin of WL peaks have
previously been linked to dark matter halos along the line of sight and this
peak-halo connection has been used to develop various semi-analytic halo-based

the effectiveness of halo-based models for WL peak counts using a suite of
ray-tracing N-body simulations. We compare WL peaks in convergence maps from
the full simulations to those in maps created from only particles associated
with halos -- the latter playing the role of a ""perfect"" halo model. We find
that while halo-only contributions are able to replicate peak counts
qualitatively well, halos do not explain all WL peaks. Halos particularly
underpredict negative peaks, which are associated with local overdensities in
large-scale underdense regions along the line of sight. In addition, neglecting
non-halo contributions to peaks counts leads to a significant bias on the
parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_{8}$) for surveys larger than $\geq$ 100

away from dark matter halos, need to be incorporated into models of WL peaks in

Recent observations of phonon-mediated collective electron flow in bulk

search for strong electron-electron interactions in high carrier density
materials. Here we present the general transport signatures of such a
second-order scattering mechanism, along with analytical limits at the
Eliashberg level of theory. We study electronic transport, using $ab$ $initio$
calculations, in finite-size channels of semimetallic ZrSiS and TaAs$_2$ with
and without topological band crossings, respectively. The order of magnitude
separation between momentum-relaxing and momentum-conserving scattering
length-scales across a wide temperature range make both of them promising
candidates for further experimental observation of electron hydrodynamics. More
generally, our calculations show that the hydrodynamic transport regime can be
realized in a much broader class of anisotropic metals and does not, to first
order, rely on the topological nature of the bands. Finally, we discuss general
design principles guiding future search for hydrodynamic candidates, based on
the analytical formulation and our $ab$ $initio$ predictions. We find that
systems with strong electron-phonon interactions, reduced electronic phase
space, and suppressed phonon-phonon scattering at temperatures of interest are
likely to feature hydrodynamic electron transport. We predict that layered

group V/VI elements with lower crystal symmetry are ideal candidates to observe
hydrodynamic phenomena in future.

constraints for evolutionary models. This makes the monitoring of the spin
history of magnetic white dwarfs of high interest. In this paper we report the
results of a campaign of follow-up optical photometry to detect and track the
39 sec white dwarf spin pulses recently discovered in Hubble Space Telescope
data of the cataclysmic variable V1460 Her. We find the spin pulsations to be

a multi-chip module (MCM) is a critical driver of performance. In this work we
report a synchronous data link using Reciprocal Quantum Logic (RQL) enabled by
resonant clock distribution on the chip and on the MCM carrier. The simple
physical link has only four Josephson junctions and 3 fJ/bit dissipation,
including a 300 W/W cooling overhead. The driver produces a signal with 35\,GHz
analog bandwidth and connects to a single-ended receiver via 20 $\Omega$ Nb
Passive Transmission Line (PTL). To validate this link, we have designed,
fabricated and tested two 32$\times$32 mm$^2$ MCMs with eight 5$\times$5 mm$^2$
chips connected serially and powered with a meander clock, and with four
10$\times$10 mm$^2$ chips powered with a 2 GHz resonant clock. The meander
clock MCM validates performance of the data link components, and achieved 5.4
dB AC bias margin with no degradation relative to individual chip test. The
resonator MCM validates synchronization between chips, with a measured AC bias
margin up to 4.8 dB between two chips. The resonator MCM is capable of powering
circuits of 4 million Josephson junctions across the four chips with a
projected 10 Gbps serial data rate.

improves on the original version through incorporation of new noise sources,
enhanced treatment of stellar and planetary signals and instrumental effects,
as well as improved user-operability and optimisations for increased speed and

observations is now included. In this paper we report the implementation of
JexoSim 2.0 and assess performance metrics for JWST in end-member scenarios
using the hot Jupiter HD 209458 b and the mini-Neptune K2-18 b. We show how
JexoSim can be used to compare performance across the different JWST
instruments, selecting an optimal combination of instrument and subarray modes,
producing synthetic transmission spectra for each planet. These studies
indicate that the 1.4 {\mu}m water feature detected in the atmosphere of K2-18
b using the Hubble WFC3 might be observable in just one transit observation
with JWST with either NIRISS or NIRSpec. JexoSim 2.0 can be used to investigate
the impact of complex noise and systematic effects on the final spectrum, plan
observations and test the feasibility of novel science cases for JWST. It can
also be customised for other astrophysical applications beyond exoplanet
spectroscopy. JexoSim 2.0 is now available for use by the scientific community.

hole model, we investigate the structure and properties of accretion disk
around a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. In the absence of
reflection symmetry, the accretion disk is in general a curved surface in

efficiency of the black hole in converting rest-mass energy to radiation during
accretion. The retrograde innermost stable circular orbits are stretched but
the effects are substantially suppressed. In addition, we find that spin
measurements based on the gravitational redshift observations of the disk,
assuming a Kerr geometry, may overestimate the true spin values if the central
object is actually a Kerr-like black hole with conspicuous equatorial

in black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star binaries is crucial to
current efforts to model kilonovae, and to understand the role of neutron star
merger in r-process nucleosynthesis. In this manuscript, we review the simple
criteria currently used in merger simulations to determine whether matter is
unbound and what the asymptotic velocity of ejected material will be. We then
show that properly accounting for both heating and cooling during r-process
nucleosynthesis is important to accurately predict the mass and kinetic energy
of the outflows. These processes are also likely to be crucial to predict the
fallback timescale of any bound ejecta. We derive a model for the asymptotic
veloicity of unbound matter and binding energy of bound matter that accounts
for both of these effects and that can easily be implemented in merger
simulations. We show, however, that the detailed velocity distribution and
geometry of the outflows can currently only be captured by full 3D fluid
simulations of the outflows, as non-local effect ignored by the simple criteria
used in merger simulations cannot be safely neglected when modeling these
effects. Finally, we propose the introduction of simple source terms in the
fluid equations to approximately account for heating/cooling from r-process
nucleosynthesis in future seconds-long 3D simulations of merger remnants,
without the explicit inclusion of out-of-nuclear statistical equilibrium

model on a source domain and then applying it to a different target domain,
results in a sharp performance decline of the eventual classifier for many

substantially differ between domains, making adaptation even more challenging.
This, for example, happens in the task of aspect extraction, where the aspects
of interest of reviews of, e.g., restaurants or electronic devices may be very
different. This paper presents a new fine-tuning scheme for BERT, which aims to
address the above challenges. We name this scheme DILBERT: Domain Invariant

domain adaptation setting. DILBERT harnesses the categorical information of
both the source and the target domains to guide the pre-training process

datasets. While practitioners commonly combine ambiguous outcome labels for all
data points (instances) in an ad hoc way to improve the accuracy of multi-class
classification, there lacks a principled approach to guide the label
combination for all data points by any optimality criterion. To address this
problem, we propose the information-theoretic classification accuracy (ITCA), a
criterion that balances the trade-off between prediction accuracy (how well do
predicted labels agree with actual labels) and classification resolution (how
many labels are predictable), to guide practitioners on how to combine
ambiguous outcome labels. To find the optimal label combination indicated by
ITCA, we propose two search strategies: greedy search and breadth-first search.
Notably, ITCA and the two search strategies are adaptive to all
machine-learning classification algorithms. Coupled with a classification
algorithm and a search strategy, ITCA has two uses: improving prediction
accuracy and identifying ambiguous labels. We first verify that ITCA achieves
high accuracy with both search strategies in finding the correct label
combinations on synthetic and real data. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness
of ITCA in diverse applications including medical prognosis, cancer survival
prediction, user demographics prediction, and cell type classification. We also
provide theoretical insights into ITCA by studying the oracle and the linear
discriminant analysis classification algorithms. Python package itca (available

The starting point of this paper is that if a dense set of the so-called

[2, \infty)$ then the $n$-fold tensor power $H^{\otimes n}_\Gamma$ for $n \geq

natural compactification of the Coxeter group, and for a large class of Coxeter

factors. In this merger the higher surface brightness of the smaller northern
relic makes its total radio luminosity comparable to that of the much larger

relics differs significantly from the relation observed in other double radio
relic systems. From our radio spectral analysis, we find that both relics

relic is connected to a discrete radio source with an optical counterpart,
which indicates the possible presence of cosmic ray injection and
re-acceleration. Therefore, we propose that this atypical surface brightness
ratio can be explained with the particle acceleration efficiency precipitously
dropping in the weak shock regime and/or with re-acceleration of fossil cosmic

considered for the case of an incompressible and inviscid fluid. Under the
assumption that a finite-time blow-up solution may be spatially anisotropic as
time goes by such that the flow contracts more rapidly into one direction than
into the other, it can be shown that the dynamics of an axially symmetric flow
with swirl may be approximated to a simpler hyperbolic system. By using the
method of characteristics, it can be shown that generically the velocity flow
exhibits multi-valued solutions appearing on a rim at a finite distance from
the axis of rotation which displays a singular behavior in the radial

Envelope SNe (SESNe) are systematically higher than those estimated for SNe II.
Although this may suggest a distinct progenitor structure between these types
of SNe, the possibility remains that this may be caused by observational bias.
One important possible bias is that SESNe with low $^{56}$Ni mass are dim, and
therefore they are more likely to escape detection. By investigating the
distributions of the $^{56}$Ni mass and distance for the samples collected from
the literature, we find that the current literature SESN sample indeed suffers
from a significant observational bias, i.e., objects with low $^{56}$Ni mass -
if they exist - will be missed, especially at larger distances. Note, however,
that those distant objects in our sample are mostly SNe Ic-BL. We also
conducted mock observations assuming that the $^{56}$Ni mass distribution for
SESNe is intrinsically the same with that for SNe II. We find that the
$^{56}$Ni mass distribution of the detected SESNe samples moves toward higher
mass than the assumed intrinsic distribution, because of the difficulty in
detecting the low-$^{56}$Ni mass SESNe. These results could explain the general
trend of the higher $^{56}$Ni mass distribution (than SNe II) of SESNe found
thus far in the literature. However, further finding clear examples of
low-$^{56}$Ni mass SESNe ($\leq 0.01M_{\odot}$) is required to add weight to
this hypothesis. Also, the objects with high $^{56}$Ni mass ($\gtrsim 0.2

overall strength $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$. The deformation can be
accessed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions by measuring the collective flow
response of the produced quark-gluon plasma to the eccentricity $\varepsilon_2$
and the density gradient $d_{\perp}$ in the initial state. Using analytical
estimate and a Glauber model, I show that the variances,
$\langle\varepsilon_2^2\rangle$ or $\langle(\delta
d_{\perp}/d_{\perp})^2\rangle$, and skewnesses, $\langle\varepsilon_2^2\delta

have a simple analytical form of $a'+b'\beta_2^2$ and
$a'+(b'+c'\cos(3\gamma))\beta_2^3$, respectively. From these, I constructed
several normalized skewnesses to isolate the $\gamma$ dependence from that of
$\beta_2$, and show that the correlations between any normalized skewness and
any variance can constrain simultaneously the $\beta_2$ and $\gamma$. Assuming
a linear relation with elliptic flow $v_2$ and mean-transverse momentum

expected for the variances and skewnesses of $v_2$ and $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$. Our
findings motivate a dedicated system scan of high-energy heavy ion collisions

prolate, $\cos(3\gamma)=1$, and oblate nuclei, $\cos(3\gamma)=-1$, with well
known $\beta_2$ values to calibrate the coefficients $b'$ and $c'$, followed by
collisions of species of interest especially those with known $\beta_2$ but

large-scale stochastic systems, which has applications in various fields such
as swarm robotics. Recently, there is a growing amount of literature that
employs mean-field partial differential equations (PDEs) to model the density
evolution and uses density feedback to design control laws which, by acting on
individual systems, stabilize their density towards a target profile. In spite
of its stability property and computational efficiency, the success of density
feedback relies on assuming the systems to be homogeneous first-order
integrators (plus white noise) and ignores higher-order dynamics, making it
less applicable in practice. In this work, we present a backstepping design
algorithm that extends density control to heterogeneous and higher-order
stochastic systems in strict-feedback forms. We show that the strict-feedback
form in the individual level corresponds to, in the collective level, a PDE (of
densities) distributedly driven by a collection of heterogeneous stochastic
systems. The presented backstepping design then starts with a density feedback
design for the PDE, followed by a sequence of stabilizing design for the
remaining stochastic systems. We present a candidate control law with stability
proof and apply it to nonholonomic mobile robots. A simulation is included to
verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

substantial symbol error rate (SER) performance gains compared to the
non-Grassmannian constellations and conventionally constructed Grassmannian

objects, as the traditional energy function usually uses hand-crafted features
in their energy functions. To address these limitations, we propose to
incorporate end-to-end trainable neural network features into the energy
functions. Our deep neural network features are extracted from the
down-sampling and up-sampling layers with skip-connections of a U-net. In the
inference stage, the learned features are fed into the energy functions. And
the segmentations are solved in a primal-dual form by ADMM solvers. In the
training stage, we train our neural networks by optimizing the energy function
in the primal form with regularizations on the min-cut and flow-conservation
functions, which are derived from the optimal conditions in the dual form. We
evaluate our methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a brain tumor
segmentation task. As the energy minimization model achieves a balance on
sensitivity and smooth boundaries, we would show how our segmentation contours
evolve actively through iterations as ensemble references for doctor diagnosis.

tool underpinning multi-linear manipulation of tensors and tensor networks is
the standard Tensor Contraction Product (TCP). However, depending on the

turbulent friction factor ($f_t$) measurements in pipes of radius $R$ and wall
roughness $r$ can be collapsed onto a one-dimensional curve expressed as a
conveyance law $f_t Re^{1/4}=g_o(\chi)$, where $Re$ is a bulk Reynolds number,
$\chi =Re^{3/4}\left({r}/{R}\right)$. The implicit function $g_o(.)$ was
conjectured based on matching two asymptotic limits of $f_t$. However, the
connection between $g_o(.)$ and the phenomenon it proclaims to represent -
turbulent eddies - remains lacking. Using models for the wall-normal velocity
spectrum and return-to-isotropy for pressure-strain effects to close a
co-spectral density budget, a derivation of $g_o(.)$ is offered. The proposed
method explicitly derives the solution of the conveyance law and provides a
physical interpretation of $\chi$ as a dimensionless length scale reflecting
the competition between viscous sublayer thickness and characteristic height of
roughness elements. The application of the proposed method to other published
measurements spanning roughness and Reynolds numbers beyond the original

tremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no

causes motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head.
Therefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor

time series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with
elastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves

consequence, its occurrence is excluded in $d=2$, but not in $d=3$. We propose

cosmic expansion history. However, the calibration of their luminosity
distances is not an easy task in comparison to Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa). To
calibrate these data, correlations between their luminosity and other observed
properties of GRBs need to be identified, and we must consider the validity of
our assumptions about these correlations over their entire observed redshift
range. In this work, we propose a new method to calibrate GRBs as cosmological
distance indicators using SNeIa observations with a machine learning
architecture. As well we include a new data GRB calibrated sample using
extended cosmography in a redshift range above $z>3.6$. An overview of this
machine learning technique was developed in [1] to study the evolution of dark
energy models at high redshift. The aim of the method developed in this work is
to combine two networks: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Bayesian Neural
Network (BNN). Using this computational approach, denoted RNN+BNN, we extend
the network's efficacy by adding the computation of covariance matrices to the
Bayesian process. Once this is done, the SNeIa distance-redshift relation can
be tested on the full GRB sample and therefore used to implement a cosmographic
reconstruction of the distance-redshift relation in different regimes. Thus,
our newly-trained neural network is used to constrain the parameters describing
the kinematical state of the Universe via a cosmographic approach at high
redshifts (up to $z\approx 10$), wherein we require a very minimal set of
assumptions on the deep learning architecture itself that do not rely on

broadband approach for measuring dielectric constant. In conventional microwave
measurements, material samples are usually mechanically shaped to fit the
waveguide opening and measured in closed waveguides. This method is not
practical for millimeter-wave and sub-millimeter-wave measurements where the
waveguide openings become tiny, and it is rather difficult to shape the sample
to exactly the same dimensions as the waveguide cross-section. In this paper,
we present a method that allows one to measure arbitrarily shaped dielectric
slabs that extend outside waveguides. In this method, the measured sample is
placed between two waveguide flanges, creating a discontinuity. The measurement
system is characterized as an equivalent Pi-circuit, and the circuit elements
of the Pi-circuit are extracted from the scattering parameters. We have found
that the equivalent shunt impedance of the measured sample is only determined
by the material permittivity and is rather insensitive to the sample shape,
position, sizes, and other structural details of the discontinuity. This
feature can be leveraged for accurate measurements of permittivity. The
proposed method is very useful for measuring the permittivity of medium-loss

lengths, we add skip connections to improve performance and stabilize training
deeper networks. Second, we propose weight-sharing NAS with multi-architectural
sampling. We enlarge a network and utilize its sub-networks to define a search

evaluation of their performance. To efficiently train the super-network, we
propose to sample and train multiple sub-networks with one forward-backward

network architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ViT-ResNAS

significant molecular absorption. To surmount these critical challenges and
fully exploit the THz band, we explore a coexisting radio frequency (RF) and
THz finite indoor network in which THz small cells are deployed to provide high
data rates, and RF macrocells are deployed to satisfy coverage requirements.
Using stochastic geometry tools, we assess the performance of coexisting RF and

accuracy of the analytical results is validated with Monte-Carlo simulations.
Several insights are devised for accurate tuning and optimization of THz system

the THz bias. The obtained results recognize a clear coverage/rate trade-off

the moments of the underlying random variables. First, we derive polynomial
approximations of the conditional expectation operator. We then apply these

coincides with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) if and only if the input is
either Gaussian or constant, i.e., if and only if the conditional expectation

1. By combining the PMMSE with the I-MMSE relationship, we derive new formulas
for information measures (e.g., differential entropy, mutual information) that
are given in terms of the moments of the underlying random variables. As an
application, we introduce estimators for information measures from data via
approximating the moments in our formulas by sample moments. These estimators
are shown to be asymptotically consistent and possess desirable properties,

existing SSL algorithms use either all unlabeled examples or the unlabeled

However, it is possible that too many correct/wrong pseudo labeled examples are
eliminated/selected. In this work we develop a simple yet powerful framework,
whose key idea is to select a subset of training examples from the unlabeled
data when performing existing SSL methods so that only the unlabeled examples
with pseudo labels related to the labeled data will be used to train models.
The selection is performed at each updating iteration by only keeping the
examples whose losses are smaller than a given threshold that is dynamically
adjusted through the iteration. Our proposed approach, Dash, enjoys its
adaptivity in terms of unlabeled data selection and its theoretical guarantee.
Specifically, we theoretically establish the convergence rate of Dash from the
view of non-convex optimization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art over

study the system dynamics by monitoring the driving-induced population transfer

different dynamical regimes emerge when considering the evolution of the third
level population. One regime exhibits (off)resonant many-body oscillations
reminiscent of Rabi oscillations in a discrete two-level system, while the
other displays a strong linear rise. Within this second regime, we connect, via
linear response theory, the extracted transfer rate to the system
single-particle spectral function, and infer the nature of the excitations from
Bethe ansatz calculations. In addition, we show that this radio-frequency
technique can be employed to gain insights into this many-body system coupling
mechanism away from equilibrium. This is done by monitoring the momentum
density redistributions and the evolution of the pair correlations during the
drive. Capturing such non-equilibrium physics goes beyond a linear response
treatment, and is achieved here by conducting time-dependent matrix product

detected with MeerKAT before 2021 February 07 when it appeared and reached a
peak flux density of 5.6\,mJy. The source was still highly circularly
polarized, but also showed up to 80\% linear polarization, and then faded
rapidly with a timescale of one day. The rotation measure of the source varied
significantly, from $-11.8\pm0.8$\,rad\,m$^{-2}$ to
$-64.0\pm1.5$\,rad\,m$^{-2}$, over three days. No X-ray counterpart was found

the first MeerKAT detection, with upper limits of $\sim
5.0\times10^{31}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ (0.3--8\,keV, assuming a distance $\sim10$

that of finding an electrical flow, and its dual is equivalent to solving a
Laplacian linear system. The case $p = \infty$ corresponds to finding a
min-congestion flow, which is equivalent to max-flows. A typical algorithmic
construction for such problems considers vertex potentials corresponding to the
flow conservation constraints, and has two simple types of update steps: cycle
toggling, which modifies the flow along a cycle, and cut toggling, which
modifies all potentials on one side of a cut. Both types of steps are typically
performed relative to a spanning tree $T$; then the cycle is a fundamental
cycle of $T$, and the cut is a fundamental cut of $T$. In this paper, we show
that these simple steps can be used to give a novel efficient implementation

well-engineered schedulers, which eschew theoretical guarantees for practical
efficiency.
  We investigate whether it is possible to design and implement a
Multi-Queue-based task scheduler that is both highly efficient and has
analytical guarantees. We propose a new variant called the Stealing Multi-Queue
(SMQ), a cache-efficient variant of the Multi-Queue, which leverages both queue
affinity -- each thread has a local queue, from which tasks are usually
removed; but, with some probability, threads also attempt to steal
higher-priority tasks from the other queues -- and task batching, that is, the
processing of several tasks in a single insert / delete step. These ideas are
well-known for task scheduling without priorities; our theoretical contribution
is showing that, despite relaxations, this design can still provide rank
guarantees, which in turn implies bounds on total work performed. We provide a
general SMQ implementation that can surpass state-of-the-art schedulers such as
Galois and PMOD in terms of performance on popular graph-processing benchmarks.
Notably, the performance improvement comes mainly from the superior rank
guarantees provided by our scheduler, confirming that analytically-reasoned
approaches can still provide performance improvements for priority task
scheduling.

are complex to analyze compared to local code changes. Development teams aiming
to review architectural aspects (design) of a change commit consider many
essential scenarios such as access rules and restrictions on usage of program
entities across modules. Moreover, design review is essential when proper
architectural formulations are paramount for developing and deploying a system.
Untangling architectural changes, recovering semantic design, and producing
design notes are the crucial tasks of the design review process. To support
these tasks, we construct a lightweight tool [4] that can detect and decompose
semantic slices of a commit containing architectural instances. A semantic
slice consists of a description of relational information of involved modules,
their classes, methods and connected modules in a change instance, which is
easy to understand to a reviewer. We extract various directory and naming
structures (DANS) properties from the source code for developing our tool.
Utilizing the DANS properties, our tool first detects architectural change
instances based on our defined metric and then decomposes the slices (based on
string processing). Our preliminary investigation with ten open-source projects
(developed in Java and Kotlin) reveals that the DANS properties produce highly
reliable precision and recall (93-100%) for detecting and generating
architectural slices. Our proposed tool will serve as the preliminary approach
for the semantic design recovery and design summary generation for the project
releases.

nanowires in a series array and multiplexing photons over space, such series
PNR-SNSPD can gain quasi-PNR capacity. However, the accuracy and maximum
resolved photon number are both limited by the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of
the output pulses. Here, we introduce a matched filter, which is an optimal
filter in terms of SNR for SNSPD pulses. Experimentally, compared to
conventional readout using a room-temperature amplifier, the normalized spacing
between pulse amplitudes from adjacent photon number detections increased by a
maximum factor of 2.1 after the matched filter. Combining with a cryogenic
amplifier to increase SNR further, such spacing increased by a maximum factor
of 5.3. In contrast to a low pass filter, the matched filter gave better SNRs
while maintaining good timing jitters. Minimum timing jitter of 55 ps was
obtained experimentally. Our results suggest that the matched filter is a
useful tool for improving the performance of the series PNR-SNSPD and the
maximum resolved photon number can be expected to reach 65 or even large.

take $a_0(1450)$ as the lowest-lying $q{\bar q}$ state and $a_0(1950)$ as the

algorithmic fairness has gained increasing importance. In this paper, we
propose a Generative Adversarial Network for tabular data generation. The model
includes two phases of training. In the first phase, the model is trained to
accurately generate synthetic data similar to the reference dataset. In the
second phase we modify the value function to add fairness constraint, and
continue training the network to generate data that is both accurate and fair.
We test our results in both cases of unconstrained, and constrained fair data
generation. In the unconstrained case, i.e. when the model is only trained in
the first phase and is only meant to generate accurate data following the same
joint probability distribution of the real data, the results show that the
model beats state-of-the-art GANs proposed in the literature to produce
synthetic tabular data. Also, in the constrained case in which the first phase
of training is followed by the second phase, we train the network and test it
on four datasets studied in the fairness literature and compare our results
with another state-of-the-art pre-processing method, and present the promising
results that it achieves. Comparing to other studies utilizing GANs for fair
data generation, our model is comparably more stable by using only one critic,
and also by avoiding major problems of original GAN model, such as
mode-dropping and non-convergence, by implementing a Wasserstein GAN.

structures - affects multinucleon transfer reactions.
  Purpose: To shed light on the effect of deformation in multinucleon transfer
processes, we study the $^{16}$O+$^{154}$Sm reaction at $E_{\rm lab}$=85 MeV
(around the Coulomb barrier) and 134 MeV (substantially above the Coulomb
barrier), where the target nucleus, $^{154}$Sm, is a well-established, deformed
nucleus.
  Results: Angular distributions for elastic scattering and for various
transfer channels were measured over a wide angular range at the BARC-TIFR
pelletron-Linac accelerator facility, Mumbai. The $Q$-value- and
angle-integrated isotope production cross sections have been extracted from the
measured angular distributions. The experimental data are analyzed along with
time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations. For the lower incident energy case,
we find a reasonable agreement between the measurements and the TDHF
calculations for a-few-nucleon transfer channels; whereas TDHF underestimates
cross sections for many-nucleon transfers, consistent with earlier works. On
the other side, we find that calculated cross sections for secondary reaction
products for the higher incident energy case, qualitatively explains the
measured trends of isotopic distributions observed for the lower energy. The
latter observation indicates possible underestimation of excitation energies in
the present TDHF+GEMINI analysis. Although certain orientation effects were
observed in TDHF results, it is difficult to disentangle them from the
$Q$-value- and angle-integrated production cross sections.

has been proven to be a very promising work. However, how to deeply dig out the
relationship between different channels and make full use of it while
maintaining the uniqueness of each channel is a problem that has not been well
studied and resolved in this field. Under such circumstances, this paper
explores and verifies the deficiency of directly constructing contrastive
learning tasks on different channels with practical experiments and proposes
the scheme of interactive modeling and matching representation across different
channels. This is the first attempt in the field of recommender systems, we
believe the insight of this paper is inspirational to future self-supervised
learning research based on multi-channel information. To solve this problem, we
propose a cross-channel matching representation model based on attentive
interaction, which realizes efficient modeling of the relationship between
cross-channel information. Based on this, we also propose a hierarchical
self-supervised learning model, which realizes two levels of self-supervised
learning within and between channels, which improves the ability of
self-supervised tasks to autonomously mine different levels of potential
information. We have conducted abundant experiments, and various metrics on
multiple public datasets show that the method proposed in this paper has a
significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods, no matter
in the general or cold-start scenario. And in the experiment of model variant
analysis, the benefits of the cross-channel matching representation model and
the hierarchical self-supervised model proposed in this paper are also fully
verified.

defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing
AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed
points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to
considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this
work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the
diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of
benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial
Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by
the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and
constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples
diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes
a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that
perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the
model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial
training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.

inpainting methods target primarily at natural scenes with repetitive patterns.
They do not make use of any prior knowledge of the face to help retrieve
correspondences for the corrupted face. They therefore only achieve sub-optimal
results, particularly for faces under large pose and expression variations
where face components appear very differently across frames. In this paper, we
propose a two-stage deep learning method for face video inpainting. We employ
3DMM as our 3D face prior to transform a face between the image space and the
UV (texture) space. In Stage I, we perform face inpainting in the UV space.
This helps to largely remove the influence of face poses and expressions and
makes the learning task much easier with well aligned face features. We
introduce a frame-wise attention module to fully exploit correspondences in
neighboring frames to assist the inpainting task. In Stage II, we transform the
inpainted face regions back to the image space and perform face video
refinement that inpaints any background regions not covered in Stage I and also
refines the inpainted face regions. Extensive experiments have been carried out
which show our method can significantly outperform methods based merely on 2D
information, especially for faces under large pose and expression variations.

achieved in the planar junctions fabricated on the surface of Weyl semimetal

inside the 2D junction can generate conductance oscillation with its visibility
strongly relying on the shape of the Fermi arcs and their orientation relative
to the strip electrodes, the latter clearly revealing the anisotropy of the
Fermi arcs. Moreover, we show that the visibility of the oscillating pattern
can be significantly enhanced by a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface
taking advantage of the bulk-surface connected Weyl orbits. Our work offers an
effective way for the identification of Fermi arc surface states through

the robustness against outlier measurements. Instead of relying on the time
difference carrier phase (TDCP) which only considers two neighboring epochs
using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimator, this paper proposed to employ
the carrier-phase measurements inside a window, the so-called window
carrier-phase (WCP), to constrain the states inside a factor graph. A left null
space matrix is employed to eliminate the shared unknown ambiguity variables
and therefore, correlated the associated states inside the WCP. Then the
pseudorange, Doppler, and the constructed WCP measurements are integrated
simultaneously using factor graph optimization (FGO) to estimate the state of
the GNSS receiver. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method in two
typical urban canyons in Hong Kong, achieving the mean positioning error of
1.76 meters and 2.96 meters, respectively, using the automobile-level GNSS

attacker injects several watermarked, mislabeled training examples into a
training set. The watermark does not impact the test-time performance of the
model on typical data; however, the model reliably errs on watermarked
examples.
  To gain a better foundational understanding of backdoor data poisoning
attacks, we present a formal theoretical framework within which one can discuss
backdoor data poisoning attacks for classification problems. We then use this
to analyze important statistical and computational issues surrounding these
attacks.
  On the statistical front, we identify a parameter we call the memorization
capacity that captures the intrinsic vulnerability of a learning problem to a
backdoor attack. This allows us to argue about the robustness of several
natural learning problems to backdoor attacks. Our results favoring the
attacker involve presenting explicit constructions of backdoor attacks, and our
robustness results show that some natural problem settings cannot yield
successful backdoor attacks.
  From a computational standpoint, we show that under certain assumptions,
adversarial training can detect the presence of backdoors in a training set. We
then show that under similar assumptions, two closely related problems we call
backdoor filtering and robust generalization are nearly equivalent. This
implies that it is both asymptotically necessary and sufficient to design
algorithms that can identify watermarked examples in the training set in order
to obtain a learning algorithm that both generalizes well to unseen data and is
robust to backdoors.

energy at the quantum level. Here we propose a spin-charger protocol, in which
the battery cells are charged by a finite number of spins through a general
Heisenberg XY interaction. Under the isotropic interaction, the spin-charger
protocol is endowed with a higher capacity in terms of the maximum stored
energy than the conventional protocols, where the battery is charged by a
continuous-variable system, e.g., a cavity mode. By tuning the charger size, a
trade-off between the maximum stored energy and the average charging power is
found in comparison to the cavity-charger protocol in the Tavis-Cummings model.
Quantum advantage of our protocol is manifested by the scaling behavior of the
optimal average power with respect to the battery size, in comparing the
collective charging scheme to its parallel counterpart. We also discuss the
detrimental effect on the charging performance from the anisotropic interaction
between the battery and the charger, the non-ideal initial states for both of
them, and the crosstalk among the charger spins. A strong charger-charger
interaction can be used to decouple the battery and the charger. Our findings
about the advantages of the spin-charger protocol over the conventional
cavity-charger protocols, including the high capacity of energy storage and the
superior power-law in the collective charging, provide an insight to exploit an
efficient quantum battery based on the spin-spin-environment model.

should on average return to its starting point and stay there. Despite the
central role played by Anderson localization in the modern understanding of
condensed matter, this ""quantum boomerang"" effect, an essential feature of the
localized state, was only recently theoretically predicted and has not
previously been observed. We report the experimental observation of the quantum
boomerang effect. Using a degenerate gas and a phase-shifted pair of optical
lattices, we probe the role of time reversal symmetry breaking, Floquet gauge,
and initial state symmetry in supporting or disrupting the boomerang effect.
Highlighting the key role of localization, we observe that as stochastic
kicking destroys dynamical localization, the quantum boomerang effect also
disappears. Measured dynamics are in agreement with analytical and numerical
predictions. These results showcase a unique experimental probe of the
underlying quantum nature of Anderson localized matter.

pixel-level classification task on the input image, currently has broad
application prospects, especially in the fast-developing fields of autonomous
driving and drone navigation. However, the huge burden of calculation together
with redundant parameters are still the obstacles to its technological
development. In this paper, we propose a Fast Bilateral Symmetrical Network
(FBSNet) to alleviate the above challenges. Specifically, FBSNet employs a
symmetrical encoder-decoder structure with two branches, semantic information
branch and spatial detail branch. The Semantic Information Branch (SIB) is the
main branch with semantic architecture to acquire the contextual information of
the input image and meanwhile acquire sufficient receptive field. While the
Spatial Detail Branch (SDB) is a shallow and simple network used to establish
local dependencies of each pixel for preserving details, which is essential for
restoring the original resolution during the decoding phase. Meanwhile, a
Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) is designed to effectively combine the output
of these two branches. Experimental results of Cityscapes and CamVid show that
the proposed FBSNet can strike a good balance between accuracy and efficiency.
Specifically, it obtains 70.9\% and 68.9\% mIoU along with the inference speed
of 90 fps and 120 fps on these two test datasets, respectively, with only 0.62
million parameters on a single RTX 2080Ti GPU. The code is available at

moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation (RTE). In our
previous work \cite{huang2021gradient}, we proposed an approach to learn the
gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than
learning the moment itself and the conventional $P_N$ closure. However, while
the ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee
hyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper
\cite{huang2021hyperbolic}, we identified a symmetrizer which leads to
conditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable
hyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that
in practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower
moments.
  In this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML
closure model. Motivated by the observation that the coefficient matrix of the
closure system is a lower Hessenberg matrix, we relate its eigenvalues to the
roots of an associated polynomial. We design two new neural network
architectures based on this relation. The ML closure model resulting from the
first neural network is weakly hyperbolic and guarantees the physical
characteristic speeds, i.e., the eigenvalues are bounded by the speed of light.
The second model is strictly hyperbolic and does not guarantee the boundedness
of the eigenvalues. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source
problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, stability and
generalizability of our hyperbolic ML closure model.

scale-free networks (FSFNs), the present model can systematically and widely
change the network structure. In this model, an FSFN is iteratively formed by
replacing each edge in the previous generation network with a small graph
called a generator. The choice of generators enables us to control the
scale-free property, fractality, and other structural properties of
hierarchical FSFNs. We calculate theoretically various characteristic
quantities of networks, such as the exponent of the power-law degree
distribution, fractal dimension, average clustering coefficient, global
clustering coefficient, and joint probability describing the nearest-neighbor
degree correlation. As an example of analyses of phenomena occurring on FSFNs,
we also present the critical point and critical exponents of the
bond-percolation transition on infinite FSFNs, which is related to the
robustness of networks against edge removal. By comparing the percolation
critical points of FSFNs whose structural properties are the same as each other
except for the clustering nature, we clarify the effect of the clustering on
the robustness of FSFNs. As demonstrated by this example, the present model
makes it possible to elucidate how a specific structural property influences a
phenomenon occurring on FSFNs by varying systematically the structures of
FSFNs. Finally, we extend our model for deterministic FSFNs to a model of
non-deterministic ones by introducing asymmetric generators and reexamine all
characteristic quantities and the percolation problem for such

data. However, the sounds to which IDLMA is applied do not always have such
timbres, and the timbral mismatch causes the performance degradation of IDLMA.
To tackle this problem, we focus on a blind source separation counterpart of
IDLMA, independent low-rank matrix analysis. It uses nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) as the source model, which can capture source spectral
components that only appear in the target mixture, using the low-rank structure
of the source spectrogram as a clue. We thus extend the DNN-based source model
to encompass the NMF-based source model on the basis of the product-of-expert

initiates from relatively 'soft' regions in the material in which large-scale
non-affine deformations become localized. The test of this hypothesis requires
an effective means of identifying 'soft' regions and their evolution as the
material is deformed to varying degrees, where the metric of 'softness' must
also account for the effect of temperature on local material stiffness. We show
that the mean square atomic displacement on a caging timescale <u2>, the
'Debye-Waller factor', provides a useful method for estimating the shear
modulus of the entire material and, by extension, the material stiffness at an
atomic scale. Based on this 'softness' metrology, we observe that SB formation
indeed occurs through the strain-induced formation of localized soft regions in
our deformed metallic glass free-standing films. Unexpectedly, the critical
strain condition of SB formation occurs when the softness (<u2>) distribution
within the emerging soft regions approaches that of the interfacial region in
its undeformed state, initiating an instability with similarities to the
transition to turbulence. Correspondingly, no SBs arise when the material is so
thin that the entire material can be approximately described as being
'interfacial' in nature. We also quantify relaxation in the glass and the
nature and origin of highly non-Gaussian particle displacements in the
dynamically heterogeneous SB regions at times longer than the caging time.

It is found that double $\Upsilon$ production from these $|uud b \overline b b

the common features. Specifically, we first prepare a set of deep models as a
committee, then deduce the explanation for every model, and obtain the
consensus of explanations across the entire committee through voting. With the
cross-model consensus of explanations, we conduct extensive experiments using
80+ models on 5 datasets/tasks. We find three interesting phenomena as follows:
(1) the consensus obtained from image classification models is aligned with the
ground truth of semantic segmentation; (2) we measure the similarity of the
explanation result of each model in the committee to the consensus (namely
consensus score), and find positive correlations between the consensus score
and model performance; and (3) the consensus score coincidentally correlates to

27$^{th}$, 2018 we discovered an isolated millisecond pulsar (MSP), PSR
J0318+0253, coincident with the unassociated $\gamma$-ray source 3FGL
J0318.1+0252. PSR J0318+0253 has a spin period of $5.19$ milliseconds, a
dispersion measure (DM) of $26$ pc cm$^{-3}$ corresponding to a DM distance of
about $1.3$ kpc, and a period-averaged flux density of $\sim$11 $\pm$ 2 $\mu$Jy
at L-band (1.05-1.45 GHz). Among all high energy MSPs, PSR J0318+0253 is the
faintest ever detected in radio bands, by a factor of at least $\sim$4 in terms
of L-band fluxes. With the aid of the radio ephemeris, an analysis of 9.6 years
of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data revealed that PSR J0318+0253 also displays strong
$\gamma$-ray pulsations. Follow-up observations carried out by both Arecibo and
FAST suggest a likely spectral turn-over around 350 MHz. This is the first
result from the collaboration between FAST and the \textit{Fermi}-LAT teams as
well as the first confirmed new MSP discovery by FAST, raising hopes for the
detection of many more MSPs. Such discoveries will make a significant

non-volatile electronic memory to optical data storage by providing reversible,
repeatable, and rapid switching between amorphous and crystalline states
accompanied by large changes in the electrical and optical properties. Here, we
demonstrate how ion irradiation can be used to tailor disorder in initially
crystalline Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) thin films via the intentional creation of lattice
defects. We found that continuous Ar ion irradiation at room temperature of GST
films causes complete amorphization of GST when exceeding 0.6 (for rock-salt
GST) and 3 (for hexagonal GST) displacements per atom (n_dpa). While the
transition from rock-salt to amorphous GST is caused by progressive
amorphization via the accumulation of lattice defects, several transitions
occur in hexagonal GST upon ion irradiation. In hexagonal GST, the creation of
point defects and small defect clusters leads to disordering of intrinsic
vacancy layers (van der Waals gaps) that drives the electronic metal-insulator
transition. Increasing disorder then induces a structural transition from
hexagonal to rock-salt and then leads to amorphization. Furthermore, we
observed different annealing behavior of defects for rock-salt and hexagonal
GST. The higher amorphization threshold in hexagonal GST compared to rock-salt
GST is caused by an increased defect-annealing rate, i.e., a higher resistance
against ion-beam-induced disorder. Moreover, we observed that the recovery of
defects in GST is on the time scale of seconds or less at room temperature.

$2$-groups of small orders, namely, the orders of $2^n$ for $n<8$. Immediately
we should note the issues our consideration describe in the introduction in
more detail.
  Here we will indicate the main directions of our research. Previously, we
proved that the normalized group of units of an integral group ring of a cyclic
2-group of order $2^n$ contains a subgroup of finite index, which is the direct
product of the subgroup of units defined by the character with the largest
character field and the subgroup of units that is isomorphic to the subgroup of
units of the integer group ring of the cyclic $2$-group of order $2^{n-1}$.
Because of this, it is very important to study the structure of the subgroup of
units defined by the character with the largest field of characters, which is
the cyclotomic field $Q_{2^n}$ obtained by adjoining a primitive $2^n$th root
of unity to $Q$, the field of rational number. That subgroup of units of an
integral group ring of a cyclic $2$-group is isomorphic to the subgroup of the
group of units of the integer ring of the specified cyclotomic field.
Therefore, the research of units of an integer group ring of a cyclic $2$-group
is reduced to study the properties of the group of units of the integer ring of
the cyclotomic field $Q_{2^n}$.
  Thus, we will study of groups of circular units of integer rings of
cyclotomic fields $Q_{2^n}$ in large part.

Community e-commerce is not a mature and sound comprehensive e-commerce with
fewer categories and low brand value. To effectively retain community users and
fully explore customer value has become an important challenge for community
e-commerce operators. Given the above problems, this paper uses the data-driven
method to study the prediction of community e-commerce customers' repurchase
behaviour. The main research contents include 1. Given the complex problem of
feature engineering, the classic model RFM in the field of customer
relationship management is improved, and an improved model is proposed to
describe the characteristics of customer buying behaviour, which includes five
indicators. 2. In view of the imbalance of machine learning training samples in
SMOTE-ENN, a training sample balance using SMOTE-ENN is proposed. The
experimental results show that the machine learning model can be trained more
effectively on balanced samples. 3. Aiming at the complexity of the parameter
adjustment process, an automatic hyperparameter optimization method based on
the TPE method was proposed. Compared with other methods, the model's
prediction performance is improved, and the training time is reduced by more
than 450%. 4. Aiming at the weak prediction ability of a single model, the soft
voting based RF-LightgBM model was proposed. The experimental results show that
the RF-LighTGBM model proposed in this paper can effectively predict customer

find a principal submatrix having the maximum determinant. The other is
probabilistic inference on exponentiated DPPs (E-DPPs), which can sharpen or
weaken the diversity preference of DPPs with an exponent parameter $p$. We
present several complexity-theoretic hardness results that explain the
difficulty in approximating MAP inference and the normalizing constant for
E-DPPs. We first prove that unconstrained MAP inference for an $n \times n$
matrix is $\textsf{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $2^{\beta n}$,
where $\beta = 10^{-10^{13}} $. This result improves upon the best-known
inapproximability factor of $(\frac{9}{8}-\epsilon)$, and rules out the
existence of any polynomial-factor approximation algorithm assuming $\textsf{P}
\neq \textsf{NP}$. We then show that log-determinant maximization is
$\textsf{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $\frac{5}{4}$ for the
unconstrained case and within a factor of $1+10^{-10^{13}}$ for the
size-constrained monotone case. In particular, log-determinant maximization
does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme unless $\textsf{P} =
\textsf{NP}$. As a corollary of the first result, we demonstrate that the
normalizing constant for E-DPPs of any (fixed) constant exponent $p \geq
\beta^{-1} = 10^{10^{13}}$ is $\textsf{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor
of $2^{\beta pn}$, which is in contrast to the case of $p \leq 1$ admitting a
fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme.

strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench
depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with

two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible

associate a weight drawn from a semiring $K$ with every transition and every

equivalence or weighted bisimulation. In this paper we explore the properties
of weighted automata in the framework of coalgebras over (i) the category
$\mathsf{SMod}$ of semimodules over a semiring $K$ and $K$-linear maps, and
(ii) the category $\mathsf{Set}$ of sets and maps. We show that the behavioural
equivalences defined by the corresponding final coalgebras in these two cases
characterize weighted language equivalence and weighted bisimulation,
respectively. These results extend earlier work by Bonchi et al. using the
category $\mathsf{Vect}$ of vector spaces and linear maps as the underlying
model for weighted automata with weights drawn from a field $K$. The key step
in our work is generalizing the notions of linear relation and linear
bisimulation of Boreale from vector spaces to semimodules using the concept of
the kernel of a $K$-linear map in the sense of universal algebra. We also
provide an abstract procedure for forward partition refinement for computing
weighted language equivalence. Since for weighted automata defined over
semirings the problem is undecidable in general, it is guaranteed to halt only
in special cases. We provide sufficient conditions for the termination of our
procedure. Although the results are similar to those of Bonchi et al., many of

evidence from industry, government and research communities across multiple
disciplines. We explore the technical and non-technical factors negatively
impacting a small business' ability to safeguard itself, such as resource

  November 16 - 20, 2020","Kyoto Daigaku Suurikaiseki Kenkyuusho Koukyuuroku 2020",,,"math.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In J. Symbolic Logic,51(4): 957-968, 1986, Pawlikowski proved that, if $r$ is
a random real over $\mathbf{N}$, and $c$ is Cohen real over $\mathbf{N}[r]$,
then
  (a) in $\mathbf{N}[r][c]$ there is a Cohen real over $\mathbf{N}[c]$, and
  (b) $2^\omega\cap\mathbf{N}[c]\notin\mathcal{N}\cap\mathbf{N}[r][c]$, so in
$\mathbf{N}[r][c]$ there is no random real over $\mathbf{N}[c]$.
  To prove this, Pawlikowski proposes the following notion: Given two models
$\mathbf{N}\subseteq \mathbf{M}$ of ZFC, we associate with a cardinal
characteristic $\mathfrak{x}$ of the continuum, a sentence
$\mathfrak{x}_\mathbf{N}^\mathbf{M}$ saying that in $\mathbf{M}$, the reals in
$\mathbf{N}$ give an example of a family fulfilling the requirements of the
cardinal. So to prove (a) and (b), it suffices to prove that
  (a')
$\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{M})_{\mathbf{N}[c]}^{\mathbf{M}[c]}\Rightarrow\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{M})_{\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{M}}\Rightarrow\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})_{\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{M}}$,
and
  (b')
$\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{M})_\mathbf{N}^\mathbf{M}\Rightarrow\mathrm{add}(\mathcal{M})_{\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{M}}\Rightarrow\mathrm{non}(\mathcal{M})_{\mathbf{N}[c]}^{\mathbf{M}[c]}\Rightarrow\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})_{\mathbf{N}[c]}^{\mathbf{M}[c]}$.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of Tukey-order with models, which
expands the concept of Tukey-order introduced by Vojt\'{a}\v{s} (Israel Math.
Conf. Proc. 6: 619-643, 1991) to prove expressions of the form
$\mathfrak{x}_\mathbf{N}^\mathbf{M}\Rightarrow\mathfrak{y}_\mathbf{N}^\mathbf{M}$.
In particular, we show (a') and (b') using Tukey-order with models.

simultaneously identifies demand baselines and the incentive-based agent demand

process of a demand response participant is represented as a differentiable
optimization layer, which takes the incentive signal as input and predicts
user's response; 2) the baseline demand forecast is represented as a standard
neural network model, which takes relevant features and predicts user's

net demand forecast. We then propose a gradient-descent approach that
backpropagates the net demand forecast errors to update the weights of the
agent model and the weights of baseline demand forecast, jointly. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through computation experiments

Our implementation allows one to relax molecular structures at the RPA level

Benchmark calculations show that our approach delivers high numerical precision
compared to previous implementations. A careful assessment of the quality of
RPA geometries for small molecules reveals that post-KS RPA systematically
overestimates the bond lengths. We furthermore optimized the geometries of the
four low-lying water hexamers -- cage, prism, cyclic and book isomers, and
determined the energy hierarchy of these four isomers using RPA. The obtained
RPA energy ordering is in good agreement with that yielded by the coupled
cluster method with single, double and perturbative triple excitations, despite
that the dissociation energies themselves are appreciably underestimated. The
underestimation of the dissociation energies by RPA is well corrected by the
renormalized single excitation correction.

we investigate the broadest spectral energy distribution of the Crab nebula and
the energy distribution of the electrons emitting the multiwavelength

powered by the pulsar, and high-energy electrons/positrons with a broken
power-law spectrum are continually injected in the nebula as the pulsar spins
down. Multiwavelength nonthermal emission is generated by the leptons through
synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. Using appropriate
parameters, the detected fluxes for the nebula can be well reproduced,
especially for the $\gamma$-rays from $10^2\,\mathrm{MeV}$ to
$1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. The results show that the detected $\gamma$-rays can be
produced by the leptons via the inverse Compton scattering, and the lower limit
of the Lorentz factor of the most energetic leptons is $\sim 8.5\times10^{9}$.
It can be concluded that there are electrons/positrons with energies higher

enhanced giant stars with unexpected high masses ($\gtrsim$1 $M_\odot$) from

masses imply young ages ($\tau<6$Gyr) incompatible with the canonical Galactic
chemical evolution scenario. Here we study the chemistry and kinematics of a
large sample of such $\alpha$-rich, high-mass red giant branch (RGB) stars
drawn from the LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Using LAMOST and Gaia, we found
these stars share the same kinematics as the canonical high-$\alpha$ old
stellar population in the Galactic thick disk. The stellar abundances show that
these high-$\alpha$ massive stars have $\alpha$- and iron-peak element
abundances similar to those of the high-$\alpha$ old thick disk stars. However,
a portion of them exhibit higher [(N+C)/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] ratios, which implies
they have gained C- and Ba-rich materials from extra sources, presumably
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions. The results support the previous
suggestion that these RGB stars are products of binary evolution. Their high
masses thus mimic ""young"" single stars, yet in fact they belong to an intrinsic
old stellar population. To fully explain the stellar abundance patterns of our
sample stars, a variety of binary evolution channels, such as, main-sequence
(MS) + RGB, MS + AGB, RGB + RGB and RGB + AGB, are required, pointing to
diverse formation mechanisms of these seemly rejuvenated cannibals. With this

detectability of memory effects, including contributions from subdominant
harmonic modes, in heavy IMRIs consisting of a stellar mass black hole and an
intermediate mass black hole. When formed through hierarchical mergers, for
example when a GW190521-like remnant captures a stellar mass black hole, IMRI
systems have a large total mass, large spin on the primary, and possibly
residual eccentricity; features that potentially raise the prospect for memory
detection. We compute both the displacement and spin non-linear GW memory from
the $m \neq 0$ gravitational waveforms computed within a black hole
perturbation theory framework that is partially calibrated to numerical
relativity waveforms. We probe the dependence of memory effects on mass ratio,
spin, and eccentricity and consider the detectability of a memory signal from
IMRIs using current and future GW detectors. We find that (i) while
eccentricity introduces additional features in both displacement and spin
memory, it does not appreciatively change the prospects of detectability, (ii)
including higher modes into the memory computation can increase singal-to-noise
(SNR) values by about 7\% in some cases, (iii) the SNR from displacement memory
dramatically increases as the spin approaches large, positive values, (iv) spin
memory from heavy IMRIs would, however, be difficult to detect with future

select a subsample of bright {\it Swift} bursts to revisit the GRB luminosity
function (LF) and redshift distribution by taking into account the probability
of redshift measurement. Here we also explore two general expressions for the
GRB LF, i.e., a broken power-law LF and a triple power-law LF. Our results
suggest that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity (with an evolution index
of $\delta=1.92^{+0.25}_{-0.37}$) or in density ($\delta=1.26^{+0.33}_{-0.34}$)
is required in order to well account for the observations, independent of the
assumed expression of the GRB LF. However, in a one-on-one comparison using the
Akaike information criterion, the best-fitting evolution model involving the
triple power-law LF is statistically preferred over the best-fitting one
involving the broken power-law LF with a relative probability of $\sim94.3$\%
versus $\sim5.7$\%. Extrapolating our fitting results to the flux limit of the
whole {\it Swift} sample, and considering the trigger probability of {\it
Swift}/Burst Alert Telescope in detail, we find that the expectations from our
evolution models provide a good representation of the observed distributions of
the whole sample without the need for any adjustment of the model free
parameters. This further confirms the reliability of our analysis results.

partition of $ k $ and $ G $ is a graph. A $\lambda$-assignment of $ G $ is a $
k $-assignment $ L $ of $ G $ such that the colour set $ \bigcup_{v\in V(G)}
L(v) $ can be partitioned into $ q $ subsets $ C_1\cup C_2\cup\cdots\cup C_q $
and for each vertex $ v $ of $ G $, $ |L(v)\cap C_i|=k_i $. We say $ G $ is
$\lambda$-choosable if for each $\lambda$-assignment $ L $ of $ G $, $ G $ is $
L $-colourable. In particular, if $ \lambda=\{k\} $, then $\lambda$-choosable
is the same as $ k $-choosable, if $ \lambda=\{1, 1,...,1\} $, then
$\lambda$-choosable is equivalent to $ k $-colourable. For the other partitions
of $ k $ sandwiched between $ \{k\} $ and $ \{1, 1,...,1\} $ in terms of
refinements, $\lambda$-choosability reveals a complex hierarchy of
colourability of graphs.
  Assume $\lambda=\{k_1, \ldots, k_q\} $ is a partition of $ k $ and $\lambda'
$ is a partition of $ k'\ge k $. We write $ \lambda\le \lambda' $ if there is a
partition $\lambda''=\{k''_1, \ldots, k''_q\}$ of $k'$ with $k''_i \ge k_i$ for
$i=1,2,\ldots, q$ and
  $\lambda'$ is a refinement of $\lambda''$. It follows from the definition
that if $ \lambda\le \lambda' $, then every $\lambda$-choosable graph is
$\lambda'$-choosable. It was proved in [X. Zhu, A refinement of choosability of
graphs, J. Combin. Theory, Ser. B 141 (2020) 143 - 164] that the converse is
also true. This paper strengthens this result and proves that for any $
\lambda\not\le \lambda' $, for any integer $g$, there exists a graph of girth
at least $g$ which is $\lambda$-choosable but not $\lambda'$-choosable.

constraint, we require the covariance of the transmit waveform be equal to a
given optimal covariance for MIMO radar, to guarantee the radar performance.
With this constraint, we formulate and solve the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem for multiuser
transmit beamforming via convex optimization. Considering that the interference
cannot be completely eliminated with this constraint, we introduce dirty paper
coding (DPC) to further cancel the interference, and formulate the SINR
balancing and sum rate maximization problem in the DPC regime. Although both of
the two problems are non-convex, we show that they can be reformulated to
convex optimizations via the Lagrange and downlink-uplink duality. In addition,
we propose gradient projection based algorithms to solve the equivalent dual
problem of SINR balancing, in both transmit beamforming and DPC regimes. The
simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvement of DPC over
transmit beamforming, and also indicate that the degrees of freedom for the

conventional alternatives for denoising positron emission tomography (PET)

Herein, we propose an unsupervised 3D PET image denoising method based on an
anatomical information-guided attention mechanism. The proposed magnetic
resonance-guided deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and
semantic features of MR-guidance image more effectively by introducing
encoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the specific shapes and
patterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because
the guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate. In a
Monte Carlo simulation of [$^{18}$F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), the
proposed method achieved the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity (27.92 $\pm$ 0.44 dB/0.886 $\pm$ 0.007), as compared with Gaussian
filtering (26.68 $\pm$ 0.10 dB/0.807 $\pm$ 0.004), image guided filtering

0.43 dB/0.737 $\pm$ 0.017), and MR-DIP (27.65 $\pm$ 0.42 dB/0.879 $\pm$ 0.007).
Furthermore, we experimentally visualized the behavior of the optimization
process, which is often unknown in unsupervised CNN-based restoration problems.
For preclinical (using [$^{18}$F]FDG and [$^{11}$C]raclopride) and clinical
(using [$^{18}$F]florbetapir) studies, the proposed method demonstrates
state-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial resolution and
quantitative accuracy, despite using a common network architecture for various
noisy PET images with 1/10th of the full counts. These results suggest that the
proposed MR-GDD can reduce PET scan times and PET tracer doses considerably
without impacting patients.

energy paths for the half- and full-fluorination processes are calculated for a
better understanding of these phenomena. While experimental observations
indicate a much slower rate of the full-fluorination process, compared with the
half-fluorination one, the obtained energy profiles demonstrate much enhanced
fluorine adsorption after the half-fluorination stage. This ambiguity is
explained in terms of significant chemical activation of the graphene sheet
after half-fluorination, which remarkably facilitates the formation of chemical
contaminants in the system and thus substantially slows down the
full-fluorination procedure. After considering the binding energy and
durability of the relevant chemical species, including hydrogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen molecules and xenon atom, it is argued that oxygen-fluorine ligands
are the most likely chemical contaminants opposing the full-fluorination of a
graphene sheet. We propose an oxygen desorption mechanism for the atomic
description of the full-fluorination procedure in realistic situations. It is
argued that the proposed mechanism explains well much enhanced rate of the

occur when three interacting waves satisfy the resonance conditions of the form
$k_1 \pm k_2 = k_3$ and $\omega_1 \pm \omega_2 = \omega_3$ with $k_i$ and
$\omega_i$ being the wavenumber and frequency of the ith wave ($i \in
{1,2,3}$), respectively. The linear stability problem is solved analytically,
which gives the eigenfunctions in the form of the modified Bessel functions. It
is identified that an interaction between two primary modes having the same
frequency $\omega$ but different wavenumbers $k_m$ and $k_n$ produces two
different secondary modes: one time-dependent (superharmonic) mode having
frequency $2\omega$ and wavenumber $k_m +k_n$, and the other time-independent
(subharmonic) mode with $\omega = 0$ and wavenumber $k_m - k_n$. The
differential equation governing the spatial amplitude of the superharmonic mode
is solved numerically as well as analytically using the method of variation of
parameters. It turns out that the linear operator associated with the
differential equation of the superharmonic mode is the same as the linear
stability operator and that the solvability condition of the differential
equation is found to be associated with the existence of RTI. The existence of
resonant triad interactions predicted by the dispersion relation, are justified
by showing the divergence of the spatial amplitude of superharmonic mode.
Various cases of wave interactions in a stably stratified shear flow are
analysed in the presence of a resonant triad for various frequencies and linear
stratifications.

down of the charge carrier dynamics is well described by a model of

understanding such interactions is crucial for linking physical models of the
environments to observations. In this work, we use 3D special-relativistic
simulations to study how jets propagate through the environment created around
a neutron star merger remnant by neutrino-driven winds. We simulate four jets
with two different initial structures, top-hat and Gaussian, and two
luminosities. After jet breakout, we study the angular jet structures and the
resulting afterglow light curves. We find that the initial angular structures
are efficiently washed out during the propagation, despite the small wind mass
of only $\sim 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$. The final structure depends on the jet
luminosity as less energetic jets are more strongly collimated, and entrainment
of baryons leads to a moderate outflow Lorentz factor ($\approx 40$). Although
our jets are not specifically intended to model the outflows of the GW170817
event, we show that they can be used to produce light curves consistent with
the afterglow observed in the aftermath of GW170817. Using this procedure we
show how the inferred physical parameters e.g., inclination angle, ambient
particle number density, can vary substantially between independent fits of the
same dataset and appear to be sensitive to smaller details of the angular jet
shape, indicating that observationally inferred parameters may depend
sensitively on the employed jet models.

networks with a high potential for applications. In particular, after
adsorption at a fluid interface, interfacial tension provides two-dimensional
(2D) confinement for microgel monolayers and drives the reconfiguration of the
particles, enabling their deployment in foam and emulsion stabilization and in
surface patterning for lithography, sensing and optical materials. However,
most studies focus on systems of fluids with a high interfacial tension, e.g.
alkanes/ or air/water interfaces, which imparts similar properties to the
assembled monolayers. Here, instead, we compare two organic fluid phases,
hexane and methyl tert-butyl ether, which have markedly different interfacial
tension ($\gamma$) values with water and thus tune the elasticity and
deformation of adsorbed microgels. We rationalize how $\gamma$ controls the
single-particle morphology, which consequently modulates the structural and
mechanical response of the monolayers at varying interfacial compression.
Specifically, when $\gamma$ is low, the microgels are less deformed within the
interface plane and their polymer networks can rearrange more easily upon
lateral compression, leading to softer monolayers. Selecting interfaces with
different surface energy offers an additional control to customize the 2D
assembly of soft particles, from the fine-tuning of particle size and
interparticle spacing to the tailoring of mechanical properties.

sense the space plasma environment around planetary bodies and ultracool
dwarfs. Therefore successful searches and characterization of aurorae outside
the Solar System will open new avenues in the area of extrasolar space physics.
Aims: We aim to demonstrate that brown dwarfs are ideal objects to search for
UV aurora outside the Solar System. We specifically search for UV aurora on the
late-type T6.5 brown dwarf 2MASS J12373919+6526148 (in the following 2MASS
J1237+6526). Methods: Introducing a parameter referred to as auroral power
potential, we derive scaling models for auroral powers for rotationally driven
aurora applicable to a broad range of wavelengths. We also analyze Hubble Space
Telescope observations obtained with the STIS camera at near-UV, far-UV, and
Ly-$\alpha$ wavelengths of 2MASS J1237+6526. Results: We show that brown
dwarfs, due to their typically strong surface magnetic fields and fast
rotation, can produce auroral UV powers on the order of 10$^{19}$ watt or more.
Considering their negligible thermal UV emission, their potentially powerful
auroral emissions make brown dwarfs ideal candidates for detecting extrasolar
aurorae. We find possible emission from 2MASS J1237+6526, but cannot
conclusively attribute it to the brown dwarf due to low signal-to-noise values
in combination with nonsystematic trends in the background fluxes. The
observations provide upper limits for the emission at various UV wavelength
bands. The upper limits for the emission correspond to a UV luminosity of
$\sim$1 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ watt, which lies in the range of the theoretically
expected values. Conclusions: The possible auroral emission from the dwarf
could be produced by a close-in companion and/or magnetospheric transport
processes.

super-massive black hole wanders in a circum-nuclear region and passes through
an interstellar medium there. It is expected that a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton type
accretion of the interstellar matter takes place and an accretion stream of
matter trapped by the black hole gravitational field appears from a tail shock
region. Since the trapped matter is likely to have a certain amount of specific
angular momentum, the accretion stream eventually forms an accretion ring
around the black hole. According to the recent study, the accretion ring
consists of a thick envelope and a thin core, and angular momenta are
transfered from the inner side facing to the black hole to the opposite side
respectively in the envelope and the core. As a result, a thick accretion flow
and a thick excretion flow extend from the envelope, and a thin accretion disk
and a thin excretion disk do from the core. The thin excretion disk is
predicted to terminate at some distance forming an excretion ring, while the
thick excretion flow is considered to become a super-sonic wind flowing to the
infinity. The thick excretion flow from the accretion ring is expected to
interact with the accretion stream toward the accretion ring and to be
collimated to bi-polar cones. These pictures provide a likely guide line to
interpret the overall accretion environments suggested from observations.

identified by the Next Generation Transit Survey in the $\sim$115 Myr old
Blanco 1 open cluster. NGTS J0002-29 comprises three M dwarfs: a short-period
binary and a companion in a wider orbit. This system is the first
well-characterised, low-mass eclipsing binary in Blanco 1. With a low mass
ratio, a tertiary companion and binary components that straddle the fully
convective boundary, it is an important benchmark system, and one of only two
well-characterised, low-mass eclipsing binaries at this age. We simultaneously
model light curves from NGTS, TESS, SPECULOOS and SAAO, radial velocities from
VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES, and the system's spectral energy distribution. We find
that the binary components travel on circular orbits around their common centre
of mass in $P_{\rm orb} = 1.09800524 \pm 0.00000038$ days, and have masses
$M_{\rm pri}=0.3978\pm 0.0033$ M$_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm sec}=0.2245\pm 0.0018$

these properties to the predictions of seven stellar evolution models, which

a crucial to understanding the recent rise in power conversion effciencies

measuring exciton diffusion lengths in organic solar cells require specialized
equipment designed for measuring high-resolution time-resolved

measure the diffusion length of organic solar cells without any temporal
measurements. Using a Monte-Carlo model we simulate the dynamics within a thin
film semiconductor and analyse the results using both pulsed-PLQY and TRPL
methods. We find that pulsed-PLQY has a larger operational region and depends
less on the excitation fuence than the TRPL approach. We validate these
simulated results by preforming both measurements on organic thin films and
reproduce the predicted trends. Pulsed-PLQY is then used to evaluate the
diffusion length in a variety of technologically relevant organic
semiconductors. It is found that the diffusion lengths in NFA's are much larger
than in the benchmark fullerene and that this increase is driven by an increase
in diffusivity.

  coupled polymers","34 pages",,,,"cs.CE cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The last decade has witnessed the emergence of magneto-active polymers (MAPs)
as one of the most advanced multi-functional soft composites. Depending on the
magnetisation mechanisms and responsive behaviour, MAPs are mainly classified
into two groups: i) hard magnetic MAPs in which a large residual magnetic flux
density sustains even after the removal of the external magnetic field, and ii)
soft magnetic MAPs where the magnetisation of the filler particles disappear
upon the removal of the external magnetic field. Polymeric materials are widely
treated as fully incompressible solids that require special numerical treatment
to solve the associated boundary value problem. Furthermore, both soft and hard
magnetic particles-filled soft polymers are inherently viscoelastic. Therefore,
the aim of this paper is to devise a unified finite element method-based
numerical framework for magneto-mechanically coupled systems that can work for
compressible and fully incompressible materials and from hard to soft MAPs,
including the effects of the time-dependent viscoelastic behaviour of the
underlying matrix. First, variational formulations for the uncoupled problem
for hard MAPs and the coupled problem for soft MAPs are derived. The weak forms
are then discretised with higher-order B\'ezier elements while the evolution
equation for internal variables in viscoelastic models is solved using the
generalised-alpha time integration scheme, which is implicit and second-order
accurate. Finally, a series of experimentally-driven boundary value problems
consisting of the beam and robotic gripper models are solved in
magneto-mechanically coupled settings, demonstrating the versatility of the
proposed numerical framework. The effect of viscoelastic material parameters on
the response characteristics of MAPs under coupled magneto-mechanical loading
is also studied.

one of the vector-vector, axial-axial and vector-axial responses as sums of six
sub-responses. These corresponds to separating the meson-exchange currents as
the sum of three currents of similar structure, and expanding the hadronic
tensor, as the sum of the separate contributions from each current plus the
interferences between them. For each sub-response we factorize the coupling
constants, the electroweak form factors, the phase space and the delta
propagator, for the delta forward current. The remaining spin-isospin
contributions are encoded in coefficients for each value of the momentum
transfer, $q$. The coefficients are fitted to the exact results in the
relativistic mean field model of nuclear matter, for each value of $q$. The
dependence on the energy transfer, $\omega$ is well described by the
semi-empirical formula. The $q$-dependency of the coefficients of the
sub-responses can be parameterized or can be interpolated from the provided
tables. The description of the five theoretical responses is quite good. The
parameters of the formula, the Fermi momentum, number of particles relativistic
effective mass, vector energy the electroweak form factors and the coupling
constants, can be modified easily. This semi-empirical formula can be applied
to the cross-section of neutrinos, antineutrinos and electrons.

data-based models. Besides explaining the model itself, an equally relevant
question is which features are important in the underlying data generating
process. We present a Shapley value based framework for inferring the
importance of individual features, including uncertainty in the estimator. We
build upon the recently published feature importance measure of SAGE (Shapley
additive global importance) and introduce sub-SAGE which can be estimated
without resampling for tree-based models. We argue that the uncertainties can
be estimated from bootstrapping and demonstrate the approach for tree ensemble
methods. The framework is exemplified on synthetic data as well as
high-dimensional genomics data.

engineering applications. Planning time and energy optimal paths for these
vehicles to navigate in stochastic dynamic ocean environments is essential to
reduce operational costs. In some missions, they must also harvest solar, wind,
or wave energy (modeled as a stochastic scalar field) and move in optimal paths
that minimize net energy consumption. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide
a natural framework for sequential decision-making for robotic agents in such
environments. However, building a realistic model and solving the modeled MDP
becomes computationally expensive in large-scale real-time applications,
warranting the need for parallel algorithms and efficient implementation. In
the present work, we introduce an efficient end-to-end GPU-accelerated
algorithm that (i) builds the MDP model (computing transition probabilities and
expected one-step rewards); and (ii) solves the MDP to compute an optimal
policy. We develop methodical and algorithmic solutions to overcome the limited
global memory of GPUs by (i) using a dynamic reduced-order representation of
the ocean flows, (ii) leveraging the sparse nature of the state transition
probability matrix, (iii) introducing a neighbouring sub-grid concept and (iv)
proving that it is sufficient to use only the stochastic scalar field's mean to
compute the expected one-step rewards for missions involving energy harvesting
from the environment; thereby saving memory and reducing the computational
effort. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simulated stochastic dynamic
environment and highlight that it builds the MDP model and computes the optimal
policy 600-1000x faster than conventional CPU implementations, making it
suitable for real-time use.

rules of the road. RRT generates a set of way points and the velocity obstacles
method ensures safe travel between way points. We also ensure that the actions
of ASVs do not violate maritime collision guidelines. Earlier work has used RRT
and VO separately to generate paths for ASVs. However, RRT does not handle
highly dynamic situations well and and VO seems most suitable as a local path
planner. Combining both approaches, VORRT-COLREGs is a global path planner that
uses a joint forward simulation to ensure that generated paths remain valid and
collision free as the situation changes. Experiments were conducted in
different types of collision scenarios and with different numbers of ASVs.
Results show that VORRT-COLREGS generated collision regulations (COLREGs)
complaint paths in open ocean scenarios. Furthermore, VORRT-COLREGS
successfully generated compliant paths within traffic separation schemes. These
results show the applicability of our technique for generating paths for ASVs
in different collision scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that combines velocity obstacles and RRT to produce safe and COLREGs

magnon currents based on the realization of the bosonic Klein paradox in

appropriately tuning the effective dissipation through spin-orbit torques, both

the reflection coefficient of incident magnons at an interface between two

manner, among $n$ agents. The goods arrive online in a sequence of $T$ time
periods. The agents' values for a good are revealed only after its arrival, and
the online algorithm needs to fractionally allocate the good, immediately and
irrevocably, among the agents. Towards a unifying treatment of fairness and
economic efficiency objectives, we develop an algorithmic framework for finding
online allocations to maximize the generalized mean of the values received by
the agents. In particular, working with the assumption that each agent's value
for the grand bundle of goods is appropriately scaled, we address online
maximization of $p$-mean welfare. Parameterized by an exponent term $p \in
(-\infty, 1]$, these means encapsulate a range of welfare functions, including
social welfare ($p=1$), egalitarian welfare ($p \to -\infty$), and Nash social
welfare ($p \to 0$).
  We present a simple algorithmic template that takes a threshold as input and,
with judicious choices for this threshold, leads to both universal and tailored
competitive guarantees. First, we show that one can compute online a single
allocation that $O (\sqrt{n} \log n)$-approximates the optimal $p$-mean welfare
for all $p\le 1$. The existence of such a universal allocation is interesting
in and of itself. Moreover, this universal guarantee achieves essentially tight
competitive ratios for specific values of $p$.
  Next, we obtain improved competitive ratios for different ranges of $p$ by
executing our algorithm with $p$-specific thresholds, e.g., we provide $O(\log
^3 n)$-competitive ratio for all $p\in (\frac{-1}{\log 2n},1)$.
  We complement our positive results by establishing lower bounds to show that
our guarantees are essentially tight for a wide range of the exponent
parameter.

RIS with low-cost elements can bypass blockages and create multiple

this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review on the RIS-assisted
non-terrestrial networks (RANTNs). Firstly, the framework of the RANTNs is
introduced with detailed discussion about distinct properties of RIS in NTNs
and the two types of RIS, that is, terrestrial RISs (TRISs), and aerial RISs
(ARISs), and the classification of RANTNs including RIS-assisted air-to-ground

next-generation communication technologies, the advanced technologies in RANTNs
are discussed. Then we overview the literature related to RANTNs from the
perspectives of performance analysis and optimization, followed by the widely

relief medications are not yet fully understood. While recent studies developed
an index for nociception level of patients under general anesthesia, based on
multiple physiological parameters, it remains unclear whether and how dynamics
of these parameters indicate long-term post-operative pain (POP). To extract
unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how physiological parameters
dynamics change over time and across patients in response to surgical
procedures, we employed a multivariate-temporal analysis. We demonstrate the
main features of intra-operative physiological responses can be used to predict
long-term POP. We propose to use a complex higher-order SVD method to
accurately decompose the patients' physiological responses into multivariate
structures evolving in time. We used intra-operative vital signs of 175
patients from a mixed surgical cohort to extract three interconnected,
low-dimensional complex-valued descriptions of patients' physiological
responses: multivariate factors, reflecting sub-physiological parameters;
temporal factors reflecting common intra-surgery temporal dynamics; and
patients factors, describing patient to patient changes in physiological
responses. Adoption of complex-HOSVD allowed us to clarify the dynamic
correlation structure included in intra-operative physiological responses.
Instantaneous phases of the complex-valued physiological responses within the
subspace of principal descriptors enabled us to discriminate between mild
versus severe levels of long-term POP. By abstracting patients into different
surgical groups, we identified significant surgery-related principal
descriptors: each of them potentially encodes different surgical stimulation.
The dynamics of patients' physiological responses to these surgical events are
linked to long-term post-operative pain development.

interband tunneling is critically dependent on junction directions because of
the anisotropic pseudospin structure of BP. When the armchair direction of BP
is normal to the interface, pseudospins of incident and transmitted carriers
are nearly aligned so that interband tunneling is highly effective, analogous
to the Klein tunneling in graphene. However, when the zigzag direction is
normal to the interface, interband tunneling is suppressed by misaligned
pseudospins. We also study junctions of band-gap inverted BP where the
electronic structure is characterized by two Dirac cones. In this case,
intervalley tunneling is prohibited either by momentum conservation or by
pseudospin mismatch while intravalley tunneling is Klein-like irrespective of
the junction direction. These results provide a foundation for developing
high-performance devices from BP and other pseudospin materials.

concentrated in a set of urban areas and establish a recreational hierarchy. In
this hierarchy, higher-level regions attract more people than lower-level

likely to visit familiar recreational places, avoid the highest level of the
recreational hierarchy, and travel close distances. Interestingly, the
recreational visitations were reduced not only in the highest but also in
low-level regions. Urban areas at low levels of the recreational hierarchy were
more severely affected by COVID-19 than urban areas at high and middle levels

For cross entropy, we show that a faster rate of change of the activation

improve the calibration of probabilities. For dice loss, we found that the

Furthermore, we provide a test space for arbitrary output activation functions

effective operator $F$ between bi-topological spaces $\TTT = (T, \tau, \sigma)$
and $\TTT' = (T', \tau', \sigma')$ is (effectively) continuous, if $\tau'$ is
(effectively) regular with respect to $\sigma'$. A central requirement on
$\TTT'$ is that bases of the neighbourhood filters of the points in $T'$ can
computably be enumerated in a uniform way, not only with respect to topology
$\tau'$, but also with respect to $\sigma'$. As follows from an example by
Friedberg, the last condition is indispensable. Conversely, it is proved that
(effectively) bi-continuous operators are effective. A prominent example of
bi-topological spaces are quasi-metric spaces. Under a very reasonable
computability requirement on the quasi-metric it is shown that all effectivity
assumptions made in the general results are satisfied in the quasi-metric case.

analyze the resulting representation space using the mathematical problem known
as Circle Packing, which provides neighbourhood structures with a theoretical
maximum inter-class distance. We finally prove experimentally the effectiveness

that a field-theoretic formulation of the stochastic density functional theory

method of the stochastic density functional theory is developed to obtain the
metastable chemical potential considering intermittent fluctuations in dense

metastable DCF that has a short-range cutoff inside the sphere while retaining
the long-range power-law behavior. It is confirmed that the metastable DCF
provides zero-wavevector limit of structure factor in quantitative agreement
with the previous simulation results of degraded hyperuniformity. We can also
predict the emergence of soft modes localized at the particle scale from
plugging this metastable DCF into the linearized Dean-Kawasaki equation, a

use realistic stellar conditions. This tactic is to artificially increase the
luminosity and to modify the thermal diffusivity of the reference stellar
model. This work focuses on the impact of these modifications on convective
penetration (or overshooting) at the base of the convective envelope of a
solar-like model. We explore a range of enhancement factors for the energy
input and confirm the increase in the characteristic overshooting depth with
the increase in the energy input. Our results highlight the importance of the
impact of penetrative downflows on the thermal background below the convective
boundary. This is a result of compression and shear which induce local heating
and thermal mixing. The artificial increase in the energy flux intensifies the
heating process by increasing the velocities in the convective zone and at the
convective boundary, revealing a subtle connection between the local heating of
the thermal background and the plume dynamics. This heating also increases the
efficiency of heat transport by radiation which may counterbalance further
heating and helps to establish a steady state. The modification of the thermal
background by penetrative plumes impacts the width of the overshooting layer.
Our results suggest that an artificial modification of the radiative
diffusivity in the overshooting layer, rather than only accelerating the
thermal relaxation, could also alter the dynamics of the penetrating plumes and
thus the width of the overshooting layer. Results from simulations with an
artificial modification of the energy flux and of the thermal diffusivity
should be regarded with caution if used to determine an overshooting width.

for which the main physical parameters such as area, mass, distance, velocity
dispersion, and virial parameter were derived. These structures are overall
less extended and less massive than the molecular clouds identified in the
$^{12}$CO(1-0) data-set because they trace the brightest and densest part of
the $^{12}$CO(1-0) clouds. Conversely, the distribution of aspect ratio,
equivalent spherical radius, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter in the
two catalogues are similar. The mean value of the mass surface density of
molecular clouds is 87$\pm$55 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ and is almost constant
across the galactocentric radius, indicating that this parameter, which is a
proxy of star formation, is mostly affected by local conditions.In data of the
Forgotten Quadrant Survey, we find a good agreement between the total mass and
velocity dispersion of the clouds derived from $^{12}$CO(1-0) and
$^{13}$CO(1-0). This is likely because in the surveyed portion of the Galactic
plane, the H$_2$ column density is not particularly high, leading to a CO
emission with a not very high optical depth. This mitigates the effects of the
different line opacities between the two tracers on the derived physical
parameters. This is a common feature in the outer Galaxy, but our result cannot
be readily generalised to the entire Milky Way.

literature. This kind of process generates a very peculiar data structure, in
which successive measurements of many process variables in each batch run are

nature of the data. The main reason is that the time series inference theory is
not based on replications of time series, as it is in batch process data. It is
based on the variability in a time domain. This fact demands some adaptations
of this theory in order to accommodate the model coefficient estimates,
considering jointly the batch to batch samples variability (batch domain) and
the serial correlation in each batch (time domain). In order to address this
issue, this paper proposes a new approach grounded in a group of control charts
based on the classical ARMA model for monitoring and diagnostic of batch
processes dynamics. The model coefficients are estimated (through the ordinary
least square method) for each historical time series sample batch and modified
Hotelling and t-Student distributions are derived and used to accommodate those
estimates. A group of control charts based on that distributions are proposed
for monitoring the new batches. Additionally, those groups of charts help to
fault diagnosis, identifying the source of disturbances. Through simulated and

mechanisms. The essence of the first one is the generation of triplets by the
superconducting spin Hall effect. These pairs are long-range in the ferromagnet
under the appropriate mutual orientation of the condensate momentum and the
ferromagnet magnetization. The second mechanism is based on the singlet-triplet
conversion at the S/F interface followed by the rotation of the spin of the
obtained short-range opposite-spin pairs via the spin current swapping
mechanism. The structure of the supercurrent-induced LRTC is studied both for

to estimate the rate of viral transfer between individuals, objects, and the

considering the behaviour and interactions of individuals between themselves

The results show the importance of considering all transmission pathways and

Multiple Access (TDMA), OFDMA concentrates the transmit power to a narrower
bandwidth, resulting in higher effective SNR. Compared with Frequency-Division
Multiple Access (FDMA), OFDMA has higher spectrum efficiency thanks to the
smaller subcarrier spacing. Although OFDMA has been introduced in 802.11ax, the
purpose was to add flexibility in spectrum usage. Our Reliable OFDMA design,
referred to as ROFA, is a clean-slate design with a single goal of
ultra-reliable packet delivery. ROFA solves a number of key challenges to
ensure the ultra-reliability: (1) a downlink-coordinated time-synchronization
mechanism to synchronize the uplink transmission of users, with at most $0.1us$
timing offset; (2) an ""STF-free"" packet reception synchronization method that
makes use of the property of synchronous systems to avoid packet misdetection;
and (3) an uplink precoding mechanism to reduce the CFOs between users and the
AP to a negligible level. We implemented ROFA on the Universal Software Radio
Peripheral (USRP) SDR platform with real-time signal processing. Extensive
experimental results show that ROFA can achieve ultra-reliable packet delivery
($PER<10^5$) with $11.5dB$ less transmit power compared with OFDM-TDMA when

oxides, where the development of the spontaneous electric polarization is
accompanied by significant strains and lattice softening. Thus, in this work we
study the mechanocaloric properties of model ferroelectric PbTiO$_{3}$, by
means of predictive atomistic (""second-principles"") simulations and a
perturbative formalism here introduced. Our calculations reveal relatively
large effects (up to $-$4 K for relatively small applied compressions of $-$0.1

can be either conventional (temperature increases upon compression) or inverse

pair of narrow filters with offset passing frequencies, have emerged as a
promising candidate for high power, ultrabroad bandwidth pulse generation. To
date, only stable mode-locking states in MOs have been reported. Here, we
present a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation of pulsating
DSs in an ytterbium MO. By reducing the filter separation down to 4 nm, we
observe pulsation in a single pulse state as well as a soliton molecule state.
In the single pulse state, the output pulse energy can vary as large as 40
times in our MO. Single-shot spectra measured by the dispersive Fourier
transform (DFT) method reveal the spectral bandwidth breathing during pulsation
and enables the observation of soliton explosion in a pulsation state. In
addition, pulsation with a period lasting 9 round trips and even a chaotic
pulsation state are also observed. Numerical simulations based on a lumped

administration, social distancing measures, including severe restrictions such
as lockdowns, remain fundamental tools to contain the spread of COVID-19. A
crucial point for any government is to understand, on the basis of the epidemic
curve, the right temporal instant to set up a lockdown and then to remove it.
Different strategies are being adopted with distinct shades of intensity. USA
and Europe tend to introduce restrictions of considerable temporal length. They
vary in time: a severe lockdown may be reached and then gradually relaxed. An
interesting alternative is the Australian model where short and sharp responses
have repeatedly tackled the virus and allowed people a return to near normalcy.
After a few positive cases are detected, a lockdown is immediately set. In this
paper we show that the Australian model can be generalized and given a rigorous
mathematical analysis, casting strategies of the type short-term pain for
collective gain in the context of sliding-mode control, an important branch of
nonlinear control theory. This allows us to gain important insights regarding
how to implement short-term lockdowns, obtaining a better understanding of
their merits and possible limitations. Our model predicts the duration of the
severe lockdown to be set to maintain e.g. the number of people in intensive
care under a certain threshold. After tuning our strategy exploiting data
collected in Italy, it turns out that COVID-19 epidemic could be e.g.
controlled by alternating one or two weeks of complete lockdown with one or two
months of freedom, respectively. Control strategies of this kind, where the
lockdown's duration is well circumscribed, could be important also to alleviate
coronavirus impact on economy.

HCE-BNN can handle the forward and inverse problems consistently, that is, to
infer unknown responses from known partial responses, or to identify boundary

rules to extract API parameter constraints from syntactic patterns in the form
of dependency parse trees of API descriptions. These rules are then applied to
a large volume of API documents in popular DL libraries to extract their input
parameter constraints. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted
constraints, DocTer uses the constraints to enable the automatic generation of
valid and invalid inputs to test DL API functions.
  Our evaluation on three popular DL libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet)
shows that the precision of DocTer in extracting input constraints is 85.4%.
DocTer detects 94 bugs from 174 API functions, including one previously unknown

studies of radioactive waste and in homeland security applications. The crisis
of 3He availability has required the development of innovative techniques. One
solution is to develop light gas detectors for neutron counting to be used as
portals for ports and airports. The neutron is converted on the Boron-coated
cathode, releasing a charged particle, whose passage can be identified by the
gas detector. While several technologies have been deployed in the past, the
project {\mu}RANIA-V ( {\mu}Rwell Advanced Neutron Identification Apparatus)
aims to detect thermal neutrons by means of the {\mu}Rwell technology, an
innovative gas detector. The goal is to produce tiles to operate as portals in
homeland security or for radioactive waste management. The technological
transfer towards the industry has started, thus the production can be
cost-effective also owing to a construction process relatively easier compared
to similar apparatus. By reading directly the signals from the amplification
stage, the neutrons can be counted with simplified electronics further reducing
the total cost. In this paper, the project will be described, with details on
the {\mu}Rwell technology and on the neutron counting, on the test beam

direction, speed, and internal state of the agent. We refer to this Markov
chain as the Navigation Control System (NCS). Furthermore, we model that agents
sense the environment by considering that the transition rates of the NCS
depend on local (scalar) measurement of the environment such as e.g. chemical
concentrations, light intensity, or temperature. Here, we investigate under
which conditions the (asymptotic) behavior of the agents can be reduced to an
effective convection-diffusion equation for the density of the agents,
providing effective expressions for the drift and diffusion terms. We apply the
developed generic framework to a series of specific examples to show that in
order to obtain a drift term two conditions should be fulfilled: i) the NCS
transition rates should depend on the agent's position, and ii) transition
rates should be asymmetric. In addition, we indicate that the sign of the drift
term - i.e. whether agents develop a positive or negative chemotactic response
- can be changed by modifying the asymmetry of the NCS or by swapping the speed
associated to the internal states. The developed theoretical framework paves
the way to model a large variety of biological systems and provides a solid
proof that chemotactic responses can be developed, counterintuitively, by

where dark matter condenses and forms a superfluid on galactic scales. In the
superfluid state phonons interact with baryons, resulting in a behavior similar
to that of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). If one assumes that the DM
condensate rotates along with the galaxy, a grid of vortices should form
throughout the superfluid component if the rotation is fast enough. We aim to
investigate the size and impact of the vortices on surrounding baryons, and to
further investigate the parameter space of the model. We also look for a
possible vortex solution of the Lagrangian presented for the SFDM theory. We
first take a simple approach and investigate vortex properties in a constant
density DM halo, applying knowledge from condensed matter physics. We then use
the zero-temperature condensate density profile as a template to vary the DM
particle mass and the energy scale, $\Lambda$, of the SFDM model. Further, we
attempt to find a vortex solution of the theory by extracting the
Euler-Lagrange equation with respect to the modulus of the condensate
wavefunction from the full relativistic SFDM Lagrangian. For the constant
density approach we find that the vortices are on millimeter scale, and
separated by distances $\sim0.002\,\rm{AU}$. The parameter space of the model
is found to be substantial and a reduction in the DM particle mass leads to
larger vortices with a higher energy. However, none of the parameter
combinations explored here give both realistic values of $\Lambda$ and vortices
energetic enough to have an observational impact on the galaxy as a whole. The

constraints are based on the CDCL architecture which empowers highly efficient
modern SAT solvers. In particular, such PB solvers not only implement a

strategies for components that are crucial for the efficiency of CDCL, namely
branching heuristics, learned constraint deletion and restarts. However, these
strategies are mostly reused by PB solvers without considering the particular
form of the PB constraints they deal with. In this paper, we present and
evaluate different ways of adapting CDCL strategies to take the specificities
of PB constraints into account while preserving the behavior they have in the
clausal setting. We implemented these strategies in two different solvers,
namely Sat4j (for which we consider three configurations) and RoundingSat. Our

significantly, the performance of these solvers, both on decision and

Daytime Sextantids, respectively), have similar visible-wavelength reflectance
spectra and orbits, dynamical investigations have failed to find any likely
method to link the two objects in the recent past. Here we present the first
near-infrared reflectance spectrum of 2005 UD, which shows it to be
consistently linear and red-sloped unlike Phaethon's very blue and concave
spectrum. Searching for a process that could alter some common starting
material to both of these end states, we hypothesized that the two objects had
been heated to different extents, motivated by their near-Sun orbits, the
composition of Geminid meteoroids, and previous models of Phaethon's surface.
We thus set about building a new laboratory apparatus to acquire reflectance
spectra of meteoritic samples after heating to higher temperatures than
available in the literature to test this hypothesis and were loaned a sample of
the CI Chondrite Orgueil from the Vatican Meteorite Collection for testing. We
find that while Phaethon's spectrum shares many similarities with different CI
Chondrites, 2005 UD's does not. We thus conclude that the most likely
relationship between the two objects is that their similar properties are only
by coincidence as opposed to a parent-fragment scenario, though the ultimate
test will be when JAXA's DESTINY+ mission visits one or both objects later this

variants of self-consistency associated with famous Hedin's system of
equations: the full self-consistency and the so called quasi-particle
approximation to it. The pros and cons of these two variants of
self-consistency are sufficiently well documented in literature for the
simplest GW approximation to the Hedin's equations. Our study, therefore, aims
primarily at the level of theory beyond GW approximation, i.e. at the level of
theory which includes vertex corrections. Whereas quasi-particle
self-consistency has certain advantages at GW level (well known fact), the
situation becomes quite different when vertex corrections are included. In the
variant with full self-consistency, vertex corrections (both for polarizability
and for self energy) systematically reduce the calculated band gaps making them
closer to the experimental values. In the variant with quasi-particle
self-consistency, however, an inclusion of the same diagrams has considerably
larger effect and calculated band gaps become severely underestimated.
Different effect of vertex corrections in two variants of self-consistency can
be related to the Z-factor cancellation which plays positive role in
quasi-particle self-consistency at GW level of theory but appears to be
destructive for the quasi-particle approximation when higher order diagrams are
included. Second result of our study is that we were able to reproduce the
results obtained with the Questaal code using our FlapwMBPT code when the same
variant of self-consistency (quasi-particle) and the same level of vertex
corrections (for polarizability only, static approximation for screened
interaction, and Tamm-Dancoff approximation for the Bethe-Salpeter equation)

inclination angle of the system is so high that in principle, it should be hard
to observe both the direct thermal emission of the central object and the
reflection component of the spectrum because they are hidden by the outer edge
of the accretion disc. Assuming that the source accretes at the Eddington
limit, we analysed non-simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and
studied the average broadband spectrum, with the aim to investigate the
presence of a reflection component. No such component has been observed before
in a high-inclination source such as 4U 1822-371. We modelled the spectral
emission of the source using two different reflection models, Diskline plus
Pexriv and the self-consistent model RfxConv. In our analysis, we find
significant evidence of a reflection component in the spectrum, in addition to
two lines associated with neutral or mildly ionised iron. The continuum
spectrum is well fitted by a saturated Comptonisation model and a thermal
black-body component emitted by the accretion disc at a lower temperature. We
updated the ephemeris, adding two new eclipse times to the most recent
ephemeris reported in literature. In our proposed scenario, the source is
accreting at the Eddington limit with an intrinsic luminosity of $10^{38}$
erg/s, while the observed luminosity is two orders of magnitude lower. Despite
the high inclination, we find that a reflection component is required to fit
residuals at the Fe line range and the hard excess observed in the spectrum.
The best-fit value of the inner disc radius is still uncertain and model
dependent. More observations are therefore needed to confirm these results,
which can give important information on this enigmatic and peculiar source.

rate. Our observations of the TAE behaviour and the corresponding phase-space
dynamics are consistent with the Berk-Breizman (BB) theory.

  resolution using laser speckle","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.optics physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Highly-resolved determination of refractive index is vital in fields ranging
from biosensing through to laser range-finding. Laser speckle is known to be a
sensitive probe of the properties of the light and the environment, but to date
speckle-based refractive index measurements have been restricted to $10^{-6}$
resolution. In this work we identify a strategy to optimise the sensitivity of
speckle to refractive index changes, namely by maximising the width of the
distribution of optical path lengths in the medium. We show that this can be
realised experimentally by encapsulating the medium of interest within an
integrating sphere. We demonstrate that variations of the refractive index of
air as small as $4.5\times10^{-9}$ can be resolved with an uncertainty of
$7\times10^{-10}$. This is an improvement of three orders of magnitude when
compared to previous speckle-based methods.

study the class of beta-star polytopes. A beta-star polytope is defined as the
convex hull of an inhomogeneous Poisson processes on the complement of the unit
ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with density proportional to $(||x||^2-1)^\beta$, where
$||x|| > 1$ and $\beta>d/2$. Explicit formulas for various geometric and
combinatorial functionals associated with beta-star polytopes are provided,
including the expected number of $k$-dimensional faces, the expected external
angle sums and the expected intrinsic volumes. Beta-star polytopes are relevant
in the context of hyperbolic stochastic geometry, since they are tightly
connected to the typical cell of a Poisson-Voronoi tessellation as well as the
zero cell of a Poisson hyperplane tessellation in hyperbolic space. The general
results for beta-star polytopes are used to provide explicit formulas for the
expected $f$- vector of the typical hyperbolic Poisson-Voronoi cell and the
hyperbolic Poisson zero cell. Their asymptotics for large intensities and their
monotonicity behaviour is discussed as well. Finally, stochastic geometry in
the de Sitter half-space is studied as the hyperbolic analogue to recent
investigations about random cones generated by random points on half-spheres in
spherical or conical stochastic geometry.

series classification, with many recent approaches including SAX-VSM, BOSS,
WEASEL, and MrSEQL. The key idea is to transform numerical time series to
symbolic representations in the time or frequency domain, i.e., sequences of
symbols, and then extract features from these sequences. While achieving high
accuracy, existing symbolic classifiers are computationally expensive. In this
paper we present MrSQM, a new time series classifier which uses multiple
symbolic representations and efficient sequence mining, to extract important
time series features. We study four feature selection approaches on symbolic
sequences, ranging from fully supervised, to unsupervised and hybrids. We
propose a new approach for optimal supervised symbolic feature selection in
all-subsequence space, by adapting a Chi-squared bound developed for
discriminative pattern mining, to time series. Our extensive experiments on 112
datasets of the UEA/UCR benchmark demonstrate that MrSQM can quickly extract
useful features and learn accurate classifiers with the classic logistic
regression algorithm. Interestingly, we find that a very simple and fast
feature selection strategy can be highly effective as compared with more
sophisticated and expensive methods. MrSQM advances the state-of-the-art for
symbolic time series classifiers and it is an effective method to achieve high
accuracy, with fast runtime.

  COVID-19",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Personal protective clothing is critical to shield users from highly
infectious diseases including COVID-19. Such clothing is predominantly
single-use, made of plastic-based synthetic fibres such as polypropylene and
polyester, low cost and able to provide protection against pathogens. However,
the environmental impacts of synthetic fibre-based clothing are significant and
well-documented. Despite growing environmental concerns with single-use
plastic-based protective clothing, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has seen a
significant increase in their use, that could result in a further surge of
oceanic plastic pollution, adding to mass of plastic waste that already
threatens marine life. In this review, we briefly discuss the nature of the raw
materials involved in the production of such clothing, as well as manufacturing
techniques and the PPE supply chain. We identify the environmental impacts at
critical points in the protective clothing value chain from production to
consumption, focusing on water use, chemical pollution, CO2 emissions and
waste. On the basis of these environmental impacts, we outline the need for
fundamental changes in the business model, including increased usage of
reusable protective clothing, addressing supply chain bottlenecks, establishing
better waste management, and the use of sustainable materials and processes
without associated environmental problems.

governing the network dynamics in order to better behave in a specific
situation. In the field of supervised learning, two complementary approaches
stand out: error-based and target-based learning. However, there exists no
consensus on which is better suited for which task, and what is the most
biologically plausible. Here we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework
that includes these two frameworks as special cases. This novel theoretical
formulation offers major insights into the differences between the two
approaches. In particular, we show how target-based naturally emerges from
error-based when the number of constraints on the target dynamics, and as a
consequence on the internal network dynamics, is comparable to the degrees of
freedom of the network. Moreover, given the experimental evidences on the
relevance that spikes have in biological networks, we investigate the role of
coding with specific patterns of spikes by introducing a parameter that defines
the tolerance to precise spike timing during learning. Our approach naturally
lends itself to Imitation Learning (and Behavioral Cloning in particular) and
we apply it to solve relevant closed-loop tasks such as the button-and-food
task, and the 2D Bipedal Walker. We show that a high dimensionality feedback
structure is extremely important when it is necessary to solve a task that
requires retaining memory for a long time (button-and-food). On the other hand,
we find that coding with specific patterns of spikes enables optimal
performances in a motor task (the 2D Bipedal Walker). Finally, we show that our
theoretical formulation suggests protocols to deduce the structure of learning
feedback in biological networks.

interferometric images, towards SVS13-A, a Class I object associated with a hot
corino rich in interstellar complex organic molecules. Methods: We used data at
3mm and 1.4mm obtained with IRAM-NOEMA in the framework of the Large Program
SOLIS. Results: We imaged the spatial distribution of the line emission of
32SO, 34SO, C32}S, C34S, C33S, OCS, H2C32S, H2C34S, and NS. The low excitation
(9 K) 32SO line is tracing the fast collimated jet driven by the nearby
SVS13-B. Conversely, the rest of the lines are confined in the inner SVS13-A
region, where complex organics have been previously imaged. The non-LTE LVG
analysis of SO, SO2, and H2CS indicates a hot corino origin (60-120 au).
Temperatures between 50 K and 300 K, and volume densities larger than 10^5 cm-3
have been derived. The abundances are in the following ranges: 0.3-6 10^-6
(CS), 7 10^-9} - 1 10^-7 (SO), 1-10 10^-7 (SO2), a few 10^-10 (H2CS and OCS),
and 10^{-10} - 10^{-9}(NS). The N(NS)/N(NS^+) ratio is larger than 10,
supporting that the NS^+ ion is mainly formed in the extended envelope.
Conclusions: The [H2CS]/[H2CO] ratio increases with time (from Class 0 to Class
II objects) by more than one order of magnitude. This suggests that [S]/[O]
changes along the Sun-like star forming process. The estimate of the [S]/[H]
budget in SVS13-A is 2%-17% of the Solar System value (1.8 10^-5), being
consistent with what was previously measured towards Class 0 objects (1%-8%).
This supports that the enrichment of the sulphuretted species with respect to
dark clouds keeps constant from the Class 0 to the Class I stages of low-mass
star formation. The present findings stress the importance of investigating the
chemistry of star forming regions using large observational surveys as well as
sampling regions on a Solar System scale.

Operating on edge streams allows us to avoid storing the entire graph in

Our scalable algorithms compute descriptors of graphs with millions of edges

important, because first it appears directly in the Euler equation which one

abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid
dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid
nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,
such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized
into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two
fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial
view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can
partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in
accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same
task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to
be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering
this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning
framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most
scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely
hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two
kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise
normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge
on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT
information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are
conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by
the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In
addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of
representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction
procedure.

challenges for boosting the recommendation performance. To alleviate this

within the causal inference framework, which enables us to counterfactually
simulate user ranking-based preferences to handle the data scarce problem. The
core of our model lies in the counterfactual question: ""what would be the
user's decision if the recommended items had been different?"". To answer this
question, we firstly formulate the recommendation process with a series of
structural equation models (SEMs), whose parameters are optimized based on the
observed data. Then, we actively indicate many recommendation lists (called
intervention in the causal inference terminology) which are not recorded in the

generating new training samples. Instead of randomly intervening on the
recommendation list, we design a learning-based method to discover more
informative training samples. Considering that the learned SEMs can be not
perfect, we, at last, theoretically analyze the relation between the number of
generated samples and the model prediction error, based on which a heuristic
method is designed to control the negative effect brought by the prediction
error. Extensive experiments are conducted based on both synthetic and

general, there are two approaches to obtain regionalized time series: top-down

assign regionalized feed-in of renewable energy sources and electrical load to

first for the case when multiple vaccines with differing efficacies and costs
are available for the same disease. Vaccine transportation and administration
lead times are also incorporated within the models. We also develop robust
optimization versions of the single vaccine model to account for the impact of
uncertainty in model parameters on the optimal vaccine distribution solution.
We use the case of the Indian state of Bihar and COVID-19 vaccines to
illustrate the implementation of the framework. We present computational
experiments to demonstrate: (a) the organization of the model outputs; (b) how
the models can be used to assess the impact of cold chain point storage

the optimal vaccine distribution pattern; and (c) the impact of vaccine
efficacies and associated costs such as ordering and transportation costs on
the vaccine selection decision informed by the model. We then consider the
computational expense of the framework for realistic problem instances, and
suggest multiple preprocessing techniques to reduce their computational burden.
Finally, we also demonstrate how the robust versions of the single vaccine

This not only offers a better understanding of language models but uses human
capabilities to incorporate knowledge outside of the rigid range of purely
data-driven approaches.

providing room for countless and diverse smart applications. This paper
proposes one such IoT enabled stand-alone device with numerous capabilities:
(i) interaction with user, (ii) required application selection, (iii) data
sensing, (iv) data publish, and (v) decision making and actuation. The
algorithm allows user to pick an application and input specific data for
calibration, which on completion enables the device for further working. To
verify and test its capability, a smart home garden environment is created
using this device, temperature, humidity, soil moisture sensors and actuators.
As it is implicit that real-time communication is inevitable for an IoT
application, the sensor data is published to a Mosquitto MQTT broker to permit
real-time remote access. The decision taken by the device is sent to actuators
via relay, thus a continuous monitoring process is achieved. Results are
obtained for the application which proves the device suitability for IoT
applications.
