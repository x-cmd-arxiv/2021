  Complementarity Constraints",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contact adaption is an essential capability when manipulating objects. Two
key contact modes of non-prehensile manipulation are sticking and sliding. This
paper presents a Trajectory Optimization (TO) method formulated as a
Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC), which is able to
switch between these two modes. We show that this formulation can be applicable
to both planning and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for planar manipulation
tasks. We numerically compare: (i) our planner against a mixed integer
alternative, showing that the MPCC planer converges faster, scales better with
respect to time horizon, and can handle environments with obstacles; (ii) our
controller against a state-of-the-art mixed integer approach, showing that the
MPCC controller achieves better tracking and more consistent computation times.
Additionally, we experimentally validate both our planner and controller with
the KUKA LWR robot on a range of planar manipulation tasks.

allocation for vision-based autonomous navigation using known landmarks. Unlike
the existing paradigm in which landmark selection is formulated as a
combinatorial optimization problem, we model it as a resource allocation
problem where the decision-maker (DM) is granted extra freedom to control the
degree of attention to each landmark. The total resource available to DM is
expressed in terms of the capacity limit of the in-take information flow, which
is quantified by the directed information from the state of the environment to
the DM's observation. We consider a receding horizon implementation of such a
controlled sensing scheme in the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) regime. The
convex-concave procedure is applied in each time step, whose time complexity is
shown to be linear in the horizon length if the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) is used. Numerical studies show that the proposed
formulation is sparsity-promoting in the sense that it tends to allocate zero
data rate to uninformative landmarks.

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is leveraged to overcome the
frequency-selective fading of the wideband multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems with one multi-antenna DFRC base station (BS) and multiple
single-antenna user equipment (UEs). In order to restrain the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM signals, we aim to jointly design
low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveforms. This is done by utilizing a weighted
objective function on both communication and radar performance metrics under
power and PAPR constraints. The formulated optimization problems can be
equivalently transformed into standard semi-definite programming (SDP) and can
be effectively solved by semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method, where we prove
that globally optimal rank-1 solution can be obtained in general. We further
develop a low-complexity method to solve the problems with much reduced
overheads. Moreover, the practical scenario with oversampling on OFDM signals
is further considered, which has a significant effect on the resulting PAPR
levels. The feasibility, effectiveness, and flexibility of the proposed low-
PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform design methods are demonstrated by a range of
simulations on communication sum rate, symbol error rate as well as radar
beampattern and detection probability.

the understanding of the chemostat dynamics and its connection with the actual

nutrients, the inference can be done with {\it limited information about the
culture}: the dilution rate of the chemostat, the concentration in the feed
media of the limiting nutrient and the cell concentration at steady state.
Also, we remark that our technique provides information, not only about the
mean values of the fluxes in the culture, but also its heterogeneity. We first
present these results studying a computational model of a chemostat. Having
control of this model we can test precisely the quality of the inference, and
also unveil the mechanisms behind the success of our approach. Then, we apply
our method to E. coli experimental data from the literature and show that it

through the ratios of vacuum expectation values (VEV) acquired at different

as well as of the mass hierarchies of the Standard Model (SM). The mixings, in
new, flavour non-universal, gauge interactions, as well as in the Yukawa

this three-site model context, the inverse seesaw mechanism is realised, with
the minimal addition of three fermion singlets $S_L^{(i)}$ and where $U(1)_F$
fermion number is broken dynamically via new singlet scalars $\Phi_i$, yielding
an anarchic light neutrino mass matrix in consistency with data, despite the
$U(2)^5$ flavour symmetry observed in the Yukawa matrices. A prediction of this
model is Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) unitarity violation with a $33$

compute the variation of the bispectra under the most general spatial gauge
transformation that is globally defined and privileges no point, direction or

classic $\zeta$-gauge consistency relations, which we also derive through the
`large diffeomorphism' approach for all four bispectra. At leading order in the
long wave-number the transformation only affects the case where the long mode
is a scalar. The first effect is a shift of the tilt factor, so that one can
significantly reduce the amplitude of that contribution. Secondly, there is now
an extra term depending on the triangle shape, the same as in solid inflation,
which is due to the fact that the 3-metric has a scalar anisotropy in generic
spatial gauge. At next-to-leading order there is no variation, so the conformal
consistency relations of the $\zeta$-gauge are preserved.

domain is called the ""virtual"" fluid, and it contains a vortex sheet whose
dynamics is equivalent to the equations of motion posed at the free surface.
The equations of fluid motion are analytically continued to both sides of the
vertical branch cut (the vortex sheet), and additional time-invariants

This result can be generalized to a system of many cuts connecting many branch

We develop an asymptotic theory that shows how a solution originating from a

model to obtain the full-faced mechanical behaviors through integrating
mechanical properties into pure data-driven model. The spatial tunnel structure
is divided into many parts and reconstructed in a form of matrix. Then, the
external load applied on structure in the field was considered to study the
mechanical behaviors of tunnel. Based on the limited observed monitoring data
in matrix and mechanical analysis results, a double-driven model was developed
to obtain the full-faced information, in which the data-driven model was the
dominant one and the mechanical constraint was the secondary one. To verify the
presented spatial deduction model, cross-test was conducted through assuming
partial monitoring data are unknown and regarding them as testing points. The
well agreement between deduction results with actual monitoring results means
the proposed model is reasonable. Therefore, it was employed to deduct both the

  revision",,"10.1109/TSE.2022.3184842",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Continuous Integration (CI) requires efficient regression testing to ensure
software quality without significantly delaying its CI builds. This warrants
the need for techniques to reduce regression testing time, such as Test Case
Prioritization (TCP) techniques that prioritize the execution of test cases to
detect faults as early as possible. Many recent TCP studies employ various
Machine Learning (ML) techniques to deal with the dynamic and complex nature of
CI. However, most of them use a limited number of features for training ML
models and evaluate the models on subjects for which the application of TCP
makes little practical sense, due to their small regression testing time and
low number of failed builds.
  In this work, we first define, at a conceptual level, a data model that
captures data sources and their relations in a typical CI environment. Second,
based on this data model, we define a comprehensive set of features that covers
all features previously used by related studies. Third, we develop methods and
tools to collect the defined features for 25 open-source software systems with
enough failed builds and whose regression testing takes at least five minutes.
Fourth, relying on the collected dataset containing a comprehensive feature
set, we answer four research questions concerning data collection time, the
effectiveness of ML-based TCP, the impact of the features on effectiveness, the
decay of ML-based TCP models over time, and the trade-off between data
collection time and the effectiveness of ML-based TCP techniques.

  harvesting and stocking","41 pages, 12 figures",,,,"math.PR math.OC q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We analyze the harvesting and stocking of a population that is affected by
random and seasonal environmental fluctuations. The main novelty comes from
having three layers of environmental fluctuations. The first layer is due to
the environment switching at random times between different environmental
states. This is similar to having sudden environmental changes or catastrophes.
The second layer is due to seasonal variation, where there is a significant
change in the dynamics between seasons. Finally, the third layer is due to the
constant presence of environmental stochasticity -- between the seasonal or
random regime switches, the species is affected by fluctuations which can be
modelled by white noise. This framework is more realistic because it can
capture both significant random and deterministic environmental shifts as well
as small and frequent fluctuations in abiotic factors. Our framework also
allows for the price or cost of harvesting to change deterministically and
stochastically, something that is more realistic from an economic point of
view.
  The combined effects of seasonal and random fluctuations make it impossible
to find the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy analytically. We get around
this roadblock by developing rigorous numerical approximations and proving that
they converge to the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy. We apply our methods
to multiple population models and explore how prices, or costs, and
environmental fluctuations influence the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy.
We show that in many situations the optimal way of harvesting and stocking is
not of threshold type.

galaxy clusters out to a redshift of unity. Following our previous 2018 study
based on the dn/dz quantity alone, we perform an upgraded cosmological analysis
of the same XXL C1 cluster catalogue (178 objects), with a detailed account of
the systematic errors. We follow the ASpiX methodology: the distribution of the
observed X-ray properties of the cluster population is analysed in a 3D
observable space (count rate, hardness ratio, redshift) and modelled as a
function of cosmology. Compared to more traditional methods, ASpiX allows the
inclusion of clusters down to a few tens of photons. We obtain an improvement
by a factor of 2 compared to the previous analysis by letting the normalisation
of the M-T relation and the evolution of the L-T relation free. Adding
constraints from the XXL cluster 2-point correlation function and the BAO from
various surveys decreases the uncertainties by 23 and 53 % respectively, and
62% when adding both. Switching to the scaling relations from the Subaru
analysis, and letting free more parameters, our final constraints are
$\sigma_8$ = $0.99^{+0.14}_{-0.23}$, $\Omega_m$ = 0.296 $\pm$ 0.034 ($S_8 =
0.98^{+0.11}_{-0.21}$) for the XXL sample alone. Finally, we combine XXL ASpiX,
the XXL cluster 2-point correlation function and the BAO, with 11 free
parameters, allowing for the cosmological dependence of the scaling relations
in the fit. We find $\sigma_8$ = $0.793^{+0.063}_{-0.12}$, $\Omega_m$ = 0.364
$\pm$ 0.015 ($S_8 = 0.872^{+0.068}_{-0.12}$), but still compatible with Planck
CMB at 2.2$\sigma$. The results obtained by the ASpiX method are promising;
further improvement is expected from the final XXL cosmological analysis
involving a cluster sample twice as large. Such a study paves the way for the
analysis of the eROSITA and future Athena surveys.

uncovered a surprisingly large number of extremely faint low surface brightness
galaxies with large physical sizes called ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in
clusters and, more recently, in lower density environments. As part of the
MATLAS survey, a deep imaging large program at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope (CFHT), our team has identified 2210 dwarf galaxies, 59 (~3%) of
which qualify as UDGs. Averaging over the survey area, we find ~0.4 UDG per
square degree. They are found in a range of low to moderate density
environments, although 61% of the sample fall within the virial radii of
groups. Based on a detailed analysis of their photometric and structural
properties, we find that the MATLAS UDGs do not show significant differences
from the traditional dwarfs, except from the predefined size and surface
brightness cut. Their median color is as red as the one measured in galaxy
clusters, albeit with a narrower color range. The majority of the UDGs are
visually classified as dwarf ellipticals with log stellar masses of ~6.5-8.7.
The fraction of nucleated UDGs (~34%) is roughly the same as the nucleated
fraction of the traditional dwarfs. Only five (~8%) UDGs show signs of tidal
disruption and only two are tidal dwarf galaxy candidates. A study of globular
cluster (GC) candidates selected in the CFHT images finds no evidence of a
higher GC specific frequency S_N for UDGs than for classical dwarfs, contrary
to what is found in most clusters. The UDG halo-to-stellar mass ratio
distribution, as estimated from the GC counts, peaks at roughly the same value
as for the traditional dwarfs, but spans the smaller range of ~10-2000. We
interpret these results to mean that the large majority of the field-to-group
UDGs do not have a different formation scenario than traditional dwarfs.

infections spread as the combined result of measures taken by central planners
(governments) and individual behavior. In this work, the spread of Covid-19 is
modelled as a differentiable game between the planner and population with
appropriate disease spread dynamical equations. We first characterise the
equilibrium dynamics of only the population with modifed
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) equations to highlight the qualitative
nature of the equilbrium. Using this result, we formulate the joint equilibrium
exposure profile between the planner and population. Additionally, as in case
of Covid-19, the role of asymptomatic carriers, inadequacies in testing,
contact tracing and quarantining can lead to a significant underestimate of the
true infected numbers as compared to just the detected numbers. Therefore, it
is vital to model the true infected numbers within the context of choices made
by individuals within the population. To incorporate this, we extend our
framework by modifying the dynamics to include additional sub-compartments of
`undetected infected' and `detected infected' in the disease dynamics. The
individuals make their own estimates of the total infected from the detected
numbers and base their strategies on those estimates. We show that these
considerations lead to a retarded optimal control problem for the players. We
present some simulation results based on these results to demonstrate how
population behavior, planner control, detection rates and trust in the reported
numbers play a key role in how the disease spreads.

  Information Decomposition","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1909.02297",,,,"q-bio.NC physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Complex systems, from the human brain to the global economy, are made of
multiple elements that interact in such ways that the behaviour of the `whole'
often seems to be more than what is readily explainable in terms of the `sum of
the parts.' Our ability to understand and control these systems remains
limited, one reason being that we still don't know how best to describe -- and
quantify -- the higher-order dynamical interactions that characterise their
complexity. To address this limitation, we combine principles from the theories
of Information Decomposition and Integrated Information into what we call
Integrated Information Decomposition, or $\Phi$ID. $\Phi$ID provides a
comprehensive framework to reason about, evaluate, and understand the
information dynamics of complex multivariate systems. $\Phi$ID reveals the
existence of previously unreported modes of collective information flow,
providing tools to express well-known measures of information transfer and
dynamical complexity as aggregates of these modes. Via computational and
empirical examples, we demonstrate that $\Phi$ID extends our explanatory power
beyond traditional causal discovery methods -- with profound implications for
the study of complex systems across disciplines.

role in biomedical science and applications. As millions of papers come out
every year in the biomedical domain, automatically discovering DTI knowledge
from biomedical literature, which are usually triplets about drugs, targets and
their interaction, becomes an urgent demand in the industry. Existing methods
of discovering biological knowledge are mainly extractive approaches that often
require detailed annotations (e.g., all mentions of biological entities,
relations between every two entity mentions, etc.). However, it is difficult
and costly to obtain sufficient annotations due to the requirement of expert
knowledge from biomedical domains. To overcome these difficulties, we explore
the first end-to-end solution for this task by using generative approaches. We
regard the DTI triplets as a sequence and use a Transformer-based model to
directly generate them without using the detailed annotations of entities and
relations. Further, we propose a semi-supervised method, which leverages the
aforementioned end-to-end model to filter unlabeled literature and label them.
Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms extractive
baselines on DTI discovery. We also create a dataset, KD-DTI, to advance this
task and will release it to the community.

Proceedings of CPOD 2021",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We introduce a novel freeze-out procedure connecting the hydrodynamic
evolution of a droplet of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) that has, as it expanded and
cooled, passed close to a posited critical point on the QCD phase diagram with
the subsequent kinetic description in terms of observable hadrons. The
procedure converts out-of-equilibrium critical fluctuations described by
extended hydrodynamics, known as Hydro+, into cumulants of hadron
multiplicities that can be subsequently measured. We introduce a critical sigma
field whose fluctuations cause correlations between observed hadrons due to the
couplings of the sigma field to the hadrons. We match the QGP fluctuations
obtained via solving the Hydro+ equations describing the evolution of critical
fluctuations before freeze-out to the correlations of the sigma field. In turn,
these are imprinted onto fluctuations in the multiplicities of hadrons, most
importantly protons, after freeze-out via a generalization of the familiar
half-a-century-old Cooper-Frye freeze-out prescription which we introduce. This
framework allows us to study the effects of critical slowing down and the
consequent deviation of the observable predictions from equilibrium
expectations quantitatively. We can also quantify the suppression of cumulants
due to the conservation of baryon number. We demonstrate the prescription in
practice by freezing out the Hydro+ simulation in a simplified azimuthally
symmetric and boost invariant background discussed in Rajagopal, Ridgway,
Weller, Yin, 2019.

namely, the standard Pauli basis and the Pauli-error basis. We experimentally
demonstrate that the performance of the CS algorithm is significantly better in
the Pauli-error basis, where the constructed $\chi$ matrix is maximally sparse.
We compare the standard least square (LS) optimization QPT method with the
CS-QPT method and observe that, provided an appropriate basis is chosen, the
CS-QPT method performs significantly better as compared to the LS-QPT method.
In all the cases considered, we obtained experimental fidelities greater than
0.9 from a reduced data set, which was approximately five to six times smaller
in size than a full data set. We also experimentally characterized the reduced
dynamics of a two-qubit subsystem embedded in a three-qubit system, and used

leaving little room for deployment on devices with limited battery and other
resources for real-time applications. The multi-exit architectures are type of
deep neural network that are interleaved with several output (or exit) layers
at varying depths of the model. They provide a sound approach for improving
computational time and energy utilization of running a model through producing
predictions from early exits. In this work, we present a novel and
architecture-agnostic approach for robust training of multi-exit architectures
termed consistent exit training. The crux of the method lies in a
consistency-based objective to enforce prediction invariance over clean and
perturbed inputs. We leverage weak supervision to align model output with
consistency training and jointly optimize dual-losses in a multi-task learning
fashion over the exits in a network. Our technique enables exit layers to
generalize better when confronted with increasing uncertainty, hence, resulting
in superior quality-efficiency trade-offs. We demonstrate through extensive
evaluation on challenging learning tasks involving sensor data that our
approach allows examples to exit earlier with better detection rate and without
executing all the layers in a deep model.

body.Such a situation is often observed in the daily lives of MS patients due
to their poor APAs and CPAs and induces their falls.The way of minimizing the
risk of falls in neurological patients is by utilizing perturbation-based
rehabilitation, as it is efficient in the recovery of the balance disorder. In
light of the findings, we present the design, implementation, and experimental
evaluation of a novel 3 DoF parallel manipulator to treat the balance disorder
of MS.The robotic platform allows angular motion of the ankle based on its
anthropomorphic freedom.Moreover, the end-effector endowed with upper and lower
platforms is designed to evaluate both the pressure distribution of each foot
and the CoM of the body, respectively.Data gathered from the platforms are
utilized to both evaluate the performance of the patients and used in
high-level control of the robotic platform to regulate the difficulty level of
tasks. In the study, kinematic and dynamic analyses of the robot are derived
and validated in the simulation environment.Low-level control of the first
prototype is also successfully implemented via the PID controller.The capacity
of each platform is evaluated with a set of experiments considering the
assessment of pressure distribution and CoM of the foot-like objects on the
end-effector.The experimental results indicate that such a system well-address
the need for balance skill training and assessment through the APAs and CPAs.

Trans-Neptunian objects has been predicted for some time. Oceans on icy worlds
exert a considerable influence on the dynamics of the ice-ocean system and,
because of the astrobiological potential, represent an important objective for
future missions. The Pluto-Charon system is representative of an icy moon
orbiting a dwarf planet formed from the remnants of a giant impact. Evolution
of icy moons is primarily controlled by the mode and efficiency of heat
transfer through the outer ice shell, which is influenced by the presence of
impurities, by tidal dissipation in the ice shell, and the radioactive element
budget in the core. Previous studies on the evolution of the Pluto-Charon
system considered either only the thermal or the tidal evolution, and in the
cases where both were considered, the important effect of the presence of
impurities in the liquid oceans was not addressed. We consider the joint
tidal-thermal evolution of the system by combining a comprehensive tidal model
that incorporates a viscoelastic tidal response with a parameterized convection
model developed for icy worlds. This approach enables an extensive analysis of
the conditions required for formation and maintenance of subsurface liquid
oceans to the present. Our results show that because of fast circularization
and synchronization of the orbits, tidal heating is only important during the
early stages of evolution (<1 Myr). We test the sensitivity of our results to
the initial orbital and thermal parameters. In all the cases, oceans on Pluto
are always predicted to remain liquid to the present, ranging from 40 km to
150-km thick, whereas oceans on Charon have solidified. This is supported by
New Horizons observations of extensional faults on Pluto and both extensional
and compressional faults on Charon.

shows a stronger pairing instability than the $d$-wave state. The bare Rashba

model for composite resource scheduling (CRS) in real-time networked control
systems, which considers a strict execution order of sensing, computing, and

the general CRS problem is NP-hard and study two special cases of the CRS

unit-size execution time while the second case assumes that both sensing and
actuating segments have unit-size execution time. We propose an optimal
algorithm to solve the first case by checking the intervals with 100% network
resource utilization and modify the deadlines of the tasks within those
intervals to prune the search. For the second case, we propose another optimal
algorithm based on a novel backtracking strategy to check the time intervals
with the network resource utilization larger than 100% and modify the timing
parameters of tasks based on these intervals. For the general case, we design a
greedy strategy to modify the timing parameters of both network segments and
computing segments within the time intervals that have network and computing
resource utilization larger than 100%, respectively. The correctness and
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are verified through extensive

deeper, but also with a longer baseline and better cadence than e.g. PS1 3$\pi$

variable stars such as RR Lyrae stars (RRL). Here, we address the question of
observing strategy optimization of LSST, as survey footprint definition, single
visit exposure time as well as the cadence of repeat visits in different
filters are yet to be finalized. We present metrics used to assess the impact
of different observing strategies on the reliable detectability and
classification of standard-candle variable stars, including detection of
amplitude period, phase modulation effects of RR Lyrae stars, the so-called
Blazhko effect (Blazhko 1907, Kollath et al. 2011), by evaluating metrics for
simulated potential survey designs. So far, due to depth and cadence of typical
all-sky surveys, it was nearly impossible to study this effect on a larger
sample. All-sky surveys with relatively few observations over a moderately long
baseline allow only for fitting phase-folded RRL light curves, thus integrating
over the complete survey length and hiding any information regarding possible
period or phase modulation during the survey. On the other hand, surveys with a
cadence to detect slightly changing light curves usually have a relatively
small footprint. LSST's survey strategy, however, will allow for studying
variable stars in a way that makes population studies possible.

through primal descent and maximizing the dual variable $\mu$ through dual
ascent. However, when $\mathcal{L}(x,\mu)$ is highly nonconvex with complex
constraints in $x$, the minimization over $x$ may not achieve global
optimality, and hence the dual ascent step loses its valid intuition. This
observation motivates us to propose a new class of primal-dual algorithms for
nonconvex constrained optimization with the key feature to reverse dual ascent
to a conceptually new dual descent, in a sense, elevating the dual variable to
the same status as the primal variable. Surprisingly, this new dual scheme
achieves some best iteration complexities for solving nonconvex optimization
problems. In particular, when the dual descent step is scaled by a fractional
constant, we name it scaled dual descent (SDD), otherwise, unscaled dual
descent (UDD). For nonconvex multiblock optimization with nonlinear equality
constraints, we propose SDD-ADMM and show that it finds an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations. The
complexity is further improved to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ under proper conditions. We also propose UDD-ALM,

We show that UDD-ALM finds an $\epsilon$-stationary solution in

that uses the ""lifted"" Fourier feature map, that demonstrates both of these
behaviors. The input is one-dimensional, and the adversary is only allowed to
perturb these inputs and not the non-linear features directly. We find that the
learned model is susceptible to adversaries in an intermediate regime where
classification generalizes but regression does not. Notably, the susceptibility
arises despite the absence of model mis-specification or label noise, which are
commonly cited reasons for adversarial-susceptibility. These results are
extended theoretically to a random-Fourier-sum setup that exhibits
double-descent behavior. In both feature-setups, the adversarial vulnerability
arises because of a phenomenon we term spatial localization: the predictions of
the learned model are markedly more sensitive in the vicinity of training
points than elsewhere. This sensitivity is a consequence of feature lifting and
is reminiscent of Gibb's and Runge's phenomena from signal processing and
functional analysis. Despite the adversarial susceptibility, we find that
classification with these features can be easier than the more commonly studied

in order to explore optoelectronic properties. Firstly, by lowering the
symmetry of the lattice to monoclinic through rotation and tilting of the

form of Kondo destruction and large-to-small Fermi-surface fluctuations. These
fluctuations lead to unconventional superconductivity whose transition
temperature is exceptionally high relative to the effective Fermi temperature,

Reionization. We present AGN luminosity functions in various bands between z =
2 to 7 predicted by the well-established Santa Cruz semi-analytic model, which
includes modelling of black hole accretion and AGN feedback. We then combine
the predicted AGN populations with a physical spectral model for
self-consistent estimates of ionizing photon production rates, which depend on
the mass and accretion rate of the accreting supermassive black hole. We then
couple the predicted comoving ionizing emissivity with an analytic model to
compute the subsequent reionization history of intergalactic helium and
hydrogen. This work demonstrates the potential of coupling physically motivated
analytic or semi-analytic techniques to capture multi-scale physical processes
across a vast range of scales (here, from AGN accretion disks to cosmological
scales). Our physical model predicts an intrinsic ionizing photon budget well
above many of the estimates in the literature, meaning that helium reionization
can comfortably be accomplished even with a relatively low escape fraction. We
also make predictions for the AGN populations that are expected to be detected

arrival times at an Earth-based detector will depend on the neutrino path. We
show here that a modest amount of neutrinos, emitted just prior to the black
hole forming, scatter on the infalling material into our line of sight and
arrive after the formation of the black hole, up to 15 ms in our model. This
neutrino echo, which we characterize with Monte Carlo simulations and analytic

$\approx1/3$ of the ARTEMIS galaxies contain a similar feature, and confirm
that they usually comprise stellar debris from the most massive accreted
satellite. Selecting 15 galaxies with discs at the present-day, we study their
changes around the times of the GS-like mergers. Dark matter haloes of many of

becoming significantly more spherical when the mergers occur. Focusing on the

merger. We also investigate the origin of in situ retrograde stars, analogous
to the 'Splash' in the Milky Way. Tracing them back to earlier snapshots, we
demonstrate that they were often disrupted onto their extreme orbits by

priority to sample size, at the cost of having a complex selection function.
With the advent of the next generation of wide-field photometric surveys,
however, it might become possible to identify subsets of the lens population
with well-defined selection criteria, trading sample size for completeness.
  Aims. There are two main advantages of working with a complete sample of
lenses. First, it is possible to recover the properties of the general
population of galaxies, of which strong lenses are a biased subset. Second, the
relative number of lenses and non-detections can be used to further constrain
models of galaxy structure. This work illustrates how to carry out a
statistical strong lensing analysis that takes advantage of these features.
  Methods. I introduced a general formalism for the statistical analysis of a
sample of strong lenses with known selection function, then tested it on
simulated data. The simulation consists of a population of $10^5$ galaxies with
an axisymmetric power-law density profile, a population of background point
sources, and a subset of $\sim10^3$ strong lenses, complete above an
observational cut.
  Mandatory. The method allows to recover the distribution in Einstein radius
and mass density slope of the galaxy population in an unbiased way. The number
of non-lenses helps to constrain the model when magnification data are not
available.
  Conclusions. Complete samples of lenses are a powerful asset to turn precise
strong lensing measurements into accurate statements on the properties of the
general galaxy population.

the largest Lyapunov exponent. We then compute the loop corrections to the

width $N$, and find a precise analogy with the well-studied $O(N)$ vector
model, in which the variance of the weight initializations plays the role of
the 't Hooft coupling. In particular, we compute both the $\mathcal{O}(1)$
corrections quantifying fluctuations from typicality in the ensemble of
networks, and the subleading $\mathcal{O}(T/N)$ corrections due to finite-width
effects. These provide corrections to the correlation length that controls the
depth to which information can propagate through the network, and thereby sets
the scale at which such networks are trainable by gradient descent. Our
analysis provides a first-principles approach to the rapidly emerging NN-QFT
correspondence, and opens several interesting avenues to the study of
criticality in deep neural networks.

correlated with star clustering. In star clusters, interactions between
planetary systems and close fly-by stars can significantly change the
architecture of primordially coplanar, circular planetary systems. Flybys in
dense clusters have a significant impact on hot Jupiter formation via
activation of high eccentricity excitation mechanisms such as the
Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and planet-planet scattering. Previous studies
have shown that if there are two giant planets in the planetary system, close
flybys can efficiently activate the ZLK mechanism, thus triggering high
eccentricity tidal migration and ultimately form hot Jupiters in star clusters.
Here we extend our previous study with a multi-planet (triple) system. We
perform high precision, high-accuracy few-body simulations of stellar flybys
and subsequent planetary migration within the perturbed planetary systems using
the code {\tt SpaceHub}. Our simulations demonstrate that a single close flyby
on a multi-planet system in a cluster can activate secular chaos and ultimately
lead to hot Jupiter formation via high eccentricity migration. We find that the
hot Jupiter formation rate per system increases with both the size of the
planetary system as well as with the mass of the outer planet, and we quantify
the relative formation fractions for a range of parameters. Hot Jupiters formed
via secular chaos are expected to be accompanied by massive companions with
very long periods. Our study further shows that this flyby-induced secular
chaos is preferred in low-density clusters where multi-planet systems are more
likely to survive, and that it contributes a significant fraction of the hot
Jupiter formation in star clusters compared to the flyby-induced ZLK mechanism.

After discussing general features of cosmological approaches to naturalness, we
extend the Standard Model with two light scalars very weakly coupled to the
Higgs and present the mechanism, which we recently introduced in a companion
paper to explain jointly the electroweak hierarchy and the strong-CP problem.
In this work we show that this solution can be decoupled from the strong-CP
problem and discuss its possible implementations and phenomenology. The
mechanism works with any standard inflationary sector, it does not require
weak-scale inflation or a large number of e-folds, and does not introduce
ambiguities related to eternal inflation. The cutoff of the theory can be as
large as the Planck scale, both for the Cosmological Constant and for the Higgs
sector. Reproducing the observed dark matter relic density fixes the couplings
of the two new scalars to the Standard Model, offering a target to future axion
or fifth force searches. Depending on the specific interaction of the scalars
with the Standard Model, the mechanism either yields rich phenomenology at
colliders or provides a novel joint solution to the strong-CP problem. We
highlight what predictions are common to most realizations of cosmological
selection of the weak scale and will allow to test this general framework in
the near future.

in galaxy formation but most previous simulations have integrated out the
energy-dependence of the CR distribution, despite its large extent over more
than twelve decades in particle energy. To improve upon this simplification, we
present the implementation and first application of spectrally resolved CRs
which are coupled to the magneto-hydrodynamics in simulations of galaxy
formation. The spectral model for the CRs enables more accurate cooling of CRs
and allows for an energy-dependent spatial diffusion, for which we introduce a
new stable numerical algorithm that proves essential in highly dynamical
systems. We perform galaxy formation simulations with this new model and
compare the results to a grey CR approach with a simplified diffusive transport
and effective cooling that assumes steady-state spectra. We find that the
galaxies with spectrally resolved CRs differ in morphology, star formation
rate, and strength and structure of the outflows. Interestingly, the first
outflow front is driven by CRs with average momenta of
$\sim200-600\,\mathrm{Gev}~c^{-1}$. The subsequent formation of outflows, which
reach mass loading factors of order unity, are primarily launched by CRs of
progressively smaller average momenta of $\sim8-15\,\mathrm{GeV}~c^{-1}$. The
CR spectra in the galactic centre quickly approach a steady state, which does
not significantly vary over time. In the outer disc and outflow regions, the
spectral shape approaches steady state only after $\sim2\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ of
evolution. Furthermore, the shapes of the approximate steady state spectra
differ for individual regions of the galaxy, which highlights the importance of
actively including the full CR spectrum.

Great Plane of Andromeda (GPoA), and their line-of-sight velocities display
correlation reminiscent of a rotating structure. Recently reported first proper
motion measurements for the on-plane satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185 indicate
that they indeed co-orbit along the GPoA. This provides a novel opportunity to
compare the M31 satellite system to $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We perform the
first detailed comparison of the orbital alignment of two satellite galaxies
beyond the Milky Way with several hydrodynamical and dark-matter-only
cosmological simulations (Illustris TNG-50, TNG-100, ELVIS, PhatELVIS), in the
context of the Planes of Satellite Galaxies Problem. In line with previous
works, we find that the spatial flattening and line-of-sight velocity
correlation alone is already in substantial tension with $\Lambda$CDM, with
none of the simulated analogs simultaneously reproducing both parameters.
Almost none (3 to 4\%) of the simulated systems contain two satellites with
orbital poles as well aligned with their satellite plane as indicated by the
most-likely proper motions of NGC 147 and NGC 185. However, within current
measurement uncertainties it is common (~70%) that the two best-aligned
satellites of simulated systems are consistent with the orbital alignment. Yet,
the chance that any two simulated on-plane satellites have as well aligned
orbital poles as observed is low (~4%). We conclude that confirmation of the
tight orbital alignment for these two objects via improved measurements, or the
discovery of similar alignments for additional GPoA members, hold the potential
to further raise the tension with $\Lambda$CDM expectations.

free Hamiltonians whose ground state phase transitions have rigorous duality to
chaotic transitions in dynamical systems. By this duality, we show the

bulk-to-surface response, which are then dubbed ""peratic"" meaning defined by
response to the boundary. For the classical system, we show how the time-like
dimension emerges in the static ground states. For the quantum system, the
ground state is a superposition of geometrical lines on a two dimensional
array, which encode the dynamical Floquet evolution history of one dimensional
disordered spin chains. Our prediction of peratic phase transition has direct
consequences in quantum simulation platforms such as Rydberg atoms and
superconducting qubits, as well as anisotropic spin glass materials. The

baths is an emerging area of quantum optics. At the same time, non-Hermitian
(NH) physics is currently thriving, spurred by the exciting possibility to
access new physics in systems ruled by non-trivial NH Hamiltonians - in
particular photonic lattices - which can challenge longstanding tenets such as
the Bloch theory of bands. Here, we combine these two fields and study the
exotic interaction between emitters mediated by the photonic modes of a lossy
photonic lattice described by a NH Hamiltonian. We show in a paradigmatic case
study that structured losses in the field can seed exotic emission properties.
Photons can mediate dissipative, fully non-reciprocal, interactions between the
emitters with range critically dependent on the loss rate. When this loss rate
corresponds to a bare-lattice exceptional point, the effective couplings are
exactly nearest-neighbour, implementing a dissipative, fully non-reciprocal,
Hatano-Nelson model. Counter-intuitively, this occurs irrespective of the
lattice boundary conditions. Thus photons can mediate an effective emitters'
Hamiltonian which is translationally-invariant despite the fact that the field
is not. We interpret these effects in terms of metastable atom-photon dressed
states, which can be exactly localized on only two lattice cells or extended
across the entire lattice. These findings introduce a new paradigm of
light-mediated interactions with unprecedented features such as
non-reciprocity, non-trivial dependence on the field boundary conditions and
range tunability via a loss rate.

In the spherical case it is characterized by a brief UV flash. In an
axisymmetric, non-spherical prolate explosion, the shock first breaches the
surface along the symmetry axis, then peels around to larger angles, producing
a breakout light curve which may differ substantially from the spherically
symmetric case. We study the emergence of a non-relativistic, bipolar shock
from a spherical star, and estimate the basic properties of the associated
bolometric shock breakout signal. We identify four possible classes of breakout
light curves, depending on the degree of asphericity. Compared to spherical
breakouts, we find that the main distinguishing features of significantly
aspherical breakouts are 1) a longer and fainter initial breakout flash and 2)
an extended phase of slowly-declining, or even rising, emission which is
produced as ejecta flung out by the oblique breakout expand and cool. We find
that the breakout flash has a maximum duration of roughly $\sim R_*/v_{\rm bo}$
where $R_*$ is the stellar radius and $v_{\rm bo}$ is the velocity of the
fastest-moving ejecta. For a standard Wolf--Rayet progenitor, the duration of
the X-ray flash seen in SN 2008D exceeds this limit, and the same holds true
for the prompt X-ray emission of low-luminosity GRBs such as GRB 060218. This
suggests that these events cannot be explained by an aspherical explosion
within a typical Wolf--Rayet star, implying that they originate from
non-standard progenitors with larger breakout radii.

for measuring galaxy morphology. This forward modelling technique allows one to
account for the PSF to effectively study semi-resolved galaxies. However, using
a specific parameterization for a galaxy's surface brightness profile can bias
measurements if it is not an accurate representation. Furthermore, it can be
difficult to assess systematic errors in parameterized profiles. To overcome
these issues we employ the Multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) method of
representing a galaxy's profile together with a Bayesian framework for fitting
images. MGE flexibly represents a galaxy's profile using a series of Gaussians.
We introduce a novel Bayesian inference approach which uses pre-rendered
Gaussian components, which greatly speeds up computation time and makes it
feasible to run the fitting code on large samples of galaxies. We demonstrate
our method with a series of validation tests. By injecting galaxies, with
properties similar to those observed at $z\sim1.5$, into deep HST observations
we show that it can accurately recover total fluxes and effective radii of
realistic galaxies. Additionally we use degraded images of local galaxies to
show that our method can recover realistic galaxy surface brightness and color
profiles. Our implementation is available in an open source python package
$\texttt{imcascade}$, which contains all methods needed for the preparation of
images, fitting and analysis of results.

spin model into 1+1d chiral system with anyon excitations. Each WZW model hosts
Abelian anyons as charge excitations, and may arise as the chiral edge theory
of 2+1d gapped topological phases. We solve the chiral SY model in two limits

interactions at any integers $N$ and $M$, which is integrable and decomposes
into a chiral SU$(M)_N$ WZW model and its coset with different ""speed of

second limit is the large $N$ and $M$ limit with random interactions, which is
solvable to the leading $\frac{1}{NM}$ order, and exhibits many-body quantum
chaos in the out-of-time-ordered correlation of anyons. As the interaction
strength approaches the upper limit preserving the chirality, the leading
velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent of the model saturates the maximal chaos

coexist on the quantum regime too. Crucially, however, objectivity relies on
distributed classical information that could conflict with thermalisation.
Here, we examine the overlap between thermal and objective states. We find that
in general, one cannot exist when the other is present. However, there are
certain regimes where thermality and objectivity are more likely to coexist: in
the high temperature limit, at the non-degenerate low temperature limit, and
when the environment is large. This is consistent with our experiences that
everyday-sized objects can be both thermal and objective.

tail at high densities and the inclusion of stellar feedback from protostellar
outflows and heating produces significant time-varying deviations from a
lognormal distribution at the low densities. The simulation with outflows has
an excess of diffuse gas compared to the simulations without outflows, exhibits
increased average sonic Mach number, and maintains a slower star formation rate
over the entire duration of the run. We study the mass transfer between the
diffuse gas in the lognormal peak of the PDF, the collapsing gas in the
power-law tail, and the stars. We find that the mass fraction in the power-law
tail is constant, such that the stars form out of the power-law gas at the same
rate at which the gas from the lognormal part replenishes the power-law. We
find that turbulence does not provide significant support in the dense gas
associated with the power-law tail. When including outflows and magnetic fields
in addition to driven turbulence, the rate of mass transfer from the lognormal
to the power-law, and then to the stars, becomes significantly slower,
resulting in slower star formation rates and longer depletion times.

billion years is vital to uncovering the earliest growth and chemical evolution
of galaxies. Pop III galaxies, however, are typically expected to be too faint
and too few in number to be detectable by forthcoming instruments without
extremely long integration times and/or extreme lensing. In an environment,
however, where star formation is suppressed until a halo crosses the atomic
cooling limit (e.g., by a modest Lyman-Werner flux, high baryonic streaming
velocities, and/or dynamical heating effects),primordial halos can form
substantially more numerous and more massive stars. Some of these stars will
in-turn be accreting more rapidly than they can thermally relax at any given
time. Using high resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive star
formation in high-z halos, we find that such rapidly accreting stars produce
prominent spectral features which would be detectable by {\it JWST}. The rapid
accretion episodes within the halo lead to stochastic reprocessing of 0--20\%
of the total stellar emission into the rest-frame optical over long timescales,
a unique signature which may allow deep observations to identify such objects
out to $z \sim 10-13$ using mid- and wide-band NIRCam colors alone.

$\simeq$10-min long flare just a few minutes after a brief sequence of multiple

environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to

higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for
undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three
components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure
and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing
culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to
emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing
culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political
struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social
justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and
Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS
education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical
implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect
for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing
that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.

demonstrated that the plasmonic metal nanostructures can be used to enhance the
light absorption efficiency and the overall dye-sensitization rate of DSP
systems through the plasmonic Mie resonance-enhanced dye-sensitization
approach. In this contribution, we report an alternate and novel approach,
dielectric Mie resonance-enhanced dye sensitization. Specifically, we
demonstrate that the dielectric Mie resonances in cuprous oxide (Cu2O)
spherical and cubical nanostructures can be used to enhance the
dye-sensitization rate of methylene blue dye. The Cu2O nanostructures
exhibiting dielectric Mie resonances exhibit up to an order of magnitude higher
dye-sensitization rate as compared to Cu2O nanostructures not exhibiting
dielectric Mie resonances. Our model system developed from finite-difference
time-domain simulation predicts a volcano-type relationship between the dye
sensitization rate and the size of Cu2O nanostructures. The predicted
structure-property-performance relationship is experimentally verified and the
optimal size ranges of Cu2O nanospheres and nanocubes are identified. Although
we demonstrate the dielectric Mie resonance-enhanced dye-sensitization approach
using Cu2O nanostructures, the proposed approach can be used to design a wide
range of DSP systems, including CeO2, {\alpha}-Fe2O3, and TiO2

moulded transportation infrastructures into their current configuration,
without having to rely on any additional information besides the topology of
the network and the distribution of the population. An illustrative example is

of $n$ points in the plane, and the goal is to select $k$ center points, so as
to minimize the maximum distance over points in $P$ to their nearest center.
Here we initiate the systematic study of the clustering with neighborhoods
problem, which generalizes the $k$-center problem to allow the covered objects
to be a set of general disjoint convex objects $\mathscr{C}$ rather than just a
point set $P$. For this problem we first show that there is a PTAS for
approximating the number of centers. Specifically, if $r_{opt}$ is the optimal
radius for $k$ centers, then in $n^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ time we can produce a
set of $(1+\varepsilon)k$ centers with radius $\leq r_{opt}$. If instead one
considers the standard goal of approximating the optimal clustering radius,
while keeping $k$ as a hard constraint, we show that the radius cannot be
approximated within any factor in polynomial time unless $\mathsf{P=NP}$, even
when $\mathscr{C}$ is a set of line segments. When $\mathscr{C}$ is a set of
unit disks we show the problem is hard to approximate within a factor of
$\frac{\sqrt{13}-\sqrt{3}}{2-\sqrt{3}}\approx 6.99$. This hardness result
complements our main result, where we show that when the objects are disks, of
possibly differing radii, there is a $(5+2\sqrt{3})\approx 8.46$ approximation
algorithm. Additionally, for unit disks we give an $O(n\log
k)+(k/\varepsilon)^{O(k)}$ time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the optimal
radius, that is, an FPTAS for constant $k$ whose running time depends only
linearly on $n$. Finally, we show that the one dimensional version of the

model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn from multiple task distributions.
ST-MAML encodes tasks using a stochastic neural network module, that summarizes
every task with a stochastic representation. The proposed Stochastic Task (ST)
strategy allows a meta-model to get tailored for the current task and enables
us to learn a distribution of solutions for an ambiguous task. ST-MAML also
propagates the task representation to revise the encoding of input variables.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ST-MAML matches or outperforms the
state-of-the-art on two few-shot image classification tasks, one curve
regression benchmark, one image completion problem, and a real-world

However, the physical origins of EIT and polarization induced phenomena have
not been well distinguished, which can lead to confusion in associated
applications such as slow light and optical/quantum storage. Here we study the
polarization effects in various optical EIT systems. We find that a
polarization mismatch between whispering gallery modes in two indirectly
coupled resonators can induce a narrow transparency window in the transmission

possible for an intelligent attacker to degrade the performance of TAS to the

the detection performance of the system is evaluated via the probability of

the robustness and the detection performance of the system. Moreover, based on
EAS, another new scheme called the reduced audit bit based scheme (RAS) is
proposed which further improves system performance. We derive the new optimal
fusion rule and the simulation results show that RAS outperforms EAS and TAS in
terms of both robustness and detection performance of the system. Then, we
extend the proposed RAS for a wide-area cluster based distributed wireless

of these characteristics lies the high mobility of Cu ions, which also
determines the spontaneous polarization. Therefore, Cu migration across the

interplay of polar and ionic properties provides a path to ionically controlled
ferroelectric behavior, achieved by applying selected DC voltage pulses and
subsequently probing ferroelectric switching during fast triangular voltage
sweeps. Using current measurements and theoretical calculations, we observe
that increasing DC pulse duration results in higher ionic currents, the
build-up of an internal electric field that shifts polarization loops, and an
increase in total switchable polarization by ~50% due to the existence of a
high polarization phase which is stabilized by the internal electric field.
Apart from tuning ferroelectric behavior by selected square pulses, hysteretic
polarization switching can even be entirely deactivated and reactivated,
resulting in three-state systems where polarization switching is either
inhibited or can be performed in two different directions.

dielectric Mie resonance-enhanced photocatalysis, to enhance the catalytic

simulation and experimental results predict a volcano-type relationship between
the photocatalytic rate and the size of Cu2O nanospheres and nanocubes. Using

associated with dielectric Mie resonance-mediated charge carrier generation is
dominant in Cu2O nanostructures that exhibit higher photocatalytic rates.

this to develop new algorithms for Boolean matrix multiplication, among other
tasks. For instance, their algorithm can compute Boolean matrix multiplication
in $O(n^{\log_2(6+6/7)} \log n) = O(n^{2.778})$ time. While faster matrix
multiplication algorithms exist asymptotically, in practice most such
algorithms are infeasible for practical problems.
  In this note, we describe an alternate way to use the broken matrix
multiplication algorithm to approximately compute matrix multiplication, either
for real-valued matrices or Boolean matrices. In brief, instead of running
multiple iterations of the broken algorithm on the original input matrix, we
form a new larger matrix by sampling and run a single iteration of the broken
algorithm. Asymptotically, the resulting algorithm has runtime $O(n^{\frac{3

Karppa-Kaski's algorithm.
  Since the goal is to obtain new practical matrix-multiplication algorithms,
these asymptotic runtime bounds are not directly useful. We estimate the
runtime for our algorithm for some sample problems which are at the upper
limits of practical algorithms; unfortunately, for these parameters, the new
algorithm does not appear to be beneficial.

sherpas to paying climbers etc. Specifically, it combines the two perspectives
into a multiscale network, i.e., a network of individual climber features

layers encode different factors. The analysis reveals that chances of failure
to summit due to fatigue, altitude or logistical problems, drastically reduce

how local MCMC algorithms, namely the Metropolis algorithm and several versions
of event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC), escape from configurations that are obtained
by slightly reducing all disk radii by a relaxation parameter. A scaling
analysis is confirmed by simulation results. We obtain two classes of ECMC, one
in which the escape time varies algebraically with the relaxation parameter (as
for the local Metropolis algorithm) and another in which the escape time scales
as the logarithm of the relaxation parameter. We discuss the connectivity of
the hard-disk sample space, the ergodicity of local MCMC algorithms, as well as
the meaning of packings in the context of the NPT ensemble. Our work is
accompanied by open-source, arbitrary-precision software for B\""or\""oczky

from a bulk to nanoscale, they can be both nonpolar, piezoelectric or even
ferroelectric. Also, in terms of electronic properties, they can be direct-band
semiconductors, semi-metals or even metals. The tuning of the electronic
properties in the LD-TMDs are commonly related with applied strains and strain
gradients, which can affect strongly their polar properties via the
piezoelectric and flexoelectric couplings. Using the density functional theory
(DFT) and phenomenological Landau approach, we studied the bended 2H-MoS$_2$
monolayer and analyzed its flexoelectric and piezoelectric properties. The
dependences of the dipole moment, strain and strain gradient on the coordinate
along the layer were calculated. From these dependences the components of the
flexoelectric and piezoelectric tensors have been determined and analyzed.
Obtained results are useful for applications of LD-TMDs in strain engineering

We connect the transition to the controllability and the complexity of QAOA

interpretable paths in the latent space of pretrained GANs, so as to provide an
intuitive and easy way of controlling the underlying generative factors. In
doing so, it addresses some of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works,
namely, a) that they discover directions that are independent of the latent
code, i.e., paths that are linear, and b) that their evaluation relies either
on visual inspection or on laborious human labeling. More specifically, we
propose to learn non-linear warpings on the latent space, each one parametrized
by a set of RBF-based latent space warping functions, and where each warping
gives rise to a family of non-linear paths via the gradient of the function.
Building on the work of Voynov and Babenko, that discovers linear paths, we
optimize the trainable parameters of the set of RBFs, so as that images that
are generated by codes along different paths, are easily distinguishable by a
discriminator network. This leads to easily distinguishable image
transformations, such as pose and facial expressions in facial images. We show
that linear paths can be derived as a special case of our method, and show
experimentally that non-linear paths in the latent space lead to steeper, more
disentangled and interpretable changes in the image space than in state-of-the

augmented with online adaptation techniques. We also develop a whole-body
trajectory optimization procedure to fix the kinematic infeasibility of the

model-based controller can seamlessly imitate various motor skills, including
trotting, pacing, turning, and side-stepping. It also shows better tracking
capabilities in simulation and the real world against several baselines,
including another model-based imitation controller and a learning-based motion

Their high temperatures result in thermally ionized particles embedded in

generating current and experiencing bulk Lorentz force drag. Previous
treatments of magnetic drag in 3D General Circulation Models (GCMs) of
ultra-hot Jupiters have mostly been uniform drag timescales applied evenly
throughout the planet, which neglects the strong spatial dependence of these
magnetic effects. In this work, we apply our locally calculated active magnetic
drag treatment in a GCM of the planet WASP-76b. We find the effects of this
treatment to be most pronounced in the planet's upper atmosphere, where strong
differences between the day and night side circulation are present. These
circulation effects alter the resulting phase curves by reducing the hotspot
offset and increasing the day-night flux contrast. We compare our models to
Spitzer phase curves which imply a magnetic field of at least 3 G for the
planet. We additionally contrast our results to uniform drag timescale models.
This work highlights the need for more careful treatment of magnetic effects in
atmospheric models of hot gas giants.

A major contributor to air pollution during construction is the use of heavy

using an excavator performing real-world construction work. A portable emission

record data including the amount of CO, NOX, CO2, SO2, and CH4 pollutions
emitted by the equipment. Different ML algorithms were developed and compared
to identify the best model to predict emission levels from inertial sensors

$\Delta$ has chromatic number at most $(C+o(1))\Delta/\log \Delta$ for some
universal constant $C > 0$. Using the entropy compression method, Molloy proved
that one can in fact take $C = 1$. Here we show that for every $q \geq (1 +
o(1))\Delta/\log \Delta$, the number $c(G,q)$ of proper $q$-colorings of $G$
satisfies $c(G, q) \,\geq\, \left(1 - \frac{1}{q}\right)^m ((1-o(1))q)^n$,
where $n = |V(G)|$ and $m = |E(G)|$. Except for the $o(1)$ term, this lower
bound is best possible as witnessed by random $\Delta$-regular graphs. When $q
= (1 + o(1)) \Delta/\log \Delta$, our result yields the inequality $c(G,q)
\,\geq\, \exp\left((1 - o(1)) \frac{\log \Delta}{2} n\right)$, which improves
an earlier bound of Iliopoulos and yields the optimal value for the constant
factor in the exponent. Furthermore, this result implies the optimal lower
bound on the number of independent sets in $G$ due to Davies, Jenssen, Perkins,

was recently developed by Rosenfeld. As a byproduct, we obtain an alternative
proof of Molloy's bound $\chi(G) \leq (1 + o(1))\Delta/\log \Delta$ using
Rosenfeld's method in place of entropy compression (other proofs of Molloy's

identified in a cosmological simulation and classified according to their

contraction at their outskirts. We study how these environments and the
dynamics of voids impact the baryonic processes inside haloes and their
mechanisms of formation and evolution. We find an under-abundance of processed
gas within the voids that can be associated with the lack of massive haloes. By
studying the dynamical phase-space diagram of haloes and the halo-particle
correlation function, we find that haloes inside of contracting voids are
slightly affected by the presence of bigger structures, in comparison to haloes
in the inner regions of expanding voids. Consistent signals are obtained both
when using dark matter and gas particles. We show that the halo assembly
depends on the void dynamical state: haloes in expanding voids assemble slowly
than those in contracting voids and in the general universe. This difference in
the assembly impacts the baryonic evolution of haloes. Overall the redshift
range analysed, haloes in voids have less baryon content than haloes in the

reference orbitals (HF-CC methodology). However, it has been repeatedly argued
in the literature that the use of a Kohn-Sham reference (KS-CC methodology)
might result in improved performance relative to HF-CC at the same
computational cost. In the present theoretical study, we re-examine the
relation of HF-CC and KS-CC methods by comparing the results of widely applied
truncated CC calculations (CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT) to the limit of full
configuration interaction (FCI), which in contrast to wave-function diagnostics
with vague physical meaning or experimental data with considerable uncertainty
serves as an undebatable reference point of accuracy. We find that apart from
incidental exceptions, the Kohn-Sham referenced CC methods show systematic
deterioration compared to HF-CC, that is, the KS-CC molecular properties
(electronic energy and density) are always farther from the FCI limit than
those obtained from HF-CC at the same coupled cluster level. Furthermore, the
introduction of common approximations (frozen core, density fitting) to the CC
calculation results in significantly higher errors in the case of KS reference.
We conclude that the use of KS reference orbitals is not expected to increase
the reliability of low-level CC energetics. Nevertheless, molecular errors from
the components of the studied chemical reaction might fortunately cancel out
resulting in illusory improvement compared to HF-CC. It is also notable that
the choice of reference orbitals has negligible influence on the results at
sufficiently high CC levels which can be estimated by test calculations or by
the magnitude of double amplitudes. Therefore, the application of KS-CC is not
unreasonable as it might bypass the difficulties of HF convergence.

It allows sending robots instead of humans in remote, possibly dangerous
locations while still using the human brain with its enormous knowledge and
creativity, especially for solving unexpected problems. A main challenge in
teleoperation consists of providing enough feedback to the human operator for
situation awareness and thus create full immersion, as well as offering the
operator suitable control interfaces to achieve efficient and robust task
fulfillment. We present a bimanual telemanipulation system consisting of an
anthropomorphic avatar robot and an operator station providing force and haptic
feedback to the human operator. The avatar arms are controlled in Cartesian
space with a 1:1 mapping of the operator movements. The measured forces and
torques on the avatar side are haptically displayed directly to the operator.
We developed a predictive avatar model for limit avoidance which runs on the
operator side, ensuring low latency. Only off-the-shelf components were used to
build the system. It is evaluated in lab experiments and by untrained operators
in a small user study.

memory. In our model, perception, episodic memory, and semantic memory are
realized by different operational modes of the oscillating interactions between
a symbolic index layer and a subsymbolic representation layer. The two layers
form a bilayer tensor network (BTN). Although memory appears to be about the
past, its main purpose is to support the agent in the present and the future.
Recent episodic memory provides the agent with a sense of the here and now.
Remote episodic memory retrieves relevant past experiences to provide
information about possible future scenarios. This aids the agent in
decision-making. ""Future"" episodic memory, based on expected future events,
guides planning and action. Semantic memory retrieves specific information,
which is not delivered by current perception, and defines priors for future
observations. We argue that it is important for the agent to encode individual
entities, not just classes and attributes. We demonstrate that a form of
self-supervised learning can acquire new concepts and refine existing ones. We
test our model on a standard benchmark data set, which we expanded to contain
richer representations for attributes, classes, and individuals. Our key
hypothesis is that obtaining a better understanding of perception and memory is
a crucial prerequisite to comprehending human-level intelligence.

remains a substantial challenge, especially for complex structures as it deals
with the global minimization of the extremely rugged high-dimensional potential

scheme was proposed to construct a symmetry tree graph, where the entire search

artificial intelligence-based symmetry selection strategy was subsequently
devised to select the low-lying subspaces with high symmetries for global
exploration and in-depth exploitation. Our approach can significantly simplify
the problem of crystal structure prediction by avoiding exploration of the most
complex P1 subspace on the entire search space and have the advantage of
preserving the crystal symmetry during structure evolution, making it well
suitable for predicting the complex crystal structures. The effectiveness of
the method has been validated by successful prediction of the candidate
structures of binary Lennard-Jones mixtures and high-pressure phase of ice,
containing more than one hundred atoms in the simulation cell. The work,
therefore, opens up an opportunity towards achieving the long-sought goal for
crystal structure prediction of complex systems.

  Datasets",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robot learning holds the promise of learning policies that generalize
broadly. However, such generalization requires sufficiently diverse datasets of
the task of interest, which can be prohibitively expensive to collect. In other
fields, such as computer vision, it is common to utilize shared, reusable
datasets, such as ImageNet, to overcome this challenge, but this has proven
difficult in robotics. In this paper, we ask: what would it take to enable
practical data reuse in robotics for end-to-end skill learning? We hypothesize
that the key is to use datasets with multiple tasks and multiple domains, such
that a new user that wants to train their robot to perform a new task in a new
domain can include this dataset in their training process and benefit from
cross-task and cross-domain generalization. To evaluate this hypothesis, we
collect a large multi-domain and multi-task dataset, with 7,200 demonstrations
constituting 71 tasks across 10 environments, and empirically study how this
data can improve the learning of new tasks in new environments. We find that
jointly training with the proposed dataset and 50 demonstrations of a
never-before-seen task in a new domain on average leads to a 2x improvement in
success rate compared to using target domain data alone. We also find that data
for only a few tasks in a new domain can bridge the domain gap and make it
possible for a robot to perform a variety of prior tasks that were only seen in
other domains. These results suggest that reusing diverse multi-task and
multi-domain datasets, including our open-source dataset, may pave the way for
broader robot generalization, eliminating the need to re-collect data for each
new robot learning project.

model is made to forget about some of its training data points. While naively
retraining the model from scratch is an option, it is almost always associated
with large computational overheads for deep learning models. Thus, several
approaches to approximately unlearn have been proposed along with corresponding
metrics that formalize what it means for a model to forget about a data point.
In this work, we first taxonomize approaches and metrics of approximate
unlearning. As a result, we identify verification error, i.e., the L2
difference between the weights of an approximately unlearned and a naively
retrained model, as an approximate unlearning metric that should be optimized
for as it subsumes a large class of other metrics. We theoretically analyze the
canonical training algorithm, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), to surface the
variables which are relevant to reducing the verification error of approximate
unlearning for SGD. From this analysis, we first derive an easy-to-compute
proxy for verification error (termed unlearning error). The analysis also
informs the design of a new training objective penalty that limits the overall
change in weights during SGD and as a result facilitates approximate unlearning
with lower verification error. We validate our theoretical work through an
empirical evaluation on learning with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and IMDB sentiment
analysis.

outcome-to-outcome interference in linear two-sibling FE models. We regress a
gain-score--the difference between siblings' continuous outcomes--on both
siblings' treatments and on a pre-treatment observed FE. Under certain
restrictions, the observed FE's partial regression coefficient signals the
presence of outcome-to-outcome interference. Monte Carlo simulations
demonstrated the robustness test under several models. We found that an
observed FE signaled outcome-to-outcome spillover if it was directly associated
with an sibling-invariant confounder of treatments and outcomes, directly
associated with a sibling's treatment, or directly and equally associated with
both siblings' outcomes. However, the robustness test collapsed if the observed
FE was directly but differentially associated with siblings' outcomes or if
outcomes affected siblings' treatments.

part of the surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory that has a spacing
of 750~m. An inflection of the spectrum is observed, confirming the presence of
the so-called \emph{second-knee} feature. The spectrum is then combined with
that of the 1500\,m array to produce a single measurement of the flux, linking
this spectral feature with the three additional breaks at the highest energies.
The combined spectrum, with an energy scale set calorimetrically via
fluorescence telescopes and using a single detector type, results in the most
statistically and systematically precise measurement of spectral breaks yet
obtained. These measurements are critical for furthering our understanding of
the highest energy cosmic rays.

binaries with orbital periods of $P_{\mathrm{orb}} \approx 5-70$ minutes. We
focus on the cases where the donor starts as a $M_{\mathrm{He}} < 0.2 \,
M_{\odot}$ Helium WD and the accretor is a $M_{\mathrm{WD}} > 0.6 \, M_{\odot}$
WD. Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we
simultaneously evolve both WDs assuming conservative mass transfer and angular
momentum loss from gravitational radiation. This self-consistent evolution
yields the important feedback of the properties of the donor on the mass
transfer rate, $\dot{M}$, as well as the thermal evolution of the accreting WD.
Consistent with earlier work, we find that the high $\dot{M}$'s at early times
forces an adiabatic evolution of the donor for $P_{\mathrm{orb}} < 30$ minutes
so that its mass-radius relation depends primarily on its initial entropy. As
the donor reaches $ M_{\mathrm{He}} \approx 0.02-0.03 \, M_{\odot}$ at
$P_{\mathrm{orb}} \simeq 30 $ minutes, it becomes fully convective and could
lose entropy and expand much less than expected under further mass loss.
However, we show that the lack of reliable opacities for the donor's surface
inhibit a secure prediction for this possible cooling. Our calculations capture
the core heating that occurs during the first $\approx 10^7$ years of accretion
and continue the evolution into the phase of WD cooling that follows. When
compared to existing data for accreting WDs, as seen by Cheng and collaborators
for isolated WDs, we also find that the accreting WDs are not as cool as we
would expect given the amount of time they have had to cool.

are structurally stable at low operating temperatures; however, material
polycrystallinity, absorption, and reactive operating conditions have so far
prevented verifying this assumption by nano resolved in-situ structure
measurements. Here, in an archetypal PCC BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-d the premise of
structural stability is demonstrated to be inaccurate at temperatures as low as
200 {\deg}C. Coherent X-ray diffraction on a nanostructured BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-d

structural rearrangements correlate with dynamic inhomogeneities of the lattice
constant within the grains, showing potential heterogeneous H+ transport. Our
results elucidate the mechanisms behind PCCs structural degradation, overturn
existing assumptions about the structure dynamics in PCCs, and fill a method

One means of gaining information about the evolutionary status and physical
nature of LBVs is studying their environments. We investigated the stellar
content within ~100 pc of HR Car and also its circumstellar nebula. Very Large
Telescope (VLT) Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of a

classification for stars with magnitudes of V > 13 mag. Eight B0 to B9 stars

region with a radius of r =1.2 degree (~100 pc at a distance of 4.8 kpc) around
HR Car, existing catalogs list several late O-type and early B-type stars, but
only one early O-type star. Given the relatively low stellar and nebular masses
in the HR Car system, no early O-type stars and only a few late O-type stars
would be expected in association with HR Car. Instead, HR Car's location in a

moving group with a population of B-type stars in a spiral arm, and it has not
received a strong kick from a supernova explosion of a companion star or a

both on the vertical motion within the eddying flow and varies nonlinearly with
the growth rate of the phytoplankton itself. Flux is maximized when the growth
rate matches the inverse of the decorrelation timescale for vertical motion.
Using a three-dimensional ocean model and a linear nutrient uptake model, we
find that phytoplankton productivity is maximized for a growth rate of 1/3
day$^{-1}$, which corresponds to the timescale of submesoscale dynamics.
Variability in the frequency of vertical motion across different physical
features of the flow favors phytoplankton production with different growth
rates. Such a growth-transport feedback can generate diversity in the

m-step rollout, approximate DP may not converge, (ii) both lookahead and m-step
rollout improve the convergence rate of approximate DP, and (iii) lookahead
helps mitigate the effect of function approximation and the discount factor on
the asymptotic performance of the algorithm. Our results are presented for two

function approximation and another which performs several steps of gradient

reliably discover keypoints of aligned instances. However, when the target
instances have high viewpoint or appearance variation, the discovered keypoints
do not match the semantic correspondences over different images. Our work aims
to discover keypoints even when the target instances have high viewpoint and
appearance variation by using image-level supervision. Motivated by the
weakly-supervised learning approach, our method exploits image-level
supervision to identify discriminative parts and infer the viewpoint of the
target instance. To discover diverse parts, we adopt a conditional image
generation approach using a pair of images with structural deformation.
Finally, we enforce a viewpoint-based equivariance constraint using the
keypoints from the image-level supervision to resolve the spatial correlation
problem that consistently appears in the images taken from various viewpoints.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for the task of keypoint
estimation on the limited supervision scenarios. Furthermore, the discovered
keypoints are directly applicable to downstream tasks without requiring any

solar cycle. Based on this model, we further investigated the effects of the

results proved: 1) Sample balance is critical for the stability of the CNN
model. The augmented data generated by GAN effectively improved the stability
of the forecast model. 2) For C-class, M-class, and X-class flare forecasting

airlines, but also for passengers and airports. Group boarding is a popular
boarding strategy that separates the passengers into several groups and those
groups, which are then called in a certain order. Group boarding can reduce the
boarding time compared with that in random order boarding; however, it is
insufficient in several real scenarios because the passengers are not separated
strictly into groups. In this paper, we propose a boarding strategy that
arranges the order of the boarding passengers at the boarding gate. Although
this approach appears more time-consuming, we show that such a rearrangement
can be applied efficiently to the waiting queue of a single-aisle aircraft. We
quantitatively demonstrate the boarding times for various patterns of this

This strategy is a promising approach to reduce boarding times and can replace

uncertainties that may cause solution values to change during implementation.
This type of uncertainty, termed implementation uncertainty, is modeled
explicitly affecting the decision variables rather than model parameters. The
binary nature of the decision variables invalidates the use of the existing
models for this type of uncertainty. The robust solutions obtained are optimal
for a worst-case min-max objective and allow a controlled degree of
infeasibility with respect to the associated deterministic problem. Structural
properties are used to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear binary
program. The degree of solution conservatism is controlled by combining both
constraint relaxation and cardinality-constrained parameters. Solutions for
optimization problems under implementation uncertainty consist of a set of
robust solutions; the selection of solutions from this possibly large set is
formulated as an optimization problem over the robust set. Results from an
experimental study in the context of the knapsack problem suggest the
methodology yields solutions that perform well in terms of objective value and
feasibility. Furthermore, the selection approach can identify robust solutions

applications. Ultrafast transient reflectance (TR) and photocurrent (PC)
spectroscopies are combined with ab initio density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to investigate the band structure and photoresponse of a layered
magnetic semiconductor CrSiTe3 (CST) nanosheet in the paramagnetic (PM, 300K)
and ferromagnetic (FM, 10 K) phases. We observe both a decrease of the direct
bandgap and emergence of a 120 meV splitting of the optical transition when the
FM phase is present. DFT band structure calculations suggest that the band
modifications are driven by a FM ordering-induced band splitting between the Te
p and the Cr d states at the valence and conduction band edges. We find that
the majority of carriers photoexcited at the direct gap recombine within
picoseconds through defect-mediated recombination, but that 2-3 % of the
electrons scatter into indirect conduction band valleys resulting in very
long-lived electrons and holes. Those long-lived carriers contribute to the
broadband PC response of CST devices that also features indirect absorption.
These results provide critical insights into the dynamics and energy landscape
of photoexcited electrons and holes, and how they are impacted by spin-ordering
effects in layered ferromagnets.

  Graphs","13 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dynamic graph embedding has gained great attention recently due to its
capability of learning low dimensional graph representations for complex
temporal graphs with high accuracy. However, recent advances mostly focus on
learning node embeddings as deterministic ""vectors"" for static graphs yet
disregarding the key graph temporal dynamics and the evolving uncertainties
associated with node embedding in the latent space. In this work, we propose an
efficient stochastic dynamic graph embedding method (DynG2G) that applies an
inductive feed-forward encoder trained with node triplet-based contrastive
loss. Every node per timestamp is encoded as a time-dependent probabilistic
multivariate Gaussian distribution in the latent space, hence we can quantify
the node embedding uncertainty on-the-fly. We adopted eight different
benchmarks that represent diversity in size (from 96 nodes to 87,626 and from
13,398 edges to 4,870,863) and diversity in dynamics. We demonstrate via
extensive experiments on these eight dynamic graph benchmarks that DynG2G
achieves new state-of-the-art performance in capturing the underlying temporal
node embeddings. We also demonstrate that DynG2G can predict the evolving node
embedding uncertainty, which plays a crucial role in quantifying the intrinsic
dimensionality of the dynamical system over time. We obtain a universal
relation of the optimal embedding dimension, $L_o$, versus the effective
dimensionality of uncertainty, $D_u$, and we infer that $L_o=D_u$ for all
cases. This implies that the uncertainty quantification approach we employ in
the DynG2G correctly captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the dynamics of
such evolving graphs despite the diverse nature and composition of the graphs
at each timestamp. Moreover, this $L_0 - D_u$ correlation provides a clear path
to select adaptively the optimum embedding size at each timestamp by setting $L
\ge D_u$.

optimize operations between energy supply and demand. Recently, the propagation
of sensors and smart meters has produced an enormous volume of data, which
supports the development of data based PVPG forecasting. Although emerging deep
learning (DL) models, such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, based on
historical data, have provided effective solutions for PVPG forecasting with
great successes, these models utilize offline learning. As a result, DL models
cannot take advantage of the opportunity to learn from newly-arrived data, and
are unable to handle concept drift caused by installing extra PV units and
unforeseen PV unit failures. Consequently, to improve day-ahead PVPG
forecasting accuracy, as well as eliminate the impacts of concept drift, this
paper proposes an adaptive LSTM (AD-LSTM) model, which is a DL framework that
can not only acquire general knowledge from historical data, but also
dynamically learn specific knowledge from newly-arrived data. A two-phase
adaptive learning strategy (TP-ALS) is integrated into AD-LSTM, and a sliding
window (SDWIN) algorithm is proposed, to detect concept drift in PV systems.
Multiple datasets from PV systems are utilized to assess the feasibility and
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The developed AD-LSTM model
demonstrates greater forecasting capability than the offline LSTM model,
particularly in the presence of concept drift. Additionally, the proposed
AD-LSTM model also achieves superior performance in terms of day-ahead PVPG
forecasting compared to other traditional machine learning models and
statistical models in the literature.

proposed method embeds the time index and the original measurements into a

of atoms by neutrinos and antineutrinos. Most existing calculations are based
on modifications of the free electron differential cross section, which destroy
the relationship between the neutrino helicities and the orbital and spin
angular momenta of the atomic electrons. The present calculations maintain the
full collision dynamics by formulating the scattering in configuration space
using the Bound Interaction Picture, rather than the usual formulation in the
Interaction Picture in momentum space as appropriate to scattering by free
electrons. Energy spectra of ionization electrons produced by scattering of
neutrinos and antineutrinos with energies of 5, 10, 20, and 30 keV by hydrogen,
helium and neon have been calculated using Dirac central field eigenfunctions
and are presented as ratios to the spectra for scattering by free electrons.
Binding effects increase strongly with atomic number, are largest for low
neutrino energy and, for each neutrino energy, greatest at the high electron
energy end of the spectrum. The most extreme effects of binding are for 5 keV
scattering by Ne where the ratios are less than 0.1. The energy spectra are
calculated for both a Coulombic final electron state and a free final electron
state. The results indicate that the binding effects from the continuum state
of the final electron are significant and can be comparable to those arising
from the bound initial electron state.

  Learning with Siamese Networks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Event cameras are novel sensors that perceive the per-pixel intensity changes
and output asynchronous event streams, showing lots of advantages over
traditional cameras, such as high dynamic range (HDR) and no motion blur. It
has been shown that events alone can be used for object tracking by motion
compensation or prediction. However, existing methods assume that the target
always moves and is the stand-alone object. Moreover, they fail to track the
stopped non-independent moving objects on fixed scenes. In this paper, we
propose a novel event-based object tracking framework, called SiamEvent, using
Siamese networks via edge-aware similarity learning. Importantly, to find the
part having the most similar edge structure of target, we propose to correlate
the embedded events at two timestamps to compute the target edge similarity.
The Siamese network enables tracking arbitrary target edge by finding the part
with the highest similarity score. This extends the possibility of event-based
object tracking applied not only for the independent stand-alone moving
objects, but also for various settings of the camera and scenes. In addition,
target edge initialization and edge detector are also proposed to prevent
SiamEvent from the drifting problem. Lastly, we built an open dataset including
various synthetic and real scenes to train and evaluate SiamEvent. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SiamEvent achieves up to 15% tracking performance
enhancement than the baselines on the real-world scenes and more robust
tracking performance in the challenging HDR and motion blur conditions.

employ a series of exploratory experiments to verify that neither high-strength

conjecture that the performance of DARTS does not depend on the well-trained
supernet weights and argue that the architecture parameters should be trained
by the gradients which are obtained in the early stage rather than the final
stage of training. This argument is then verified by exchanging the learning
rate schemes of weights and parameters. Experimental results show that the
simple swap of the learning rates can effectively solve the degradation and
achieve competitive performance. Further empirical evidence suggests that the
degradation is not a simple problem of the validation set overfitting but
exhibit some links between the degradation and the operation selection bias

effectiveness of FRBs as a probe of AGN feedback, we analysed three different
AGN models from the EAGLE simulation series. We measured the mean DM-redshift
relation, and the scatter around it, using $2.56 \times 10^8$ sightlines at 131
redshift ($z$) bins between $0 \leq z \leq 3$. While the DM-redshift relation
itself is highly robust against different AGN feedback models, significant
differences are detected in the scatter around the mean: weaker feedback leads
to more scatter. We find $\sim 10^4$ localised FRBs are needed to discriminate
between the scatter in standard feedback and stronger, more intermittent
feedback models. The number of FRBs required is dependent on the redshift
distribution of the detected population. A log-normal redshift distribution at

Graph Convolution Network works as a deep learning paradigm which works on
graphs. Our proposed framework deals with limited amount of labelled data; we
go for a semi-supervised learning method. We come up with a semi-supervised
fake news detection technique based on GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks). The
recommended architecture comprises of three basic components: collecting word
embeddings from the news articles in datasets utilising GloVe, building
similarity graph using Word Movers Distance (WMD) and finally applying Graph
Convolution Network (GCN) for binary classification of news articles in
semi-supervised paradigm. The implemented technique is validated on three
different datasets by varying the volume of labelled data achieving 95.27 %
highest accuracy on Real or Fake dataset. Comparison with other contemporary
techniques also reinforced the supremacy of the proposed framework.

the spectral bands comparable to those used for remote-sensing observations is
important for characterizing the collected samples and examining how
representative the sample is compared with spacecraft observations of Ryugu as
a whole. In this study, we constructed a multiband microscopic camera system
that enables both visual multispectral imaging at 390 (ul), 475 (b), 550 (v),
590 (Na), 700 (w), and 850 nm (x), and three-dimensional (3D) shape
reconstruction of individual grain samples based on stereo imaging. The imaging
system yields the images of 4096 x 2160 pixels with the pixel resolution of
1.93 {\mu}m/pix and field of view of 7.9 x 4.2 mm. Our validation measurements
demonstrate that our multispectral imaging system, which observes the samples

navigation camera (ONC-T) on Hayabusa2, yields reflectance spectra with a
relative error of 3% and a 3D model with an error of 5%. These results indicate

The average spectra of the measured Ryugu samples were flat and consistent with
the global averaged spectrum of Ryugu. The 550-nm band (v-band) reflectance of
the returned grains in the dishes was 2.4% on average, higher than that of the

universal computation. Diagonal gates such as the transversal $T$ gate play an
important role in implementing a universal set of quantum operations. This
paper introduces a framework that describes the process of preparing a code
state, applying a diagonal physical gate, measuring a code syndrome, and
applying a Pauli correction that may depend on the measured syndrome (the
average logical channel induced by an arbitrary diagonal gate). It focuses on
CSS codes, and describes the interaction of code states and physical gates in
terms of generator coefficients determined by the induced logical operator. The
interaction of code states and diagonal gates depends very strongly on the
signs of $Z$-stabilizers in the CSS code, and the proposed generator
coefficient framework explicitly includes this degree of freedom. The paper
derives necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary diagonal gate to
preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, and provides an explicit
expression of the induced logical operator. When the diagonal gate is a
quadratic form diagonal gate (introduced by Rengaswamy et al.), the conditions
can be expressed in terms of divisibility of weights in the two classical codes
that determine the CSS code. These codes find application in magic state
distillation and elsewhere. When all the signs are positive, the paper
characterizes all possible CSS codes, invariant under transversal $Z$-rotation
through $\pi/2^l$, that are constructed from classical Reed-Muller codes by
deriving the necessary and sufficient constraints on $l$. The generator
coefficient framework extends to arbitrary stabilizer codes but there is
nothing to be gained by considering the more general class of non-degenerate
stabilizer codes.

In the uniform bilayer Holstein model, charge density wave (CDW) order
dominates at small interlayer hybridization $t_3$, but decreases and eventually
vanishes as $t_3$ grows, providing a charge analog of singlet (spin liquid)
physics. In the interface case, we show that CDW order penetrates into the
metal layer and forms long-range CDW order at intermediate ratio of inter- to
intra-layer hopping strengths, $1.4 \lesssim t_3/t \lesssim 3.4$. This is
consistent with the occurrence of an ""orbitally selective CDW"" regime at weak

deep-learning-based approach for metal artifact reduction (MAR). In order to
alleviate the need for anatomically identical CT image pairs (i.e., metal
artifact-corrupted CT image and metal artifact-free CT image) for network
learning, we propose a self-supervised cross-domain learning framework.
Specifically, we train a neural network to restore the metal trace region
values in the given metal-free sinogram, where the metal trace is identified by
the forward projection of metal masks. We then design a novel FBP
reconstruction loss to encourage the network to generate more perfect
completion results and a residual-learning-based image refinement module to
reduce the secondary artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. To preserve the
fine structure details and fidelity of the final MAR image, instead of directly
adopting CNN-refined images as output, we incorporate the metal trace
replacement into our framework and replace the metal-affected projections of
the original sinogram with the prior sinogram generated by the forward
projection of the CNN output. We then use the filtered backward projection
(FBP) algorithms for final MAR image reconstruction. We conduct an extensive
evaluation on simulated and real artifact data to show the effectiveness of our
design. Our method produces superior MAR results and outperforms other
compelling methods. We also demonstrate the potential of our framework for
other organ sites.

  In six of the sixteen classes we find the familiar power-law behaviour, so
that the coefficients behave like $s_n \sim C \cdot \mu^n \cdot n^g,$ while in
the remaining ten cases we find a stretched exponential as the most likely
sub-dominant term, so that the coefficients behave like $s_n \sim C \cdot \mu^n

log-convexity, which can be used to provide quite strong rigorous lower bounds.
  Stronger bounds still can be established under plausible monotonicity

For the first time, we investigate the size evolution of planets via both giant
impacts and photoevaporation to compare with these observed features. We
calculate the size of a protoplanet, which is the sum of its core and envelope
sizes, by analytical models. $N$-body simulations are performed to evolve
planet sizes during the giant impact phase with envelope stripping via impact
shocks. We consider the initial radial profile of the core mass and the initial
envelope mass fractions as parameters. Inner planets can lose their whole
envelopes via giant impacts, while outer planets can keep their initial
envelopes since they do not experience giant impacts. Photoevaporation is
simulated to evolve planet sizes afterward. Our results suggest that the
period-radius distribution of the observed planets would be reproduced if we
perform simulations in which the initial radial profile of the core mass
follows a wide range of power-law distributions and the initial envelope mass
fractions are $\sim0.1$. Moreover, our model shows that the adjacent planetary

(ALPACA) is an international experiment that applies southern very-high-energy

consists of an air shower (AS) array with a surface of $83, 000\, {\rm m}^2$
and an underground water Cherenkov muon detector (MD) array covering $5, 400\,
{\rm m}^2$. The experimental site is at the Mt. Chacaltaya plateau in La Paz,
Bolivia, with an altitude of $4, 740\, {\rm m}$ corresponding to $572\, {\rm

the ALPAQUITA experiment aims to begin data acquisition in late 2021. The
ALPAQUITA array consists of a smaller AS array ($18, 450\, {\rm m}^2$) and
underground MD ($900\, {\rm m}^2$), which are now under construction.
ALPAQUITA's sensitivity to gamma-ray sources is evaluated with Monte Carlo
simulations. The simulation finds that five gamma-ray sources observed by
H.E.S.S. and HAWC experiments will be detected by ALPAQUITA beyond 10 TeV and
one out of these five - HESS J1702-420A - above 300 TeV in one calendar year

  in Serverless Computing","Accepted by NSDI'23",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Serverless applications are typically composed of function workflows in which
multiple short-lived functions are triggered to exchange data in response to
events or state changes. Current serverless platforms coordinate and trigger
functions by following high-level invocation dependencies but are oblivious to
the underlying data exchanges between functions. This design is neither
efficient nor easy to use in orchestrating complex workflows -- developers
often have to manage complex function interactions by themselves, with
customized implementation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we
argue that function orchestration should follow a data-centric approach. In our
design, the platform provides a data bucket abstraction to hold the
intermediate data generated by functions. Developers can use a rich set of data
trigger primitives to control when and how the output of each function should
be passed to the next functions in a workflow. By making data consumption
explicit and allowing it to trigger functions and drive the workflow, complex
function interactions can be easily and efficiently supported. We present
Pheromone -- a scalable, low-latency serverless platform following this
data-centric design. Compared to well-established commercial and open-source
platforms, Pheromone cuts the latencies of function interactions and data
exchanges by orders of magnitude, scales to large workflows, and enables easy
implementation of complex applications.

  Cooperation","AI Ethics (2022)",,"10.1007/s43681-022-00238-5",,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This position paper highlights an ethic of machine-to-machine cooperation and
machine pro-sociality, and argues that machines capable of autonomous sensing,
decision-making and action, such as automated vehicles and urban robots, owned
and used by different self-interested parties, and having their own agendas (or
interests of their owners) should be designed and built to be cooperative in
their behaviours, especially if they share public spaces. That is, by design,
the machine should first cooperate, and then only consider alternatives if
there are problems. It is argued that being cooperative is not only important
for their improved functioning, especially, when they use shared resources
(e.g., parking spaces, public roads, curbside space and walkways), but also as
a favourable requirement analogous to how humans cooperating with other humans
can be advantageous and often viewed favourably. The usefulness of such
machine-to-machine cooperation are illustrated via examples including
cooperative crowdsourcing, cooperative traffic routing and parking as well as
futuristic scenarios involving urban robots for delivery and shopping. It is
argued that just as privacy-by-design and security-by-design are important
considerations, in order to yield systems that fulfil ethical requirements,
cooperative-by-design should also be an imperative for autonomous systems that
are separately owned but co-inhabit the same spaces and use common resources.
If a machine using shared public spaces is not cooperative, as one might
expect, then it is not only anti-social but not behaving ethically. It is also
proposed that certification for urban robots that operate in public could be
explored.

  autoencoder-based source separation algorithm for determined mixtures","submit to IEEE/ACM TASLP, under review",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new source model and training scheme to improve the
accuracy and speed of the multichannel variational autoencoder (MVAE) method.
The MVAE method is a recently proposed powerful multichannel source separation
method. It consists of pretraining a source model represented by a conditional
VAE (CVAE) and then estimating separation matrices along with other unknown
parameters so that the log-likelihood is non-decreasing given an observed
mixture signal. Although the MVAE method has been shown to provide high source
separation performance, one drawback is the computational cost of the
backpropagation steps in the separation-matrix estimation algorithm. To
overcome this drawback, a method called ""FastMVAE"" was subsequently proposed,
which uses an auxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE) to train the source model. By
using the classifier and encoder trained in this way, the optimal parameters of
the source model can be inferred efficiently, albeit approximately, in each
step of the algorithm. However, the generalization capability of the trained
ACVAE source model was not satisfactory, which led to poor performance in
situations with unseen data. To improve the generalization capability, this
paper proposes a new model architecture (called the ""ChimeraACVAE"" model) and a
training scheme based on knowledge distillation. The experimental results
revealed that the proposed source model trained with the proposed loss function
achieved better source separation performance with less computation time than
FastMVAE. We also confirmed that our methods were able to separate 18 sources
with a reasonably good accuracy.

determine the aggregation strength from intra-frame neighbors in space, and
(ii) similarity relations that indicate the transition probability of

contrastive learning objective discriminates dynamic objects from both their
neighboring views and temporal views. Compared with prior works, our approach
actively explores the neighbor relations of central instances to learn a latent
association between center-neighbor pairs (e.g., ""hand -- arm"") across time,
thus improving the instance discrimination. Without fine-tuning, our learned
representation outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on a
variety of visual tasks including video object propagation, part propagation,

radiation. Various nonreciprocal emitters have been proposed to break the
balance between absorption and emission. However, the thicknesses of the
nonreciprocal materials are usually larger than 1/10 times of the wavelength.
Besides, the previous proposed nonreciprocal emitters are complex, thus they
can hardly be fabricated in experiment to verify the Kirchhoff s law for
nonreciprocal materials. In this paper, we investigate the nonreciprocal
thermal radiation of the magnetic Weyl semimetal (MWSM) film atop of the metal
substrate. It is found that the strong nonreciprocal radiation at the
wavelength of 9.15 {\mu}m can be achieved when the thickness of the MWSM film
is 100 nm. The enhanced nonreciprocity is attributed to the Fabry-Perot
resonances. The results indicate that the MWSM film is the promising candidate
to engineer the ultrathin and simple nonreciprocal thermal emitters. What is
perhaps most intriguing here is that the proposed structure can be more easily
fabricated in experiment to verify the Kirchhoff s law for nonreciprocal

conversion rate with six response functions, each of which, in principle, is
observable by varying nuclear properties of targets. We construct a
nucleon-level nonrelativistic effective theory (NRET) to clarify the
microscopic origin of these response functions and to relate rate measurements

parameters that control the NRET operator expansion. We note inconsistencies in
past treatments of these parameters. The NRET is technically challenging,
involving 16 operators, several distorted electron partial waves, bound muon
upper and lower components, and an exclusive nuclear matrix element. We
introduce a trick for treating the electron Coulomb effects accurately, which
enables us to include all of these effects while producing transition densities
whose one-body matrix elements can be evaluated analytically, greatly
simplifying the nuclear physics. We derive bounds on operator coefficients from
existing and anticipated $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion experiments. We discuss
how similar NRET formulations have impacted dark matter phenomenology, noting

superconductors (SCs). This intriguing possibility motivates us to unveil the
first pathway to engineer topological superconductivity by harnessing the
interplay of charge Chern insulators (CIs) and conventional SCs. We here
identify under which conditions a pyramidal SC/CI/SC heterostructure induces an
effective 1D spinless p-wave SC that allows pinning Majorana zero modes (MZMs)
at termination edges and domain walls. As we reveal, such a MZM track is
controlled by the phase difference of the two SCs involved and additional
magnetic fields which are required for generating Rashba-like spin-orbit
coupling. Further, we show that a SC/CI/SC/CI/SC double-pyramidal hybrid
defines a double MZM track, in which braiding occurs by varying the two
superconducting phase differences in space and adiabatically in time. Given the
geometry of the MZM racetrack, we propose to employ the time-averaged
quadrupolar differential conductance to confirm the here-termed MZM track
exchange process which is pivotal for braiding. In addition, we identify
experimental knobs which enable the fusion of MZM pairs, and the detection of
the underlying non-Abelian topological order and twofold many-body ground state
degeneracy by encoding it in a topological invariant.

observations of the far-infrared-bright galaxy PKS0023-26, which hosts a young
radio source and a luminous optical AGN. Although young, the powerful radio
source has grown to a size of a few kpc, making it capable of affecting the ISM
of the host galaxy. We detect an extended distribution of molecular gas with a
mass between 0.3 and 3x10^10 Msun, depending on the CO conversion factor. The
gas has a maximum extent of ~24 kpc and is distributed asymmetrically wrt the
radio galaxy. Overall, the observed properties are reminiscent of molecular
structures observed in some galaxy clusters. However, in the inner few kpc, the
kinematics of the gas appears to be affected by the radio source. In the
central regions we observe the brightest emission and the broadest profiles
(FWZI ~ 500 km/s), which indicate a direct interaction of the jet with dense
clouds. On larger scales, the molecular gas appears to avoid the radio lobes
and gas with smaller velocity dispersion (FWZI ~350 km/s) is observed around
the them. There, the gas appears to be affected by the expanding cocoon
surrounding the radio source, dispersing and heating preexisting molecular
clouds. The data suggest that the mode of coupling between radio jets and ISM
changes from an outflowing phase in the inner regions to a maintenance phase at
larger radii. This reveals that on galaxy scales the impact of the AGN is not
limited to outflows. With a star-formation rate of 25 Msun/yr, PKS0023-26 is
located on the SFR-M* relation for star forming galaxies. The AGN does not
appear to have, at present, a major impact on the overall level of star
formation of the host galaxy. However, as the jet and lobes expand throughout
the galaxy, they will carry enough energy to prevent further gas cooling and/or
to inject turbulence and affect future star formation.

massive labeled data are required for model training. However, a difficulty of
implementing this in real industries hinders the application of these methods.
Hence, an effective diagnostic approach that can work well in such situation is
urgently needed.In this study, a multi-stage semi-supervised improved deep
embedded clustering (MS-SSIDEC) method, which combines semi-supervised learning
with improved deep embedded clustering (IDEC), is proposed to jointly explore
scarce labeled data and massive unlabeled data. In the first stage, a
skip-connection-based convolutional auto-encoder (SCCAE) that can automatically
map the unlabeled data into a low-dimensional feature space is proposed and
pre-trained to be a fault feature extractor. In the second stage, a
semi-supervised improved deep embedded clustering (SSIDEC) network is proposed
for clustering. It is first initialized with available labeled data and then
used to simultaneously optimize the clustering label assignment and make the
feature space to be more clustering-friendly. To tackle the phenomenon of
overfitting, virtual adversarial training (VAT) is introduced as a
regularization term in this stage. In the third stage, pseudo labels are
obtained by the high-quality results of SSIDEC. The labeled dataset can be
augmented by these pseudo-labeled data and then leveraged to train a bearing
fault diagnosis model. Two public datasets of vibration data from rolling
bearings are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves a promising
performance in both semi-supervised and unsupervised fault diagnosis tasks.
This method provides a new approach for fault diagnosis under the situation of
limited labeled samples by effectively exploring unsupervised data.

convolution process to derive user and micro-video representations: warm-up
propagation, graph denoising and preference refinement. A heterogeneous
tripartite graph is constructed by connecting user nodes with video nodes, and
video nodes with associated concept nodes, extracted from captions and comments

user-oriented graph denoising phase to extract a subgraph which can better
reflect the user's preference. Despite the main focus of micro-video
recommendation in this paper, we also show that our method can be generalized
to other types of tasks. Therefore, we also conduct empirical studies on a

proposed CONDE achieves significantly better recommendation performance than

confirming unambiguously the existence of flat electronic bands in tMBG. The
bandwidth of this flat-band peak is found to be slightly narrower than that of
the tBG, validating previous theoretical predictions. Remarkably, by measuring
spatially resolved spectroscopy, combined with continuum model calculation, we
show that the flat-band states in tMBG exhibit a unique layer-resolved

Lett. {\bf 12},1702 (2021)]. We assumed spherical ions with different
diameters, and implicit solvent inducing strong, short-range attraction between
ions of the same sign. For this highly simplified model, we calculated
correlation functions. Our results indicate that mesoscopic inhomogeneities can
occur when the sum of the Coulomb and the water-mediated interactions between
like ions is attractive at short- and repulsive at large distances. We adjusted
the attractive part of the potential to the water-in-LiTFSI electrolyte, and
obtained both the period and the decay rate of the correlations in a
semiquantitative agreement with the experiment. In particular, the decay length
of the correlations increases nearly linearly with the volume fraction of ions.

few-shot learning tasks, mostly owing to the sophisticated design of templates
and label words. However, when applied to token-level labeling tasks such as
NER, it would be time-consuming to enumerate the template queries over all
potential entity spans. In this work, we propose a more elegant method to
reformulate NER tasks as LM problems without any templates. Specifically, we
discard the template construction process while maintaining the word prediction
paradigm of pre-training models to predict a class-related pivot word (or label
word) at the entity position. Meanwhile, we also explore principled ways to
automatically search for appropriate label words that the pre-trained models
can easily adapt to. While avoiding complicated template-based process, the
proposed LM objective also reduces the gap between different objectives used in
pre-training and fine-tuning, thus it can better benefit the few-shot
performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method over bert-tagger and template-based method under few-shot setting.
Moreover, the decoding speed of the proposed method is up to 1930.12 times
faster than the template-based method.

valley points. We propose a possible way to realize anomalous valley Hall
effect in monolayer $\mathrm{GdCl_2}$ by piezoelectric effect, not an external

phenomenon could be classified as piezo-valleytronics, being similar to
piezotronics and piezophototronics. The only independent piezoelectric strain

convenient for people to draw sketches on screen. This results in the demand
for automatically understanding the sketches. Thus, the sketch recognition task
becomes more significant than before. To accomplish this task, it is necessary
to solve the critical issue of improving the distinction of the sketch
features. To this end, we have made efforts in three aspects. First, a novel
multi-scale residual block is designed. Compared with the conventional basic
residual block, it can better perceive multi-scale information and reduce the
number of parameters during training. Second, a hierarchical residual structure
is built by stacking multi-scale residual blocks in a specific way. In contrast
with the single-level residual structure, the learned features from this
structure are more sufficient. Last but not least, the compact triplet-center
loss is proposed specifically for the sketch recognition task. It can solve the
problem that the triplet-center loss does not fully consider too large
intra-class space and too small inter-class space in sketch field. By studying
the above modules, a hierarchical residual network as a whole is proposed for
sketch recognition and evaluated on Tu-Berlin benchmark thoroughly. The
experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms most of

existing works leverage the social relationship to aggregate user features from

significant defect of the indirect paradigm is that it ignores the temporal
relationships between behavior events across users. In this paper, we propose a
novel time-aware sequential recommendation framework called Social Temporal

the fine-grained impact of friends' behaviors on the user s dynamic interests
in an event-level direct paradigm. Moreover, we propose to decompose the

embedding layer to refine user representation via structural information. To
enhance temporal information propagation, STEN directly extracts the
fine-grained temporal mutual influence of friends' behaviors through the
mutually exciting temporal network. Besides, the user s dynamic interests are
captured through the self-exciting temporal network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets show that STEN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline

the nanoscale thermal transport. Because phonons have a large spread in their
properties, the non-gray (i.e. considering different phonon bands) phonon BTE
is needed to accurately capture the nanoscale transport phenomena. However, BTE
solvers generally require large computational cost. Non-gray modeling imposes
significant additional complexity to the numerical simulations, which hinders
the modeling of real nanoscale systems. In this work, we address this issue by
a systematic investigation on the phonon band discretization scheme using real
material properties of four representative materials, including silicon,
gallium arsenide, diamond, and lead telluride. We find that the schemes used in
previous studies require at least a few tens of bands to ensure the accuracy,
which requires large computational costs. We then propose an improved band
discretization scheme, in which we divide the mean free path domain into two
subdomains, one on either side of the inflection point of the mean free path
accumulated thermal conductivity and adopt the Gauss-Legendre quadrature for
each subdomain. With this scheme, the solution of phonon BTE converges (error <
1%) with less than 10 phonon bands for all these materials. The proposed scheme
allows to significantly reduce the time and memory consumption of the numerical
BTE solver, which is an important step towards large-scale phonon BTE
simulation for real materials.

comprehension makes scientifically sound reasoning about their influence
difficult. We conduct the first empirical evaluation, a correlational study

answering comprehension questions on code snippets. We found that personality
traits are unlikely to impact code comprehension performance, at least not

intelligence, significant small to moderate positive effects on code

intelligence has a positive but statistically insignificant effect on code

opportunity to sanction defectors, classical behavioral experiments suggest
that cooperation can take root. Overlooked from standard experimental designs,
however, is the fact that real-world human punishment -- the administration of
justice -- is intrinsically noisy. Here we show that stochastic punishment
falls short of sustaining cooperation in the repeated public good game. As
punishment noise increases, we find that contributions decrease and punishment
efforts intensify, resulting in a $45\%$ drop in gains compared to a noiseless
control. Moreover, we observe that uncertainty causes a rise in antisocial

convection in a liquid metal with a Prandtl number of 0.03 located inside a box
with a square base area and an aspect ratio of five. Experiments and numerical
simulations are focused on the moderate Rayleigh number range, where a new
cellular flow regime has been reported by a previous study (Akashi et al.,
Phys. Rev. Fluids, vol.4, 2019, 033501). This flow structure shows symmetries
with respect to the vertical planes crossing at the center of the container.
The dynamic behaviour is dominated by strong three-dimensional oscillations
with a period length that corresponds to the turnover time. Our analysis
reveals that the flow structure in the aspect ratio five box corresponds in key
features to the jump rope vortex structure, which has recently been discovered
in an aspect ratio two cylinder (Vogt et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA,
vol.115, 2018, 12674-12679). While in the cylinder a single jump rope vortex
occurs, the coexistence of four recirculating swirls is detected in this study.
%Their cycling movement is restrained by the limited height of the fluid layer
in the aspect ratio five box. Their approach to the lid or the bottom of the
convection box causes a temporal deceleration of both the horizontal velocity
at the respective boundary and the vertical velocity in the bulk, which in turn
is reflected in Nusselt number oscillations. The cellular flow regime shows
remarkable similarities to properties commonly attributed to turbulent
superstructures

fields have helix-like wave-fronts which tend to zero on-axis where, at focus,
there are large on-axis longitudinal magnetic and electric fields. The
acceleration of electrons by this type of laser pulse is analysed as a function
of radial mode number and it is shown that the radial mode number has a
profound effect on electron acceleration close to the laser axis.Using
three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations a circular-polarized helical
laser beam with power of 0.6 PW is shown to produce several dense attosecond
bunches. The bunch nearest the peak of the laser envelope has an energy of 0.47
GeV with spread as narrow as 10\%, a charge of 26 pC with duration of $\sim
400$ as, and a very low divergence of 20 mrad}. The confinement by longitudinal
magnetic fields in the near-axis region allows the longitudinal electric fields
to accelerate the electrons over a long period after the initial reflection.
Both the longitudinal E and B fields are shown to be essential for electron
acceleration in this scheme. This opens up new paths towards attosecond
electron beams, or attosecond radiation, at many laser facilities around the

For this purpose, we construct a general acoustic regular black hole in the

perspective of finiteness of curvature invariants and completeness of
geodesics. In particular, we find that the acoustic interval not only looks
like a line element of a conformally related black hole in which the fluid
density can be regarded as a conformal factor, but also gives rise to a
non-vanishing partition function which coincides with that of a conformally
related black hole. As an application, we provide a specific acoustic regular
black hole model, investigate its energy conditions and compute its quasinormal
modes. We note that the strong energy condition of our model is violated
completely outside the horizon of the model but remains valid in some regions
inside the horizon, which may give a new insight into the relation between the
regularity and strong energy condition. Moreover, we analyze the oscillating

adiabatic hyperspherical representation is combined with a fully semi-classical

quantified utilizing the Fano profile formula. In particular, a closed form
expression is derived that describes the width of the corresponding Efimov
resonances and the Fano lineshape asymmetry parameter $q$. The profile of
Efimov resonances exhibits a $q-$reversal effect as the inter- and

zero width and are fully decoupled from the three-body and atom-dimer continua,

resolved for large tournaments. Here we investigate to what extent the
conjecture holds for directed graphs in general. In particular, we prove that
the conjecture holds with high probability for the random directed graph
$D_{n,p}$ for a large range of $p$ (thus proving that it holds for most

wavefront manipulation. They find diverse applications ranging from novel
displays to optical and quantum communications. Among commercial SLMs for phase
modulation, Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) offers the smallest pixel size
and, thus, the most precise phase mapping and largest field of view (FOV).
Further pixel miniaturization, however, is not possible in these devices due to
inter-pixel cross-talks, which follow from the high driving voltages needed to
modulate the thick liquid crystal (LC) cells that are necessary for full phase
control. Newly introduced metasurface-based SLMs provide means for pixel
miniaturization by modulating the phase via resonance tuning. These devices,
however, are intrinsically monochromatic, limiting their use in applications
requiring multi-wavelength operation. Here, we introduce a novel design
allowing small pixel and multi-spectral operation. Based on LC-tunable
Fabry-Perot nanocavities engineered to support multiple resonances across the
visible range (including red, green and blue wavelengths), our design provides
continuous 2pi phase modulation with high reflectance at each of the operating
wavelengths. Experimentally, we realize a device with 96 pixels (~1{\mu}m
pitch) that can be individually addressed by electrical biases. Using it, we
first demonstrate multi-spectral programmable beam steering with FOV~18 degrees
and absolute efficiencies exceeding 40%. Then, we reprogram the device to
achieve multi-spectral lensing with tunable focal distance and efficiencies
~27%. Our design paves the way towards a new class of SLM for future
applications in displays, optical computing and beyond.

streaming video as inputs and identifies ongoing actions within them. It is
important to retain past information associated with a current action. However,
long short-term memory (LSTM), a popular recurrent unit for modeling temporal
information from videos, accumulates past information from the previous hidden
and cell states and the extracted visual features at each timestep without
considering the relationships between the past and current information.
Consequently, the forget gate of the original LSTM can lose the accumulated
information relevant to the current action because it determines which
information to forget without considering the current action. We introduce a
novel information elevation unit (IEU) that lifts up and accumulate the past
information relevant to the current action in order to model the past
information that is especially relevant to the current action. To the best of
our knowledge, our IEN is the first attempt that considers the computational
overhead for the practical use of OAD. Through ablation studies, we design an
efficient and effective OAD network using IEUs, called an information elevation
network (IEN). Our IEN uses visual features extracted by a fast action
recognition network taking only RGB frames because extracting optical flows
requires heavy computation overhead. On two OAD benchmark datasets, THUMOS-14

frames. Furthermore, on the THUMOS-14 dataset, our IEN outperforms the
state-of-the-art OAD methods using two-stream features based on RGB frames and

two cases depending on the low pass graph filter's strength. When the graph
filter is strong low pass, i.e., it has a frequency response that drops sharply
at the high frequencies, we show that the principal component analysis (PCA)
method detects central nodes with high accuracy. For general low pass graph
filter, we show that the graph signals can be described by a structured factor
model featuring the product between a low-rank plus sparse factor and an
unstructured factor. We propose a two-stage decomposition algorithm to learn
the structured factor model via a judicious combination of the non-negative
matrix factorization and robust PCA algorithms. We analyze the identifiability

how strong coupling of an optical cavity mode to molecular vibrations affect
the reactivity and how resonance behavior emerges are still under dispute. In
the present work, we approach these mechanistic issues from the perspective of
a thermal model reaction, the inversion of ammonia along the umbrella mode, in
presence of a single cavity mode of varying frequency and coupling strength. A
topological analysis of the related cavity Born-Oppenheimer potential energy
surface in combination with quantum mechanical and transition state theory rate
calculations reveals two quantum effects, leading to decelerated reaction rates
in qualitative agreement with experiments: The stiffening of quantized modes
perpendicular to the reaction path at the transition state, which reduces the
number of thermally accessible reaction channels, and the broadening of the
barrier region which attenuates tunneling. We find these two effects to be very
robust in a fluctuating environment, causing statistical variations of
potential parameters such as the barrier height. Further, by solving the
time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation in the vibrational strong coupling
regime, we identify a resonance behavior, in qualitative agreement with
experimental and earlier theoretical work. The latter manifests as reduced
reaction probability, when the cavity frequency $\omega_c$ is tuned resonant to
a molecular reactant frequency. We find this effect to be based on the
dynamical localization of the vibro-polaritonic wavepacket in the reactant
well.

tends to infinity. In this article, we consider the large volume regime where
the size of the lattice grows to infinity. We first establish an asymptotically
sharp threshold such that the ground states are metastable if and only if the
inverse temperature is larger than the threshold in a suitable sense. Then, we
carry out a detailed analysis of the energy landscape and rigorously establish
the Eyring-Kramers formula when the inverse temperature is sufficiently larger

thanks to the discontinuous nature of the quantum phase transition between the
two phases. We show how to induce the characteristic behavior of the droplet
through the control of the trap potential by using the time-dependent
Gutzwiller simulations in a two-dimensional system. The static and dynamical
properties of the droplet can be described qualitatively by the effective
Ginzburg-Landau field theory with cubic-quintic nonlinearities, where the
attractive cubic nonlinearlity emerges although all the bare interparticle
interactions are repulsive.

infrastructure providers (EIPs) with limited edge resources to support IoT
applications performed in a CDC approach in edge networks, given the additional
computational resources required by CDC. In this paper, we propose coded edge
federation, in which different EIPs collaboratively provide edge resources for
CDC tasks. To study the Nash equilibrium, when no EIP has an incentive to
unilaterally alter its decision on edge resource allocation, we model the coded
edge federation based on evolutionary game theory. Since the replicator
dynamics of the classical evolutionary game are unable to model economic-aware
EIPs which memorize past decisions and utilities, we propose fractional
replicator dynamics with a power-law fading memory via Caputo fractional
derivatives. The proposed dynamics allow us to study a broad spectrum of EIP
dynamic behaviors, such as EIP sensitivity and aggressiveness in strategy
adaptation, which classical replicator dynamics cannot capture. Theoretical
analysis and extensive numerical results justify the existence, uniqueness, and
stability of the equilibrium in the fractional evolutionary game. The influence
of the content and the length of the memory on the rate of convergence is also
investigated.

interplay between two flows separated at a radius $R_J$: a standard accretion
disk (SAD) in the outer parts and a jet-emitting disk (JED) in the inner parts.
In the previous papers of this series, we recover the spectral evolution in
both X-rays and radio for four outbursts of GX339-4 by playing independently
with the two parameters: $R_J$ and the accretion rate $\dot{M}_{in}$. In this
paper, we compare the time evolution of $R_J$ and $\dot{M}_{in}$ for the four
outbursts. We show that despite the undeniable differences between the time
evolution of each outburst, a unique pattern in the $\dot{M}_{in}-R_J$ plane
seems to be followed by all cycles within the JED-SAD model. We call this
pattern a fingerprint, and show that even the 'failed' outburst considered
follows it. We also compute the radiative efficiency in X-rays during the
cycles and consider its impact on the radio--X-ray correlation. Within the
JED-SAD paradigm, we find that the accretion flow is always radiatively
efficient in the hard states, with between $15\%$ and $40\%$ of the accretion
power being radiated away at any given time. Moreover, we show that the
radiative efficiency evolves with the accretion rate because of key changes in
the JED thermal structure. These changes give birth to two different regimes
with different radiative efficiencies: the thick disk and the slim disk. While
the existence of these two regimes is intrinsically linked to the JED-SAD
model, we show direct observational evidence of the presence of two different
regimes using the evolution of the X-ray power-law spectral index, a
model-independent estimate. We then argue that these two regimes could be the
origin of the gap in X-ray luminosity in the hard state, the wiggles and
different slopes seen in the radio--X-ray correlation, and even the existence
of outliers.

We identify two important clues for surgical instrument perception, including
local temporal dependency from adjacent frames and global semantic correlation
in long-range duration. However, most existing works perform segmentation
purely using visual cues in a single frame. Optical flow is just used to model
the motion between only two frames and brings heavy computational cost. We
propose a novel dual-memory network (DMNet) to wisely relate both global and
local spatio-temporal knowledge to augment the current features, boosting the
segmentation performance and retaining the real-time prediction capability. We
propose, on the one hand, an efficient local memory by taking the complementary
advantages of convolutional LSTM and non-local mechanisms towards the relating
reception field. On the other hand, we develop an active global memory to
gather the global semantic correlation in long temporal range to current one,
in which we gather the most informative frames derived from model uncertainty
and frame similarity. We have extensively validated our method on two public
benchmark surgical video datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art works on segmentation accuracy

quantum systems. In contrast, Bell's theorem and entanglement concern the
nonclassicality of composite quantum systems. Accordingly, unlike
incompatibility, entanglement and Bell non-locality are not necessary to
demonstrate KS-contextuality. However, here we find that for multiqubit
systems, entanglement and non-locality are both essential to proofs of the
Kochen--Specker theorem. Firstly, we show that unentangled measurements (a
strict superset of local measurements) can never yield a logical
(state-independent) proof of the KS theorem for multiqubit systems. In
particular, unentangled but nonlocal measurements -- whose eigenstates exhibit
""nonlocality without entanglement"" -- are insufficient for such proofs.This
also implies that proving Gleason's theorem on a multiqubit system necessarily
requires entangled projections, as shown by Wallach [Contemp Math, 305: 291-298
(2002)]. Secondly, we show that a multiqubit state admits a statistical
(state-dependent) proof of the KS theorem if and only if it can violate a Bell
inequality with projective measurements. We also establish the relationship
between entanglement and the theorems of Kochen--Specker and Gleason more
generally in multiqudit systems by constructing new examples of KS sets.
Finally, we discuss how our results shed new light on the role of multiqubit
contextuality as a resource within the paradigm of quantum computation with
state injection.

minimization of expected regret. It is well known that designs that are optimal
over certain exponential families can achieve expected regret that grows
logarithmically in the number of arm plays, at a rate governed by the
Lai-Robbins lower bound. In this paper, we show that when one uses such
optimized designs, the regret distribution of the associated algorithms
necessarily has a very heavy tail, specifically, that of a truncated Cauchy
distribution. Furthermore, for $p>1$, the $p$'th moment of the regret
distribution grows much faster than poly-logarithmically, in particular as a
power of the total number of arm plays. We show that optimized UCB bandit
designs are also fragile in an additional sense, namely when the problem is
even slightly mis-specified, the regret can grow much faster than the
conventional theory suggests. Our arguments are based on standard
change-of-measure ideas, and indicate that the most likely way that regret
becomes larger than expected is when the optimal arm returns below-average
rewards in the first few arm plays, thereby causing the algorithm to believe
that the arm is sub-optimal. To alleviate the fragility issues exposed, we show
that UCB algorithms can be modified so as to ensure a desired degree of
robustness to mis-specification. In doing so, we also provide a sharp trade-off
between the amount of UCB exploration and the tail exponent of the resulting
regret distribution.

difficult exploration, especially if the environment is initially reward-free.
To solve the problems of exploration and SRL in parallel, we propose a new
approach called XSRL (eXploratory State Representation Learning). On one hand,
it jointly learns compact state representations and a state transition
estimator which is used to remove unexploitable information from the
representations. On the other hand, it continuously trains an inverse model,
and adds to the prediction error of this model a $k$-step learning progress
bonus to form the maximization objective of a discovery policy. This results in
a policy that seeks complex transitions from which the trained models can
effectively learn. Our experimental results show that the approach leads to
efficient exploration in challenging environments with image observations, and
to state representations that significantly accelerate learning in RL tasks.

sometimes behave unpredictably. To combat this, our approach uses a simple yet
effective rule-based fallback layer that performs sanity checks on an ML
planner's decisions (e.g. avoiding collision, assuring physical feasibility).
This allows us to leverage ML to handle complex situations while still assuring
the safety, reducing ML planner-only collisions by 95%. We train our ML planner
on 300 hours of expert driving demonstrations using imitation learning and
deploy it along with the fallback layer in downtown San Francisco, where it
takes complete control of a real vehicle and navigates a wide variety of
challenging urban driving scenarios.

relevant for observation of many-body localization (MBL), a phenomenon that is
expected to freeze the dynamics of the system and prevent it from reaching
thermal equilibrium. Performing extensive numerical simulations of the
imbalance, a quantity often employed in the experimental studies of MBL, we
show that the regime of a slow power-law decay of imbalance persists to
disorder strengths exceeding by at least a factor of 2 the current estimates of
the critical disorder strength for MBL. Even though we investigate time
evolution up to few thousands tunneling times, we observe no signs of the
saturation of imbalance that would suggest freezing of system dynamics and
provide a smoking gun evidence of MBL. We demonstrate that the situation is
qualitatively different when the disorder is replaced by a quasiperiodic
potential. In this case, we observe an emergence of a pattern of oscillations
of the imbalance that is stable with respect to changes in the system size.
This suggests that the dynamics of quasiperiodic systems remain fully local at

sufficiently strong. Our study identifies challenges in an unequivocal

up the possibility of non-adiabatic evolution of the dark sector. To study the
non-adiabatic evolution of the dark sector, we have considered a $U(1)_{L_\mu -
L_\tau} \otimes U(1)_X$ extension of the standard model (SM). Here the dark
sector is charged only under $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry whereas the SM fields are
singlet under this symmetry. Due to the presence of tree-level kinetic mixing
between $U(1)_X$ and $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge bosons, the dark sector
evolves non-adiabatically and thermal equilibrium between the visible and dark
sector is governed by the portal coupling. Depending on the values of the
portal coupling ($\epsilon$), dark sector gauge coupling ($g_X$), mass of the
dark matter ($m_\chi$) and mass of the dark vector boson ($m_{Z^\prime}$), we
study the temperature evolution of the dark sector as well as the various
non-equilibrium stages of the dark sector in detail. Furthermore we have also
investigated the constraints on the model parameters from various laboratory
and astrophysical searches. We have found that the parameter space for the
non-adiabatic evolution of dark sector is significantly constrained for
$m_{Z^\prime}$ $\lesssim 100 \, {\rm MeV}$ from the observations of beam dump
experiments, stellar cooling etc. The relic density satisfied region of our
parameter space is consistent with the bounds from direct detection, and self
interaction of dark matter (SIDM) for the mass ratio $r \equiv
m_{Z^\prime}/m_\chi = 10^{-3}$ and these bounds will be more relaxed for larger
values of $r$. However the constraints from measurement of diffuse $\gamma$-ray

network (ANN) called the rank similarity filter (RSF). RSFs can be used to both
transform and classify nonlinearly separable datasets with many data points and
dimensions. The weights of RSF are set using the rank orders of features in a
data point, or optionally the 'confusion' adjusted ranks between features
(determined from their distributions in the dataset). The activation strength
of a filter determines its similarity to other points in the dataset, a measure
related to cosine similarity. The activation of many RSFs maps samples into a
new nonlinear space suitable for linear classification (the rank similarity
transform (RST)). We additionally used this method to create the nonlinear rank
similarity classifier (RSC), which is a fast and accurate multiclass
classifier, and the nonlinear rank similarity probabilistic classifier (RSPC),
which is an extension to the multilabel case. We evaluated the classifiers on
multiple datasets and RSC was competitive with existing classifiers but with
superior computational efficiency. Open-source code for RST, RSC and RSPC was
written in Python using the popular scikit-learn framework to make it easily
accessible. In future extensions the algorithm can be applied to specialised
hardware suitable for the parallelization of an ANN (GPU) and a Spiking Neural
Network (neuromorphic computing) with corresponding performance gains. This
makes RSF a promising solution to the problem of efficient analysis of
nonlinearly separable data.

non-isentropic mean flow, the axially varying flow conditions affect the
acoustic energy balance of the system. This is significant in understanding and
controlling thermo-acoustic phenomena, particularly in combustors. This work
aims at quantifying the acoustic energy change in such configurations, using
the acoustic absorption coefficient, $\Delta$. The acoustic response of the
duct to acoustic forcing is determined using an analytical model, neglecting
the effect of entropy fluctuations on the acoustic field, and subsequently,
$\Delta$ is estimated. The model predictions of $\Delta$ are validated using a
linearised Euler equations (LEEs) solver. The model was found to be accurate
for Mach numbers below $0.25$, provided the lower frequency limit set by the
analytical solution is satisfied. For conically varying area ducts with linear
mean temperature gradient, it was observed that $\Delta$ showed very little
dependence on frequency, and that the absolute value of $\Delta$ tended to be
maximised when the upstream boundary was anechoic rather than non-anechoic.
More importantly, $\Delta$ was also observed to show stronger dependence on the
mean temperature gradient than area gradient variation for such configurations.
Further parametric and optimisation studies for $\Delta$ revealed a crucial
finding that a positive mean temperature gradient, representing a heated duct
caused acoustic energy absorption. Similarly, a negative mean temperature
gradient, representing a cooled duct caused acoustic energy generation -- a key
result of this analysis. This behaviour was shown to be consistent with a
simplified analysis of the acoustic energy balance. Based on this finding, a
linearly proportional reduction in acoustic energy generation was achieved by
changing the mean temperature gradient.

mathematical formalization is relatively underdeveloped. The aim of this paper
is to provide a framework to systematically formulate the probabilistic
evolution equation, termed chemical diffusion master equation (CDME), that
governs particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. To account for
the non-conserved and unbounded particle number of this type of open systems,
we employ a classical analogue of the quantum mechanical Fock space that
contains the symmetrized probability densities of the many-particle
configurations in space. Following field-theoretical ideas of second
quantization, we introduce creation and annihilation operators that act on
single-particle densities and provide natural representations of symmetrized
probability densities as well as of reaction and diffusion operators. These
operators allow us to consistently and systematically formulate the CDME for
arbitrary reaction schemes. The resulting form of the CDME further serves as
the foundation to derive more coarse-grained descriptions of reaction-diffusion
dynamics. In this regard, we show that a discretization of the evolution
equation by projection onto a Fock subspace generated by a finite set of
single-particle densities leads to a generalized form of the well-known
reaction-diffusion master equation, which supports non-local reactions between

undefined. Statistical analysis based solely on observed survivors may give
biased results because the characteristics of survivors differ between

effect was proposed as a causal estimand defined in always-survivors. However,
this estimand is not identifiable when there is unmeasured confounding between
the treatment assignment and survival or outcome process. In this paper, we
consider the comparison between an aggressive treatment and a conservative
treatment with monotonicity on survival. First, we show that the survivor
average causal effect on the conservative treatment is identifiable based on a
substitutional variable under appropriate assumptions, even when the treatment
assignment is not ignorable. Next, we propose an augmented inverse probability

Finally, large sample properties of this estimator are established. The
proposed method is applied to investigate the effect of allogeneic stem cell

operations in critical ecosystems. They are usually required by law in
financial and government digital services. The most important feature of an HSM
is its ability to store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys inside a
tamper-resistant hardware, so that every operation is done internally through a
suitable API, and such sensitive data are never exposed outside the device.
HSMs are now conveniently provided in the cloud, meaning that the physical
machines are remotely hosted by some provider and customers can access them
through a standard API. The property of keeping sensitive data inside the
device is even more important in this setting as a vulnerable application might
expose the full API to an attacker. Unfortunately, in the last 20+ years a
multitude of practical API-level attacks have been found and proved feasible in
real devices. The latest version of PKCS#11, the most popular standard API for
HSMs, does not address these issues leaving all the flaws possible. In this
paper, we propose the first secure HSM configuration that does not require any
restriction or modification of the PKCS#11 API and is suitable to cloud HSM
solutions, where compliance to the standard API is of paramount importance. The
configuration relies on a careful separation of roles among the different HSM
users so that known API flaws are not exploitable by any attacker taking
control of the application. We prove the correctness of the configuration by
providing a formal model in the state-of-the-art Tamarin prover and we show how

of molecular dynamics, e.g. to understand processes in ultrafast spectroscopy.
They have, however, two limitation: On the one hand, such calculations are
typically based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and the electron
dynamics for stationary nuclei is considered, thus neglecting quantum effects
of the nuclei. On the other hand, even if the quantum nuclear motion would be
taken into account, a BOA dynamics on a single potential energy surface would
not provide any electron trajectories because the electronic part is treated as
a stationary problem. By using the exact factorization method, we overcome
these limitations and generalize the theory of electronic quantum trajectories
to a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of the nuclei. After reviewing the
time-dependent theory of quantum hydrodynamics and quantum trajectories, we
show that the nuclei can be viewed as a quantum clock for the electronic motion
and we develop a fully quantum-mechanical clock-dependent version of quantum
hydrodynamics. This theory is used to obtain electronic trajectories for
quantum nuclei, as is exemplified for a model system of a proton-coupled
electron transfer dynamics. Our work generalizes the concept of quantum

frequency conversion, still remains challenging for vectorial structured light
since parametric processes are polarization dependent, leading to a change in

that allows to maintain the full spatial structure of vectorial structured
light in the conversion; and systematically examine its spatial polarization
independence based on non-degenerate sum-frequency generation with type-0 phase

flexible wireless channel control and configuration, and thereby enhances the
wireless signal transmission rate and reliability significantly. Despite the
vast literature on designing and optimizing assorted IRS-aided wireless
systems, prior works have mainly focused on enhancing wireless links with
single signal reflection only by one or multiple IRSs, which may be
insufficient to boost the wireless link capacity under some harsh propagation
conditions (e.g., indoor environment with dense blockages/obstructions). This
issue can be tackled by employing two or more IRSs to assist each wireless link
and jointly exploiting their single as well as multiple signal reflections over
them. However, the resultant double-/multi-IRS aided wireless systems face more
complex design issues as well as new practical challenges for implementation as
compared to the conventional single-IRS counterpart, in terms of IRS reflection
optimization, channel acquisition, as well as IRS deployment and

which calls for innovative design approaches and optimization methods. In this

of constraints per variable $\alpha$ makes the system solvable in theory on the
one hand, but also makes the search for a solution hard, meaning that common
algorithms such as Monte-Carlo method fail to find a solution. The onset of
this hardness is deeply linked to the appearance of a dynamical phase
transition where the phase space of the problem breaks into an exponential
number of clusters. The exact position of this dynamical phase transition is
not universal with respect to the details of the Hamiltonian one chooses to
represent a given problem. In this paper, we develop some theoretical tools in
order to find a systematic way to build a Hamiltonian that maximizes the
dynamic $\alpha_{\rm d}$ threshold. To illustrate our techniques, we will
concentrate on the problem of continuous coloring, where one tries to set an
angle $x_i \in [0;2\pi]$ on each node of a network in such a way that no
adjacent nodes are closer than some threshold angle $\theta$, that is $\cos(x_i
- x_j) \leq \cos\theta$. This problem can be both seen as a continuous version
of the discrete graph coloring problem or as a one-dimensional version of the
the Mari-Krzakala-Kurchan (MKK) model. The relevance of this model stems from
the fact that continuous constraint satisfaction problems on sparse random
graphs remain largely unexplored in statistical physics. We show that for
sufficiently small angle $\theta$ this model presents a random first order

finite-speed, high-fidelity transport of a quantum wavepacket through a

wavepacket within a shallow anharmonic trap (tweezer), whose nonuniform
velocity is steered so as to maximize the transfer fidelity between two
locations. A relevant scenario is a quantum impurity moving through an
ultracold gas. Unlike shortcuts to adiabaticity, our approach can
simultaneously cope with wavepacket leakage via non-adiabatic and
phonon-mediated processes, provided both act perturbatively. Nor does our
approach require the application of compensating forces or counter-diabatic

Instead, optimal (highest fidelity) transport is achieved here by minimizing
the functional overlap of the varying velocity-spectrum of the chosen
trajectory with the combined (bath-induced and non-adiabatic) leakage spectrum.

that is characterized by positive output gap and mainly prevailing before the
Financial crisis, and a low-growth regime that characterized by negative but
volatile output gap and mainly prevailing after the Financial crisis. The

formation rate (SFR) of dense star-forming clouds in simulations of jet-ISM

of virial parameter and Mach number of the clumps on the star formation
activity. This improves upon other estimates of the SFR in simulations of
jet--ISM interactions, which are often solely based on local gas density,
neglecting the impact of turbulence. We apply this framework to the results of
a suite of jet-ISM interaction simulations to study how the jet regulates the
SFR both globally and on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. We find
that the jet strongly affects the multi-phase ISM in the galaxy, inducing
turbulence and increasing the velocity dispersion within the clouds. This
causes a global reduction in the SFR compared to a simulation without a jet.
The shocks driven into clouds by the jet also compress the gas to higher
densities, resulting in local enhancements of the SFR. However, the velocity
dispersion in such clouds is also comparably high, which results in a lower SFR
than would be observed in galaxies with similar gas mass surface densities and
without powerful radio jets. We thus show that both local negative and positive
jet feedback can occur in a single system during a single jet event, and that
the star-formation rate in the ISM varies in a complicated manner that depends
on the strength of the jet-ISM coupling and the jet break-out time-scale.

  Communication Networks",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of sixth-generation (6G) networks, emergency management
systems (EMSs) based on wireless communications have recently gained increasing
interest. Hereby, fundamentals and open problems of post-disaster
communications are discussed, especially focusing on their topological aspects.
The motivation behind this choice is due to the fact that, whenever a natural
or a man-made disaster occurs, there is a high chance that the terrestrial
communication infrastructure is compromised, and therefore alternative networks
need to be deployed efficiently in order to enable the majority of the
civilians and the first responders (FRs) to communicate. In this paper, we
first provide a brief review of existing aerial ad-hoc networks for
post-disaster communications. Next, we shed light on some new aspects of this
problem, which are related to the topology of the network supporting the
impacted area. Finally, with the aid of selected simulation results, we show
how the cellular infrastructure requirements for a disaster-struck region
significantly depend on its location and its extension.

place in the blow-up space of two-dimensional trianguline representations

  Our convergence result can be used to compute the reductions of any

reductions of certain crystalline representations of exceptional weight. In
particular, this provides an alternative approach to computing the reductions
of irreducible two-dimensional semi-stable representations that circumvents the
somewhat technical machinery of integral $p$-adic Hodge theory. For instance,
using the zig-zag conjecture made in [Gha21] on the reductions of crystalline
representations of exceptional weights, we recover completely the work of
Breuil-M\'ezard and Guerberoff-Park on the reductions of irreducible
semi-stable representations of weights at most $p+1$, at least on the inertia
subgroup. In the cases where the zig-zag conjecture is known, we are further
able to obtain some new information about the reductions for small odd weights.

constancy in the weight of the reductions of crystalline representations of
small weight which were noticed in [Gha21].

multiple access systems of communications. Such a system must be able to serve
a number of simultaneous users while keeping interference low. A popular choice
for the set of sequences to deploy is the quasi-complementary sequence set
(QCSS). Its large set size enables the system to accommodate a lot of users.
The set has low nontrivial correlation magnitudes within a zone around the
origin. This keeps undue interference among users under control. A QCSS
performs better than the perfect complementary sequence set (PCSS) does in
schemes with fractional delays.
  The optimality of a set of periodic sequences is measured by its maximum
periodic correlation magnitude, for which there is an established lower bound
to aim at. For a fixed period, optimal sets are known only for very restricted
parameters. Efforts have therefore been centered around the constructions of
asymptotically optimal sets. Their periods are allowed to be as large as
sufficient to establish optimality. In this paper we share an insight that a
sequence set that asymptotically attains the Welch bound generates an
asymptotically optimal periodic QCSS by interleaving. One can simply use known
families of such sequence sets to construct the desired QCSSs. Seven families
of QCSSs with specific parameters are shown as examples of this general
construction. We build upon the insight to propose two new direct constructions
of asymptotically optimal QCSSs with very flexible parameters without
interleaving. The flexibility enhances their appeal for practical
implementation. The mathematical tools come from the theory of groups in the
form of additive and multiplicative characters of finite fields.

associated with D+D, D+T, D+3He, p+D, p+6Li and p+7Li fusion reactions.
Surprisingly, we find that our calculated optical potential parameters are
quite different from those of many previous results (e.g., Phys. Rev. C. 61
(2000) 024610, Nucl. Phys. A 986 (2019) 98, etc.), in which approximate Coulomb
wave functions (ACWFs) with only retaining the leading terms are exploited for
the continuity conditions at the radius of nuclear potential. Furthermore, with
the obtained optical potential parameters, we compare the fusion cross sections
and astrophysical S-factors with that formulated from ACWFs approach, and also
find apparent deviations especially for the fusion reactions with resonance
peaks such as D+T and D+3He fusion reactions. We then calculate the phase
diagrams of the fusion cross sections with respect to the optical potential
parameters and demonstrate several narrow shape resonance belts. It implies
that a small deviation of ACWFs from the exact CWFs at nuclear radius might
lead to fall off the resonance regimes and therefore causes the big difference
on the optical parameters as well as the cross sections.

Feynman path integral is a very appealing approach, as it approximates the
propagator by a closed-form expression (a sum over a finite number of classical

obtain closed-form expressions for the initial velocity, bounce times, focal

We calculate the propagator within the semiclassical approximation. The
numerical results agree with eigenfunction expansion results away from

permeability, and (3) to compare the performance of CPA estimates of keff to

We construct two- and three-dimensional random (uncorrelated) geologic
formations based on permeability measurements from the Borden site and assume
that the permeability distribution conforms to the log-normal probability
density function over a wide range of means and standard deviations. Comparing
keff estimated via CPA to keff values derived from numerical flow simulations
indicates that CPA provides accurate estimations in both two and three
dimensions over a wide range of heterogeneity levels, similar to RGT.
Inter-model comparisons show that although PT and EMA provide reasonable keff
estimations in rather homogeneous formations, they substantially overestimate
the effective permeability in highly heterogeneous formations.

first-order phase transition can only arise from a departure from thermal
equilibrium in the plasma. Recently however, it was argued that an effective
friction, scaling as $\gamma_w^2$ (with $\gamma_w$ being the Lorentz factor for
the bubble wall velocity), persists in local equilibrium. This was derived
assuming constant plasma temperature and velocity throughout the wall. On the
other hand, it is known that, at the leading order in derivatives, the plasma
in local equilibrium only contributes a correction to the zero-temperature
potential in the equation of motion of the background scalar field. For a
constant plasma temperature, the equation of motion is then completely
analogous to the vacuum case, the only change being a modified potential, and
thus no friction should appear. We resolve these apparent contradictions in the
calculations and their interpretation and show that the recently proposed
effective friction in local equilibrium originates from inhomogeneous
temperature distributions, such that the $\gamma_w^2$-scaling of the effective
force is violated. Further, we propose a new matching condition for the
hydrodynamic quantities in the plasma valid in local equilibrium and tied to
local entropy conservation. With this added constraint, bubble velocities in
local equilibrium can be determined once the parameters in the equation of
state are fixed, where we use the bag equation in order to illustrate this
point. We find that there is a critical value of the transition strength
$\alpha_{\rm crit}$ such that bubble walls run away for $\alpha>\alpha_{\rm
crit}$.

A suitable sampling rate varies from application to application due to the
trade-off between speech quality and generation speed. In this study, we
propose a method to handle multiple sampling rates in a single NV, called the
MSR-NV. By generating waveforms step-by-step starting from a low sampling rate,
MSR-NV can efficiently learn the characteristics of each frequency band and
synthesize high-quality speech at multiple sampling rates. It can be regarded
as an extension of the previously proposed NVs, and in this study, we extend
the structure of Parallel WaveGAN (PWG). Experimental evaluation results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkably higher subjective
quality than the original PWG trained separately at 16, 24, and 48 kHz, without
increasing the inference time. We also show that MSR-NV can leverage speech

cheap to produce, since they rely on the same fabrication techniques used to
produce mobile phone accelerometers. A significant challenge in the development
of MEMS gravimeters is maintaining stability over long time periods, which is
essential for long term monitoring applications. A standard way to demonstrate
gravimeter stability and sensitivity is to measure the periodic elastic
distortion of the Earth due to tidal forces - the Earth tides. Here we present
a nineteen day measurement of the Earth tides, with a correlation coefficient
to the theoretical signal of 0.979. The estimated bias instability of the
proposed gravimeter is 8.18 microGal for an averaging time of ~400 s when
considering the raw, uncompensated data. The bias instability extracted from
the sensor electronic noise sits just under 2 mircoGal for an averaging time of
~200 s. After removing the long-term temperature and control electronics
effects from the raw data, a linear drift of 268 microGal/day is observed in
the data, which is among one of the best reported for a MEMS device. These
results demonstrate that this MEMS gravimeter is capable of conducting
long-therm time-lapse gravimetry, a functionality essential for applications
such as volcanology.

there is increasing competition around privacy between these smartphone

find that third-party tracking and the sharing of unique user identifiers was

children's category, iOS apps tended to use fewer advertising-related tracking
than their Android counterparts, but could more often access children's

tracking without user consent, 2) the lack of parental consent before sharing
personally identifiable information (PII) with third-parties in children's
apps, 3) the non-data-minimising configuration of tracking libraries, 4) the
sending of personal data to countries without an adequate level of data
protection, and 5) the continued absence of transparency around tracking,
partly due to design decisions by Apple and Google. Overall, we find that
neither platform is clearly better than the other for privacy across the

methods mainly focus on single-task speech restoration (SSR), such as speech
denoising or speech declipping. However, SSR systems only focus on one task and
do not address the general speech restoration problem. In addition, previous
SSR systems show limited performance in some speech restoration tasks such as
speech super-resolution. To overcome those limitations, we propose a general
speech restoration (GSR) task that attempts to remove multiple distortions
simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose VoiceFixer, a generative framework to
address the GSR task. VoiceFixer consists of an analysis stage and a synthesis
stage to mimic the speech analysis and comprehension of the human auditory
system. We employ a ResUNet to model the analysis stage and a neural vocoder to
model the synthesis stage. We evaluate VoiceFixer with additive noise, room
reverberation, low-resolution, and clipping distortions. Our baseline GSR model
achieves a 0.499 higher mean opinion score (MOS) than the speech enhancement
SSR model. VoiceFixer further surpasses the GSR baseline model on the MOS score
by 0.256. Moreover, we observe that VoiceFixer generalizes well to severely
degraded real speech recordings, indicating its potential in restoring old
movies and historical speeches. The source code is available at

  Junction with an anti-ferromagnetic Capping Layer",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Using first-principles calculations, we explore the role of an
anti-ferromagnetic heavy-metal, L1$_0$-IrMn, as a capping layer in a
perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (\emph{p}-MTJ). A comparative study is
conducted by employing conventional non-magnetic heavy-metals (Ta, W or Mo)
capping layers along with an anti-ferromagnetic IrMn in a symmetric-MTJ
X/FeCo/MgO/FeCo/X, where X=Ta, W, Mo or IrMn. Firstly, the calculations without
including spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are presented where the highest TMR is
achieved in IrMn-IrMn MTJ compared to that of Ta-Ta, W-W and Mo-Mo MTJs. The
origin of this large TMR is attributed to, both, the large spin-polarization
due to reduced lattice-mismatch and the non-identical signatures of both the
anti-parallel conduction-channels caused by the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of
IrMn that reflects the spins at IrMn/FeCo interface. Moreover, when SOC is
switched-on, the increase of TMR is observed in all the MTJs with a
particularly giant enhancement in IrMn-IrMn MTJ. This SOC-induced increase in
TMR is ascribed to the mixed contribution of $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_5$ states
and the additional increase in the band levels of the out-of-plane orbitals,
\emph{p}$_z$, \emph{d}$_{z}^2$ and \emph{d}$_{xz}$ due to the lifting of
degeneracy. Furthermore, it was also observed that the lattice-mismatch-induced
strain might create an orbital reconstruction within the capping layer,
probably, due to the crystallographic deformation and, in turn, in the adjacent
FeCo-electrode. This microscopic mechanism also plays an additional decisive
role in enhancing the TMR. Finally, our results indicate that IrMn can offer
giant TMR in future spin-orbit toque (SOT) based MRAM devices with a
straightforward design strategy.

In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive attribute and structure subspace
clustering network (AASSC-Net) to simultaneously consider the attribute and
structure information in an adaptive graph fusion manner. Specifically, we
first exploit an auto-encoder to represent input data samples with latent
features for the construction of an attribute matrix. We also construct a mixed
signed and symmetric structure matrix to capture the local geometric structure
underlying data samples. Then, we perform self-expressiveness on the
constructed attribute and structure matrices to learn their affinity graphs
separately. Finally, we design a novel attention-based fusion module to
adaptively leverage these two affinity graphs to construct a more
discriminative affinity graph. Extensive experimental results on commonly used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our AASSC-Net significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we conduct comprehensive ablation

  Centrality Method","44 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many applications such as recommendation systems or sports tournaments
involve pairwise comparisons within a collection of $n$ items, the goal being
to aggregate the binary outcomes of the comparisons in order to recover the
latent strength and/or global ranking of the items. In recent years, this
problem has received significant interest from a theoretical perspective with a
number of methods being proposed, along with associated statistical guarantees
under the assumption of a suitable generative model.
  While these results typically collect the pairwise comparisons as one
comparison graph $G$, however in many applications - such as the outcomes of
soccer matches during a tournament - the nature of pairwise outcomes can evolve
with time. Theoretical results for such a dynamic setting are relatively
limited compared to the aforementioned static setting. We study in this paper
an extension of the classic BTL (Bradley-Terry-Luce) model for the static
setting to our dynamic setup under the assumption that the probabilities of the
pairwise outcomes evolve smoothly over the time domain $[0,1]$. Given a
sequence of comparison graphs $(G_{t'})_{t' \in \mathcal{T}}$ on a regular grid
$\mathcal{T} \subset [0,1]$, we aim at recovering the latent strengths of the
items $w_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ at any time $t \in [0,1]$. To this end, we adapt
the Rank Centrality method - a popular spectral approach for ranking in the
static case - by locally averaging the available data on a suitable
neighborhood of $t$. When $(G_{t'})_{t' \in \mathcal{T}}$ is a sequence of
Erd\""os-Renyi graphs, we provide non-asymptotic $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$
error bounds for estimating $w_t^*$ which in particular establishes the
consistency of this method in terms of $n$, and the grid size
$\lvert\mathcal{T}\rvert$. We also complement our theoretical analysis with
experiments on real and synthetic data.

research. In particular, they provide novel and powerful ways to culture cells,
cell aggregates, and even functional models of entire organs. Nuclear magnetic
resonance is a non-invasive, high-resolution spectroscopic technique which
allows real-time process monitoring with chemical specificity. It is ideally
suited for observing metabolic and other biological and chemical processes in
microfluidic systems. However, its intrinsically low sensitivity has limited
its application. Recent advances in nuclear hyperpolarization techniques may
change this: under special circumstances, it is possible to enhance NMR signals
by up to 5 orders of magnitude, which dramatically extends the utility of NMR
in the context of microfluidic systems. At the same time, hyperpolarization
requires complex chemical and/or physical manipulations, which in turn may
benefit from microfluidic implementation. In fact, many hyperpolarization
methodologies rely on processes that are more efficient at the micro-scale,
such as molecular diffusion, penetration electromagnetic radiation into the
sample, or restricted molecular mobility on a surface. In this review we
examine the confluence between the fields of hyperpolarization-enhanced NMR and
microfluidics, and assess how these areas of research have mutually benefited
one another, and will continue to do so.

molecular gas in and around the galaxy. As in many low redshift cool core
clusters, the molecular gas is located in a series of clumps extending along
the old radio jets and lobes. It has a relatively low velocity dispersion (336
[+39,-35] km/s FWHM) and shows no velocity gradients indicative of outflow or
infall. Roughly half the gas is located in a central clump on the northeast
side of the galaxy, overlapping a bright ionized gas filament and a spur of
excess X-ray emission, suggesting that this is a location of rapid cooling. The
molecular gas is unusually extended, out to ~55 kpc radius, comparable to the
scale of the filamentary nebula in the Perseus cluster, despite the much higher
redshift of this system. The extent falls within the thermal instability radius
of the intracluster medium (ICM), with t_cool/t_ff<25 and t_cool}/t_eddy~1
within ~70 kpc. Continuum measurements at 159.9 GHz from NOEMA and 850 micron
from the JCMT SCUBA-2 show excess far infrared emission, which we interpret as
free-free emission arising from the ongoing starburst. These observations
suggest that ICM cooling is not strongly affected by the buried QSO, and that
cooling from the ICM can build gas reservoirs sufficient to fuel quasar-mode
activity and drive the reorientation of the central AGN.

that the explanation for this discrepancy is that although magnetic-field

operations conditionally, using feedforward of previous photon-detection
outcomes, within the lifetime of remaining photons. Most visibly, feedforward
switching is required for fault-tolerant operations at the level of logical
qubits, which are needed in turn for useful quantum algorithms. However, switch
networks are also required for multiplexing (""muxing"") stages that are needed
for generating specific small entangled resource states, where it is used to
boost the probabilities for allocating quantum states to fusion gates and other

timing of the critical windows and magnitude of the associations are likely
heterogeneous across different levels of individual, family, and neighborhood

individualized relationship between weekly exposures to fine particulate matter

topic. Recent theories of language optimality have tried to justify its

Piantadosi et al. (2012) argued homophony enables the reuse of efficient
wordforms and is thus beneficial for languages. This hypothesis has recently
been challenged by Trott and Bergen (2020), who posit that good wordforms are
more often homophonous simply because they are more phonotactically probable.
In this paper, we join in on the debate. We first propose a new
information-theoretic quantification of a language's homophony: the sample
R\'enyi entropy. Then, we use this quantification to revisit Trott and Bergen's
claims. While their point is theoretically sound, a specific methodological
issue in their experiments raises doubts about their results. After addressing

with visualizations presented as VR scenes are more or less correct than those
obtained from traditional screens, and if it takes more or less time to produce
those answers. Method: We will run an experiment with volunteer subjects from
several backgrounds. We will have two setups: an on-screen application, and a
VR scene. Both will be designed to be as much equivalent as possible in terms
of the information they provide. For the former, we use a commercial-grade set

spreads in a non-Hermitian disordered system for demonstraing that it is very
different from the Hermitian case. Interestingly, a cascade like wave packet
spreading as in the Hermitian case is suppressed in the clean limit and at weak

its non-monotonic evolution in time. We clarify the different roles of
dephasing in the time evolution of entanglement entropy in Hermitian and

surveys was designed as a part of an international initiative that congregates
researchers from 12 countries -- InsighTD. At country level, national teams ran
survey replications with industry practitioners from the respective countries.
In total 653 valid responses were collected from 6 countries. Regarding the
prevalence of the TD concept 22% of practitioners have only theoretical
knowledge about it, and 47% have some practical experiences with TD
identification or management. Further analysis indicated that senior
practitioners who work in larger organizations, larger teams, and on larger
systems are more likely to be experienced with TD management. Time pressure or

delivery delay, low maintainability, and rework were the most cited. InsighTD

provided a methodological framework that allowed multiple replication teams to

protection of source location privacy to some extent. It is urgent to solve the
problems such as complicate the ac path between nodes, improve the centralized

communication overhead. In this paper, PSSPR routing is proposed as a visable
approach to address SLP issues. We use the coordinates of the center node V to
divide sector-domain, which act as important role in generating a new phantom
nodes. The phantom nodes perform specified routing policies to ensure that they
can choose various locations. In addition, the directed random route can ensure
that data packets avoid the visible range when they move to the sink node hop
by hop. Thus, the source location is protected. Theoretical analysis and
simulation experiments show that this protocol achieves higher security of
source node location with less communication overhead.

operator by a series of linear problems. Our method does not depend on the
actual choice of discretization. The main approximation task is to construct an
efficient rational approximation of a generalized exponential function. It is
well known that this class of functions allows exponentially convergent
rational approximations, which, combined with the sensitivity analysis of the
closed form solution, allows us to present a robust numerical method. Several
case studies are presented to illustrate our results.

Feature Enrichment Network for Few-Shot Segmentation"". The prior mask serves as
an indicator that highlights the region of interests of unseen categories, and
it is effective in achieving better performance on different frameworks of
recent studies.
  However, the current method directly takes the maximum element-to-element
correspondence between the query and support features to indicate the
probability of belonging to the target class, thus the broader contextual
information is seldom exploited during the prior mask generation. To address
this issue, first, we propose the Context-aware Prior Mask (CAPM) that
leverages additional nearby semantic cues for better locating the objects in
query images. Second, since the maximum correlation value is vulnerable to
noisy features, we take one step further by incorporating a lightweight Noise
Suppression Module (NSM) to screen out the unnecessary responses, yielding
high-quality masks for providing the prior knowledge.
  Both two contributions are experimentally shown to have substantial practical
merit, and the new model named PFENet++ significantly outperforms the baseline
PFENet as well as all other competitors on three challenging benchmarks
PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and FSS-1000.
  The new state-of-the-art performance is achieved without compromising the
efficiency, manifesting the potential for being a new strong baseline in
few-shot semantic segmentation.

human and other biological societies. The foundations of these relationships
are rooted in the decision making of individuals, and whether they choose to be
selfish or altruistic. How individuals choose their behaviors can be analyzed
using a strategy optimization process in the framework of game theory. Previous
studies have shown that reference to individuals' previous actions plays an
important role in their choice of strategies and establishment of social
relationships. A fundamental question remains as to whether an individual with
more information can exploit another who has less information when learning the
choice of strategies. Here we demonstrate that a player using a memory-one
strategy, who can refer to their own previous action and that of their
opponent, can be exploited by a reactive player, who only has the information
of the other player, based on mutual adaptive learning. This is
counterintuitive because the former has more choice in strategies and can
potentially obtain a higher payoff. We demonstrated this by formulating the
learning process of strategy choices to optimize the payoffs in terms of
coupled replicator dynamics and applying it to the prisoner's dilemma game.
Further, we show that the player using a memory-one strategy, by referring to
their previous experience, can sometimes act more generous toward the
opponent's defection, thereby accepting the opponent's exploitation. Mainly, we
found that through adaptive learning, a player with limited information usually
exploits the player with more information, leading to asymmetric exploitation.

to a better final performance. Using this, we derive a novel fitness metric and
use it to make some of the population members focus on long-term performance.

maps (GDMaps) and utilizing geometric harmonics is developed for predicting the

utilizes the GDMaps to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the
underlying behavior of physical/mathematical systems with respect to
uncertainties in the input parameters. Using this representation, geometric
harmonics, an out-of-sample function extension technique, is employed to create
a global map from the space of input parameters to a Grassmannian diffusion
manifold. Geometric harmonics is also employed to locally map points on the
diffusion manifold onto the tangent space of a Grassmann manifold. The
exponential map is then used to project the points in the tangent space onto
the Grassmann manifold, where reconstruction of the full solution is performed.
The performance of the proposed surrogate modeling is verified with three
examples. The first problem is a toy example used to illustrate the development
of the technique. In the second example, errors associated with the various
mappings employed in the technique are assessed by studying response
predictions of the electric potential of a dielectric cylinder in a homogeneous
electric field. The last example applies the method for uncertainty prediction
in the strain field evolution in a model amorphous material using the shear

using the $WW^*(\rightarrow e\nu\mu\nu)jj$ final state, based on a dataset
corresponding to 36.1/fb of $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV proton$-$proton collisions
recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The first study
targets Higgs boson production via gluon$-$gluon fusion and constrains the CP
properties of the effective Higgs$-$gluon interaction. Using angular
distributions and the overall rate, a value of $\tan(\alpha) = 0.0 \pm 0.4$
stat. $ \pm 0.3$ syst is obtained for the tangent of the mixing angle for
CP-even and CP-odd contributions. The second study exploits the vector-boson
fusion production mechanism to probe the Higgs boson couplings to
longitudinally and transversely polarised $W$ and $Z$ bosons in both the
production and the decay of the Higgs boson; these couplings have not been
directly constrained previously. The polarisation-dependent coupling-strength
scale factors are defined as the ratios of the measured polarisation-dependent
coupling strengths to those predicted by the Standard Model, and are determined

motor impairment. Motor severity (captured via motor score) is a key component
in assessing overall HD severity. However, motor score evaluation involves
in-clinic visits with a trained medical professional, which are expensive and
not always accessible. Speech analysis provides an attractive avenue for
tracking HD severity because speech is easy to collect remotely and provides
insight into motor changes. HD speech is typically characterized as having
irregular articulation. With this in mind, acoustic features that can capture
vocal tract movement and articulatory coordination are particularly promising
for characterizing motor symptom progression in HD. In this paper, we present
an experiment that uses Vocal Tract Coordination (VTC) features extracted from
read speech to estimate a motor score. When using an elastic-net regression

features across varied-length audio segments, which highlights the
effectiveness of these features for both short- and long-form reading tasks.
Lastly, we analyze the F-value scores of VTC features to visualize which

tools for studying the small-scale dynamics of the solar atmosphere.
Estimations of the observability of the small-scale dynamics as a function of
spatial resolution for regions with different characteristic magnetic field
topology facilitate a more robust analysis of ALMA observations of the Sun. A
3D model of the solar atmosphere from the MHD code Bifrost was used to produce
high-cadence observables at mm and submm wavelengths. The synthetic observables
for receiver bands 3-10 were degraded to the angular resolution corresponding
to ALMA observations with different configurations of the interferometric array
from the most compact C1, to the more extended C7. The observability of the
small-scale dynamics was analyzed in each case. The analysis was thus also
performed for predicting the potential of future capabilities. The minimum
resolution required to study the typical small spatial scales in the solar
chromosphere depends on the characteristic properties of the target region.
Here, a range from quiet Sun to enhanced network loops is considered. Limited
spatial resolution affects the observable signatures of dynamic small-scale
brightening events in the form of reduced brightness temperature amplitudes,
potentially leaving them undetectable, and even shifts in the times at which
the peaks occur of up to tens of seconds. Conversion factors between the
observable brightness amplitude and the original amplitude in the fully
resolved simulation are provided that can be applied to observational data in
principle, but are subject to wavelength-dependent uncertainties. Predictions
of the typical appearance at the different combinations of receiver band, array
configuration, and properties of the target region are conducted.

the dynamics of its power source. Responding to a change of these dynamics is
critical for the fitness of living flow networks, e.g. the animal vasculature,
which are subject to frequent and sudden shifts when the pump (the heart)
transitions between different steady states. The combination of flow
resistance, fluid inertia, and elasticity of the vessel walls causes the flow
and pressure of the fluid throughout the network to respond to these
transitions and adapt to the new power source operating profiles over a nonzero
time scale. We find that this response time can exist in one of two possible
regimes; one dominated by the decay rate of travelling wavefronts and
independent of system size, and one dominated by the diffusive nature of the
fluid mechanical energy over large length scales. These regimes are shown to
exist for both single vessels and hierarchically structured networks with
systems smaller than a critical size in the former and larger systems in the
later. Applying biologically relevant parameters to the model suggests that

(QKD) protocols that has enabled countless QKD experiments with inexpensive
light sources. However, new technological advancements might require further
theoretical study of this technique. In particular, the decoy-state method is
typically described under the assumption of a Poisson statistical distribution
for the number of photons in each QKD pulse. This is a practical choice,
because prepare-and-measure QKD is often implemented with attenuated lasers,
which produce exactly this distribution. However, sources that do not meet this
assumption are not guaranteed to be compatible with decoy states. In this work,
we provide security bounds for decoy-state QKD using a source with an arbitrary
photon emission statistic. We consider both the asymptotic limit of infinite
key and the finite-size scenario, and evaluate two common decoy-state schemes:
the vacuum+weak and one-decoy protocols. We numerically evaluate the
performance of the bounds, comparing three realistic statistical distributions
(Poisson, thermal, binomial), showing that they are all viable options for QKD.

segmentation since it alleviates the heavy burden of acquiring the costly

while the unlabeled images are exploited by enforcing the perturbation-based

cyclic prototype consistency learning (CPCL) framework, which is constructed by
a labeled-to-unlabeled (L2U) prototypical forward process and an
unlabeled-to-labeled (U2L) backward process. Such two processes synergistically
enhance the segmentation network by encouraging more discriminative and compact

subcutaneously implanted or placed near the body surface and facilitate
continuous monitoring of health parameters of a patient. Research endeavours
involving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected
parameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and
analysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern
in WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their
energy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot
be recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed
at optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this
paper, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of
alarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a
two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates `uninteresting' health
parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being
transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. A reading is categorised as
uninteresting if it deviates very slightly from its immediately preceding
reading and does not provide new insight on the patient's well being. In
addition to this, readings that are faulty and emanate from possible sensor
malfunctions are also eliminated. These eliminations are done at the site of
the sensor using algorithms that are light enough to effectively function in
the extremely resource-constrained environments of the sensor nodes. We notice,
through experiments, that this eliminates and thus reduces around 90% of the
readings that need to be transmitted to the LPU leading to significant energy
savings. Furthermore, the proper functioning of these algorithms in such
constrained environments is confirmed and validated over a hardware simulation
set up. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection
model at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health
parameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to
being able to handle streaming data, the model works within the
resource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of
transmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The
anomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available
from the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other
anomaly detection techniques.

dosimeter coupled to an extremely compact front-end electronics. The detection
system was tested under the X-ray pulses generated by a medical LINAC for both
the 6 MV and the 18 MV accelerating voltages. Located in the LINAC's bunker, it
eliminates the need for a long cable connection between the detector and the
electronics, detrimental for the system response speed. Signal acquisition was
performed synchronously with the impinging X-ray pulses with a sampling period
as low as 20 us, allowing for a real-time beam monitoring. The dosimeter
demonstrated a very good stability despite the high value of the absorbed dose
during the performed experiments (about 100 Gy). The measured dose-per-pulse
values of 278 uGy and 556 uGy at 6 MV and 18 MV, respectively, are in excellent
agreement with the nominal values expected for the LINAC apparatus used for the
tests. In addition to single-pulse measurements, fundamental for dynamic
radiotherapy, the proposed system also allows for the calculation of both the
total collected charge and the photocurrent generated by the detector. In this
regards, despite the compactness, it demonstrates its effectiveness as a tool
for source diagnostics in terms of both beam intensity and emission timing.

we show the robustness of the approach through a set of randomization

some methods to be consistently reliable (LRP, GradCAM), while others produce

games, but it has been adapted for team sports and other settings.
  In 2015, Junca and Jabin proposed a kinetic version of the Elo model, and
showed that under certain assumptions the ratings do converge towards the

solve remaining useful life estimation and failure prediction problems in
recent years. Having access to the remaining useful life estimation or
likelihood of failure in near future helps operators to assess the operating
conditions and, therefore, provides better opportunities for sound repair and
maintenance decisions. However, many operators believe remaining useful life
estimation and failure prediction solutions are incomplete answers to the
maintenance challenge. They argue that knowing the likelihood of failure in the
future is not enough to make maintenance decisions that minimize costs and keep
the operators safe. In this paper, we present a maintenance framework based on
offline supervised deep reinforcement learning that instead of providing
information such as likelihood of failure, suggests actions such as
""continuation of the operation"" or ""the visitation of the repair shop"" to the
operators in order to maximize the overall profit. Using offline reinforcement
learning makes it possible to learn the optimum maintenance policy from
historical data without relying on expensive simulators. We demonstrate the
application of our solution in a case study using the NASA C-MAPSS dataset.

intelligence (AI) models demand expensive computational resources. While
currently available high-performance computing environments support well this
complexity, the deployment of AI models in mobile devices, which is an
increasing trend, is challenging. Mobile applications consist of environments
with low computational resources and hence imply limitations in the design
decisions during the AI-enabled software engineering lifecycle that balance the
trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the mobile applications.
  Objective: Our objective is to systematically assess the trade-off between
accuracy and complexity when deploying complex AI models (e.g. neural networks)
to mobile devices, which have an implicit resource limitation. We aim to cover
(i) the impact of the design decisions on the achievement of high-accuracy and
low resource-consumption implementations; and (ii) the validation of profiling
tools for systematically promoting greener AI.
  Method: This confirmatory registered report consists of a plan to conduct an
empirical study to quantify the implications of the design decisions on
AI-enabled applications performance and to report experiences of the end-to-end
AI-enabled software engineering lifecycle. Concretely, we will implement both
image-based and language-based neural networks in mobile applications to solve
multiple image classification and text classification problems on different
benchmark datasets. Overall, we plan to model the accuracy and complexity of
AI-enabled applications in operation with respect to their design decisions and
will provide tools for allowing practitioners to gain consciousness of the
quantitative relationship between the design decisions and the green
characteristics of study.

indeed eliminate the gap between classical and quantum physics. At the same
time, it is difficult for a classical theory to include a particular feature
like entanglement without compromising the theory's smooth working on a
four-dimensional scale geometry. A unified theory should reconsider this
difficulty. On the other hand, pregeometry hold the assumption of a
non-commutative space where the Requardt-Roy model seems to be a promising one.
From the ordinary five-dimensional approach first initiated by Kaluza-Klein, a
toy model is proposed to show the insignificant description of gravity at
Planck's scale physics. It is found that the classical nature of quantum
correlations are fine tuned within the geometry of space-time at four
dimensions. Such a nature can be better understood by studying the pregeometric
effects of gravity at five-dimensions. A combined description of gravity and
entanglement is found sufficient to explain the fundamental difficulties of
discrete space-time manifolds in both the theories.

diffusion coefficients, substrate anisotropy, and average exciton lifetimes of
perylene diimide (PDI) and tetracene based substrates in the low concentration

display enhanced singlet exciton transport properties when compared to
tetracene. Simulations show that substrates with dipole-aligned chromophores
are characterised by anisotropic exciton diffusion, with slightly improved

substrate transport is predominantly mediated by PDI due to the asymmetry in
the transport rates between the two dyes considered. We conclude discussing the

generator generates images and the physical contexts at the beginning, ending,

internet access among non-Hispanic whites with at least a bachelors degree with
an annual household income of less than 99K is more likely to oppose the
deportation of undocumented immigrants and separating unaccompanied children
from their families in borderland areas. The individuals with substantial
Republican political ideology exhibit significantly lower opposing effects in
deporting undocumented immigrants or separating unaccompanied children from

fairness as a sociotechnical construct. Third, we propose directions for IS

environmental challenges associated with this technology. In the social domain,
digital technologies raise concern about exclusion (financial, geographical,
educational, demographical, racial, gender, language, and disabled related
exclusion) and physical and mental health. In the societal dimension, digital
technologies raise concern about politics and democracy (sovereignty and
governance, cognitive filters and citizen's engagement), privacy and security
(data acquisition and usage transparency, level of personal approval, and level
of anonymization), and economics. In the environmental dimension, digital
technologies raise concern about energy consumption and hardware production.
This paper introduces and defines these challenges for digital technology in
general, as well as when applied to health care. The objective of this paper is
to make the research community more aware about the challenges of digital
technology and to promote more transparency for innovative and responsible
research.

server-side proxy training data and actual data received on local devices of
users. With the use of federated learning (FL), we introduce an efficient
approach on continuously adapting neural network language models (NNLMs) on
private devices with applications on automatic speech recognition (ASR). To
address the potential speech transcription errors in the on-device training
corpus, we perform empirical studies on comparing various strategies of
leveraging token-level confidence scores to improve the NNLM quality in the FL
settings. Experiments show that compared with no model adaptation, the proposed
method achieves relative 2.6% and 10.8% word error rate (WER) reductions on two
speech evaluation datasets, respectively. We also provide analysis in
evaluating privacy guarantees of our presented procedure.

dynamic equations to generate diagnosers and to analyze detectability and
isolability of the dynamic systems. Model-based fault detection and isolation
methods use system model to generate a set of residuals as the bases for fault
detection and isolation. However, in many complex systems it is not feasible to
develop highly accurate models for the systems and to keep the models updated
during the system lifetime. Recently, data-driven solutions have received an
immense attention in the industries systems for several practical reasons.
First, these methods do not require the initial investment and expertise for
developing accurate models. Moreover, it is possible to automatically update
and retrain the diagnosers as the system or the environment change over time.
Finally, unlike the model-based methods it is straight forward to combine time
series measurements such as pressure and voltage with other sources of
information such as system operating hours to achieve a higher accuracy. In
this paper, we extend the traditional model-based fault detection and isolation
concepts such as residuals, and detectable and isolable faults to the
data-driven domain. We then propose an algorithm to automatically generate
residuals from the normal operating data. We present the performance of our
proposed approach through a comparative case study.
