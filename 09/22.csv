features on the prediction fosters model explainability and delivers relevant
information about the dataset. While typical setups for feature importance
ranking assess input features individually, in this study, we go one step
further and rank the importance of groups of features, denoted as
feature-blocks. A feature-block can contain features of a specific type or
features derived from a particular source, which are presented to the neural
network in separate input branches (multiblock ANNs). This work presents three
methods pursuing distinct strategies to rank features in multiblock ANNs by
their importance: (1) a composite strategy building on individual feature
importance rankings, (2) a knock-in, and (3) a knock-out strategy. While the
composite strategy builds on state-of-the-art feature importance rankings,
knock-in and knock-out strategies evaluate the block as a whole via a mutual
information criterion. Our experiments consist of a simulation study validating
all three approaches, followed by a case study on two distinct real-world
datasets to compare the strategies. We conclude that each strategy has its
merits for specific application scenarios.

  difficulties of flow reconstruction",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerical simulations of turbulence provide non-intrusive access to all the
resolved scales, although they often invoke idealizations that can compromise
realism. In contrast, experimental measurements probe the true flow with lesser
idealizations, but they continually contend with spatio-temporal sensor
resolution. Assimilating observations directly in simulations can combine the
benefits of both approaches. The problem is expressed in variational form,
where we seek a Navier-Stokes solution that minimizes a cost function defined
in terms of the deviation of numerical predictions and observations. In this
framework, measurements are no longer a mere record of the instantaneous, local
quantity, but rather an encoding of the antecedent flow events that we aim to
decode using the governing equations. We examine three state estimation
problems: In circular Couette flow, starting from wall stress data, we
accurately reconstruct the nonlinear saturated wavy Taylor vortices. Through a
discussion of transition to chaos in a Lorenz system, we highlight the
challenge of navigating the landscape of the cost function, and how the
landscape can be modified by sensor placement. In turbulent channel flow, the
Taylor microscale and Lyapunov timescale place restrictions on the resolution
of observations that ensure an accurate reconstruction of all the scales. The
notion of domain of dependence of an observation is introduced and related to
the Hessian of the cost function. For measurements of wall stress, the
eigenspectrum of the Hessian demonstrates the sensitivity of short-time
observations to the near-wall turbulent scales and to outer large scales. At
long times, backward chaos obfuscates the interpretation of the data:
observations that are infinitesimally close may be traced back to entirely
different earlier flow states--a dual to the more common butterfly effect for
forward trajectories.

stochastic processes observed in neuronal circuits. However, it is not observed
directly and, in order to create branching-like processes, the observed spike
time series is processed by attaching time bins to spikes. It has been shown
that results such as criticality and size distributions depend on the chosen
time bin. A different methodology whose results do not depend on the choice of
time bin might therefore be useful and is proposed in this article.
  The new methodology circumvents using time bins altogether by replacing the
previously used discrete-time models by continuous-time models. First, the
article introduces and characterises a continuous-time version of the branching
process with immigration, which will be called pumped branching process, and
second, it presents an analytical derivation of the corresponding spike
statistics, which can be directly compared to observed spike time series. The
presented approach allows determining the degree of criticality, the average
number of overlapping avalanches, and other observables without using a time
bin. Furthermore, the effects caused by using time bins are analyzed and the
influence of temporal and spatial subsampling discussed, all of which is
compared to experimental data and supported by Monte Carlo simulations.

hostile to the evolution of protoplanetary disks, driving mass loss by external
photoevaporation and shortening disk-dissipation timescales. Their effect may
also reduce the timescale of angular momentum exchanges between the disk and
host star during the early pre-main-sequence phase. To improve our
understanding of the environmental influence on the rotational history of
stars, we developed a model that considers the influence of the local
far-ultraviolet radiation on the spin evolution of low mass stars. Our model
includes an assumption of disk-locking, which fixes the rotation rate during
the star-disk-interaction phase, with the duration of this phase parametrised
as a function of the local far-ultraviolet radiation and stellar mass (in the
range 0.1--1.3 M$_\odot$). In this way, we demonstrate how the feedback from
massive stars can significantly influence the spin evolution of stars and
explain the mass-dependency observed in period-mass distributions of young
regions like Upper Sco and NGC 2264. The high far-ultraviolet environments of
high-mass stars can skew the period distribution of surrounding stars towards
fast-rotation, explaining the excess of fast-rotating stars in the open cluster
h Per. The proposed link between rotation and the pre-main-sequence environment
opens new avenues for interpreting the rotational distributions of young stars.
For example, we suggest that stellar rotation may be used as a tracer for the
primordial ultraviolet irradiation for stars up to $\sim$1 Gyr, which offers a
potential method to connect mature planetary systems to their birth
environment.

sequences of terms from $G$ with maximal length $|S|=2n-2+k$ that fail to
contain a nontrivial zero-sum subsequence of length at most $2n-1-k$. For
$k\leq 1$, this is the inverse question for the Davenport Constant. For
$k=n-1$, this is the inverse question for the $\eta(G)$ invariant concerning
short zero-sum subsequences. The structure in both these cases (known
respectively as Property B and Property C) was established in a two-step
process: first verifying the multiplicative property that, if the structural
description holds when $n=n_1$ and $n=n_2$, then it holds when $n=n_1n_2$, and
then resolving the case $n$ prime separately. When $n$ is prime, the structural
characterization for $k\in [2,\frac{2n+1}{3}]$ was recently established,
showing $S$ must have the form $S=e_1^{[n-1]}\boldsymbol{\cdot}e_2^{[n
-1]}\boldsymbol{\cdot} (e_1+e_2)^{[k]}$ for some basis $(e_1,e_2)$ for $G$. It
was conjectured that this also holds for $k\in [2,n-2]$ (when $n$ is prime). In
this paper, we extend this conjecture by dropping the restriction that $n$ be
prime and establish the following multiplicative result. Suppose $k=k_mn+k_n$
with $k_m\in [0,m-1]$ and $k_n\in [0,n-1]$. If the conjectured structure holds
for $k_m$ in $C_m\oplus C_m$ and for $k_n$ in $C_n\oplus C_n$, then it holds
for $k$ in $C_{mn}\oplus C_{mn}$. This reduces the full characterization
question for $n$ and $k$ to the prime case. Combined with known results, this
unconditionally establishes the structure for extremal sequences in
$G=C_{n}\oplus C_{n}$ in many cases, including when $n$ is only divisible by
primes at most $7$, when $n\geq 2$ is a prime power and $k\leq \frac{2n+1}{3}$,
or when $n$ is composite and $k=n-d-1$ or $n-2d+1$ for a proper, nontrivial
divisor $d\mid n$.

permissioned blockchain technologies for large-scale deployments. Permissioned
blockchains typically exhibit low latencies, compared to permissionless
deployments -- however at the cost of poor scalability. Various solutions were
proposed to capture ""the best of both worlds"", targeting low latency and high
scalability simultaneously, the most prominent technique being blockchain
sharding. However, most existing sharding proposals exploit features of the
permissionless model and are therefore restricted to cryptocurrency
applications.
  We present MITOSIS, a novel approach to practically improve scalability of
permissioned blockchains. Our system allows the dynamic creation of
blockchains, as more participants join the system, to meet practical
scalability requirements. Crucially, it enables the division of an existing
blockchain (and its participants) into two -- reminiscent of mitosis, the
biological process of cell division. MITOSIS inherits the low latency of
permissioned blockchains while preserving high throughput via parallel
processing. Newly created chains in our system are fully autonomous, can choose
their own consensus protocol, and yet they can interact with each other to
share information and assets -- meeting high levels of interoperability. We
analyse the security of MITOSIS and evaluate experimentally the performance of
our solution when instantiated over Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that
MITOSIS can be ported with little modifications and manageable overhead to
existing permissioned blockchains, such as Hyperledger Fabric.

fundamental point of view, but also from a practical one due to the
difficulties in visualizing phases with similar refraction indices. An
additional challenge arises when the multiphase flow to be observed occurs in
the sub-millimetric range. A common solution in experimental fluid dynamics is
the addition of a color dye for contrast enhancement. However, added dyes can
act as surface-active agents and significantly influence the observed
phenomena. In the recently reported Marangoni bursting phenomenon, where a
binary droplet on top of an oil bath is atomized in thousands of smaller

the use of color dyes is naturally tempting. In this work, we quantify
experimentally the significant influence of added methyl blue dye, as well as
the obtained contrast enhancement. We find that the reaction of the system to
such an additive is far from trivial and brings an opportunity to learn about
such a complex phenomenon. Additionally, we propose a simple method to analyze
the contrast enhancement as a function of dye concentration, with the aim of
finding the minimum concentration of dye for successful imaging in similar

skills from raw images that can be sequenced to complete long-horizon
visuomotor tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for
acquiring short-horizon skills autonomously. However, the focus of RL
algorithms has largely been on the success of those individual skills, more so
than learning and grounding a large repertoire of skills that can be sequenced
to complete extended multi-stage tasks. The latter demands robustness and
persistence, as errors in skills can compound over time, and may require the
robot to have a number of primitive skills in its repertoire, rather than just
one. To this end, we introduce EMBER, a model-based RL method for learning
primitive skills that are suitable for completing long-horizon visuomotor
tasks. EMBER learns and plans using a learned model, critic, and success
classifier, where the success classifier serves both as a reward function for
RL and as a grounding mechanism to continuously detect if the robot should
retry a skill when unsuccessful or under perturbations. Further, the learned
model is task-agnostic and trained using data from all skills, enabling the
robot to efficiently learn a number of distinct primitives. These visuomotor
primitive skills and their associated pre- and post-conditions can then be
directly combined with off-the-shelf symbolic planners to complete long-horizon
tasks. On a Franka Emika robot arm, we find that EMBER enables the robot to
complete three long-horizon visuomotor tasks at 85% success rate, such as
organizing an office desk, a file cabinet, and drawers, which require
sequencing up to 12 skills, involve 14 unique learned primitives, and demand
generalization to novel objects.

across different areas within a region of interest. The number of cases in an
area is often assumed to follow a Poisson distribution whose mean is decomposed
as the product between an offset and the logarithm of the disease's relative
risk. The log risk may be written as the sum of fixed effects and latent random
effects. The commonly used BYM model further decomposes the latent effects into
a sum of independent effects and spatial effects to account for potential
overdispersion and a spatial correlation structure among the counts. However,
this model suffers from an identifiably issue. The BYM2 model reparametrises
the latter by decomposing each latent effect into a weighted sum of independent
and spatial effects. We build on the BYM2 model to allow for heavy-tailed
latent effects and accommodate potentially outlying risks, after accounting for
the fixed effects. We assume a scale mixture structure wherein the variance of
the latent process changes across areas and allows for outlier identification.
We explore two prior specifications of this scale mixture structure in
simulation studies and in the analysis of Zika cases from the 2015-2016
epidemic in Rio de Janeiro. The simulation studies show that, in terms of WAIC
and outlier detection, the two parametrisations always perform well compared to
commonly used models. Our analysis of Zika cases finds 19 districts of Rio as
potential outliers, after accounting for the socio-development index, which may
help prioritise interventions.

well-studied notions, namely vertex cover and tree-depth, and that has recently
gained attention as a structural graph parameter. In this paper we investigate
the algorithmic trade-offs involved with this parameter from the point of view
of algorithmic meta-theorems for First-Order (FO) and Monadic Second Order
(MSO) logic. Our positive results are the following: (i) given a graph $G$ of
vertex integrity $k$ and an FO formula $\phi$ with $q$ quantifiers, deciding if
$G$ satisfies $\phi$ can be done in time $2^{O(k^2q+q\log q)}+n^{O(1)}$; (ii)
for MSO formulas with $q$ quantifiers, the same can be done in time
$2^{2^{O(k^2+kq)}}+n^{O(1)}$. Both results are obtained using kernelization
arguments, which pre-process the input to sizes $2^{O(k^2)}q$ and
$2^{O(k^2+kq)}$ respectively.
  The complexities of our meta-theorems are significantly better than the
corresponding meta-theorems for tree-depth, which involve towers of
exponentials. However, they are worse than the roughly $2^{O(kq)}$ and
$2^{2^{O(k+q)}}$ complexities known for corresponding meta-theorems for vertex
cover. To explain this deterioration we present two formula constructions which
lead to fine-grained complexity lower bounds and establish that the dependence
of our meta-theorems on $k$ is best possible. More precisely, we show that it
is not possible to decide FO formulas with $q$ quantifiers in time
$2^{o(k^2q)}$, and that there exists a constant-size MSO formula which cannot
be decided in time $2^{2^{o(k^2)}}$, both under the ETH. Hence, the quadratic
blow-up in the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable and vertex integrity has a
complexity for FO and MSO logic which is truly intermediate between vertex
cover and tree-depth.

structure on the global expansion of the Universe. The main question
surrounding this phenomenon is whether or not it is important enough to lead to
measurable effects on the scale factor evolution eventually explaining its
acceleration or the Hubble tension. One of the most important result on this
subject is the Buchert-Ehlers theorem (Buchert \& Ehlers, 1997) stating that
backreaction is exactly zero when calculated using Newton's theory of
gravitation, which may not be the case in general relativity. It is generally
said that this result implies that backreaction is a purely relativistic
effect. We will show that this is not necessarily the case, in the sense that
this implication does not apply to a universe which is still well described by
Newton's theory on small scales but has a non-Euclidean topology. The theorem
should therefore be generalised to account for such a scenario. In a heuristic
calculation where we construct a theory which is locally Newtonian but defined
on a non-Euclidean topology, we show that backreaction is non-zero, meaning
that it might be non-relativistic depending on the topological class of our
Universe. However, that construction is not unique and remains to be justified
from a non-relativistic limit of general relativity.

binding potential, we report a new symmetry operation of the electronic
coordinates. The symmetry operation is such that it leads to the equality of
the transformed wave function to the wave function. This equality is referred
to as the Wave Function Identity. The symmetry operation is a two-step process:
an interchange of the spatial coordinates of the electrons whilst keeping their
spin moments unchanged, followed by an inversion. The Identity is valid for
arbitrary structure of the binding potential, arbitrary electron interaction of
the form $w(|{\bf{r}} - {\bf{r}}'|)$, all bound electronic states, and
arbitrary dimensionality. It is proved that the exact wave functions satisfy
the Identity. On application of the permutation operation for fermions to the
identity, it is shown that the parity of the singlet states is even and that of
triplet states odd. As a consequence, it follows that at electron-electron
coalescence, the singlet state wave functions satisfy the cusp coalescence
constraint, and triplet state wave functions the node coalescence condition.
Further, we show that the parity of the singlet state wave functions about all
points of electron-electron coalescence is even, and that of the triplet state
wave functions odd. The Wave Function Identity and the properties on parity,
together with the Pauli principle, are then elucidated by application to the

spatiotemporal properties and relations in the context of Quantum Gravity (QG).
As we will show, in both Loop Quantum Gravity and in String Theory, these
observables are non-commuting ones. By analogy with some recent arguments put
forward in the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM), we shall
propose to interpret these physical quantities as ontologically indeterminate
-- i.e., indeterminate in a non-epistemic, mind-independent way. This result
has two important consequences for current debates in philosophy of physics.
First, it shows that ontological indeterminacy may extend well beyond the
non-relativistic case, thereby also suggesting a conceptual continuity between
QM and QG. Second, when applied to QG, the notion of indeterminacy may provide
a unified philosophical framework for understanding very distinct approaches
that are usually considered incompatible.

effect of 3 factors on the transfer: the number of teacher languages with
document level data, the balance between document and sentence level data at
training, and the data condition of parallel documents (genuine vs.
backtranslated). Our experiments on Europarl-7 and IWSLT-10 show the
feasibility of multilingual transfer for DocNMT, particularly on
document-specific metrics. We observe that more teacher languages and adequate

transfer is less sensitive to the data condition, where multilingual DocNMT
delivers decent performance with either backtranslated or genuine document

properties of the interstellar medium and YMCs. Compared with a controlled
simulation of an isolated galaxy, the mass fraction of dense and high-pressure
gas is much higher in mergers. Consequently, the mass function of both
molecular clouds and YMCs becomes shallower and extends to higher masses.
Moreover, cluster formation efficiency is significantly enhanced and correlates
positively with the star formation rate surface density and gas pressure. We
track the orbits of YMCs and investigate the time evolution of tidal fields
during the course of the merger. At an early stage of the merger, the tidal
field strength correlates positively with YMC mass, $\lambda_{\rm tid}\propto
M^{0.71}$, which systematically affects the shape of the mass function and age
distribution of the YMCs. At later times, most YMCs closely follow the orbits
of their host galaxies, gradually sinking into the center of the merger remnant
due to dynamical friction, and are quickly dissolved via efficient tidal
disruption. Interestingly, YMCs formed during the first passage, mostly in
tidal tails and bridges, are distributed over a wide range of galactocentric
radii, greatly increasing their survivability because of the much weaker tidal
field in the outskirts of the merger system. These YMCs are promising
candidates for globular clusters that survive to the present day.

eccentricities are resonantly driven by convective flows somehow made coherent
when the turnover time matches the tidally locked red giant's spin period,
which is also the tidal forcing period. Numerical simulations of rotating red
giants and magnetic field studies of stars show some evidence for especially

characterize conventional MSPs, in good agreement with observations ($t_{\rm

events on a pathway of a binary to become a gravitational wave source, an X-ray

survival, while strong kicks frequently disrupt the binary. In this article, we
aim to further constrain neutron star natal kicks in binaries. We explore
binary population synthesis models by varying prescription for natal kick,
remnant mass and mass accretion efficiency. We introduce a robust statistical
technique to analyse combined observations of different nature. Using this
technique, we further test different models using parallax and proper motion
measurements for young isolated radio pulsars and similar measurements for
Galactic Be X-ray binaries. Our best model for natal kicks is consistent with
both measurements and contains a fraction of $w=0.2\pm 0.1$ weak natal kicks

the high-velocity component, same as in previous works: $\sigma_2 = 336$ km/s.
We found that currently used models for natal kicks of neutron stars produced
by electron capture supernova (combination of maxwellian $\sigma=265$ km/s and
$\sigma = 30$ km/s for electron capture) are inconsistent or marginally
consistent with parallaxes and proper motions measured for isolated radio

the estimation of the mean stellar age and metallicity, addressing the question
of which signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) are needed to determine these quantities.
To address this problem we used simulated spectra containing stellar and
nebular emission, reproducing the evolution of a galaxy for a constant and
exponentially declining star formation law. The spectra have been degraded to
different S/N and analysed with three different spectral synthesis codes: FADO,
STARLIGHT, and STECKMAP assuming similar fitting set-ups and the same spectral
bases. For S/N > 5 all tools considered show a large diversity in the results.
FADO and STARLIGHT find median differences in light-weighted mean stellar ages
of ~0.1 dex, while STECKMAP shows a higher value of ~0.2 dex. For S/N > 50 the
median differences in FADO are ~0.03 dex (~7%), a factor 3 and 4 lower than the
0.08 dex (~20%) and 0.11 dex (~30%) obtained from STARLIGHT and STECKMAP,
respectively. Our results indicate that phases of high specific star formation
rate (sSFR) in galaxies require analysis tools that do not neglect the nebular
continuum emission in the fitting process, since purely stellar models would
have strong problems in the estimation of star formation history, even in
presence of high S/N spectra.
  The median values of these differences are of the order of 7% (FADO), 20%
(STARLIGHT), and 30% (STECKMAP) for light-weighted quantities, and 20% (FADO),
60% (STARLIGHT), and 20% (STECKMAP) for mass-weighted quantities. That implies
a severe overestimation of the mass-to-light ratio and stellar mass, even in
the presence of a mild contribution from the nebular continuum. Our work
underlines the importance of a self-consistent treatment of nebular emission,
which is the only route towards a reliable determination of the assembly of any
high-sSFR galaxy.

two-dimensional (2D) distribution of Si II line depths (Branch plot). In this
paper, we study the polarization signature associated with the 2D asymmetric
ejecta of the collision model and a double-detonation model using similar
TARDIS radiative transfer simulations along different lines of sight with a
spherical photosphere, combined with a new 3D Monte Carlo polarization code. We
show that the polarization $Q$ can be parametrized as a product
$Q=Q_{\max}Q_{\rm{x}}$ of a radial structure component $Q_{\max}$ which is
insensitive to the model specifics and is shown to be universally around
$Q_{\max}\sim 5\%$, and a cancellation component $Q_{\rm{x}}$ which depends on
the asymmetry details. The continuum polarization is found to be low for both
the collision and double-detonation models with $Q\sim 0.5\%$. However, the
irregular Si distribution in the 2D head-on collision model results in Si II
line polarization reaching $Q\sim 3\%$ ($Q_{\rm{x}} \lesssim 50\%$) in tension
with observations (mostly $\lesssim 1.2\%$). In contrast, we show that the
double-detonation model also covers the Branch plot, and yet results in low
line polarization $Q\lesssim 0.7\%$ ($Q_{\rm{x}} \sim 10\%$) consistent with
previous results and most SNe Ia. These results strengthen the case for

show that a solidlike tissue responds linearly only to small strains and but

$z_\mathrm{re}(\boldsymbol{x})$ assuming that hydrogen gas encountering higher
radiation intensity are photoionized earlier. Redshift values are assigned
while matching the abundance of ionized mass according to a given mass-weighted
ionization fraction $\bar{x}_\mathrm{i}(z)$. The code has the unique advantage
of allowing users to directly specify the reionization history through the
redshift midpoint $z_\mathrm{mid}$, duration $\Delta_\mathrm{z}$, and asymmetry
$A_\mathrm{z}$ input parameters. The reionization process is further controlled
through the minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{min}$ for galaxy formation and the
radiation mean free path $l_\mathrm{mfp}$ for radiative transfer. We implement
improved methods for constructing density, velocity, halo, and radiation
fields, which are essential components for modeling reionization observables.
We compare AMBER with two other semi-numerical methods and find that our code
more accurately reproduces the results from radiation-hydrodynamic simulations.
The parallelized code is over four orders of magnitude faster than radiative
transfer simulations and will efficiently enable large-volume models, full-sky

encode graph structures in low-dimensional vector spaces via a message passing
heuristic between neighboring nodes. Over the recent years, a multitude of

hardware, this leads to a significant speedup and memory reduction while
maintaining a competitive performance level. Moreover, we extend the frozen

studies conclude that the contribution of dust-obscured galaxies to the cosmic

of their growth has long been of interest, yet fundamental debates about the
effects of firm size on growth have persisted. Here we develop a scaling
framework that focuses on company size as the critical feature determining a
variety of tradeoffs, and use this to reveal novel systematic behavior across
the diversity of publicly-traded companies. Using a large database of 31,553 US
companies over nearly 70 years, and 3,160 Chinese companies over 24 year, we
show how the dynamics of companies expressed as scaling relationships leads to
a quantitative, analytic theory for their growth. This theory produces several
predictions that are in good agreement with data for both the US and China,
whose markets have strikingly different histories and underlying structures. In
both cases sales scale sublinearly with assets and exhibit nearly identical
exponents leading, surprisingly and nontrivially, to assets that grow as a
power law in time rather than exponentially, as often assumed. On the other
hand, liabilities scale linearly in the US (exponent of $1.0$) but
superlinearly in China (exponent of $1.09$). We show that such small
differences in scaling exponents can have a significant impact on the character
and long-term evolution of growth trajectories. These results illustrate that
while companies are part of a larger class of growth phenomena driven by
incomes and costs that scale with size, they are unique in that they grow
following a temporal power-function which sets them apart from organisms,
cities, nations, and markets, whose growth over time is often exponential.

Universe was three billion years old. Very low amounts of molecular gas appear
responsible for this, at least in some cases, though morphological gas
stabilization, shock heating, or activity associated with accretion onto a
central supermassive black hole is invoked in other cases. Recent studies of
quenching by gas depletion have been based upon upper limits that are
insufficiently sensitive to determine this robustly, or stacked emission with
its problems of averaging. Here we report 1.3mm observations of dust emission
from six strongly lensed galaxies where star formation has been quenched, with
magnifications of up to a factor of 30. Four of the six galaxies are undetected
in dust emission, with an estimated upper limit on the dust mass of 0.0001
times the stellar mass, and by proxy (assuming a Milky Way molecular
gas-to-dust ratio) 0.01 times the stellar mass in molecular gas. This is two
orders of magnitude less molecular gas per unit stellar mass than seen in star
forming galaxies at similar redshifts. It remains difficult to extrapolate from
these small samples, but these observations establish that gas depletion is
responsible for a cessation of star formation in some fraction of high-redshift
galaxies.

perform only a local search to solve a complex non-convex optimization problem.
As a result, they cannot capture the multi-modal characteristic of human
driving. A global optimizer can be a potential solution but is computationally
intractable in a real-time setting. In this paper, we present a real-time MPC
capable of searching over different driving modalities. Our basic idea is
simple: we run several goal-directed parallel trajectory optimizations and
score the resulting trajectories based on user-defined meta cost functions.
This allows us to perform a global search over several locally optimal motion
plans. Although conceptually straightforward, realizing this idea in real-time
with existing optimizers is highly challenging from technical and computational
standpoints. With this motivation, we present a novel batch non-holonomic
trajectory optimization whose underlying matrix algebra is easily
parallelizable across problem instances and reduces to computing large batch
matrix-vector products. This structure, in turn, is achieved by deriving a
linearization-free multi-convex reformulation of the non-holonomic kinematics
and collision avoidance constraints. We extensively validate our approach using
both synthetic and real data sets (NGSIM) of traffic scenarios. We highlight
how our algorithm automatically takes lane-change and overtaking decisions
based on the defined meta cost function. Our batch optimizer achieves
trajectories with lower meta cost, up to 6x faster than competing baselines.

the opportunity to characterize material from extrasolar planetary and stellar
systems up close. The forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) will provide an unprecedented increase in sensitivity to
these objects compared to the capabilities of currently operational
observational facilities. We generate a synthetic population of `Oumuamua-like
objects drawn from their galactic kinematics, and identify the distribution of
impact parameters, eccentricities, hyperbolic velocities and sky locations of
objects detectable with the LSST, assuming no cometary activity. This
population is characterized by a clustering of trajectories in the direction of
the solar apex and anti-apex, centered at orbital inclinations of
$\sim90^\circ$. We identify the ecliptic or solar apex as the optimal sky
locations to search for future interstellar objects as a function of survey
limiting magnitude. Moreover, we identify the trajectories of detectable
objects that will be reachable for \textit{in-situ} rendezvous with a dedicated
mission with the capabilities of the forthcoming \textit{Comet Interceptor} or
proposed \textit{Bridge} concept. By scaling our fractional population
statistics with the inferred spatial number density, we estimate that the LSST
will detect of order $\sim 15$ interstellar objects over the course of its
$\sim10$ year observational campaign. Furthermore, we find that there should be
$\sim1-3$ and $\sim0.0007-0.001$ reachable targets for missions with propulsion
capabilities comparable to \textit{Bridge} and \textit{Comet Interceptor},

rearrangements. Since all polygons deform in the same way, we only need to
analyze the ground states and the response to deformations of a single polygon

rigid/incompatible state. %The rigid solid-like state has a single gapped

deformation protocols and discover that at the onset of rigidity, where a
single zero-energy ground-state exists, %We show that in the incompatible

to describe the mechanical response to even infinitesimal deformations. In

coordinate transformation to retain eigen-directions that are highly observable
and reachable. To address realizability and scalability of BT applied to highly
stiff and lightly-damped systems, a non-intrusive data-driven method is
developed for balancing discrete-time systems via the eigensystem realization
algorithm (ERA). The advantage of ERA for balancing transformation makes
full-state outputs tractable. Further, ERA enables balancing despite stiffness,
by eliminating computation of balancing modes and adjoint simulations. As a
demonstrative example, we create balanced ROMs for a one-dimensional reactive
flow with pressure forcing, where the stiffness introduced by the chemical
source term is extreme (condition number $10^{13}$), preventing analytical
implementation of BT. We investigate the performance of ROMs in prediction of
dynamics with unseen forcing inputs and demonstrate stability and accuracy of
balanced ROMs in truly predictive scenarios whereas without ERA, POD-Galerkin
and Least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projections fail to represent the true
dynamics. We show that after the initial transients under unit impulse forcing,
the system undergoes lightly-damped oscillations, which magnifies the influence
of sampling properties on predictive performance of the balanced ROMs. We
propose an output domain decomposition approach and couple it with tangential
interpolation to resolve sharp gradients at reduced computational costs.

satisfactory results in applying machine learning to extract features that are

methods can capture malware patterns from many different malware families and
improve malware detection speed. On the other hand, recent research has also
shown adversarial attacks against such visualization-based malware detection.
Attackers can generate adversarial examples by perturbing the malware binary in
non-reachable regions, such as padding at the end of the binary. Alternatively,
attackers can perturb the malware image embedding and then verify the
executability of the malware post-transformation. One major limitation of the
first attack scenario is that a simple pre-processing step can remove the
perturbations before classification. For the second attack scenario, it is hard
to maintain the original malware's executability and functionality. In this

slowly-shrinking circular boundaries, under contact forces with friction. We
perform computations with a spring-lattice model that deforms like a thin
inextensible filament of uniform bending stiffness. Early in the deformation,
two lobes of the filament make contact. If the friction coefficient is small
enough, one lobe slides inside the other; otherwise, the lobes move together or
one lobe bifurcates the other. There follows a sequence of deformations that is
a mixture of spiraling and bifurcations, primarily the former with small
friction and the latter with large friction. With zero friction, a simple model
predicts that the maximum curvature and the total elastic energy scale as the
wall radius to the -3/2 and -2 powers respectively. With nonzero friction, the
elastic energy follows a similar scaling but with a prefactor up to 8 times
larger, due to delayering and bending with a range of small curvatures. For
friction coefficients as large as 1, the deformations are qualitatively similar
with and without friction at the outer wall. Above 1, the wall friction case
becomes dominated by buckling near the wall.

trading in an accurate model of contemporary financial markets. At any one
time, every trader in the market is trying to make as much profit as possible
given the current distribution of different other trading strategies that it
finds itself pitched against in the market; but the distribution of trading
strategies and their observable behaviors is constantly changing, and changes
in any one trader are driven to some extent by the changes in all the others.
Prior studies of coevolutionary dynamics in markets have concentrated on
systems where traders can choose one of a small number of fixed pure
strategies, and can change their choice occasionally, thereby giving a market
with a discrete phase-space, made up of a finite set of possible system states.
Here we present first results from two independent sets of experiments, where
we use minimal-intelligence trading-agents but in which the space of possible
strategies is continuous and hence infinite. Our work reveals that by taking
only a small step in the direction of increased realism we move immediately
into high-dimensional phase-spaces, which then present difficulties in
visualising and understanding the coevolutionary dynamics unfolding within the
system. We conclude that further research is required to establish better
analytic tools for monitoring activity and progress in co-adapting markets. We
have released relevant Python code as open-source on GitHub, to enable others

selecting a Web service for each task of a composite Web service from a pool of
candidate Web services. In contrast to the existing approaches, all global QoS
constraints, interservice constraints, and transactional constraints are
considered simultaneously. At first, all candidate Web services are scored and
ranked per each task using the proposed mechanism. Then, the top 20 percent of
the candidate Web services of each task are considered as the candidate Web
services of the corresponding task to reduce the problem search space. Finally,
the Web service selection problem is solved by focusing only on these 20
percent candidate Web services of each task using a genetic algorithm.
Empirical studies demonstrate this approach leads to a higher efficiency and
efficacy as compared with the case that all the candidate Web services are
considered in solving the problem.

the local nature of the patterns involved. With numerical optimization methods
such as gradient boosting, ensembles of local decision rules can gain good
predictive performance on data involving global structure. Meanwhile, machine
learning models are being increasingly used to solve problems in high-stake
domains including healthcare and finance. Here, there is an emerging consensus
regarding the need for practitioners to understand whether and how those models
could perform robustly in the deployment environments, in the presence of
distributional shifts. Past research on local decision rules has focused mainly
on maximizing discriminant patterns, without due consideration of robustness
against distributional shifts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new
method to learn and ensemble local decision rules, that are robust both in the
training and deployment environments. Specifically, we propose to leverage
causal knowledge by regarding the distributional shifts in subpopulations and
deployment environments as the results of interventions on the underlying
system. We propose two regularization terms based on causal knowledge to search
for optimal and stable rules. Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark
datasets show that our method is effective and robust against distributional
shifts in multiple environments.

viscoelastic fluid, forms a natural setting to study the emergence of
nonreciprocity during a dynamical phase transition. At these densities, the
transport of active particles is strongly influenced by the passive medium and
shows a dynamical jamming transition as a function of activity and medium
density. In the process, the compressible medium is actively churned up -for
low activity, the active particle gets self-trapped in a spherical cavity of
its own making, while for large activity, the active particle ploughs through
the medium, either accompanied by a moving anisotropic wake, or leaving a
porous trail. A hydrodynamic approach makes it evident that the active particle
generates a long range density wake which breaks fore-aft symmetry, consistent
with the simulations. Accounting for the back reaction of the compressible
medium leads to (i) dynamical jamming of the active particle, and (ii) a
dynamical non-reciprocal attraction between two active particles moving along
the same direction, with the trailing particle catching up with the leading one
in finite time. We emphasize that these nonreciprocal effects appear only when
the active particles are moving and so manifest in the vicinity of the
jamming-unjamming transition.

extracted from environmental objects for ground robots with fixed mount
monocular cameras. The proposed algorithm is robust to changes in the starting
pose of the camera/robot, where a pose is defined as the planar position plus
the orientation around the vertical axis. VTR consists of a teach phase in
which a robot moves in a prescribed path, and a repeat phase in which the robot
tries to repeat the same path starting from the same or a different pose. Most
available VTR algorithms are pose dependent and cannot perform well in the
repeat phase when starting from an initial pose far from that of the teach
phase. To achieve more robust pose independency, the key is to generate a 3D
semantic map of the environment containing the camera trajectory and the
positions of surrounding objects during the teach phase. For specific
implementation, we use ORB-SLAM to collect the camera poses and the 3D point
clouds of the environment, and YOLOv3 to detect objects in the environment. We
then combine the two outputs to build the semantic map. In the repeat phase, we
relocalize the robot based on the detected objects and the stored semantic map.
The robot is then able to move toward the teach path, and repeat it in both
forward and backward directions. We have tested the proposed algorithm in
different scenarios and compared it with two most relevant recent studies.
Also, we compared our algorithm with two image-based relocalization methods.
One is purely based on ORB-SLAM and the other combines Superglue and RANSAC.
The results show that our algorithm is much more robust with respect to pose
variations as well as environmental alterations. Our code and data are

POSL can leverage a diversity of candidate algorithms, including online

orthonormality when acting on the subspace to be recovered. Among the most

paper, we propose modewise measurement schemes based on sub-gaussian and
randomized Fourier measurements. These modewise operators act on the pairs or
other small subsets of the tensor modes separately. They require significantly
less memory than the measurements working on the vectorized tensor, provably
satisfy the tensor restricted isometry property and experimentally can recover
the tensor data from fewer measurements and do not require impractical storage.

both classification and uncertainty quantification for regression. For joint
density estimation, minimax rates have been characterized for general density
classes in terms of uniform (metric) entropy, a well-studied notion of
statistical capacity. When applying these results to conditional density
estimation, the use of uniform entropy -- which is infinite when the covariate
space is unbounded and suffers from the curse of dimensionality -- can lead to
suboptimal rates. Consequently, minimax rates for conditional density
estimation cannot be characterized using these classical results.
  We resolve this problem for well-specified models, obtaining matching (within
logarithmic factors) upper and lower bounds on the minimax Kullback--Leibler
risk in terms of the empirical Hellinger entropy for the conditional density
class. The use of empirical entropy allows us to appeal to concentration
arguments based on local Rademacher complexity, which -- in contrast to uniform
entropy -- leads to matching rates for large, potentially nonparametric classes
and captures the correct dependence on the complexity of the covariate space.

activated deep learning models that have sublinear compute costs with respect

MoE offers opportunities for drastically growing model size with significant
accuracy gain while consuming much lower compute budget. However, supporting
large scale MoE training also has its own set of system and modeling
challenges. To overcome the challenges and embrace the opportunities of MoE, we
first develop a system capable of scaling MoE models efficiently to trillions
of parameters. It combines multi-dimensional parallelism and heterogeneous
memory technologies harmoniously with MoE to empower 8x larger models on the
same hardware compared with existing work. Besides boosting system efficiency,
we also present new training methods to improve MoE sample efficiency and
leverage expert pruning strategy to improve inference time efficiency. By
combining the efficient system and training methods, we are able to
significantly scale up large multitask multilingual models for language
generation which results in a great improvement in model accuracy. A model
trained with 10 billion parameters on 50 languages can achieve state-of-the-art
performance in Machine Translation (MT) and multilingual natural language

decoding algorithms used for polar codes and their variants. Rewinding this
process seems trivial if we have access to all intermediate log-likelihood
ratios (LLRs) and partial sums. However, as the block length increases,
retaining all of the intermediate information becomes inefficient and
impractical. Rewinding the SC process in a memory-efficient way is a problem
that we address in this paper. We first explore the properties of the SC
process based on the binary representation of the bit indices by introducing a
new operator used for grouping the bit indices. This special grouping helps us
in finding the closest bit index to the target index for rewinding. We also
analytically prove that this approach gives access to the untouched
intermediate information stored in the memory which is essential in resuming
the SC process. Then, we adapt the proposed approach to multiple rewinds and
apply it on SC-flip decoding and shifted-pruning based list decoding. The
numerical evaluation of the proposed solution shows a significant reduction of
>=50% in the complexity of the additional decoding attempts at medium and high
SNR regimes for SC-flip decoding and less for shifted-pruning based list
decoding.

non-Gaussian (intermittent) features that monotonically increase with the

$s$-PDF for an ensemble of 36 sub-to-trans-Alf\'venic mean-field, supersonic,
isothermal turbulence simulations with different modes of driving, relevant to
molecular gas in the cool interstellar medium, we show that a more intricate

measures of the non-Gaussian components, we find hydrodynamical-like structure
in the highly magnetised plasma for $\mathcal{M} \lesssim 4$. However, for
$\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 4$, the non-Gaussian signatures disappear, leaving
approximately Gaussian $s$-statistics -- exactly the opposite of hydrodynamical

$\varepsilon$-far (in total variation distance) from uniformity. Our results
reveal various interesting phase transitions which depend on the interplay of
the sample size $n$ and the signal strength $\varepsilon$ with the dimension
$d$ and the sparsity level $s$. For instance, if the sample size is less than a
threshold (which depends on $d$ and $s$), then all tests are asymptotically
powerless, irrespective of the magnitude of the signal strength. On the other
hand, if the sample size is above the threshold, then the detection boundary
undergoes a further phase transition depending on the signal strength. Here, a
$\chi^2$-type test attains the detection boundary in the dense regime, whereas
in the sparse regime a Bonferroni correction of two maximum-type tests and a
version of the Higher Criticism test is optimal up to sharp constants. These
results combined provide a complete description of the phase diagram for the
sparse uniformity testing problem across all regimes of the parameters $n$,

discrete-time systems turns out to be a perfect analogy of the celebrated
Hirsch's limit-set dichotomy for continuous-time semiflows. In this paper, we
first present a sharpened dynamics alternative for $C^1$-smooth strongly
monotone discrete-time dissipative system $\{F_0^n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ (with
an attractor $A$), which concludes that there is a positive integer $m$ such
that any orbit is either manifestly unstable; or asymptotic to a linearly
stable cycle whose minimal period is bounded by $m$. Furthermore, we show the
$C^1$-robustness of the sharpened dynamics alternative, that is, for any
$C^1$-perturbed system $\{F_\epsilon^n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ ($F_\epsilon$ not
necessarily monotone), any orbit initiated nearby $A$ will admit the sharpened
dynamics alternative with the same $m$. The improved generic convergence to
cycles for the $C^1$-system $\{F_0^n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, as well as for the
perturbed system $\{F_\epsilon^n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, is thus obtained as
by-products of the sharpened dynamics alternative and its $C^1$-robustness. The
results are applied to nonlocal $C^1$-perturbations of a time-periodic

costs for communication and computation. This is due to the fact that most of
current FL frameworks only consider a star network topology where all local
trained models are aggregated at a single server (e.g., a cloud server). This
causes significant overhead at the server when the number of users are huge and
local models' sizes are large. This paper proposes a novel edge network
architecture which decentralizes the model aggregation process at the server,
thereby significantly reducing the aggregation latency of the whole network. In
this architecture, we propose a highly-effective in-network computation
protocol consisting of two components. First, an in-network aggregation process
is designed so that the majority of aggregation computations can be offloaded
from cloud server to edge nodes. Second, a joint routing and resource
allocation optimization problem is formulated to minimize the aggregation
latency for the whole system at every learning round. The problem turns out to
be NP-hard, and thus we propose a polynomial time routing algorithm which can
achieve near optimal performance with a theoretical bound. Numerical results
show that our proposed framework can dramatically reduce the network latency,
up to 4.6 times. Furthermore, this framework can significantly decrease cloud's
traffic and computing overhead by a factor of K/M, where K is the number of
users and M is the number of edge nodes, in comparison with conventional
baselines.

However, most existing dehazing methods emphasize more on haze removal but less
on the detail recovery of the dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a
single image dehazing method with an independent Detail Recovery Network (DRN),
which considers capturing the details from the input image over a separate
network and then integrates them into a coarse dehazed image. The overall
network consists of two independent networks, named DRN and the dehazing
network respectively. Specifically, the DRN aims to recover the dehazed image
details through local and global branches respectively. The local branch can
obtain local detail information through the convolution layer and the global
branch can capture more global information by the Smooth Dilated Convolution
(SDC). The detail feature map is fused into the coarse dehazed image to obtain
the dehazed image with rich image details. Besides, we integrate the DRN, the
physical-model-based dehazing network and the reconstruction loss into an
end-to-end joint learning framework. Extensive experiments on the public image

widespread applications including industrial gripping, surgical robotics and

science of the jamming phase transition, which has been rigorously studied in

vibration as a means to improve the properties of granular jamming grippers
through vibratory fluidisation and the exploitation of resonant modes within
the granular material. We show that vibration in soft jamming grippers can
improve holding strength, reduce the downwards force needed for the gripping
action, and lead to a simplified setup where the second air pump, generally
used for unjamming, could be removed. In a series of studies, we show that
frequency and amplitude of the waveforms are key determinants to performance,
and that jamming performance is also dependent on temporal properties of the
induced waveform. We hope to encourage further study in transitioning
fundamental jamming mechanisms into a soft robotics context to improve
performance and increase diversity of applications for granular jamming
grippers.

often outperform the unsupervised ones, but the training of the supervised
denoising models needs the corresponding clean labels, which is not always
avaiable due to the high labeling cost. On the other hand, those semantic
labels, such as the located soma positions, the reconstructed neuronal fibers,
and the nuclei segmentation result, are generally available and accumulated
from everyday neuroscience research. This work connects a supervised denoising
and a semantic segmentation model together to form a end-to-end model, which
can make use of the semantic labels while still provides a denoised image as an
intermediate product. We use both the supervised and the self-supervised models
for the denoising and introduce a new cost term for the joint denoising and the

transferable multi-modal representations from large-scale image-text data and
to achieve strong performances on a broad scope of vision-language tasks after
finetuning. Previous mainstream VLP approaches typically adopt a two-step
strategy relying on external object detectors to encode images in a multi-modal
Transformer framework, which suffer from restrictive object concept space,
limited image context and inefficient computation. In this paper, we propose an
object-aware end-to-end VLP framework, which directly feeds image grid features
from CNNs into the Transformer and learns the multi-modal representations
jointly. More importantly, we propose to perform object knowledge distillation
to facilitate learning cross-modal alignment at different semantic levels. To
achieve that, we design two novel pretext tasks by taking object features and
their semantic labels from external detectors as supervision: 1.) Object-guided
masked vision modeling task focuses on enforcing object-aware representation
learning in the multi-modal Transformer; 2.) Phrase-region alignment task aims
to improve cross-modal alignment by utilizing the similarities between noun
phrases and object labels in the linguistic space. Extensive experiments on a
wide range of vision-language tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
framework, and we achieve competitive or superior performances over the
existing pretraining strategies.

on the leader-board, they cannot meet users' requirements in practice, due to
their poor reasoning skills. The underlying reason is that most neural dialogue
models only capture the syntactic and semantic information, but fail to model
the logical consistency between the dialogue history and the generated
response. Recently, a new multi-turn dialogue reasoning task has been proposed,
to facilitate dialogue reasoning research. However, this task is challenging,
because there are only slight differences between the illogical response and
the dialogue history. How to effectively solve this challenge is still worth
exploring. This paper proposes a Fine-grained Comparison Model (FCM) to tackle
this problem. Inspired by human's behavior in reading comprehension, a
comparison mechanism is proposed to focus on the fine-grained differences in
the representation of each response candidate. Specifically, each candidate
representation is compared with the whole history to obtain a history
consistency representation. Furthermore, the consistency signals between each
candidate and the speaker's own history are considered to drive a model to
prefer a candidate that is logically consistent with the speaker's history
logic. Finally, the above consistency representations are employed to output a
ranking list of the candidate responses for multi-turn dialogue reasoning.
Experimental results on two public dialogue datasets show that our method
obtains higher ranking scores than the baseline models.

observational data derived from large administrative databases have massive
sample sizes and better generalizability, but they are prone to unmeasured
confounding bias. It is thus of considerable interest to reconcile effect
estimates obtained from randomized controlled trials and observational studies
investigating the same intervention, potentially harvesting the best from both
realms. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the potential efficiency
gain of integrating observational data into the RCT-based analysis from a
minimax point of view. For estimation, we derive the minimax rate of
convergence for the mean squared error, and propose a fully adaptive anchored
thresholding estimator that attains the optimal rate up to poly-log factors.
For inference, we characterize the minimax rate for the length of confidence

impossible. A curious phenomenon thus emerges: for estimation, the efficiency
gain from data integration can be achieved without prior knowledge on the
magnitude of the confounding bias; for inference, the same task becomes

them constantly function as social bridges without being embedded in local
networks. Using a novel cost-benefit analysis model combined with machine
learning, we show that long ties are highly beneficial, which instinctively
motivates people to expend extra effort to maintain them. This partly explains
why long ties are more persistent than what has been suggested by many existing
theories and models. Overall, our study suggests the need for social
interventions that can promote the formation of long ties, such as mixing
people with diverse backgrounds.

Such a blur is sometimes considered as just a noise, however, it sometimes
gives an important effect to add dynamism in the scene for photographs or
videos. Unlike the similar effects, such as defocus blur, which is now easily
controlled even by smartphones, motion blur is still uncontrollable and makes
undesired effects on photographs. In this paper, an unified framework to add
motion blur on per-object basis is proposed. In the method, multiple frames are
captured without motion blur and they are accumulated to create motion blur on
target objects. To capture images without motion blur, shutter speed must be
short, however, it makes captured images dark, and thus, a sensor gain should
be increased to compensate it. Since a sensor gain causes a severe noise on
image, we propose a color compensation algorithm based on non-linear filtering
technique for solution. Another contribution is that our technique can be used
to make HDR images for fast moving objects by using multi-exposure images. In
the experiments, effectiveness of the method is confirmed by ablation study
using several data sets.

For the first time, we show that the state of the outer radiation belt can be

any initial and boundary conditions. The most important features for
determining outer radiation belt dynamics are found to be AL, solar wind flow
speed and density, and SYM-H indices. ORIENT-R reproduces out-of-sample
relativistic electron fluxes with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 and an
uncertainty factor of ~2. ORIENT-R reproduces radiation belt dynamics during an
out-of-sample geomagnetic storm with good agreement to the observations. In
addition, ORIENT-R was run for a completely out-of-sample period between March
2018 and October 2019 when the AL index ended and was replaced with the
predicted AL index (lasp.colorado.edu/~lix). It reproduces electron fluxes with
a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and an out-of-sample uncertainty factor of
~3. Furthermore, ORIENT-R captured the trend in the electron fluxes from
low-earth-orbit (LEO) SAMPEX, which is a completely out-of-sample dataset both
temporally and spatially. In sum, the ORIENT-R model can reproduce transport,

have been widely employed to control the propagation and scattering of light.
Yet, similar tools to control diffraction and engineering spatial wavefronts
have remained elusive. Here, we show that, by operating a suitably tailored
metagrating around a BIC and EPs, it is possible to achieve an extreme degree
of control over coupling to different diffraction orders in metasurfaces. We
stack subwavelength metallic slit arrays on a metal-insulator-metal waveguide,
enabling a careful control of the coupling between localized and guided modes.
By periodically tuning the coupling strength from weak to strong, we largely
tailor the overall spectrum and enable the emergence of singular features, like
BICs and EPs. Perfect unitary diffraction efficiency with large spectrum
selectivity is achieved around these singular features, with promising
applications for arbitrary wavefront shaping combined with filtering and
sensing.

that in heterogeneous parameter spaces, i.e. in spaces in which the variance of

achieve and requires arduous tweaking of the loss function, hyper parameters,
and the distribution of the training data in parameter space. Here, we address
these issues with a theoretically well-founded loss function: the Cram\'er-Rao
bound (CRB) provides a theoretical lower bound for the variance of an unbiased
estimator and we propose to normalize the squared error with respective CRB.
With this normalization, we balance the contributions of hard-to-estimate and
not-so-hard-to-estimate parameters and areas in parameter space, and avoid a
dominance of the former in the overall training loss. Further, the CRB-based
loss function equals one for a maximally-efficient unbiased estimator, which we
consider the ideal estimator. Hence, the proposed CRB-based loss function
provides an absolute evaluation metric. We compare a network trained with the
CRB-based loss with a network trained with the commonly used means squared
error loss and demonstrate the advantages of the former in numerical, phantom,

interesting characteristics of t-SNE are the structure preservation property
and the answer to the crowding problem, where all neighbors in high dimensional
space cannot be represented correctly in low dimensional space. $t$-SNE
preserves the local neighborhood, and similar items are nicely spaced by
adjusting to the local density. These two characteristics produce a meaningful
representation, where the cluster area is proportional to its size in number,
and relationships between clusters are materialized by closeness on the
embedding.
  This algorithm is non-parametric, therefore two initializations of the
algorithm would lead to two different embedding. In a forensic approach,
analysts would like to compare two or more datasets using their embedding. An
approach would be to learn a parametric model over an embedding built with a
subset of data. While this approach is highly scalable, points could be mapped
at the same exact position, making them indistinguishable. This type of model
would be unable to adapt to new outliers nor concept drift.
  This paper presents a methodology to reuse an embedding to create a new one,
where cluster positions are preserved. The optimization process minimizes two
costs, one relative to the embedding shape and the second relative to the
support embedding' match. The proposed algorithm has the same complexity than
the original $t$-SNE to embed new items, and a lower one when considering the
embedding of a dataset sliced into sub-pieces. The method showed promising
results on a real-world dataset, allowing to observe the birth, evolution and
death of clusters. The proposed approach facilitates identifying significant
trends and changes, which empowers the monitoring high dimensional datasets'

Mondrian forests to arbitrary split directions, as well as random forests
derived from Poisson hyperplane tessellations. These are the first results

low-energy effective Hamiltonians for $\beta^\prime$-$X$[Pd(dmit)$_2$]$_2$ with
available room- and low-temperature structures. We find that the amplitudes of
the Coulomb interactions and the anisotropy of the hopping parameters in the
effective Hamiltonians are sensitive to the changes in the lattice constants
induced by lowering the temperature. The obtained effective Hamiltonians are
analyzed using the exact diagonalization method with the boundary-condition
average. We find that a significant reduction of the antiferromagnetic ordered
moment occurs in the effective Hamiltonian of
$\beta^\prime$-EtMe$_3$Sb[Pd(dmit)$_2$]$_2$ with the low-temperature structure.
The reduction is consistent with the quantum spin liquid behavior observed in
experiments. The comprehensive derivations of the effective Hamiltonians and
exact-diagonalization analyses of them will clarify the microscopic origins of
the exotic quantum states of matter found in
$\beta^\prime$-$X$[Pd(dmit)$_2$]$_2$ such as the quantum spin liquid behavior.

mitigate this issue by learning a robust policy. However, it suffers from heavy
computational resource consumption due to the newly introduced value and policy

signal for performance improvement and evaluation. Traditionally, click is
usually treated as a positive implicit feedback signal of relevance or
usefulness, while non-click (especially non-click after examination) is
regarded as a signal of irrelevance or uselessness. However, there are many
cases where users do not click on any search results but still satisfy their
information need with the contents of the results shown on the Search Engine
Result Page (SERP). This raises the problem of measuring result usefulness and
modeling user satisfaction in ""Zero-click"" search scenarios.
  Previous works have solved this issue by (1) detecting user satisfaction for
abandoned SERP with context information and (2) considering result-level click
necessity with external assessors' annotations. However, few works have
investigated the reason behind non-click behavior and estimated the usefulness
of non-click results. A challenge for this research question is how to collect

design a lab-based user study and reveal differences in brain signals while
examining non-click search results with different usefulness levels. The
findings in significant brain regions and electroencephalogram~(EEG) spectrum
also suggest that the process of usefulness judgment might involve similar
cognitive functions of relevance perception and satisfaction decoding. Inspired
by these findings, we conduct supervised learning tasks to estimate the
usefulness of non-click results with brain signals and conventional information

utilize brain signals to improve usefulness estimation performance and

the small marginal effects of the noise may then accumulate quickly, shifting
empirical closest and furthest neighbors away from the ground truth. In this
paper, we exactly characterize such effects in noisy high-dimensional data
using an asymptotic probabilistic expression. Previously, it has been argued
that neighborhood queries become meaningless and unstable when distance
concentration occurs, which means that there is a poor relative discrimination
between the furthest and closest neighbors in the data. However, we conclude
that this is not necessarily the case when we decompose the data in a ground

derive that under particular conditions, empirical neighborhood relations
affected by noise are still likely to be truthful even when distance
concentration occurs. We also include thorough empirical verification of our

integrating the orbits for 5 and 12 Gyr backward. For the first time we have
studied the influence of separately a change in the masses and a change in the
sizes of the Galactic components. The changes in the masses and sizes of the
components are shown to act on the orbital parameters in the opposite way. At
small Galactocentric distances this influence is maximally compensated for. The
orbits of distant globular clusters and those with a large apocenter distance
undergo the biggest changes. We show that on time scales up to $-5$~Gyr the
orbits of globular clusters in the case of a potential with both changing
masses and changing sizes of the components undergo, on average, minor changes
compared to the case of a static potential. These changes fit into the limits
of the statistical uncertainties caused by the errors in the data. So, on these

turbulence at mesoscale even though the constituent particles move at Reynolds

are generally marred by a lack of detailed balance. In this letter, we answer
this question and report an exact expression of the effective temperature for a

infer the orbital characteristics of asteroid swarms, and performed parametric
studies to explore the possible characteristics of the pulsar, its wind, and of
the asteroids, under the constraint that the latter remain dynamically and
thermally stable. We found a plausible configuration in which a young pulsar is
orbited by a main $\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ companion with a period $3P = 49$d,
three times longer than the apparent periodicity $P$. Asteroids responsible for
FRBs are located in three dynamical swarms near the L3, L4 and L5 Lagrange
points, in a 2:3 orbital resonance akin to the Hildas class of asteroids in the
Solar system. In addition, asteroids could be present in the Trojan swarms at
the L4 and L5 Lagrange points. Together these swarms form a carousel that
explains the apparent $P$ periodicity and dispersion. We estimated that the
presence of at least a few thousand asteroids, of size $\sim20$km, is necessary

introduced, so that magnetic processes are the main driver of the outflow up to
stellar masses of ~20 solar mass. The disc properties depend on the physics
included. The disc formed in the ideal and resistive runs show opposite
properties in terms of plasma beta and of magnetic fields topology. While the
disc in the ideal case is dominated by the magnetic pressure and the toroidal
magnetic fields, the one formed in the resistive runs is dominated by the
thermal pressure and has essentially vertical magnetic fields in the inner
regions (R<200 au). We find that magnetic processes dominate the early

accretion/ejection as well as the disc formation. Ambipolar diffusion is mainly
at work at disc scales and regulates its properties. Our finding for the

sensor array signal processing. A popular multi-signal DoA estimation method is
the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which enables
high-performance super-resolution DoA recovery while being highly applicable in
practice. MUSIC is a model-based algorithm, relying on an accurate mathematical
description of the relationship between the signals and the measurements and
assumptions on the signals themselves (non-coherent, narrowband sources). As
such, it is sensitive to model imperfections. In this work we propose to
overcome these limitations of MUSIC by augmenting the algorithm with
specifically designed neural architectures. Our proposed deep augmented MUSIC
(DA-MUSIC) algorithm is thus a hybrid model-based/data-driven DoA estimator,
which leverages data to improve performance and robustness while preserving the
interpretable flow of the classic method. DA-MUSIC is shown to learn to
overcome limitations of the purely model-based method, such as its inability to
successfully localize coherent sources as well as estimate the number of
coherent signal sources present. We further demonstrate the superior resolution

high level finding a reorientation object pose, and the low level planning
paths between adjacent grasps. We learn an offline-training path cost estimator
to predict approximate path planning costs, which serve as pseudo rewards to
allow for pre-training the high-level planner without interacting with the

follow-up observations of this system with CFHT/ESPaDOnS in order to
investigate its variability over several rotational periods. We derive a 4.38
day period from the K2 light curve. This period is also seen in the radial
velocity variations, ascribed to spot modulation. The narrow component of the
He I 5876 {\AA} line as well as the red wing of the H{\beta} and H{\gamma} line
profiles also vary in intensity with the same periodicity. The former traces
the accretion shock at the stellar surface, and the latter is a signature of an
accretion funnel flow crossing the line of sight. We derive a surface
brightness and magnetic field topology from the modeling of Stokes I and V
profiles, respectively, for photospheric lines and for the He I line. This
reveals a bright spot at the stellar surface, located at a latitude of 60 deg,
and a maximum field strength of about 2 kG. The magnetic field topology at the
stellar surface is dominated by a dipolar component inclined by about 40 deg
onto the spin axis. Despite of its clear and stable dipper behavior, we derive
a relatively low inclination of about 50 deg for this system, which calls
question the origin of the dips. This low inclination is also consistent with
the absence of deep inverse P Cygni components in the line profiles. We
conclude that magnetospheric accretion is ongoing in V807 Tau, taking place
through non-axisymmetric accretion funnel flows controlled by a strong, tilted,
and mainly dipolar magnetic topology. Whether an inner disk warp resulting from
this process can account for the dipper character of this source remains to be
seen, given the low inclination of the system.

novel clustering algorithm that reduces the dimension of the design space to
speed up the searching process. Subsequently, a rollback algorithm is proposed
to recover the high-dimensional design space so that higher pruning accuracy

such distinguishability can be erased with a projective measurement. Here, we
report a method of homodyne detection that can also recover interference

that leads to the recovery of interference, and the quantum nature of homodyne
detection and the detector's slow response time both play an essential role.
This is different from the quantum eraser schemes mentioned above. It
demonstrates that quantum interference occurs in the measurement processes.
With no need for path compensation, the unbalanced interferometers studied here

formation of gravitational radiation becomes non-trivial because of violation

while the full retarded gravitational field of a localized source propagates
with all velocities lower or equal to the speed of light, so special care is
needed to extract radiation. Here we consider a simplified model consisting of
two point masses moving on a three-brane embedded in five-dimensional bulk.
Particles are assumed to interact through a massless scalar field living on the
same brane, while gravitational radiation is emitted into the full
five-dimensional space. We use the Rohrlich-Teitelboim approach to radiation,
extracting the radiative component of the retarded gravitational field via
splitting of the energy-momentum tensor. The source term consists of the local
contribution from the particles and the non-local contribution from the scalar
field stresses. The latter is computed using the DIRE approach to the
post-Newtonian expansions. In the non-relativistic limit, we find an analog of

this method achieves the average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.895 and

from a big corpus are two major challenges of large-scale industrial
recommender systems. In tree-based methods, a tree structure T is adopted as
index and each item in corpus is attached to a leaf node on T . Then the
recommendation problem is converted into a hierarchical retrieval problem
solved by a beam search process efficiently. In this paper, we argue that the
tree index used to support efficient retrieval in tree-based methods also has
rich hierarchical information about the corpus. Furthermore, we propose a novel
context-aware tree-based deep model (ConTDM) for recommender systems. In
ConTDM, a context-aware user preference prediction model M is designed to
utilize both horizontal and vertical contexts on T . Horizontally, a graph
convolutional layer is used to enrich the representation of both users and
nodes on T with their neighbors. Vertically, a parent fusion layer is designed
in M to transmit the user preference representation in higher levels of T to
the current level, grasping the essence that tree-based methods are generating
the candidate set from coarse to detail during the beam search retrieval.
Besides, we argue that the proposed user preference model in ConTDM can be
conveniently extended to other tree-based methods for recommender systems. Both
experiments on large scale real-world datasets and online A/B test in large
scale industrial applications show the significant improvements brought by
ConTDM.

OSIRIS/SINFONI along with their natural seeing (NS) counterparts from KMOS at
spatial resolutions of [$0.1-0.4$] arcsec and [$0.6-1.0$] arcsec respectively.
The AO data reveals 2/10 systems to be mergers and for the remaining eight the
mean uncertainties $\bar \Delta j_*$ decrease from 49% (NS), and 26.5% (AO), to
16% in the combined analysis. These $j_*$ measurements agree within 20% with
simple estimates ($\tilde{j_*}$) calculated from the Hubble Space Telescope
photometry and NS kinematics, however higher resolution kinematics are required
to first identify these disks. We find that the choice of surface mass density
model and the measurement of effective radius from photometry are the key
sources of systematic effects in the measurement of $j_*$ between different
analyses. Fitting the $j_*$ vs $M_*$ relations (Fall, 1983) with a fixed

results at $z\geq1$ within $\sim 0.3$ dex. Finally, we find a $\sim 0.38$ dex

the propagation speed of gravitational waves. We also find that there is no

systems. In their simplest implementation, an external agent switches on, for a
given time, the interaction between the system and a specimen from the
reservoir. Generically, in this operation the external agent performs work onto
the system, preventing thermalization when the reservoir is at equilibrium. One
can recover thermalization by considering an autonomous global setup where the
reservoir particles colliding with the system possess a kinetic degree of
freedom. The drawback is that the corresponding scattering problem is rather
involved. Here, we present a formal solution of the problem in one dimension
and for flat interaction potentials. The solution is based on the transfer
matrix formalism and allows one to explore the symmetries of the resulting
scattering map. One of these symmetries is micro-reversibility, which is a
condition for thermalization. We then introduce two approximations of the
scattering map that preserve these symmetries and, consequently, thermalize the
system. These relatively simple approximate solutions constitute models of
quantum thermostats and are useful tools to study quantum systems in contact
with thermal baths. We illustrate their accuracy in a specific example, showing
that both are good approximations of the exact scattering problem even in
situations far from equilibrium. Moreover, one of the models consists of the

  pathway information",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Genetic interactions play an important role in the progression of complex
diseases, providing explanation of variations in disease phenotype missed by
main genetic effects. Comparatively, there are fewer investigations on
prognostic survival time, given its challenging characteristics such as
censoring. In recent biomedical research, two-level analysis of both genes and
their involved pathways has received much attention and been demonstrated to be
more effective than single-level analysis, however such analysis is limited to
main effects. Pathways are not isolated and their interactions have also been
suggested to have important contributions to the prognosis of complex diseases.
In this article, we develop a novel two-level Bayesian interaction analysis
approach for survival data. This approach is the first to conduct the analysis
of lower-level gene-gene interactions and higher-level pathway-pathway
interactions simultaneously. Significantly advancing from existing Bayesian
studies based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, we propose a
variational inference framework based on the accelerated failure time model
with favourable priors to account for two-level selection as well as censoring.
The computational efficiency is much desirable for high dimensional interaction
analysis. We examine performance of the proposed approach using extensive
simulation. Application to TCGA melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma data leads to
biologically sensible findings with satisfactory prediction accuracy and
selection stability.

proposed. Instead of relying on occupation numbers of a few dominant modes,
which become macroscopic in the limit of infinite particle numbers, it focuses
on the regular excitations whose numbers stay bounded in this limit. In this
manner, subspaces of global, respectively local regular wave functions are
identified. Their orthogonal complements determine the wave functions of
particles forming proper (infinite) condensates in the limit. In contrast to
the concept of macroscopic occupation numbers, which does not sharply fix the
wave functions of condensates in the limit states, the notion of proper
condensates is unambiguously defined. It is outlined, how this concept can be
used in the analysis of condensates in models. The method is illustrated by the
example of trapped non-interacting ground states and their multifarious
thermodynamic limits, differing by the structure of condensates accompanying
the Fock vacuum. The concept of proper condensates is also compared with the
Onsager-Penrose criterion, based on the analysis of eigenvalues of one-particle
density matrices. It is shown that the concept of regular wave functions is
useful there as well for the identification of wave functions forming proper
condensates.

reaccelerate successively the same particles. To describe these systems, one
has to account for the nonlinear backreaction of the particles on the

reacceleration at nonlinear shocks, we show that the presence of prexisting
energetic particles strongly affects the shock profile, in such a way that the
reacceleration of non thermal particles or the acceleration of particles from
the thermal bath becomes less efficient. We further describe the evolution of
the distribution of particles after several shocks and study the properties of
the asymptotic solution. We detail the case of identical shocks as well as more
realistic scenarios, including the heating of the medium or superbubble
environments. When the particles are efficiently confined in the acceleration
region, it is generally found that the spectrum converges toward a concave

of about 4-5% of the ram pressure of one shock. Most of the shock pressure is

have received a lot of research interests and reached many successful
applications. However, it is always a challenge to achieve the consistency
between the learned latent distribution and the prior latent distribution when
optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), and finally leads to an
unsatisfactory performance in data generation. In this paper, we propose a
latent distribution consistency approach to avoid such substantial
inconsistency between the posterior and prior latent distributions in ELBO
optimizing. We name our method as latent distribution consistency VAE
(LDC-VAE). We achieve this purpose by assuming the real posterior distribution
in latent space as a Gibbs form, and approximating it by using our encoder.
However, there is no analytical solution for such Gibbs posterior in
approximation, and traditional approximation ways are time consuming, such as
using the iterative sampling-based MCMC. To address this problem, we use the
Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to approximate the Gibbs posterior.
Meanwhile, we use the SVGD to train a sampler net which can obtain efficient
samples from the Gibbs posterior. Comparative studies on the popular image
generation datasets show that our method has achieved comparable or even better
performance than several powerful improvements of VAEs.

graphical models (GGMs) from noisy data. In decentralized learning, data set is
distributed across different machines (sensors), and GGMs are widely used to
model complex networks such as gene regulatory networks and social networks.
The proposed decentralized learning uses the Chow-Liu algorithm for estimating
the tree-structured GGM.
  In previous works, upper bounds on the probability of incorrect tree
structure recovery were given mostly without any practical noise for
simplification. While this paper investigates the effects of three common types
of noisy channels: Gaussian, Erasure, and binary symmetric channel. For
Gaussian channel case, to satisfy the failure probability upper bound $\delta >
0$ in recovering a $d$-node tree structure, our proposed theorem requires only
$\mathcal{O}(\log(\frac{d}{\delta}))$ samples for the smallest sample size
($n$) comparing to the previous literature \cite{Nikolakakis} with
$\mathcal{O}(\log^4(\frac{d}{\delta}))$ samples by using the positive
correlation coefficient assumption that is used in some important works in the
literature. Moreover, the approximately bounded Gaussian random variable
assumption does not appear in \cite{Nikolakakis}. Given some knowledge about
the tree structure, the proposed Algorithmic Bound will achieve obviously
better performance with small sample size (e.g., $< 2000$) comparing with
formulaic bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by performing
simulations on synthetic data sets.

In this paper, we propose a method for mitigating bias in classifier training

class label are encouraged to have similar representations, while instances
sharing a protected attribute are forced further apart. In such a way our
method learns representations which capture the task label in focused regions,
while ensuring the protected attribute has diverse spread, and thus has limited
impact on prediction and thereby results in fairer models. Extensive
experimental results across four tasks in NLP and computer vision show (a) that
our proposed method can achieve fairer representations and realises bias
reductions compared with competitive baselines; and (b) that it can do so
without sacrificing main task performance; (c) that it sets a new

our method is conceptually simple and agnostic to network architectures, and
incurs minimal additional compute cost.

cosmological reionization and chemical enrichment. However, in spite of their
importance to the evolution of the early Universe, their properties remain
uncertain because of limitations to previous numerical simulations and the lack
of any observational constraints. Here we investigate Pop III star formation in
five primordial halos with 3D radiation-hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations. We find that multiple stars form in each minihalo and that their
numbers increase over time, with up to 23 stars forming in one of the halos.
Radiative feedback from the stars generates strong outflows, deforms the
surrounding protostellar disk, and delays star formation for a few thousand
years. Star formation rates vary with halo and depend on mass accretion onto
the disk, halo spin number, and the fraction of massive stars in the halo.
Stellar masses in our models range from 0.1-37 $\rm M_{\odot}$, and of the 55
stars that form in our models twelve are $\rm > 10~ M_{\odot}$ and most of the
others are 1-10 $\rm M_{\odot}$. Our simulations thus suggest that Pop III
stars have characteristic masses of 1-10 $\rm M_{\odot}$ and a top-heavy IMF
with dN/dM $\propto M_*^{-1.18}$. Up to 70\% of the stars are ejected from
their disks by three-body interactions which, along with ionizing UV feedback,
limits their final masses.

is proposed with multiple antennas at relay station (RS). To achieve a high
rate, an alternately iterative structure (AIS) of maximizing receive power
(Max-RP) at RS is proposed to jointly optimize the beamforming vectors at RS
and phase shifts at IRS. Considering its high-complexity, two low-complexity
Max-RP schemes of null-space projection (NSP) plus maximum ratio combining
(MRC) and IRS element selection (IRSES) plus MRC are presented to reduce this
complexity, respectively. For the former, NSP is used to separate the reflected
signal from IRS and the direct transmitted signal from source and MRC is
adopted to combine the two signals at RS. For the latter, the basic concept of
IRSES is as follows: IRS is partitioned into M subsets of elements and
adjusting the phases of all elements per subset make all reflected signals and
the direct signal from source phase alignment (PA) at the corresponding antenna
of relay. Simulation results show that the proposed three methods perform much
better than the existing network with single-antenna relay in terms of rate
performance. In particular, a 85% rate gain over existing scheme is achieved in
the high signal-to-noise ratio region. Moreover, it is verified that the

strategy during the trading period, we simulate the trading signals using best
bid/ask quotes and market trades. We exclusively take the order execution into
account when the asset size is already available at its quoted price (with one

non-compact gravitational systems, as e.g. cosmology, is to introduce a
fiducial cell by cutting-off the spatial slice at a finite region $V_o$. This
is usually considered as an auxiliary integral regulator to be removed after
performing computations by sending it to infinity. In this paper, we analyse
the dependence of the classical and quantum theory of homogeneous, isotropic
and spatially flat cosmology on this fiducial cell. We show that each fixed
$V_o$ regularisation leads to a different canonically independent theory. At
the classical level, the dynamics of observables is not affected by the
regularisation choice on-shell. For the quantum theory, however, this leads to
a family of regulator dependent quantum representations labelled by $V_o$ and
the limit $V_o\to\infty$ becomes then more subtle. First, we construct a novel
isomorphism between different $V_o$-regularisations, which allows us to
identify states in the different $V_o$-labelled Hilbert spaces to ensure
equivalent dynamics for any value of the regulator. The $V_o \rightarrow
\infty$ limit would then correspond to choosing a state for which the volume
assigned to the fiducial cell becomes infinite. As second main result of our
analysis, by looking at observables respectively smeared over the fiducial cell
$V_o$ and subregions $V$, we find that quantum fluctuations of the latter
explicitly depend on the size of the fiducial cell. Physically relevant
fluctuations for a finite region, as e.g. in the early time regime, would then
be unreasonably suppressed in the limit where the volume of the fiducial cell
becomes infinite. Our results suggest that the fiducial cell is not playing the
role of a mere regularisation but is physically relevant at the quantum level
and complement previous statements in the literature based on different
arguments.

ground for experimenting with new approaches, especially concerning Deep
Learning techniques. We present hereby a novel approach that takes advantage of
both CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and classical CV (Computer Vision)
techniques, able to detect a generic class ''fish'' in acoustic video streams.
The pipeline pre-treats the acoustic images to extract 2 features, in order to
localise the signals and improve the detection performances. To ensure the
performances from an ecological point of view, we propose also a two-step
validation, one to validate the results of the trainings and one to test the
method on a real-world scenario. The YOLOv3-based model was trained with data
of fish from multiple species recorded by the two common acoustic cameras,
DIDSON and ARIS, including species of high ecological interest, as Atlantic
salmon or European eels. The model we developed provides satisfying results
detecting almost 80% of fish and minimizing the false positive rate, however
the model is much less efficient for eel detections on ARIS videos. The first
CNN pipeline for fish monitoring exploiting video data from two models of
acoustic cameras satisfies most of the required features. Many challenges are
still present, such as the automation of fish species identification through a
multiclass model. 1 However the results point a new solution for dealing with
complex data, such as sonar data, which can also be reapplied in other cases

in the plane, with a convexity constraint on the admissible domains, are
polygons. The main terms of the shape functionals we consider are either E f
($\Omega$), the Dirichlet energy of the Laplacian in the domain $\Omega$, or
$\lambda$ 1 ($\Omega$), the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian.
Usually, one considers minimization of such functionals (often with measure
constraint), as for example for the famous Saint-Venant and Faber-Krahn
inequalities. By adding the convexity constraint (and possibly other
constraints to ensure existence of an optimal shape) one allows to consider the
rather unusual and difficult question of maximizing these functionals. This
paper follows a series of papers by the authors, where the leading idea is that
a certain concavity property of the shape functional that is minimized leads
optimal shapes to locally saturate the convexity constraint, which
geometrically means that they are polygonal. In these previous papers, the
leading term in the shape functional usually was the opposite of the perimeter,
for which the aforementioned concavity property was rather easy to obtain
through computations of its second order shape derivative. By carrying
classical shape calculus, a similar concavity property can be observed for the
opposite of E f or $\lambda$ 1 , for shapes that are smooth and convex. The
main novelty in the present paper is indeed the proof of a weak convexity
property of E f and $\lambda$ 1 when it is only known that the shape is planar
and convex, which means we have to consider rather non-smooth shapes. This work
involves new computations and estimates of the second order shape derivative of
E f and $\lambda$ 1 that are interesting in themselves.

using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in Jacobi coordinates. The inner

its mass to $10.04^{+4.53}_{-3.10}\,M_{\rm Jup}$. If one adds the astrometry of
$\beta$ Pictoris c, the mass is narrowed down to $9.15^{+1.08}_{-1.06}\,M_{\rm

orbital parameters significantly, but it does slightly decrease the mass
estimate to $8.89^{+0.75}_{-0.75}\,M_{\rm Jup}$. With a semimajor axis of
$2.68\pm0.02$\,au, a period of $1221\pm15$ days, and an eccentricity of

as precisely as those of $\beta$ Pictoris b. The orbital configuration is
compatible with a high-order mean-motion resonance (7:1). The impact of the
resonance on the planets' dynamics would then be negligible with respect to the
secular perturbations, which might have played an important role in the

Localization (NLVL) aims to identify the video moment described by the query.
To address this task, existing methods can be roughly grouped into two groups:

candidates and then find out the best-matching one. 2) proposal-free models
directly predict two temporal boundaries of the referential moment from frames.
Currently, almost all the propose-and-rank methods have inferior performance
than proposal-free counterparts. In this paper, we argue that propose-and-rank

rules are hard to guarantee the complete coverage of targeted segments. 2)
Densely sampled candidate moments cause redundant computation and degrade the

across engineering. This work suggests an approach based on Bayesian filtering
to extract and identify the contribution of an unknown nonlinear term in the
system which can be seen as an alternative viewpoint on restoring force surface
type approaches. To achieve this identification, the contribution which is the
nonlinear restoring force is modelled, initially, as a Gaussian process in
time. That Gaussian process is converted into a state-space model and combined
with the linear dynamic component of the system. Then, by inference of the
filtering and smoothing distributions, the internal states of the system and
the nonlinear restoring force can be extracted. In possession of these states a
nonlinear model can be constructed. The approach is demonstrated to be
effective in both a simulated case study and on an experimental benchmark
dataset.

  interaction","18 pages, 10 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Discrete quantum walks are operations on the states comprised of an external
position space and an internal coin space. The interactions between the two
spaces governed by quantum walk operation greatly influence the properties of
the states and have important consequences for the quantum algorithms and
quantum simulation protocols for which they are used extensively. In this work,
we study the effect of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric non-Hermitian walk operation on
the interactions between the coin and the position spaces of the state. Such an
evolution mimics a quantum walk which is interacting with an external
environment. To understand this interaction, we study the non-Markovianity of
the reduced dynamics and also the entanglement between the two spaces. The
non-Hermitian evolution is studied from the two perspectives: the normalised
state method, and the metric formalism which relies on a redefinition of the
Hilbert space. We argue that metric formalism provides a more consistent
measurement of the non-Markovianity under the non-Hermitian dynamics compared
to the case under the normalised state method. It can also provide a better
indicator of the breakdown of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry across the exceptional
point. We also show that the non-unitary walks preserve the purity of the state
under the metric formulation, due to which one can study entanglement under
non-Hermiticity using entanglement entropy. We also find the indications that
the coin-position entanglement is more robust in the asymmetric quantum walks.

datasets and performing inferences in them. They model, however, only pairwise
relations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order
relations. This drawback is mitigated by hypergraphs, in which an edge can
connect an arbitrary number of nodes. Most hypergraph learning approaches
convert the hypergraph structure to that of a graph and then deploy existing
geometric deep learning methods. This transformation leads to information loss,
and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present
HyperMSG, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a modular two-level
neural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate
information within each hyperedge and across the hyperedges. HyperMSG adapts to
the data and task by learning an attention weight associated with each node's
degree centrality. Such a mechanism quantifies both local and global importance
of a node, capturing the structural properties of a hypergraph. HyperMSG is
inductive, allowing inference on previously unseen nodes. Further, it is robust
and outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on a wide range of
tasks and datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HyperMSG in
learning multimodal relations through detailed experimentation on a challenging
multimedia dataset.

improved scaling protocols whereby our redesigned models achieve similar

geometry. This ubiquitous representation is essentially a hybrid one that
decouples continuous vertex locations from the discrete topological
triangulation. Unfortunately, the combinatorial nature of the triangulation
prevents taking derivatives over the space of possible meshings of any given
surface. As a result, to date, mesh processing and optimization techniques have
been unable to truly take advantage of modular gradient descent components of
modern optimization frameworks. In this work, we present a differentiable
surface triangulation that enables optimization for any per-vertex or per-face
differentiable objective function over the space of underlying surface
triangulations. Our method builds on the result that any 2D triangulation can
be achieved by a suitably perturbed weighted Delaunay triangulation. We
translate this result into a computational algorithm by proposing a soft
relaxation of the classical weighted Delaunay triangulation and optimizing over
vertex weights and vertex locations. We extend the algorithm to 3D by
decomposing shapes into developable sets and differentiably meshing each set
with suitable boundary constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method
on various planar and surface meshes on a range of difficult-to-optimize
objective functions. Our code can be found online:

popular technique to compute epistemic uncertainty is the Monte-Carlo (MC)
dropout technique. From a network with MC dropout and a single input, multiple
outputs can be sampled. Various methods can be used to obtain epistemic
uncertainty maps from those multiple outputs. In the case of multi-class
segmentation, the number of methods is even larger as epistemic uncertainty can
be computed voxelwise per class or voxelwise per image. This paper highlights a
systematic approach to define and quantitatively compare those methods in two
different contexts: class-specific epistemic uncertainty maps (one value per
image, voxel and class) and combined epistemic uncertainty maps (one value per
image and voxel). We applied this quantitative analysis to a multi-class
segmentation of the carotid artery lumen and vessel wall, on a multi-center,
multi-scanner, multi-sequence dataset of (MR) images. We validated our analysis
over 144 sets of hyperparameters of a model. Our main analysis considers the
relationship between the order of the voxels sorted according to their
epistemic uncertainty values and the misclassification of the prediction. Under
this consideration, the comparison of combined uncertainty maps reveals that
the multi-class entropy and the multi-class mutual information statistically
out-perform the other combined uncertainty maps under study. In a
class-specific scenario, the one-versus-all entropy statistically out-performs
the class-wise entropy, the class-wise variance and the one versus all mutual
information. The class-wise entropy statistically out-performs the other
class-specific uncertainty maps in terms of calibration. We made a python
package available to reproduce our analysis on different data and tasks.

induced modules by tilting modules. Furthermore, we give injective resolutions
for induced modules in certain truncated categories. We show that the
multiplicities of the indecomposable tilting and injective modules in these

co-orbital and a potential space mission target. Its short-term dynamics is
characterized by a periodic switching between quasi-satellite and horseshoe
configurations. Due to its small diameter of only about 36 meters, the
Yarkovsky effect may play a significant role in the long-term dynamics. In this
work, we addressed this issue by studying the changes in the long-term motion
of Kamo'oalewa caused by the Yarkovsky effect. We used an estimation of the
magnitude of the Yarkovsky effect assuming different surface compositions and
introduced the semi-major axis drift by propagating orbits of test particles
representing the clones of the nominal orbit. Our simulations showed that the
Yarkovsky effect may cause Kamo'oalewa to exit from the Earth co-orbital region
a bit faster when compared to a purely gravitational model. Nevertheless, it
still could remain an Earth companion for at least 0.5 My in the future. Our
results imply that Kamo'oalewa is the most stable Earth's co-orbital object
known so far, not only from a short-term perspective but also on long time

static mode contribution, have made it possible to treat transverse-magnetic
(TM) modes of a spherically symmetric system with the same efficiency as their
transverse-electric (TE) counterparts. We demonstrate here that the efficient
inclusion of static modes in the RSE results in its quick convergence to the
exact solution regardless of the static mode set used. We then apply the RSE to
spherically symmetric systems with continuous radial variations of the
permittivity. We show that in TM polarization, the spectral transition from
whispering gallery to Fabry-Perot modes is characterized by a peak in the mode
losses and an additional mode as compared to TE polarization. Both features are
explained quantitatively by the Brewster angle of the surface reflection which
occurs in this frequency range. Eliminating the discontinuity at the sphere
surface by using linear or quadratic profiles of the permittivity modifies this
peak and increases the Fabry-Perot mode losses, in qualitative agreement with a
reduced surface reflectivity. These profiles also provide a nearly parabolic
confinement for the whispering gallery modes, for which an analytical
approximation using the Morse potential is presented. Both profiles result in a
reduced TE-TM splitting, which is shown to be further suppressed by choosing a
profile radially extending the mode fields. Based on the concepts of ray
optics, phase analysis of the secular equation, and effective
quantum-mechanical potential for a wave equation, we have further developed a
number of useful approximations which shed light on the physical phenomena
observed in the spectra of graded-index systems.

lensing, we have direct access to the RQQ population out to cosmic noon, where
evidence for twin mini-jets has recently been found in a sub-\textmu Jy RQQ.
Here we present radio observations of two lensed RQQs using the VLA at 5~GHz,
the latest objects to be observed in a sample of quadruply-imaged RQQs above

lies on the radio--FIR correlation, the result would reinforce the need for
caution when applying the correlation to rule out jet activity and when
assuming no AGN heating of FIR-emitting dust when calculating star formation
rates. Our programme so far has shown that two of the faintest radio sources
ever imaged show strong evidence for AGN-dominated radio emission.

complement the above findings by analyzing in both models the relativistic

optically thin $^{13}$CO(3-2) emission, which provides several important new
results. In agreement with observations at infrared and visible wavelengths, we
give evidence for confinement and probably rotation of a dense gas volume
within $\sim$50 au from the star and for a large SiO line-width within $\sim$15
au. We show that the mass loss process is episodic and takes the form of clumps
having a very low SiO/CO abundance ratio compared with similar oxygen-rich long
period variables, probably a result of depletion on dust grains and
photo-dissociation. We evaluate the mass loss rate associated with the main
clumps and compare it with values obtained from single dish observations. We
argue that the SiO emission observed in the south-western quadrant is not
related to the mechanism of generation of the nascent wind but to a mass
ejection that occurred eleven years before the observations. We remark that
Mira Ceti is not a good archetype in terms of its wind: models aiming at
describing the very complex gas-dust chemistry in action in the CSE of
oxygen-rich AGB stars may find it difficult to account for its peculiar
features, small variations in the parameters deciding when and where mass loss
can proceed significantly.

as BERT have provided substantial improvements on information retrieval tasks.
Recent approaches based on pre-trained transformer models such as BERT,
fine-tune dense low-dimensional contextualized representations of queries and
documents in embedding space. While these dense retrievers enjoy substantial
retrieval effectiveness improvements compared to sparse retrievers, they are
computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources, and dense
retrievers are known to be more expensive from both time and resource
perspectives. In addition, sparse retrievers have been shown to retrieve
complementary information with respect to dense retrievers, leading to
proposals for hybrid retrievers. These hybrid retrievers leverage low-cost,
exact-matching based sparse retrievers along with dense retrievers to bridge
the semantic gaps between query and documents. In this work, we address this
trade-off between the cost and utility of sparse vs dense retrievers by
proposing a classifier to select a suitable retrieval strategy (i.e., sparse
vs. dense vs. hybrid) for individual queries. Leveraging sparse retrievers for
queries which can be answered with sparse retrievers decreases the number of
calls to GPUs. Consequently, while utility is maintained, query latency
decreases. Although we use less computational resources and spend less time, we
still achieve improved performance. Our classifier can select between sparse
and dense retrieval strategies based on the query alone. We conduct experiments
on the MS MARCO passage dataset demonstrating an improved range of
efficiency/effectiveness trade-offs between purely sparse, purely dense or
hybrid retrieval strategies, allowing an appropriate strategy to be selected

believed to arise from the antiferromagnetic interchain coupling between the

observed at low temperatures, with the interstitial Fe acting as the
uncompensated moment and its neighboring Fe chain providing the source for its
pinning. This iron-based telluride may thereby represent a new paradigm to
study the large family of transition metal chalcogenides whose magnetic order
or even the dimensionality can be tuned to a large extent, forming a fertile
playground to manipulate or switch the spin degrees of freedom thereof.

according to various road accident records. Thus, reliably predicting such
manoeuvre in advance is critical for the safe and comfortable operation of
automated driving systems. The majority of previous studies rely on detecting a
manoeuvre that has been already started, rather than predicting the manoeuvre
in advance. Furthermore, most of the previous works do not estimate the key
timings of the manoeuvre (e.g., crossing time), which can actually yield more
useful information for the decision making in the ego vehicle. To address these
shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel multi-task model to simultaneously
estimate the likelihood of LC manoeuvres and the time-to-lane-change (TTLC). In
both tasks, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a
shared feature extractor from a bird's eye view representation of the driving
environment. The spatial attention used in the CNN model improves the feature
extraction process by focusing on the most relevant areas of the surrounding
environment. In addition, two novel curriculum learning schemes are employed to
train the proposed approach. The extensive evaluation and comparative analysis
of the proposed method in existing benchmark datasets show that the proposed

characterization of conformal mappings in Hardy or weighted Bergman spaces by
studying Euclidean areas. Applying these results, we prove several consequences
for such mappings that extend known results for Hardy spaces to weighted
Bergman spaces. Moreover, we introduce a number which is the analogue of the

convenient storage and transportation), hydrogen-based multi-energy systems
(HMESs) have received wide attention. However, existing works on the optimal
operation of HMESs neglect building thermal dynamics, which means that the
flexibility of building thermal loads can not be utilized for reducing system
operation cost. In this paper, we investigate an optimal operation problem of
an HMES with the consideration of building thermal dynamics. Specifically, we
first formulate an expected operational cost minimization problem related to an
HMES. Due to the existence of uncertain parameters, inexplicit building thermal
dynamics models, temporally coupled operational constraints related to three
kinds of energy storage systems and indoor temperatures, as well as the
coupling between electric energy subsystems and thermal energy subsystems, it
is challenging to solve the formulated problem. To overcome the challenge, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov game and propose an energy management
algorithm to solve it based on multi-agent discrete actor-critic with rules
(MADACR). Note that the proposed algorithm does not require any prior knowledge
of uncertain parameters, parameter prediction, and explicit building thermal
dynamics model. Simulation results based on real-world traces show the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

element method is hereby implemented to obtain a solution of the Helmholtz
partial differential equation, which models the potential field for surveying
motion control. This allows us to survey arbitrarily shaped domains and to
include obstacles in an elegant and robust manner intrinsic to HEDAC's
fundamental idea. For a simple kinematic motion, the obstacles and boundary
avoidance constraints are successfully handled by directing the agent motion
with the gradient of the potential. However, including additional constraints,
such as the minimal clearance distance from stationary and moving obstacles and
the minimal path curvature radius, requires further alternations of the control
algorithm. We introduce a relatively simple yet robust approach for handling
these constraints by formulating a straightforward optimization problem based
on collision-free escape route maneuvers. This approach provides a guaranteed
collision avoidance mechanism while being computationally inexpensive as a
result of the optimization problem partitioning. The proposed motion control is
evaluated in three realistic surveying scenarios simulations, showing the
effectiveness of the surveying and the robustness of the control algorithm.
Furthermore, potential maneuvering difficulties due to improperly defined
surveying scenarios are highlighted and we provide guidelines on how to
overpass them. The results are promising and indicate real-world applicability

technology for the practical use of self-organising swarms of drones. This
paper proposes a decentralised reciprocal collision-avoidance algorithm, which
is based on stigmergy and scalable. The algorithm is computationally
inexpensive, based on the gradient of the locally measured dynamic cumulative
signal strength field which results from the signals emitted by the swarm. The
signal strength acts as a repulsor on each drone, which then tends to steer
away from the noisiest regions (cluttered environment), thus avoiding
collisions. The magnitudes of these repulsive forces can be tuned to control
the relative importance assigned to collision avoidance with respect to the
other phenomena affecting the agent's dynamics. We carried out numerical
experiments on a self-organising swarm of drones aimed at fighting wildfires
autonomously. As expected, it has been found that the collision rate can be
reduced either by decreasing the cruise speed of the agents and/or by
increasing the sampling frequency of the global signal strength field. A
convenient by-product of the proposed collision-avoidance algorithm is that it
helps maintain diversity in the swarm, thus enhancing exploration.

Compile-time information coupled with run-time mechanisms can then selectively
lift defenses for speculation invariant instructions, reclaiming some of the
lost performance.
  Unfortunately, speculation invariant instructions can easily be manipulated
by a form of speculative interference to leak information via a new
side-channel that we introduce in this paper. We show that forward speculative
interference whereolder speculative instructions interfere with younger
speculation invariant instructions effectively turns them into transmitters for
secret data accessed during speculation. We demonstrate forward speculative
interference on actual hardware, by selectively filling the reorder buffer
(ROB) with instructions, pushing speculative invariant instructions in-or-out
of the ROB on demand, based on a speculatively accessed secret. This reveals
the speculatively accessed secret, as the occupancy of the ROB itself becomes a
new speculative side-channel.

In asteroseismology the pulsation mode frequencies of a star are the
fundamental data that are compared to theoretical predictions to determine a
star's interior physics. Recent significant advances in the numerical,
theoretical and statistical asteroseismic methods applied to main sequence
stars with convective cores have renewed the interest in investigating the
propagation of observational uncertainties within a forward asteroseismic
modelling framework. Aims. We aim to quantify the impact of various choices
made throughout the observational aspects of extracting pulsation mode
frequencies in main sequence stars with gravity modes. Methods. We use a
well-studied benchmark slowly pulsating B star, KIC 7760680, to investigate the
sensitivity of forward asteroseismic modelling to various sources of
observational uncertainty that affect the precision of the input pulsation mode
frequencies. Results. We quantify the impact of the propagation of the
observational uncertainties involved in forward asteroseismic modelling. We
find that one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our benchmark star is in
the manual building of period spacing patterns, such that the inclusion of a
potentially ambiguous pulsation mode frequency may yield differences in model
parameters of up to 10% for mass and age depending on the radial order of the
mode. Conclusions. We conclude that future asteroseismic studies of main
sequence stars with a convective core should quantify and include observational
uncertainties introduced by the light curve extraction, iterative pre-whitening
and the building of period spacing patterns, as these propagate into the final
modelling results.

  Medical Images","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2109.05232",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a Deep Variational Clustering (DVC) framework for unsupervised
representation learning and clustering of large-scale medical images. DVC
simultaneously learns the multivariate Gaussian posterior through the
probabilistic convolutional encoder and the likelihood distribution with the
probabilistic convolutional decoder; and optimizes cluster labels assignment.
Here, the learned multivariate Gaussian posterior captures the latent
distribution of a large set of unlabeled images. Then, we perform unsupervised
clustering on top of the variational latent space using a clustering loss. In
this approach, the probabilistic decoder helps to prevent the distortion of
data points in the latent space and to preserve the local structure of data
generating distribution. The training process can be considered as a
self-training process to refine the latent space and simultaneously optimizing
cluster assignments iteratively. We evaluated our proposed framework on three
public datasets that represented different medical imaging modalities. Our
experimental results show that our proposed framework generalizes better across
different datasets. It achieves compelling results on several medical imaging
benchmarks. Thus, our approach offers potential advantages over conventional
deep unsupervised learning in real-world applications. The source code of the

samples plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, biomedical research, and

accurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only
coarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it
alleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of
refining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more
accurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning
models from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement
problem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and
corrected, and all of them require a -- often very large -- number of training
samples. We present a method, named Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning
(LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI without the need of
external training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are
processed jointly within a multiple instance learning framework, mitigating
their impact on the predictive model and refining the segmentation. Our
experiments on a heterogeneous WSI set with breast cancer lymph node
metastasis, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL
significantly refines the coarse annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art
alternatives, even while learning from a single slide. Moreover, we demonstrate
how real annotations drawn by pathologists can be efficiently refined and
improved by the proposed approach. All these results demonstrate that LC-MIL is
a promising, light-weight tool to provide fine-grained annotations from

was blocked if the conditions for slip transfer were not fulfilled, leading to
the formation of dislocation pile-ups. All the model parameters for each

(PINNs) are a promising tool to approximate (partial) differential equations.
PINNs are not suited for control tasks in their original form since they are
not designed to handle variable control actions or variable initial values. We
thus present the idea of enhancing PINNs by adding control actions and initial
conditions as additional network inputs. The high-dimensional input space is
subsequently reduced via a sampling strategy and a zero-hold assumption. This
strategy enables the controller design based on a PINN as an approximation of
the underlying system dynamics. The additional benefit is that the
sensitivities are easily computed via automatic differentiation, thus leading
to efficient gradient-based algorithms. Finally, we present our results using
our PINN-based MPC to solve a tracking problem for a complex mechanical system,
a multi-link manipulator.

methods for reasoning about data probabilistically. However, it has been
observed that they can assign higher likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD)
data than in-distribution data, thus calling into question the meaning of these
likelihood values. In this work we provide a novel perspective on this
phenomenon, decomposing the average likelihood into a KL divergence term and an
entropy term. We argue that the latter can explain the curious OOD behaviour
mentioned above, suppressing likelihood values on datasets with higher entropy.
Although our idea is simple, we have not seen it explored yet in the
literature. This analysis provides further explanation for the success of OOD
detection methods based on likelihood ratios, as the problematic entropy term
cancels out in expectation. Finally, we discuss how this observation relates to
recent success in OOD detection with manifold-supported models, for which the

appealing alternative for mitigating this obstacle. In this work, we propose a
dual-branch architecture, where the upper branch (teacher) receives strong
annotations, while the bottom one (student) is driven by limited supervision
and guided by the upper branch. Combined with a standard cross-entropy loss
over the labeled pixels, our novel formulation integrates two important terms:
(i) a Shannon entropy loss defined over the less-supervised images, which
encourages confident student predictions in the bottom branch; and (ii) a KL
divergence term, which transfers the knowledge (i.e., predictions) of the
strongly supervised branch to the less-supervised branch and guides the entropy
(student-confidence) term to avoid trivial solutions. We show that the synergy
between the entropy and KL divergence yields substantial improvements in
performance. We also discuss an interesting link between Shannon-entropy
minimization and standard pseudo-mask generation, and argue that the former
should be preferred over the latter for leveraging information from unlabeled
pixels. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation through a
series of quantitative and qualitative experiments using two publicly available

Moreover, we rarely
have access to all of the relevant state variables governing the dynamics.
Delay embedding allows us, in principle, to account for unobserved state
variables. Here we provide an algebraic approach to delay embedding that
permits explicit approximation of error. We also provide the asymptotic
dependence of the first order approximation error on the system size. More
importantly, this formulation of delay embedding can be directly implemented
using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This observation expands the
interpretability of both delay embedding and RNN and facilitates principled
incorporation of structure and other constraints into these approaches.

  Risk Assessment",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Algorithmic recommendations and decisions have become ubiquitous in today's
society. Many of these and other data-driven policies, especially in the realm
of public policy, are based on known, deterministic rules to ensure their
transparency and interpretability. For example, algorithmic pre-trial risk
assessments, which serve as our motivating application, provide relatively
simple, deterministic classification scores and recommendations to help judges
make release decisions. How can we use the data based on existing deterministic
policies to learn new and better policies? Unfortunately, prior methods for
policy learning are not applicable because they require existing policies to be
stochastic rather than deterministic. We develop a robust optimization approach
that partially identifies the expected utility of a policy, and then finds an
optimal policy by minimizing the worst-case regret. The resulting policy is
conservative but has a statistical safety guarantee, allowing the policy-maker
to limit the probability of producing a worse outcome than the existing policy.
We extend this approach to common and important settings where humans make
decisions with the aid of algorithmic recommendations. Lastly, we apply the
proposed methodology to a unique field experiment on pre-trial risk assessment
instruments. We derive new classification and recommendation rules that retain
the transparency and interpretability of the existing instrument while
potentially leading to better overall outcomes at a lower cost.

objects or zero-shot samples. To exacerbate the problem further, object
segmentation using image frames rely on recognition and pattern matching cues.
Instead, we utilize the 'active' nature of a robot and their ability to
'interact' with the environment to induce additional geometric constraints for
segmenting zero-shot samples.
  In this paper, we present the first framework to segment unknown objects in a
cluttered scene by repeatedly 'nudging' at the objects and moving them to
obtain additional motion cues at every step using only a monochrome monocular
camera. We call our framework NudgeSeg. These motion cues are used to refine
the segmentation masks. We successfully test our approach to segment novel
objects in various cluttered scenes and provide an extensive study with image

(MTD) early and proceed quickly to an expansion cohort or phase II trial for
efficacy. We propose an early completion method based on multiple dosages to
accelerate the identification of MTD for model-assisted designs. Methods: The
early completion performs based on each dose-assignment probability for
multiple dosages. The formulas of probabilities are simple to calculate. We
evaluated the early completion for an actual trial. In addition, a simulation
study performed the percentage of correct MTD selection and early completion.
Results: In the actual trial, the early completion could perform, and the MTD
estimation phase could be shortened. In the simulation study, the change in the
percentage of correct MTD selection from non-early completion version was 2.2%
at the maximum, indicating that there was almost no decrease. In addition,
depending on the toxicity rate, the percentage of correct MTD selection
improved compared to the non-early completion version. The early completion
performed from 18.1% to 90.8%. Conclusion: We propose the early completion
method with not only little reduction in accuracy but also improving the
percentage of correct MTD selection. We conclude the early completion can
perform unproblematically for model-assisted design.

of describing the behavior of certain kinds of random dynamical systems that

inference combines Bayesian decision theory and optimal Bayesian design
principles under a single imperative to minimize expected free energy. It is
this aspect of active inference that allows for the natural emergence of
information-seeking behavior. When removing prior outcomes preferences from
expected free energy, active inference reduces to optimal Bayesian design,
i.e., information gain maximization. Conversely, active inference reduces to
Bayesian decision theory in the absence of ambiguity and relative risk, i.e.,
expected utility maximization. Using these limiting cases, we illustrate how
behaviors differ when agents select actions that optimize expected utility,
expected information gain, and expected free energy. Our T-maze simulations
show optimizing expected free energy produces goal-directed information-seeking
behavior while optimizing expected utility induces purely exploitive behavior
and maximizing information gain engenders intrinsically motivated behavior.

station near each user. For a continental or global scale implementation, this
information dissemination approach would require a dense network of reference
stations whose construction and maintenance would be prohibitively expensive.
Precise Point Positioning affords more flexibility as a public service for GNSS
receivers, but its State Space Representation format is not supported by most
receivers in the field or on the market. This article proposes a novel Virtual
Network DGNSS (VN-DGNSS) approach and an optimization algorithm that is key to
its implementation. The approach capitalizes on the existing PPP infrastructure
without the need for new physical reference stations. By connecting to public
GNSS SSR data services, a VN-DGNSS server maintains current information about
common-mode errors. Construction of the RTCM Observation Space Representation

consistent with the time-of-reception for each client. This article presents an

better horizontal performance than the ZED-F9P receiver with SBAS enabled and
